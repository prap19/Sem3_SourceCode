the great dividing line in the american economy is whether one has 2 years of college or not . 
our goal should be opportunity and prosperity in the long run . 
with respect to the constitutional misinterpretation , the gentleman from virginia ( mr. scott ) xz4003632 will offer an amendment later in this debate that needs to be adopted . 
we are not opposed to faith-based organizations continuing the work they are presently doing in job training . 
it is an abrogation of our constitutional traditions to enshrine that in the law , and that is what this bill does . 
i do not think we should ever have a situation in this country where an organization takes taxpayers ' money collected from everyone and then says if they want to be a job counselor in our agency , they can not be a catholic , they can not be jewish , they can not be muslim , they can not be an evangelical christian . 
mr. chairman , i rise in opposition to h.r. 27 , the job training improvement act . 
since 1982 , these provisions have been included in the bill and received bipartisan support . 
this is why i strongly support congressman scott 's amendment that will restore these basic civil rights and my faith in our legislative process . 
i urge my colleagues to join me in voting no on final passage . 
mr. chairman , i rise today in support of h.r. 27 , the job training improvement act . 
in the span of just two decades , information technology has become a commonplace part of our lives and has also created nearly 10 million jobs in the united states . 
information technology is a factor in the productivity and success of many different sectors of our economy . 
this is important , in as much as it recognizes that the industries themselves are the most qualified to determine what skills their workforce will need to succeed and excel . 
this , in turn , can increase an individual 's ability to find and retain a good job that utilizes that training . 
the success of wia in expanding the computer skills of americans -- through training and certification -- will improve the productivity of every sector of our economy . 
this in turn will make america more competitive globally and is an effective step toward creating good jobs right here in the united states . 
the rule makes in order only those amendments printed in the committee on rules report , and for the time specified in the report . 
mr. speaker , i am pleased to stand before the house today in strong support of this rule and support of the underlying resolution legislation , h.r. 27 , the job training improvement act of 2005 . 
the gentleman from ohio ( chairman boehner ) and the gentleman from california ( subcommittee chairman mckeon ) and the committee members from both sides of the aisle are to be commended for their diligence and hard work in putting together a comprehensive measure reauthorizing vital job training programs while , at the same time , providing for improvements of those programs aimed at providing greater flexibility , accountability , targeting federal dollars where they will be most effective and where there is the highest demonstrated need . 
but in that he , playing the character of henry drummond , talks about the other main character , matthew harrison brady , who was a well intentioned , yet flawed , character . 
and in talking about his death , drummond says of brady , a giant once lived in that body . 
last wednesday in my district at a town meeting , i met a young lady by the name of micaela , who offered me also this five-page letter of her efforts and her concerns . 
she is in need of vocational rehabilitation services , but does not quite fit our standards we have designed . 
in her letter she said in her years of trying to receive services that she was told she had too many disabilities , too few disabilities . 
oftentimes the federal government , in fact , not oftentimes . 
what we need is creativity , efficiency , and caring ; and that can only be done effectively on the state levels , which is why this particular bill has gone from several years ago , 63 programs , has now taken three funding streams and tried to bring it into one so they could help individual people by trying to apply 70 percent of the funding that has been given to students to those who have been unserved and out of school , to create a demonstration project for personal reemployment accounts to meet individual needs prior to coming to congress , i had the opportunity , like many of you , of serving in the state legislature , and i was a teacher for a long time . 
in that position , or those positions , i witnessed firsthand the years of oftentimes federal programs and mandates shoved on states , on local school districts , on local units of governments with this one-size-fits-all uniform approach . 
recently , i attended a community college , a community technical college in my district . 
in their diesel program , to find the kinds of materials that were provided by the industry , they have to get hands-on experience for first-rate technicians . 
and in program after program in that particular college , i saw , through innovation and hard work , the community college has been able to leverage the state and federal dollars and to attract private contributions for equipment and training that met the need of training qualified workers in the high-tech future . 
vocational rehabilitation services in state after state does the same thing . 
but these type partnerships are not just allowed in this bill . 
they are encouraged under this legislation , which is vital in helping provide workers for the competition of the 21st century . 
we face a 21st-century challenge in an ever-changing technology and the aging american workforce . 
and they vary in need from state to state . 
i would like to point out also that h.r. 27 builds upon legislation passed in the 108th congress , namely h.r. 1261 , the workforce reinvestment and adult education act of 2003 , which was passed by this house . 
let us not , in the debate over the rule or the bill , lose focus and lose sight of our goal , which is to help the micaelas of this nation who need services , which are and will continue to be distributed fairly without precondition . 
it is significant that we not confuse services rendered with the desire of some to sanitize and regulate legally diverse practices , reaffirmed in a rare moment of sanity by the courts , which do not impact the rendering of those employment services . 
mr. speaker , this is a good rule , supporting a bill that has been discussed and amended in committee through regular order . 
the programs that we already have in place , specifically the disabled veterans ' outreach program , the local veterans employment representative program , the vocational rehabilitation program , already are required to contribute to the infrastructure of these one-stop career center programs . 
that is an area that was specifically covered in this bill . 
in closing , my friends on the other side have had numerous objections to provisions in h.r. 27 . 
they have a right to do so and i expect it will be warmly discussed in the ensuing discussion of the bill itself . 
i believe strongly in the ability of our states , governors , local boards , workforce boards , to be creative and innovative . 
people can think for themselves in other parts of this country . 
i believe , and i have confidence in the ability of local governments to be creative and effective , and i think so does h.r. 27 . 
many amendments that we will be discussing on the floor have also been discussed in committee . 
a lot of other amendments were heard in the committee . 
this was fully discussed in committee and voted upon . 
may i just , in closing , ask us not to lose sight that the goal is service and how to provide training for people which is given without any precondition . 
this is not the venue in this particular bill . 
our goal should be to try to join hands to help all the micaelas in the world solve the problem of employment , retraining , and servicing , not to try to change our friends in other particular ways but to join together on a common front , in a common effort , to help people , not to harm people . 
mr. speaker , in closing , i urge adoption of the rule and the underlying legislation . 
mr. speaker , we are going to talk about economic competitiveness in the economy tonight , but before we start on that topic , i just want to draw attention to a couple of things that have appeared in the newspaper and talk about iraq and the middle east . 
mr. speaker , our hearts go out to those individuals and their families , those that have lost their lives , and certainly our hearts continue to go out to the families of each and every man and woman in our military service . 
i think we join with every one of them , all of our military families and with all of these iraqis who love freedom and are loving having the opportunity to grasp on to freedom , and we join them in saying no to terrorism and standing strong for freedom . 
what happened in lebanon this week , analysts say , is the beginning of a new era in the middle east , one in which popular demand pushes the momentum for democracy and people 's will can no longer be disregarded . 
repeatedly , he talks about how in the heart of every man and woman is the desire to be free and to seek that freedom and to have hope and to have opportunity . 
one of those is the opportunity to dream big dreams and have great adventure , have great successes and to see that lived out in our lives . 
and tonight we are going to spend an hour discussing the republican policies about encouraging entrepreneurship and economic growth in this great nation . 
we are going to highlight the republican agenda for creating jobs in america . 
after fighting an expensive global war on terrorism , being in the middle of that fight , we have faced significant challenges and we have made some very wise decisions . 
mr. speaker , it is certainly something that i know , as millions of americans tonight are sitting down at their kitchen tables with pencil and paper and beginning to look at those forms , filling out their federal income tax filings , that they are noticing the difference that the tax cuts we have passed are making in their lives . 
certainly in tennessee , i know there are tennesseeans noticing for the first time in 20 years that they have the opportunity to deduct the sales tax they are paying from their federal income tax filing . 
we are trying to be certain that the american public has more money in their pocketbook ; that they have the opportunity to decide how to spend that money ; and that they have the opportunity to grow those businesses . 
we have known that small businesses and working families need tax relief , and we have fought hard to make that happen so that we see the opportunity right there for our economy , for the growth in our economy , for the opportunity for competitiveness not on just a local scale , not just on a local scale , but on a global scale . 
mr. speaker , our support for tax relief has been vindicated , and we see that in the economic figures that are out there . 
this past week we found the economy grew faster than expected in the last few months of 2004 . 
in february , we had the twenty-first consecutive month , that is twenty-first consecutive months , of increased economic activity in the manufacturing sector . 
i want to be certain everybody hears and understands that : twenty-first months of consecutive increases in economic activity in the manufacturing sector . 
for some of the tool and die manufacturers that are in my district , from some of the manufacturers that we see of various component parts , of items that are being created , how exciting that they are seeing growth ; that they are seeing growth in their jobs that they have right there in these local communities . 
the overall economy grew for the fortieth , that is 4-0 , the fortieth consecutive month in february . 
we have had twenty-first consecutive months of increases in productivity in the manufacturing sector . 
look at this headline : `` u.s. chiefs ' confidence highest in 3 years. '' well , that is a pretty good thing . 
it says here : `` confidence in the economy at the u.s. biggest companies has soared to the highest level in 3 years as increasing numbers plan to spend more on capital investment. '' well , who would have thunk ? 
mr. speaker , i am joined here on the floor tonight by one of my colleagues , a gentleman from the freshman class i served in in the 108th congress , the gentleman from iowa ( mr. king ) xz4002201 . 
the gentleman from iowa ( mr. king ) mentioned tax reform and the cost of 22 cents of every dollar of manufactured good in this nation being eaten up by compliance , and the importance of us having a wonderful debate about how we lower that cost so that every sector of our economy is going to see greater productivity and is going to see growth . 
we know that working on our tax reform issues , working on tort reform issues to eliminate frivolous lawsuits , are going to be a way that we can begin to benefit , that we can see the products that are manufactured here be more competitive in a global marketplace . 
as we look at the opportunities for trade in tennessee , for example , where our exports have increased every year for the past 5 years , and we know that does equal jobs . 
over the past 2 years , as the gentleman from iowa ( mr. king ) said , we created about 2.7 million new jobs , and that will soon in a couple of months be 1.5 million new jobs per year . 
there are a couple of industries that have seen good growth in the past couple of months : apparel , textiles , transportation and equipment , electronic components and equipment , chemicals , industrial and commercial equipment and computers , instruments , photographic equipment , metals , food , wood and wood products . 
virtually every state in the union can claim at least one of these industrial sectors . 
in fact , one of the things that we have seen about job creation is that in 48 of our 50 states we have seen jobs growth . 
that is why we are beginning to see this 40 months of overall economic growth , 21 straight months where we are seeing increases in the manufacturing sector , and we know all of this means jobs . 
we will continue to see growth in those sectors . 
is in education , she understands the importance of an educated workforce and lifelong learning and developing the skills that are so necessary to be productive in your job , to be satisfied in your job . 
how exciting that is , and how exciting for us that we have a program like the workforce development programs that are very successful , that assist in retraining folks . 
i know in my 7th congressional district in tennessee , we have seen tremendous success with the workforce development program . 
as a matter of fact , we have a program in montgomery county , tennessee , that is really attuned to the needs of our veterans and to our military spouses and our military retirees . 
jobs and education , they go hand in hand . 
mr. speaker , at this time i would like to recognize a member of the freshman class , new to us , but with a tremendous amount of experience in his home state of texas where he has been a part of the business community , has served as a judge , and is a skilled legislator . 
the gentleman from texas ( mr. gohmert ) xz4006510 is going to speak with us for a few moments about some of the things that are happening in texas as in the process with our economic competitiveness issues . 
and i would like to commend him for meeting with the students and working with the students from grace high school in tyler , texas , and for their study , their caring about the free enterprise system and seeking greater information on that . 
i want to see if i can grab on to that american dream of owning my own company , starting a company , having an idea , watching that idea come to fruition in the form of a company that creates jobs . 
and it is so encouraging to me that the republican leadership and our majority in this house is committed to doing the things that are going to be necessary to continue economic growth , long-term sustained economic growth like we have seen over the past 40 months . 
construction spending rose a strong seven-tenths of a percent in january , a month when generally they are not going to see that kind of increase . 
this pushed total construction activity to a record high of just over $ 1 trillion at a seasonally adjusted annual rate and followed an even larger 1.2 percent rise in december . 
what we are seeing is confidence and belief and the fact that people believe in the strength of this economy . 
he is with us for just a few moments to talk about some of the good things that are happening in his state . 
i thank the gentleman from kentucky for talking with us a few moments about what he is seeing happening and his desire to see some changes take place here in the policies that we will make , the things that we will implement in this congress , in the 109th congress . 
i think it is important to note , small businesses in america represent over 90 percent of all employers and employ half of all private sector employees . 
that is why it is so important that we carry forth on this commitment to be certain that we have the right environment for an economic renaissance in this country . 
we are planning and continue to work daily on trade and opening foreign markets for american-made goods so that our employers in our local communities have access to markets around the globe , ways that they can place their products before a world that is ready to buy them . 
and we are trying to make certain that manufacturers are not being treated unfairly and that they have the opportunity to be competitive in a global marketplace . 
we believe excessive government growth in spending crowds businesses out of the marketplace . 
we know that when there is a need , if government fills that need , then the private or not-for-profit sector does not move in and fill that need . 
we know that the growth of government needs to be curtailed so that less of the taxpayers ' money is being required to pay for the government , so that taxpayers keep that money in their pocket . 
we have had 2.7 million jobs created in just under the past couple of years . 
twenty-two cents of every single dollar of manufactured goods in this nation is spent in compliance . 
we know this tax code is overly complicated , it is time-consuming , and it is incredibly frustrating for millions of small business owners in this nation . 
and , mr. speaker , one thing that we know for sure in this 109th congress , we are committed to moving forward on commonsense reforms that will continue to work toward greater effectiveness and greater competitiveness for our nation 's economy . 
the workforce investment act , enacted in 1998 , brought together some 60 federal job-training and retraining programs , and put them together and we created these one-stop shops all across america . 
we want to ensure that more of the funding that is available for this act goes down to the local county boards , or , in some cases , multiple county jurisdictions . 
in this bill , we also renew the vocational programs for those who have disabilities , an important part of our workforce . 
i think all of us know if we are going to be successful in the 21st century , that america has to do a better job of training and retraining our workforce . 
there is one amendment that we will debate that we have had considerable debate on over the last several years in this congress and considered in the committee twice during the markup of this bill . 
the 1964 civil rights act , the landmark legislation which prevented discrimination in america , allowed for one exception in hiring and that exception was granted to religious organizations where we grant them an exemption if they wished to only hire people of their own faith . 
we allow faith-based providers in this bill to provide services without giving up their protections in the 1964 civil rights act . 
some believe , and it is certainly their right to have a different opinion , believe that faith-based organizations , even though they have this right , ought to be forced to give it up in order to take federal funds to help the poorest of the poor . 
now i would argue those who really do believe that is the case ought to go back and amend the 1964 civil rights act , title 7 , and not try to do it in this bill . 
but this provision , and again , we will have ample time to debate it later , i think this provision helps organizations who want to go out and help the needy in their community . 
one critical element in creating that opportunity is the provision of rigorous education and ongoing training to all members of our society. '' chairman greenspan this morning testified before congress and talked about the need to do a better job with our education system and better training and retraining of american workers . 
in 1998 , congress established a system of one-stop career centers aimed at providing one convenient central location to offer job training and related employment services . 
first , requiring state and local workforce investment boards to ensure the job training programs reflect the employment needs in local areas . 
first , it consolidates the three adult wia training programs , giving states and local communities greater flexibility and enabling more job seekers to be served with no reduction in services . 
in addition , it targets 70 percent of the youth grant funds to out-of-school youth , an underserved population that faces significant challenges in finding meaningful employment . 
the bill includes a proposal passed by the house last year introduced by the gentleman from nevada ( mr. porter ) xz4003240 to create personal reemployment accounts of up to $ 3 , 000 to help unemployed americans purchase job training and other employment-related services , such as child care , transportation services and housing assistance , giving them the flexibility they need in order to gain meaningful employment . 
in addition , it includes the president 's community college proposal to strengthen the partnership between local businesses , community colleges , and the local one-stop delivery system . 
when we considered this bill in committee , we twice rejected it on a bipartisan basis , and i urge all members to vote against it today . 
in 1987 , the supreme court unanimously upheld this right . 
our nation 's faith-based institutions have a proven track record in meeting the training and counseling needs of our citizens . 
why would we want to deny them the opportunity to help in federal job training efforts ? 
i can think of no better place to start than to protect the rights of faith-based groups who are willing to lend a helping hand in providing job training and other critical social services to the most needy of our citizens . 
i want to thank the gentleman from california ( mr. mckeon ) xz4002670 for his work in putting this bill together , a bill that is supported by a broad and diverse coalition of groups , including the u.s. chamber of commerce , the national association of counties , the national association of workforce boards , the national workforce association , the coalition to preserve religious freedom and the salvation army , amongst others . 
we are part of a dynamic economy that is constantly creating new and different types of jobs , so the knowledge and skills of each job seeker is absolutely critical in determining their success or failure . 
their plan fails to reduce duplication and inefficiency , it fails to give states and local communities more flexibility , and it fails to take advantage of the positive role that faith-based institutions play in our communities and the success they have in providing critical social services to those most in need . 
data on young adults participating in adult education programs is important information for our committee as well as for the adult education programs and for school districts to keep in mind as we work to raise our high school completion rates . 
and it is my understanding that this is information that the department already collects but has not been a focus in program reporting . 
i will continue to work with him and the department to ensure that we have the necessary information to carefully monitor the participation of high school-aged students in adult education programs . 
mr. chairman , back in 1998 , congress enacted the workforce investment act , which established a system for a one-stop career centers aimed at providing one convenient central location to offer job training and other employment-related services . 
the bill that we are approving today aims to strengthen training services for job seekers accomplishes these goals in several ways : particularly by streamlining bureaucracy and eliminating duplication ; consolidating the three adult wia training programs , giving states and local communities greater flexibility , and enabling more job seekers to be served with no reduction in services ; removing arbitrary barriers that prevent individuals from accessing job training services immediately ; strengthening partnerships between local businesses , communities colleges and the local one-stop delivery system ; enhancing vocational rehabilitation to help individuals with disabilities ; and improving allocation and literacy for adults to ensure they gain the knowledge and skills necessary to find employment , including language proficiency . 
it accomplishes this by requiring state and local workforce investment boards to ensure the job training programs reflect the employment needs in local areas ; also allowing training for currently employed workers so employers can upgrade workers ' skills and avoid layoffs ; encouraging the highest caliber providers , including community colleges , to offer training through the one-stop system ; leveraging other public and private resources to increase training opportunities ; and increasing connections to economic development programs . 
the bill reauthorizes the rehabilitation act of 1993 , the primary federal program designed to assist individuals with disabilities to prepare for , obtain and retain employment to live independently ; and furthermore , it includes transition services for students with disabilities moving from secondary education into post-secondary activities that can only be determined as a possible alternative to address the needs of those in special needs . 
and that is none other than creating a better and strong economy and society that will be prepared to compete in a changing and demanding new world that rises as we speak . 
however , it is not clear that the language that the gentlewoman offered in committee that is included in s. 9 fixes the problem in new york and could have other unintended consequences in new york and other states . 
it was first passed in 1998 . 
what we have done in this reauthorization is tried to make these one-stop centers work even better . 
we believe strongly that the youth services money here ought to be directed for the most part to out of school youth , a population that is vastly underserved and we do that in this bill . 
we also believe that faith-based providers , especially in large urban centers , can provide a very necessary outreach to help those who are really needy have an opportunity to get the kind of training and retraining they need to become productive members of our society . 
mr. chairman , i rise in opposition to the gentleman 's amendment and yield myself such time as i may consume . 
mr. chairman , the amendment that is being offered by my friend , the gentleman from michigan ( mr. kildee ) xz4002160 , would strike all of the positive reforms for youth that are included in h.r. 27 . 
in the white house , the disadvantaged youth task force has proposed targeted federal youth training funds to serve the most in need and to reduce the duplication of services amongst federal programs . 
there are a large number of programs today designed to deal with in-school , at-risk children , and there is really only one program in wia that is targeted at out-of-school youth . 
what we tried to do in this bill was to strike a balance by requiring that 70 percent of the youth program funds go to out-of-school youth , a population that is by and large ignored and that i think these funds ought to be targeted to . 
we do allow the local workforce boards to use up to 30 percent of their programs for in-school youth ; but there are other programs , a half a dozen other programs , targeted at these at-risk children who are in school . 
so as a way of trying to bring more synergy to an effort to help out-of-school youth , i think the language we have in the bill strikes the right balance . 
the gentlewoman who just spoke says that we eliminated a preference for veterans in this bill . 
secondly , the gentlewoman said there are block grants in the underlying bill . 
as a matter of fact , the targeting of funds to the local workforce boards in this bill is more structured than it is today under current law , so that at least 75 percent of the funds available back to the states must go to the local workforce investment boards . 
lastly , the gentlewoman said that we have discrimination in this bill . 
i would just remind the gentlewoman that when our predecessors wrote the 1964 civil rights act , they recognized in title vii that religious organizations ought to be protected in their hiring so that they would not be required to hire anybody that shows up , but could , if they wanted to , only hire those people within their faith . 
they may go to the committee on the judiciary and change that law , but let us not try to do it in this bill . 
mr. chairman , i rise in opposition to the amendment offered by the gentleman from virginia . 
title vii of the 1964 civil rights act explicitly says that religious organizations in their hiring can hire people of their own faith . 
it says that a religious organization can take religion into account in terms of their hiring . 
mr. chairman , so the debate here boils down to one of two issues , you believe that if these faith-based organizations want to participate in these programs that they have to give up their rights under the 1964 civil rights act . 
we believe and the majority of this house has believed on a number of occasions as we have had this vote , that faith-based organizations who want to help the neediest of the needy should in fact be able to have their rights under the 1964 civil rights act . 
there is no reason why that they can not partner with the federal government to help us in our effort to help the neediest of the needy , and to help improve the prospects for job training and retraining to help all americans participate in the 21st century economy and give them a chance to succeed at the american dream . 
mr. speaker , i rise in opposition to the motion to recommit . 
mr. speaker , let us tell the truth about what has happened in job creation in america . 
over the last 17 months , 2.7 million new jobs have been created in america . 
but the fact is that unemployed workers have access today , people coming back from iraq who are unemployed have access to services , and those who may have their jobs lost through outsourcing have , in fact , access to services . 
but what also happens under the gentleman 's amendment is that they get a preference in this bill . 
the underlying bill , in fact , will provide more services to more unemployed workers and workers who want to increase their skills who may not be unemployed . 
the fact is i think it is a cruel hoax on those who may be unemployed , who may fall into one of these categories to think that they are going to be eligible for unemployment-type assistance or be eligible for unlimited training when , in fact , there is no appropriation and the fact is the program will take years to implement . 
mr. chairman , i rise in support of h.r. 27 , the job training improvement act , which will reauthorize the workforce investment act ( wia ) -- programs which provide job training for youths , veterans , and seasonal and migrant workers . 
in addition , they have access to numerous other federal programs that provide services for job seekers . 
with facilities in wilmington , newark , dover and georgetown , the `` one-stop delivery system '' in delaware has proved to be an efficient tool in training individuals for the workforce . 
for example , in delaware all of our centers are fully equipped with : internet ready computers , interactive cd-rom tutorials , fax machine to send resume and cover letters to perspective employers , copy machine , telephone resource center with career manuals including reference books . 
the purpose of highlighting the program in delaware is to provide a real life example of useful it is to have services in one central place . 
mr. speaker , the outsourcing of good-paying american jobs to other countries is a crisis that touches every community in the united states . 
not only have 2.7 million jobs been lost in our once-vibrant manufacturing sector since the beginning of this administration but white collar jobs are being offshored as well . 
should the gentleman from ohio ( mr. boehner ) xz4000360 have to say whether or not he believes in jesus christ , whether or not he believes in evolution , whether or not he believes in the literal interpretation of the new testament ? 
what this bill would say , without the scott amendment , is that someone could say to a single mom trying to find a job in our religious faith , we do not believe single mothers should work , so we are not going to hire you , even though you are fully qualified for this job . 
to subsidize it in the year 2005 i find unbelievable . 
it is unbelievable that on the very day american soldiers are risking their lives in iraq , and perhaps some have given their lives today in iraq to give the iraqis religious freedom , we are debating a bill on the floor of this house that would say an american citizen can be denied a federally funded , tax-funded job for simply one reason , the exercise of your religious faith . 
it is the first freedom enunciated in the bill of rights . 
it is the freedom upon which all other freedoms we cherish in this country are built . 
the founding fathers thought so much about that freedom , about religious freedom , they put in the first 16 words of the first amendment these words : `` congress shall pass no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof. '' if saying that someone has to lose a job to support his or her family because they are exercising their own deeply-felt religious faith , if that is not prohibiting the free exercise of religion , what is ? 
yet repeatedly i have heard on this floor those say on this side of the floor that supporters of the scott amendment are opposed to faith-based groups being involved in providing social services . 
i would suggest perhaps they should not only preach the ten commandments ; perhaps they should exercise and practice the ninth commandment , because to make that argument is to suggest that the baptist joint committee , the american jewish committee , and numerous other religious groups are somehow opposing faith-based groups ' involvement in federal social service programs . 
i will be addressing just one particular topic which has been controversial in committee discussions and will be the subject of an amendment later on , and that is turning the clock back on the civil rights act of 1964 and changing what it says . 
i have listened carefully to the debate in the committee . 
we have had this same debate several times in committee . 
i have yet to understand precisely what the objections are , but it seems that opponents are afraid of two things : one , that this provision in the bill somehow will allow these organizations to discriminate on other grounds in their hiring , which is , first , contrary to the civil rights act , and second , i would say religious organizations are the least likely to discriminate on the basis of race or any of the other forbidden categories . 
the other objection appears to be that somehow these churches are going to use this federal money to try to proselytize , to get people in these programs and then they will say , okay , now is n't this wonderful , you should join this church . 
when my wife and i moved to grand rapids , michigan , in 1966 to take on a new position , we looked for a church . 
in fact , we spent 3 months trying out different churches , looking , trying to find a certain something : we wanted a church in the inner city because we wanted to be able to contribute to solving the problems of the city of grand rapids , particularly in the inner city . 
they worked very hard in the community . 
the church stepped in and started it . 
it was on the top story of a ramshackle building which housed a small convenience store in the lower floor . 
today it is a large community center , one of the best , if not the best , in the city . 
we did have and still largely do have religious restrictions on the hiring of individuals , but the facility serves all people in that community . 
it has brought in medical care workers of all faiths to work and provide medical care and dental care for the recipients in that community . 
iccf , the inner city christian federation , developed housing programs , and they had built many houses before habitat for humanity started in our community ; but iccf has built and remodeled more houses than almost any organization within the city that i am aware of . 
the employees are hired partially on the basis of their faith and their commitment to serving in the inner city and often work for less pay than they could get elsewhere . 
today it is one of the largest mental health hospitals in our nation . 
then , finally , something we have ongoing in our church right now . 
every saturday , i wish you could visit our church ; you would see people of all races , all colors , all faiths walking in the church basement which we have stocked with food that we have collected from different stores , warehouses and so forth : produce , baked goods , and many different types of perishable food . 
and saturday morning anyone from that city can walk in with no test of their faith , no means test , they can just walk in and say , i need some groceries , and they go through the line . 
that is true in our church as well . 
we have hired individuals who work in the church . 
you have to be multifaceted to be on the staff of a church , and that is precisely what we have in our church . 
the liberty that is being asked , frankly i am disappointed to hear this asserted , and i think the greatest denigration of religious organizations coming forward here are those who are saying this : there are religious groups in this country who are eager to help people in need , but if they get federal tax dollars to help people in need and they are forced to associate with heathens and unbelievers and infidels , then they will be driven away . 
what is so terrible about saying to the orthodox jews in brooklyn who were cited , you want to help the people in brooklyn , the people you want to help will be black and hispanic , they will be white and poor and jewish and christian , if you really want to help them , on your own , whatever you want to do , you can do . 
but if you want all of those people in brooklyn who paid federal taxes , if you want a share of their federal taxes to run a program to help them , god forbid , i guess you mean this literally , god forbid you should have to hire one of them . 
martin luther king said , and it is sadly still true , that one of the most segregated times in america is the hour of worship . 
those orthodox jewish groups in brooklyn will hire very few black people in brooklyn . 
and if in fact you have a policy that says all the money is going to go in these areas to the religious groups , then what about people who are not religious ? 
what we are going to be saying if you win here in the house of representatives is , attention all shiites , do not hire sunnis . 
apparently , we are going to be encouraging the people in iraq with iraqi government money or american government money , a lot of it is going to iraq , do you really think you want to send that message to the shiites that when they try to rebuild their country they should not hire sunnis ? 
but here is the point : we are being asked to say to americans , yes , you will pay taxes for this ; but the taxes you pay , you are not eligible for a job because you believe in the wrong god . 
or you believe in god in the wrong way . 
you believe in the wrong denomination . 
is it really the case that religious organizations , that they are somehow so angry towards outsiders , that they feel so unclean that they can not help people in need if they have to associate with people who are otherwise perfectly qualified , who believe in the mission of this entity , but they do not share the same religion ? 
i hope we will not so characterize religious people as being so narrow and so biased towards people not of their own religion that they can not even work with them in this common cause to which you say they are committed . 
fortunately , there are many organizations in those communities that want to help , and they offer unique and innovative solutions to some of our most challenging needs . 
that begins by removing the barriers that unnecessarily stand in their way . 
these organizations are a central part of the fabric of communities across america and we need to ensure that we are removing any obstacles that stand in the way of their ability to help . 
organizations willing to serve their communities by participating in federal programs should not be forced to give up that right . 
we must pass this legislation with a clear message from congress to our faith-based leaders : we need your service and we want to assist you in delivering for us and for the most vulnerable in our society . 
mr. chairman , i rise today to voice my opposition to this job training improvement act because it does nothing to improve job training in our country . 
wager peyser established the federal performance and accountability standards that ensure our job training programs are quality programs that place able workers in appropriate positions in the workforce . 
mr. chairman , i rise today in support of the gentleman from virginia 's ( mr. scott ) xz4003641 amendment to h.r. 27 . 
clearly , it did not intend to permit government-funded job training programs to engage in religious discrimination when making an employment decision , which is exactly what this bill purports to do . 
under this bill , if a woman providing workforce rehabilitation services in a faith-based organization was found to be using birth control , she could be fired , demoted , or not promoted . 
mr. chairman , i urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the scott amendment and voting `` no '' on the final passage of this bill that endorses a federal rollback of decades-old civil rights and privacy protections . 
mr. speaker , in the 107th congress , we passed in a bipartisan manner the jobs for veterans act , legislation to reorganize , update , and improve these very same veterans ' employment and training programs . 
while our troops are actively engaged in iraq and afghanistan and many others suffering from severe injuries and permanent disabilities , now is not the time to reduce the resources for these critical job training programs . 
as a continuation of those efforts , we must not let these people fall through the cracks that we have in our employment laws . 
mr. chairman , i rise to engage the gentleman from ohio ( chairman boehner ) of the committee on education and the workforce in a colloquy . 
during our full committee consideration of h.r. 27 , i offered and withdrew an amendment to ensure that data on high school-aged students participating in adult education programs is publicly available and reported to our committee . 
in the hispanic community , that figure is nearly 50 percent . 
our first step in shining the light on this issue is to make sure that we have accurate and regularly reported data . 
at full committee , the gentleman offered to work with me to ensure that these concerns are addressed in the reports that our committee received from the department of education . 
the department already collects this data and would be able to highlight this information in its annual report to congress with very little additional work . 
it is simply a matter of clearly communicating to the department that we would like to see focused information on high school-aged students in adult education reported by race , ethnicity , language proficiency , and program enrollment . 
there were amendments that were proposed that have not been made in order . 
back in 1998 when this bill , this program , was first passed , david broder wrote an article . 
he said : when senator paul wellstone walked off the floor arm in arm with senator mike dewine of ohio , bipartisan i should point out , paul wellstone said , `` mike , this may not be the lead story on the network news , but it 's a good piece of work. '' well , indeed it was not the lead story on the network news . 
but as says broder , in communities less consumed by scandal than washington , the impact of the measure that dewine and wellstone and others had fashioned may be felt in real lives long after the memories of the scandals have faded . 
in a dynamic economy where technological changes and market shifts are forcing layoffs of some people even as other jobs are being created , the key is to equip workers with needed skills and then link them efficiently to the vacancies . 
said broder back then , the workers will never know the names of the legislators , but they are in their debt . 
mr. chairman , i rise in opposition to h.r. 27 , the reauthorization of the workforce investment act . 
it was passed back in 1998 . 
and as we know , funding through nearly every past block grant program has led to decreases in funding in just about every education or labor program that was block granted . 
in addition , the proposal here would reduce and restrict services for in-school youths . 
it would fund one-stop infrastructure by siphoning off funds used to serve veterans and individuals with disabilities ; and importantly , the legislation before us here would allow discrimination in hiring based on individuals 's religious beliefs . 
it is a step backward from the legislation that was passed in 1998 . 
mr. speaker , i rise in opposition to the structured rule that has been reported out of the committee on rules for this debate . 
the party-line vote of 220-204 that we saw in the 108th congress on the debate of the then h.r. 1261 should evidence the need for the most open debate over the issues . 
nevertheless , i am pleased that the amendments of my colleagues from massachusetts , new york , and virginia respectively have been ruled in order . 
in the short term , extending unemployment benefits , coupled with the assistance that unemployed workers can receive through one-stop service centers , will provide workers with the means to achieve high paying jobs . 
we must address the needs of our unemployed now and in a manner that respects the rights of individuals regardless of their faith , while they are struggling to pay their mortgages and to put food on the table for their families . 
mr. chairman , i rise in support of the amendment offered by my colleague the ranking member of the judiciary subcommittee on crime , mr. scott xz4003641 along with ms. woolsey , mr. van hollen , mr. frank , mr. edwards , and mr. nadler , to the base bill , h.r. 27 . 
as i stated with respect to the rule , h. res. 126 , the party-line vote of 220-204 that we saw in the 108th congress on the debate of the then h.r. 1261 should evidence the need for the most open debate over the deficiencies that lie within the provisions on the floor . 
i support the scott-woolsey-vanhollen-frank-edwards-nadler amendment to h.r. 27 to remove the provision allowing religious discrimination in employment from the underlying bill . 
in fact , there is no place for religious discrimination in american law just as there should be no place in america for that kind of backwards thinking . 
h.r. 27 , in its current state , erodes fundamental civil rights protections for the unemployed and the underemployed by exempting faith-based organizations from compliance with the current non-discrimination law . 
presently , under our country 's existing laws , in title vii of the civil rights act , employing institutions using private funds were exempt from employment discrimination protections . 
simply put : public funds are not allowed to be used to encourage religious discrimination in employment and that should not change . 
each of my colleagues should understand that without this important amendment , we are advocating the notion that one 's ability to provide employment to those who are in need is contingent on the religious institution to which the individual belongs . 
what if anything is accomplished by attempting to create religious hierarchies in the workplace ? 
despite the rhetoric on the other side of the aisle , h.r. 27 as it currently reads will not only result in the loss of jobs for applicants who do not identify with their prospective employer 's religious beliefs but more importantly it will cause the loss of quality workers . 
therefore , i stand in full support of this amendment and i urge my colleagues to do the same . 
i know he was very thoughtful in this amendment . 
particularly when we talk about these programs , what comes to mind , and i heard the gentleman from michigan ( mr. kildee ) xz4002160 be so eloquent in the committee on rules about the effectiveness and the importance of a training program , number one , for the new jobs of the 21st century . 
i am reminded of the fact that i spent a good part of my time as a locally elected official on the houston city council promoting the job training programs of our community that came down through the workforce board commissions in texas . 
i am very disappointed , in addition , to the cut in youth programs , and the fact that we are now getting rid of the veterans ' preference for job training , actually cutting funds . 
with a million people having served in afghanistan and iraq ; with the devastation of the impact of those returning veterans , with their emotional problems and injuries , and now we are suggesting to them that they are not worthy of a job preference . 
that is what this program does ; and in particular , it sends away this opportunity . 
there is discrimination in this bill . 
and , frankly , i think we should follow the kildee model , who said that he knew a priest in detroit who had a job training program who made sure that there was no discrimination , whether someone is a muslim , whether they are jewish or catholic or protestant . 
a program that is based upon religion and allows someone to deny you the opportunity for a job or a training position under the auspices of being a particular faith and being in charge of that particular program is discrimination under title vii in the 1964 civil rights bill or under any discrimination law that has been passed in america and that exists today . 
frankly , i believe this bill , even in its presence on the floor of the house , should go no further than this house ; and i ask my colleagues to support the tierney amendment , but to oppose the underlying bill . 
mr. chairman , i rise in strong opposition to this bill . 
just a few weeks ago , president bush spoke to individuals in omaha , nebraska . 
there he met a woman in her late 50s who is a mother of three children . 
it will go down in history with marie antoinette 's famous quote : `` let them eat cake. '' mr. chairman , this bill is not going to help this mother of three or the millions of americans seeking job training . 
wagner-peyser was first enacted in june of 1933 in the first term of president franklin delano roosevelt . 
in my hometown of flint , michigan , we had two parts of the unemployment office , one where you applied for the unemployment benefits and the other where you went in and were seeking a job and they would put the unemployed and an employer together . 
third , the bill allows discrimination in hiring based on religion with wia funds . 
the bill turns back the clock on decades of civil rights protections in our job training programs . 
focus hope in detroit , michigan , is one of the best , if not the best , job training program in the state of michigan . 
focus hope was run until his death by father william cunningham , a classmate of mine in the seminary . 
he trained thousands of people in inner-city detroit as a catholic priest assigned by his bishop there , and he did not care whether those who were training people to run a lathe , to do engineering or whatever it was , he did not care whether they were catholic , whether they were protestant , whether they were morman , muslim or had no faith at all . 
i urge members to join me in opposing passage of this legislation . 
in summary , i urge a no vote on this bill . 
in 1998 , the gentleman from california ( mr. mckeon ) xz4002670 who is a very good friend of mine , we will always remain friends , we have great respect for one another , we wrote a very good bill in 1998 , wia , and i hope we would do likewise this time ; but i find myself unable to support this bill . 
the bill , among other things , i do not mean to be harsh , but among other things , encapsulates president bush 's response to the woman in omaha who told him that she was presently working three jobs to ensure that she could provide for her family . 
nothing in the act prevents states from spending all of youth funds on out-of-school youths . 
in fact , as many as 17 states spend more than 30 percent on out-of-school programs . 
eliminating services for in-school youth cuts funding for programs designed to keep youths in school , to develop workforce skills , to prepare for post-secondary education , and provide after school and summer opportunities . 
in many communities , you have that cooperation between the business community and the schools . 
yes , i am , mr. speaker , in its current form . 
an additional 830 , 000 jobs are expected to be outsourced in 2005 and 3.3 million by 2015 . 
up to 6 million jobs may be sent overseas in the next 10 years . 
likewise , many veterans returning from the conflicts in afghanistan and iraq may need skills and training to obtain or retain their jobs . 
mr. chairman , i rise in support of the amendment offered by the gentleman from virginia , mr. scott . 
as written , the underlying bill will make it legal for faith-based organizations that receive federal funds and run job-training programs to discriminate in their hiring practices . 
throughout my life , i have fought against discrimination wherever it is practiced in our social , cultural , political and economic life . 
the language contained in this bill goes against that core principle . 
i support the work of our religious institutions in sponsoring federal programs and delivering vital social and employment programs to our communities . 
but supporters of this bill contend if you do not allow religious organizations to hire members of their own faith , we are denying religious institutions from participating in federal programs that deliver needed services to our local communities . 
in other words , they argue we are practicing religious bigotry . 
in fact , i would suggest that this movement is reminiscent of the days of school desegregation when many parents withdrew their children from public school so they could attend so-called christian academies for the purpose learning . 
mr. speaker , i thank the gentlewoman for yielding to me and leading us in this important subject matter . 
i would like to paint this image in the mind of the people in the country . 
and that is that as we see people demonstrating in the streets of lebanon , when they have made the pledge that they are not leaving the public arena until they are a government governed by themselves and that they are a free people , that magnificent display that is going on in lebanon today , as i watched that , i looked back through my mind 's eye and i asked myself where i have experienced anything like that before ; where i have seen anything like that in history . 
it takes me back to the square in prague , back in the early 1990s , after the berlin wall came down . 
that was about november 9 when the wall came down , and it echoed into about 1990 , right before the czechs went to the square and stood there with their keys and rattled their keys in the air . 
that miracle of freedom that echoed across eastern europe in that time was not something anyone predicted . 
he said in that address : `` if you stand for freedom , we stand with you. '' today , we stand with the lebanese people , we stand with the syrians , we stand with the iranians , and we stand with the saudis . 
another thing that has happened there is that the fear factor has disappeared in lebanon . 
when the fear factor disappeared , the people could freely stand in the streets . 
when that fear factor can disappear in iran , in syria , in saudi arabia , and around the middle east , they can also come to the streets . 
when that day comes , we will no longer see the habitat that breeds terror , and we will be able to actually stand here today and define a victory in the war on terror , and that is the absence of the habitat that breeds terrorists . 
i characterize it a couple of ways and add to the gentlewoman 's discussion , and that is that our jobs growth in this country has been going on at such a torrid pace that we will soon , within the next 3 months , reach the level of over the last 2 years having had job growth of 1.5 million jobs a year . 
that is an amazingly fast growth , 3.8 percent growth as the gentlewoman said , but that in the face of the trial lawyers skimming 3 percent off the top . 
if we want to grow at 3 1/2 percent , just to sustain the growth we need in our infrastructure and to meet the needs of a growing population , then we have to make up for that 3 percent that goes off the top because of the litigation in this country that is rampant . 
we took steps in this congress to rein some of that in . 
i think it would compete with anywhere in the world , at 69.2 percent . 
seven out of ten people you meet on the street live in a home they own or are making payments on . 
what pride in ownership . 
and what that does for sending the roots down into our economy and society and keeping our children at home , all of those things are a plus that show up in the bottom line . 
inflation is in check . 
that is so much in the last year that it scares me a little bit , being a 28-year employer ; thinking that if personal income is up 8.6 percent , then i would have to be giving my employees a raise of 8.6 percent every year , which is a pretty torrid pace as well to keep up with employment . 
in fact , a year ago it was minus $ 503 billion a year . 
the last announcement came out , the annual report came out february 10 , and that was a minus $ 617.7 billion in imbalance in trade . 
so that is about a 20 percent increase in the negative balance of trade that we have . 
so we need to work this thing back to correct the balance of trade , but it is not something that will be done with a policy that says , well , we are concerned about sweat shop labor in el salvador or those kinds of issues that are essentially out of control . 
what is in our control in this congress are our tax policy , regulatory policy , and that is what we need to focus on . 
that is why i , years ago , in fact 25 years ago , came to the position and the conclusion that we needed to do some real tax reform . 
we are reaching for that destiny to inspire all people in the world to reach for freedom and liberty and being able to make their own investments and control their own destiny economically , but we can also set a tax policy that ceases to punish the productivity in america . 
so us , in our wisdom , we tax productivity in america instead of consumption . 
productivity will go up in america . 
the irs right now is a trillion dollar drag on an $ 11 trillion economy when we add the cost of funding them , enforcing them , and the disincentives that are in place that people decide i am not going to make that sales call , i am not going to do that extra overtime , i am not going to make that investment in that farm or industrial factory because the tax burden is too high . 
if we take the tax off all productivity , everybody gets the money they earned in their paycheck . 
take-home pay goes up 56 percent under a national sales tax , and items on the shelf , their price goes down by an average of 22 percent because there is an imputed cost in everything that is sold . 
businesses that provide goods for sales have to impute the cost of the federal tax in that item . 
so , for example , if there is a japanese-made mazda that is imported from japan sitting on the dealer 's lot at $ 30 , 000 , and pick your american brand sitting on the other side of the street with a $ 30 , 000 sticker price , we remove the federal tax that is imputed into the american made because it is imputed in the japanese made overseas . 
by the time we add the sales tax back in , the american car is at $ 30 , 400 or so , but the japanese car is around $ 39 , 000 . 
mr. chairman , i rise to join the chairman of the committee on education and the workforce , the gentleman from ohio ( mr. boehner ) xz4000360 , in a colloquy on how certain provisions in this legislation might affect the governance of wia funding in new york state . 
i offered an amendment to remedy this conflict in committee . 
the amendment i offered was language that is identical to language already included in s. 9 . 
i would ask the chairman if he would commit to working with me and my new york colleagues in conference to resolve this issue . 
our workforce is in trouble . 
times , '' recently reported that the volatility of income for the working poor has doubled in recent years . 
mr. chairman , we need to rethink the systems we have in place to help workers and employers maximize productivity and profitability . 
we continue to pursue open trade to open our domestic market to foreign competition , but we are not employing the same vigor toward pursuing the means to ensure that our workforce can compete and be the best trained and equipped in the world . 
this issue , investing in our workforce , transcends social and economic status . 
everyone in these industries is competing for their jobs against someone overseas . 
we ought to significantly invest in continuing education training programs for people in industries that are challenged by global competition . 
this bill , even without the bad provisions such as personal reemployment accounts and the provisions that allow workplace discrimination based on religion , does nothing to meet the new challenges that workers and businesses that rely on them face in the new global economy . 
the poor have more things today -- including wild income swings `` the poor are not like everyone else , '' social critic michael harrington wrote in the 1962 bestseller `` the other america , '' which helped shape president johnson 's war on poverty . 
rojas and maldanado live in a two-room apartment in hawthorne but have china settings for 16 tucked in a wooden hutch . 
in many ways , rojas is the new face of the working poor , suffering not so much from a dearth of possessions as from a cavalcade of chaos -- pay cuts and eviction notices , car troubles and medical crises -- that rattles her finances and nudges her family toward the economic brink . 
in this way , rojas and millions like her are not -- as harrington described them -- fundamentally different from most other americans ; they are remarkably similar . 
during the early 1970s , the inflation-adjusted incomes of most families in the bottom fifth of the economy bounced up and down no more than 25 % a year . 
by the beginning of this decade , those annual fluctuations had doubled to as much as 50 % , according to statistics generated by the los angeles times in conjunction with moffitt and researchers at several other major universities . 
for a family with an income at the 20th percentile -- or roughly $ 23 , 000 a year in inflation-adjusted terms -- that has meant recent annual swings of as much as $ 12 , 000 . 
in contrast to most economic indicators , which involve taking random samples of different americans at different times and comparing the results , the panel study has followed the same 5 , 000 nationally representative families and their offshoots for nearly 40 years . 
in supplementing conventional statistics with the panel-study data , the newspaper has sought to explain why americans in rising numbers report being less financially secure , even as the nation has grown richer overall . 
in a nutshell , the times has found that behind the upward march of most economic averages are increasingly frequent instances of financial setback and hardship for a large swath of the population . 
even those in the top-10 percent bracket -- making well over $ 100 , 000 a year -- have seen their incomes grow more volatile and therefore prone to steep dives . 
but for the country 's 20 million working-poor families , the findings are particularly sobering : they now run the risk of seeing their incomes slashed by half in any given year . 
that 's almost double the volatility experienced by families in the middle of the economic spectrum , the newspaper 's findings show . 
`` most people are n't that prudent. '' elvira rojas headed for the u.s. at age 21 in search of two things that were in short supply in her native ei salvador : peace and prosperity . 
combatants in that country 's bloody civil war engaged in firefights outside her family 's home in acajutla , and maldanado had received death threats because of his role as a former military man . 
in addition , rojas discovered that the only job she could get with her high school diploma from el instituto nacional was at the local fish-packing plant . 
the pair arrived in l.a . 
in may 1989 . 
but with the average rent on a one-bedroom apartment in the city then running about $ 600 , they could not afford a first foothold in their new country -- a place of their own to live . 
`` i felt bad in the beginning because i had nothing , '' rojas said . 
`` i wanted to go home. '' with nowhere else to turn , they moved in with one of maldanado 's aunts , her five children and four cousins in a two-bedroom house on firmona avenue in hawthorne . 
in 1991 , the two gained legal status under a program that allowed people fleeing war in their homelands to be counted as refugees . 
but their new standing was thrown into question in 1994 , when california voters approved proposition 187 . 
`` i see one-third of a nation ill-housed , ill-clad , ill-nourished , '' he said in 1937 . 
in the years that followed , a booming private sector largely solved the food and clothing problems . 
in 1974 , president nixon and congress turned to another solution : the section 8 program . 
instead of putting up buildings itself , the government would subsidize private developers to construct housing and give poor families vouchers to rent apartments in the open market . 
but developer subsidies produced cost overruns and political scandals in the 1980s and were largely phased out . 
in all , the amount of money that congress and the president have authorized to be spent on housing assistance has plunged by nearly two-thirds in the last 25 years , from an inflation-adjusted $ 82 billion in 1978 to $ 29 billion last year . 
in hot housing markets such as southern california 's , little has . 
in the absence of substantial government help -- and with housing prices soaring beyond the reach of even the middle class -- most working-poor families have been left to fend for themselves . 
by 1997 , rojas and maldanado thought they had succeeded in doing that . 
she was making more than $ 12 , 000 dashing between a part-time job at an airline linen service on prairie avenue in hawthorne and a temporary position with kelly services , packing magazines , perfume and shampoo in samplers for direct-market mailings . 
in the fall of that year , the couple , with another of maldanado 's aunts and her children , moved into a white stucco bungalow on burin avenue in inglewood , not far from los angeles international airport . 
although the house sagged in the middle and had drainage problems , it featured two kitchens and two living rooms , plenty of space for each family . 
albert grimes arrived in los angeles a few years before elvira rojas did , similarly hungry to start over . 
he opened a barbershop , founded a youth marching band called b.j. 's raiders and became a kingmaker of sorts in cleveland politics . 
it paid about $ 15 , 000 , equal to about $ 30 , 000 in today 's dollars . 
in 1985 , at the age of 29 , he left home and headed west . 
in a reverse of the current passion for temps , outsourcing and lean workforces , corporate america felt it had a civic duty to offer full-time jobs with good wages and solid benefits , even to those like grimes with no college education . 
that it is hard to see why we manufacturers have not made more progress in its application , '' procter & amp ; gamble co . 
his social security records show that his income rose steadily -- from $ 12 , 000 in 1987 to $ 20 , 000 in 1990 ( or nearly $ 28 , 000 in today 's terms ) . 
but in 1992 , sears stumbled , the result of a failed strategy to sell everything from socks to stocks . 
the combination of recession and steep cuts in defense spending , brought on by the end of the cold war , walloped southern california . 
any chance that he would be rehired by sears soon evaporated when the company 's warehouse and adjacent store were damaged in the l.a . 
in their place were tens of thousands of relatively small employers whose job-generating capacity is now regularly praised by the nation 's leaders but whose instability , often-low wages and meager benefits are less remarked upon . 
the slide was even steeper in l.a . 
in 1995 , he resurfaced , this time as a security guard and -- befitting the u.s. economy 's free-market transformation -- a self-employed entrepreneur . 
with the help of a friend , grimes persuaded a string of businesses in a run-down neighborhood along bixel street near downtown to hire him . 
then in 1998 , he found out how risky the life of an entrepreneur can be : the city bought up the properties along bixel street to make way for the staples center . 
as grimes ' world caved in on him once more , rojas ' prospects were looking up . 
the latter would prove particularly important when rojas suffered a miscarriage in 2001 , and her health plan picked up the tab for more than $ 5 , 000 . 
until then , virtually everything she had in her life had belonged to her in-laws . 
by 1998 , as rojas and maldanado 's income more than doubled to $ 26 , 000 ( $ 30 , 500 in today 's dollars ) , the couple began assembling the pieces of a middle-class life . 
she purchased a hutch from levitz furniture in which to display the dishes . 
she would make a similar choice when their second child was born last may , rejecting maldanado 's suggestion of elvira in favor of melane . 
`` here , '' said rojas , `` my family will go a lot farther than in el salvador. '' in the summer of 2000 , the wyndham 's owners announced that they were closing the hotel for renovations . 
unions , which represented 17 percent of the nation 's private-sector workforce in the early 1980s , counted only 8 percent as members by last year . 
for the poor , the most dramatic of all the safety-net cuts that the government has engineered in the last 25 years came in 1996 . 
in doing so , it essentially reversed the poverty-fighting strategy that washington had pursued since the 1960s in which poor americans were promised a certain minimal standard of living . 
advocates have hailed the measure as a spectacular success , saying it has increased the incomes of many poor people while triggering a steep drop in poverty among black children . 
but grimes , in the meantime , has been staggered by another , lesser-known element of the 1996 act -- a significant toughening of child-support enforcement rules . 
grimes and harvey 's son , albert jr. , was born in 1988 . 
it 's also unclear whether counting grimes as a parent in the house would have jeopardized the size of harvey 's welfare checks . 
a recent study commissioned by the state found that past-due child-support payments in california have soared to almost $ 17 billion from $ 2.5 billion in the last decade . 
`` the system was largely about welfare-cost recovery , not helping families , '' said curtis l. child , who stepped down recently as head of the state department of child support services , which was created in 2000 to remove enforcement power from county district attorneys and restructure the system . 
`` in imposing these huge judgments on fathers , we 're confronting these men with an awful choice : go underground , which is just what child-support enforcement was intended to stop , or let themselves be financially ruined. '' in august 1997 , grimes was ordered to start sending the county $ 173 a month in current payments , plus an additional amount for past-due support totaling $ 4 , 900 . 
when he fell behind after his bixel street business collapsed in 1998 , the past-due total began to swell . 
in one great clap , the 9/11 terrorists brought down the twin towers in new york , shattered americans ' sense of security and shoved elvira rojas down the economic ladder . 
it took her five days to reach burger king after the police and military sealed off the airport in the wake of the september 2001 attacks . 
when she finally was allowed in , rojas found that her manager had cut her shift to just four hours . 
over the next 15 months , rojas grabbed whatever hours she could get at the hotel and worked a second job ironing clothes at hermosa cleaners in hermosa beach . 
it was a tough schedule even before she got pregnant in 2002 . 
in may 2002 , rojas was rushed to the emergency room at robert f. kennedy medical center in hawthorne , where she suffered a second miscarriage . 
as the credit card industry emerged in the late 1950s and '60s , some expressed concern that even well-provisioned middle-class families would be unable to resist the lure of instant credit . 
betty furness , president johnson 's consumer affairs advisor , warned that credit cards were `` modern traps '' that would turn americans into `` hopeless addicts. '' but over the last 25 years , card issuers have not let up in pushing their products . 
federal reserve figures show that among families in the bottom fifth of the economy , the percentage of households with credit cards has soared from 11 % in the late 1970s to almost 40 % . 
their average balance on those cards has climbed , in inflation-adjusted terms , from about $ 825 to more than $ 2 , 000 . 
economists dirk krueger of the university of pennsylvania and fabrizio perri , a new york university professor now on sabbatical at the federal reserve bank of minneapolis , say families of all incomes increasingly rely on loans , rather than on business and government safety nets , in times of trouble . 
they borrow their way through the bad patches and pay off their debts in flush periods . 
some of the items purchased on rojas ' and maldanado 's credit cards can seem frivolous or extravagant -- the tvs , for example , or a $ 150 set of sepia-toned studio photographs of katherine and her mom dressed in feather boas and gowns . 
that 's in large part because the interest the two are charged is about double what a typical middle-class borrower faces . 
( the minnetonka , minn. , bank recently was ordered by federal regulators to pay $ 3.2 million in penalties for `` downselling '' -- offering low pre-approved rates and then moving customers to higher-rate accounts without fully disclosing the switch . 
in the spring of 2000 , two years after grimes ' bixel street business failed , he found a job as a security guard five blocks away at ernst & amp ; young plaza . 
`` i thought i should have a situation where i 'm in control. '' but for most of the last year , grimes has been anything but in control . 
in february , after a dispute with their landlord , he and his family were evicted from their apartment on fedora street , where they had lived for several years . 
in july , things took another turn for the worse . 
for the time being , he is working for the service employees international union on a campaign to organize security guards in the city 's high-rise offices . 
a developer is preparing to raze the place and put in half-million-dollar townhouses . 
and the cabinets in the kitchenette are so stuffed that rojas must store her supply of infant formula in her car trunk . 
but the couple has plans -- to turn around the slide in their income , to look for a house , to make sure that the girls continue all the way through school . 
soon after arriving in the u.s. , she took out a loan to finance her future at the inglewood park cemetery . 
by the time rojas is finished , she will have spent more than $ 12 , 000 in total . 
the panel study has followed a nationally representative sample of about 5 , 000 families and their offshoots for nearly 40 years and is the most comprehensive publicly available income and earnings database in the world . 
the times also consulted with yale university political scientist jacob s. hacker , who has conducted his own analysis of income volatility among households in the panel study and has published results linking it to economic risk . 
the times ' analysis looked at five-year increments from 1970 to 2000 and examined the annual fluctuations in each family 's income . 
for example , for a family whose income rose by $ 5 , 000 over a five-year span , the paper examined the journey from the lower number to the higher : did the change occur in steady $ 1 , 000 annual increases ? 
or did the family 's income take a big jump in one year and plunge in another ? 
the times ' basic finding is that the fluctuations in annual income that individual families have experienced have grown larger over the last three decades . 
to zero in on working families , the times focused on men and women 25 to 64 years old whose households had some income . 
it then concentrated on those in the bottom one-fifth of income earners and especially those right at the 20th percentile . 
all amounts were adjusted for inflation , expressed in 2003 dollars . 
the republican leadership seems to think that the job picture in this country is rosy , but they could not be more wrong . 
they seem to think jobs are popping out of the woodwork , but it is clear our workers need job training assistance in order to compete in the 21st century workplace . 
every day over 85 , 000 people in this country lose their jobs . 
in addition to the 8 million americans who are currently unemployed , there are 5 million unemployed workers who want to work but have given up looking for jobs simply because there are no jobs out there for them . 
beyond that , there are 4.5 million people who have accepted low-wage , part-time work simply because they can not find full-time employment in this weak economy . 
and not only are millions of american workers looking for jobs , but the long-term unemployment rate , workers who have been jobless for 6 months or more , is the highest in more than 20 years . 
the republicans have mismanaged this economy , and american workers are paying the price through lower pay , reduced benefits , and in too many cases job loss . 
this bill will do nothing to create new jobs , reduce the number of unemployed people in this country , or sufficiently training workers for jobs . 
frankly , this bill is a slap in the face to american workers . 
in my home state of massachusetts , this program provides services to nearly 165 , 000 jobseekers each year , and it has successfully helped 75 percent of them retain employment in less than 6 months . 
in addition , this bill block grants adult and dislocated worker funding streams . 
twenty-one years ago , then-senator dan quayle sponsored legislation that provided civil rights protections against religious-based employment discrimination in programs that receive federal funding . 
this provision received strong bipartisan support when the workforce reinvestment act was reauthorized in 1998 . 
in other words , this bill would allow a religious organization that discriminates based on religion , like a bob jones university , to get taxpayer money and use that federal funding to legally discriminate on religious grounds when hiring staff to carry out the job training programs and services in this bill . 
but let me be clear , the right of churches , synagogues , mosques and other religious organizations to remain free from government intervention has long been protected under the law , and i am sure my colleagues join me in support of this protection . 
congress has always exempted faith-based organizations from antidiscrimination provisions in programs funded by their own money , and we are not proposing that a church or synagogue or mosque be forbidden from using religious criteria in deciding who to hire as a minister or rabbi or imam . 
however , that same church , synagogue or mosque should not be permitted to apply for and receive federal funding for job training and then , as written in this bill , be exempted from federal civil rights protections . 
faith-based institutions should be required , like all other recipients of federal funds , to adhere to basic civil rights laws , and i can not even begin to count the number of institutions that have contacted my office in the last few days asking to be held to those same standards . 
last night in the committee on rules , i heard my colleagues , the gentleman from virginia ( mr. scott ) xz4003641 and the gentleman from florida ( mr. hastings ) xz4001701 talk about a return to discrimination practices that forced these men and millions of other african americans to drink from separate drinking fountains and eat at separate lunch counters from white americans . 
i certainly can not find it in myself to do so . 
i hope that my colleagues will join me in voting for the scott amendment . 
mr. speaker , many democrats offered several high-quality amendments in the committee on rules yesterday . 
it is truly a tragedy when a nation that prides itself on democracy and equality considers and will most likely pass a bill that would permit employment discrimination in federally-funded programs . 
what we feel is that this provision in this bill is offensive and it turns the clock backwards on civil rights . 
mr. speaker , i include for printing in the record a letter opposing this bill signed by 67 religious organizations and civil rights organizations that have great concerns not only with the provision on religious-based employment discrimination but on a whole series of other provisions . 
dear representative : the undersigned organizations are writing to urge you to vote against h.r. 27 , the job training improvement act , unless it is modified to address the concerns outlined in this letter ; and to oppose any effort to expand the block grant authority in the bill along the lines of the administration 's `` wia plus '' proposal . 
instead , the legislation would eliminate the dislocated worker training program , undermine state rapid response systems , end the federal-state labor exchange system , roll back protections against religious discrimination in hiring by job training providers , and potentially undermine the stability of other important programs . 
in particular , we are concerned about the following provisions in h.r. 27 : h.r. 27 consolidates into a single block grant the wia adult and dislocated worker programs with the wagner-peyser employment service program and reemployment services for unemployment insurance recipients . 
in doing so , it will eliminate job training assistance specifically targeted to workers dislocated by off shoring and other economic changes , pit different types of workers against each other , and lead to future funding reductions . 
eliminating the employment a principal criticism of wia has been the substantial decline in actual training compared to its predecessor , the job training partnership act . 
while there are various reasons for the reduction in training , including the sequence of services requirement in current law , the use of wia resources by local boards and operators to build new one-stop facilities and bureaucracies , without any limitation , has contributed substantially to the decline in training . 
in doing so , they transform the original one-stop idea of a better-coordinated workforce system into a mechanism for reducing resources for and block granting these programs in the future . 
a more effective and simple solution to ensuring adequate training services would be to require that a certain percentage of wia funds be used for training as provided in previous job training programs and to create a separate wia funding stream for one-stop operations , if necessary . 
since this demonstration already is in process , we see no justification for this provision and can only surmise that it is an attempt to implement pras more broadly , despite a lack of congressional support for a full-scale program in the past . 
these protections have been included in job training programs , which received bipartisan support , since 1982 . 
at no time have the civil rights provisions prohibited religious organizations from effective participation in federal job training programs . 
this rollback of civil rights protections is especially incongruous in a program designed to provide employment and career opportunities in an evenhanded manner and should be rejected . 
furthermore , the in summary , h.r. 27 strays far from the appropriate mission for federal job training programs of enhancing training opportunities for workers and providing skilled workers for employers . 
equal partners in faith . 
national alliance for partnerships in equity . 
it is not just a concern that those of us who are speaking here have ; i submitted a list of close to 70 civil rights and religious organizations that have objections to this provision , including the african american ministers in action ; american jewish committee ; the american jewish congress ; americans for religious liberty ; the anti-defamation league ; the baptist joint committee ; central conference of american rabbis ; episcopal church , usa ; the general board of church and society of the united methodist church ; the national advocacy center of the sisters of the good shepherd ; national council of jewish women ; network , mr. speaker , i yield 6 minutes to the gentleman from virginia ( mr. scott ) xz4003641 . 
mr. chairman , i rise in strong support of h.r. 27 and thank the gentleman from ohio for his leadership in bringing this bill to the floor , the job training improvement act of 2005 , which i introduced to strengthen and reauthorize the nation 's job training system as well as adult education and vocational rehabilitation programs . 
in today 's knowledge-based economy , we need to equip americans with the skills they need to find a new or better job and quickly return to the workforce . 
one of the hallmarks of wia is that in order to encourage the development of comprehensive systems that improve services to both employers and job seekers , local services are provided through a one-stop delivery system . 
the one-stop centers serve as the front line in helping job seekers return to the workforce . 
for example , the bill streamlines the current wia funding in order to provide more efficient and results-oriented services and programs by combining the adult , dislocated , and employment service funding streams into one funding stream . 
this will eliminate duplication in service delivery and administrative functions that remain in the system , improving services for individuals . 
the bill also ensures the financial contribution of the mandatory partners in the one-stop centers while at the same time it increases the service integration among the partner programs . 
in order to ensure greater responsiveness to local area needs and strengthen the private sector 's role , the bill simplifies the local and state governance processes . 
mr. chairman , i had a couple of my good friends , constituents in my district , that lost their jobs in the defense industry . 
one of them went on to become a school teacher , one a worker in the computer industry . 
the new bill that we are passing today will make it better , more efficient and help the people to really get the services they need so we can continue to have the job growth that we have been enjoying the last few months here in the country . 
mr. chairman , although i do not oppose the amendment , i ask unanimous consent to claim the time in opposition . 
mr. chairman , i rise in strong support of his amendment , and i find it just incredible that all of a sudden discrimination becomes the core of religious organizations , for those of us who have spent almost 40 years working with faith-based organizations in our communities involved in all kinds of public service endeavors , all kinds of delivery of services to people in need , to help members of our community in almost everything , from education to child care to job training to substance abuse to a whole range of activities that are absolutely essential to binding our community together . 
you can not maintain your religious character , you can not maintain the religious character of your organization unless you can discriminate in hiring ? 
mr. chairman , i rise in strong opposition to the job training improvement act , because it will reduce important job training programs such as the veterans employment programs , perkins vocational educational program and the vocational rehabilitation program . 
this measure consolidates the adult , dislocated worker and employment service programs and funding into a block grant , while also repealing the wagner peyser act and removing many of the federal performance and accountability measurements that make the workforce investment act such an important investment in our nation 's workforce . 
states are not going to spend that money where it is needed the most , which is to aid job seekers in this troubling economy . 
this will go against the true intent of the workforce investment act , which is to invest in our workforce . 
president bush has pledged to expand the no child left behind law to high schools and require students to take annual tests in reading and mathematics through 11th grade . 
so the president wants to ensure that students and teachers are held accountable for learning standards , but he lacks support for programs that strive to keep kids in school ? 
they strive to meet the increasing demands placed upon them in an environment of increasingly inadequate resources . 
the message that we are sending to the millions of americans who are unemployed , who are veterans and those who are in need of economic assistance is that we do not care about keeping them from falling further into an economic crisis . 
this bill fails as a reinvestment in our workforce and fails to aid the millions of jobless americans who need it the most . 
i urge all my colleagues to vote in favor of the scott amendment which will protect current civil rights protections for employees and job applicants of faith-based organizations . 
mr. chairman , since the presidency of franklin roosevelt , our nation has moved inexorably toward the elimination of all forms of discrimination in government contracting and in the private sector . 
this bill rolls back that commitment that would enshrine the principle of religious discrimination in one of our most important job training programs at a time when many americans are losing their jobs and need the help these programs offer . 
are religiously affiliated charities unable to participate in federally social services programs ? 
they can not make professing religious faith a precondition of receiving social services paid for with the taxpayers ' dollars , and they can not discriminate in employment when those jobs are paid for with taxpayers ' dollars . 
we have all heard about the bad old days when signs hung in windows : `` no catholics need apply , '' `` no jews need apply . 
fill in one 's favorite denomination . 
in inner cities , and sometimes our rural areas , we find that they are very effective . 
for instance , a music director at a church may also work at the job training center in the afternoon . 
mr. speaker , i rise in opposition to this amendment . 
the 1964 civil rights act explicitly protects the rights of religious organizations to take religion into account in their hiring practices . 
in fact , the civil rights act made clear that when faith-based organizations hire employees on a religious basis , it is an exercise of the organization 's civil liberties and does not constitute discrimination under federal law . 
by denying the rights of religious organizations to hire according to their principles , this amendment declares war between the government and faith-based organizations , it cuts services for people in need , it eliminates the role of faith-based organizations in our government efforts to help . 
mr. chairman , i rise today in strong support of h.r. 27 , the job training improvement act of 2005 , and i certainly applaud the gentleman from california ( chairman mckeon ) and the gentleman from ohio ( chairman boehner ) for their tireless efforts in bringing this important legislation to the floor today . 
as an original cosponsor of this legislation , there are many provisions that will increase the ability of our nation 's workers to achieve greater stability in our ever-changing workforce . 
as my community of southern nevada experienced in the wake of september 11 , our economy proved to be very vulnerable . 
as my community rebounded from this blow , nevadans sought help in adjusting to the realities of the workforce . 
mr. chairman , i know that pras would have provided my constituents with a valuable option in seeking these services . 
in fact , many constituents have told me they are excited to have this opportunity in case there is another emergency at some point in time . 
in fact , one young girl , lucy , wanted to make sure that there was ample education dollars available ; and i assured her there would be . 
we are enthusiastic about the launch of pra demonstration projects in seven states . 
we look forward to working with you , chairman boehner , and chairman mckeon on this innovative plan to help workers in transition . 
mr. chairman , i rise in strong support of h.r. 27 , the job training improvement act of 2005 . 
i would like to recognize the gentleman from ohio ( mr. boehner ) xz4000360 and the gentleman from california ( mr. mckeon ) xz4002670 for their leadership and tireless efforts in bringing this bill to the house floor . 
hard-working families in my district who have been laid off rely on programs like the one-stop workforce development system , which helps states and communities ensure workers to get the training they need to find good jobs . 
he came to the one-stop and enrolled in training to become a registered nurse . 
in another case , my constituent , tiffany birtalan , a single mother raising a teenager , she currently works as a waitress making $ 2.13 an hour plus tips . 
i will be offering it in conjunction with the gentlewoman from california ( ms. woolsey ) xz4004360 , the gentleman from maryland ( mr. van hollen ) xz4004150 , the gentleman from massachusetts ( mr. frank ) xz4001400 , the gentleman from texas ( mr. edwards ) xz4001180 , and the gentleman from new york ( mr. nadler ) xz4002890 in order to preserve and maintain civil rights protections as they currently appear in the job training laws . 
for decades , our country has prohibited discrimination in hiring with federal funds . 
in 1941 , president roosevelt ordered a prohibition against discrimination in all defense contracts . 
in other words , since 1941 , our national policy has been that even if you can build better and cheaper rifles , the army will not buy them from you if you discriminate in employment . 
the civil rights act passed in 1964 , and it prohibited discrimination ; but it included an exception for religious organizations , but that exception was limited to the context of the religious organizations using their own money . 
in 1965 , president johnson banned discrimination in all government contracts without exception . 
in job training programs specifically , this congress passed in 1982 the job training partnership act with bipartisan support . 
in that act , congress included a nondiscrimination clause without exception , and that remains the statutory requirement in job training requirement programs today . 
this is not a debate about religious organizations having the right to participate in job training programs . 
religious organizations do not need section 129 in the bill to sponsor federally funded job training programs . 
they need that section in order to discriminate in hiring with federal dollars . 
and if we do not enforce discrimination laws in federal contracts with secular programs , where is our moral authority to tell private employers who may be devoutly religious that they can not discriminate with their private money ? 
that is a profound change in civil rights protection . 
for example , i read in a dear colleague that the bill is one that would `` restore hiring protections for faith-based organizations participating in federal job training programs. '' mr. speaker , section 129 does not restore anything . 
people have not been able to discriminate in federal contracts since 1965 and specifically not in any job training program since 1982 . 
they are contracts for government services , and we should honor the tradition begun in 1941 , which prohibits discrimination . 
and , finally , mr. speaker , dear colleague talks about barriers that exist to prevent faith-based organizations from fully participating in government-sponsored programs , but it does not say what the barrier is . 
in fact , the only barrier is one can not discriminate . 
any program that can get funded under the underlying bill could be funded without section 129 if the sponsoring organization would agree not to discriminate in employment . 
today they support the nondiscrimination provision in the workforce investment act the way it is and they oppose section 129 . 
mr. chairman , we keep hearing that we are discriminating against religious organizations in terms of participation in government contracts . 
what has not been said is since 1965 there has been a specific prohibition against discrimination in federal contracts . 
you have not been able to discriminate in a job training program since 1965 . 
in fact , for defense contracts , you have not been able to discriminate since 1941 . 
in the 1960s , mr. chairman , we passed civil rights laws to respond to our sorry history of bigotry , and we designated specific protected classes where you could not discriminate in employment , race , color , creed , national origin and sex ; and you can not discriminate against those protected classes . 
mr. chairman , i want to further elaborate on the last point in this amendment 's attack on religious liberty in the united states , that in fact the interpretation in the presiding bishop v. amos , the supreme court unanimously upheld the language permitting religious organizations to staff on a religious basis in matters concerning employment when they receive federal funds , in a unanimous decision . 
finding that the exemption did not violate the establishment clause , the supreme court has made it clear that it is `` a permissible legislative purpose to alleviate significant governmental interference with the ability of religious organizations to define and carry out their religious missions. '' even where the content of their activities is secular , in the sense that activities do not include religious teaching , proselytizing , or worship , and it is very important for everybody to understand , we all agree you can not have prayer , you can not proselytize , you can not use government funds for anything but a secular purpose in job training , justice brennan , hardly a conservative , said that even if a religious organization is providing job training , which would be a secular thing , it is likely to be infused with a religious purpose . 
in other words , the motivation of the individuals probably is religious . 
and then he recognized that preserving the title vii protections when religious organizations engage in social services is a necessary element of religious freedom . 
this attempt to redefine the supreme court in today 's debate is unfortunate . 
it is , in my opinion , bigotry against many religious people in the united states who would like to provide assistance to the poor , who would like to leverage their funds , their volunteer time , their churches , but are being told that even though they accept everybody in , even though they can not proselytize with it , that they are not welcome to participate , they are going to have their liberties taken away . 
furthermore , as we take the logical extension of this which we are dealing with in whether we provide buses and computers to private schools and which will certainly come up in education bills in front of our committee , one of the questions is , if those funds run through the bishop 's office , does in fact the reach of the funds that go for buses and for computers , which the court has ruled a computer does not do the proselytizing , the software does the proselytizing , will this reach back in because the governance of catholic charities ultimately comes back to the bishop 's office ? 
court rulings are increasingly tilting that direction because we have falsely interpreted what is religious liberty in the united states and that we have to make it clear in these bills which , as the chairman has pointed out , have passed this house multiple times , the president of the united states in many of these was not president bush pushing a faith-based initiative , but president clinton . 
former vice president gore has said specifically that religious organizations should not have to change their religious character in order to participate . 
it means that if you are an orthodox jewish group and you are going to serve everybody in your community , that you get to be an orthodox jewish group ; if you are an evangelical group that believes in the resurrection of jesus christ , that people who represent your organization should share that belief ; if you are a muslim group , that people who represent that group should share that . 
the fundamental question here is , and through my subcommittee on criminal justice and human services we held eight hearings across the united states and we had a great debate in every region of the country , but many organizations came forth , whether they were muslim , jewish or christian in some form , and said , we can not compromise the nature of our faith if you are going to make us change our hiring practices . 
i believe that the members , and i know one argument is that we had these debates in the middle of the night , i believe members actually looked at those bills and they knew what they were voting for , and i hope they will not flip-flop today . 
mr. chairman , i rise today in opposition to h.r. 27 , the so-called job training improvement act of 2005 . 
let me remind my republican colleagues that there are still fewer jobs available in america than when president bush came to office . 
they even allow religious organizations to engage in hiring discrimination in an unholy attempt to turn back a half-century of progress in preventing workplace discrimination . 
current law prohibits employers participating in federal job training programs from discriminating based on race , color , religion , sex , national origin , age disability , or political affiliation or belief . 
the republican bill would allow the taxpayer dollars that pay for these job-training programs to go to religious organizations that blatantly discriminate in hiring based on religious beliefs . 
in fact , the provision was first included in the federal job training legislation that former senator dan quayle sponsored . 
throughout its 23-year history , this civil rights provision has not been an obstacle to the participation of religiously affiliated organizations in federal job training programs . 
currently , many religious organizations participate in the federal programs and comply with the same civil rights protections that apply to other employers . 
just in response to the gentleman 's comments a second ago and earlier , the reason for this amendment is that current law takes care of any state that wants to put a higher proportion of funds towards out-of-school youth . 
and if they want to move in that direction , they can . 
the others already can , in fact , serve as many of the people they want out of school . 
so i hope my colleagues look at this and do not disadvantage those states that need to have the flexibility to serve more in-school youth , and at the same time realize that this amendment harms those who need more out-of-school youth served in no way at all . 
those programs would be slashed in many states if h.r. 27 were to go through as it is . 
we have a great need for these in many states ; programs like girls inc. , action inc . 
this amendment is not about whether faith-based organizations do a terrific job in our communities and around the world in providing services . 
catholic charities , jewish federation , and a whole variety of protestant denominations currently receive federal dollars to provide services in our community and around the world . 
and guess what , today they are doing it under current law which says when they receive those federal tax dollars , they may not discriminate in who they hire based on religion , and not one of those organizations has come to me and said we could do a better job in providing job training services if only you would let us discriminate based on religion . 
the civil rights act of 1964 does not say in any way that religious organizations can take taxpayer dollars and then discriminate in their hiring based on religion when they are providing services based on those dollars . 
we are now using those resources to provide to faith-based organizations , and what the bill would allow people to do is to say to somebody who is coming to apply for a job to provide job training services , you know what , we know you are qualified , we know you have a great education , know you can do a good job in providing job training services , but you are the wrong religion . 
in the latest attack on october 1 , the president doubled the fees that small businesses must pay to receive a 7 ( a ) loan . 
for a loan of $ 150 , 000 , an entrepreneur must now pay nearly $ 3 , 000 in up-front fees , a significant cost for someone trying to start a company . 
president bush was wrong when he increased the burden entrepreneurs face in accessing capital . 
unemployed workers should be allowed to use these funds in their accounts to pay for the cost of the 7 ( a ) loan fees , and that is exactly what my amendment will do . 
given president bush 's commitment to creating an ownership society , i am surprised there are not more provisions in this bill to help unemployed workers own small businesses . 
we need a revival of entrepreneurship in this country that will spur more job creation and grow our economy . 
i want to be on record , and i want every member in this house to be on record about the fact that last july , an amendment to the cjs appropriations that would have protected the 7-a program was approved with strong support . 
mr. chairman , once again my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are claiming they want to help workers in this nation . 
instead of increasing funding in the bill to address infrastructure needs separately , this bill forces governors to choose between workers and updating facilities , all from the same pot of money . 
this bill also changes the way in which the government will evaluate the success of wia programs . 
first , it would not keep faith-based organizations from hiring members of their own religion with their own funds in the exercise of their faith . 
second , it would not keep faith-based organizations from participating in job training programs under this bill . 
what this amendment says is that if a faith-based organization accepts federal funds for job training , then in delivering job training , it can not engage in religious discrimination . 
the proof of this slippery slope is in the president 's words . 
in talking about a hypothetical federally-funded methodist alcohol treatment center , he said that the policy should be that `` all are welcome , welcome to be saved so they become sober. '' i support every american 's right to seek salvation through their religion , but our only interest in federally-funded programs should be whether they provide qualified services for which they are funded . 
in closing , i will correct a third misunderstanding , that the faith community opposes this amendment . 
so i thank the gentleman from virginia ( mr. scott ) xz4003641 , the gentleman from maryland ( mr. van hollen ) xz4004150 , the gentleman from texas ( mr. edwards ) xz4001180 , and the gentleman from new york ( mr. nadler ) xz4002890 for their commitments to protecting american 's liberties and i encourage all americans to join us in supporting this amendment . 
mr. speaker , we have asked literally hundreds of thousands of our best and brightest , many of them national guard and reservists from south dakota , to serve overseas in operations iraqi freedom and enduring freedom . 
additionally , too many of the brave men and women who are serving in the national guard and reserve forces have returned home to find their jobs gone and their families struggling to make ends meet . 
while our military personnel are risking their lives in iraq and afghanistan , they should not be worrying if their jobs will be there for them when they return home or what they will do if they are not . 
mr. chairman , i thank the chairman and the gentleman from california for allowing me to participate in this debate . 
these are very challenging times for many in our workforce . 
greater flexibility in the delivery of core , intensive , and training services allows individuals to receive the most appropriate services specifically for them . 
getting more resources to those most in need when they are out of school helps those without other opportunities , and that is a good thing . 
faith-based language in this bill is identical , identical , to four separate pieces of legislation passed during the clinton administration . 
mr. chairman , i urge my colleagues to support this bill and move forward in helping those needing to return to the workforce . 
in the bill , it would change it from 16 to 24 years . 
and that is one of the reasons the provision is in the bill to change it , so that more individuals out of school will have greater opportunity to access those monies . 
in summary , no one , no one is decreasing the amount of money to in-school youth for the concerns and the issues that they have . 
what we are doing is making it so that this bill addresses those individuals that are most in need . 
no one , no one , is encouraging faith-based institutions to discriminate with the language in this bill . 
there has been some discussion about previous language that many members on the other side of the aisle have adopted in previous bills , four pieces of legislation under the clinton administration . 
president clinton himself said that no discrimination with employment in the bills that were adopted , and we have heard about them , the welfare reform , the community renewal tax relief , community services block grant , substance abuse . 
the gentleman from virginia well , the exact identical language in this bill was in those . 
by the second generation , both had become professionals and had made a great impact on their local economies , passed that on to the third generation with their children , adding value , working to create jobs in the long term . 
the great diversity has one thing in common , that is , a unity of vision , of opportunity , of purpose that can be accomplished when we are part of something bigger than ourselves . 
when i look at the numbers right now in this nation from an unemployment standpoint , we stand at 5.2 percent , which is one of the lowest unemployments in the industrialized world , particularly in light of the fact that we are involved in a war that was forced upon us by global terrorists . 
more than that , when i look to my own district , to the fourth district of kentucky , and the tremendous steps forward that have been made in the manufacturing economy , that have been made in technology and in the creation of jobs and in the development of industry and health sciences , i am excited about our future . 
i am excited about the potential for our young people to move forward and have the opportunity to create their own future , to create jobs , to start small businesses , to follow in the opportunity that i had when i finished my military service . 
after a time in industry , i chose to pursue that vision to start my own company and then end up helping other companies create jobs . 
i think one of the great things that we see a need for right now is to continue to remove the burden of regulations , to remove the burdensome tax code , to remove the impediments to individuals at every level of our economy , from starting their own businesses , from creating jobs in our communities , that will stay in our communities , to keep capital investment in those communities . 
i believe that the tax cuts that were enacted in the last congress need to be made permanent so that people can keep more of what they earn . 
it has to do with jobs in our communities , local farmers , small family farmers , people that own family businesses that have gone on for generations , to make sure that they have the opportunity to keep those jobs in the community . 
if they see the opportunity in a good year to take advantage of capital investment to improve their competitiveness , to increase jobs in the local community or protect the jobs that they have , they should have that flexibility ; and i would like to see the ability to expense capital investment made permanent rather than renewing it as we have been doing over the past 18 years . 
we need to open up the tremendous opportunities to entrepreneurship that we have in our economy . 
i met recently with a new division of northern kentucky university , a pioneer in the university of kentucky system . 
they have their own school of entrepreneurship now to encourage this creation of jobs in the local economy , to show people how they can start a business , how they can add value , how they can help people create a nest egg and a job that will last for the long term and create other jobs that will strengthen our community . 
it is also important that we continue to invest in our university systems and vocational and technical education . 
in addition , it is also important that we look at reforms that will allow small businesses to function . 
i found in my own business that my premiums , if i had not been elected to congress , were going to increase 50 percent , from $ 1 , 200 to $ 1 , 800 a month , just for my family and my business . 
we need to encourage these small businesses and enact regulations that will allow them to cover more of their employees , more of our employees in the long term . 
in addition to that , we need to bring about meaningful medical liability reform as part of this health care reform . 
the reason for that is , first of all , to stop driving our doctors out of practice in many states . 
for example , in kentucky we have lost one-third of our ob-gyn doctors in the last 5 years due to medical liability costs . 
but at a small business and job creation level , it will be a job creator if we have some meaningful liability reforms , not only to keep our doctors but to keep the cost of health care provision low so that we could cover more of our employees and also be more competitive in the long term . 
in the end , there are a variety of steps that we can take . 
we have shown in a time of national adversity now that we can compete , that we can have a strong economy , that we can create jobs ; and when i look at one of the largest employers in northeastern kentucky , a very prominent steel mill that is creating jobs , that is hiring , that is competing effectively in the world economy now , i know that we are going to be successful . 
mr. chairman , i rise in opposition to the offered amendment . 
it seems to me in our country right now we have an all-out assault on faith-based groups . 
just this week , a court in my home state of louisiana ruled that school boards were prohibited from having voluntary school board member-led prayers to begin their meetings . 
now , this very chamber , the supreme court , and many government entities begin their proceedings with a prayer ; and along that line i see nothing wrong with us inviting faith-based groups to be partners with the government in training tomorrow 's workforce . 
in my home state of louisiana , faith-based groups have done a wonderful thing . 
what might be next might be the baptist hospitals not being allowed to participate in our state 's medicaid program . 
all we are saying is let us build on a bipartisan precedent , a precedent set in the civil rights act , a precedent reaffirmed under president clinton under four different bills . 
people of faith pay taxes as well in this country . 
to quote members from the other side , senator kerry and senator clinton , those that have stood before for freedom and plurality , they themselves say , senator clinton in her own words says , `` there is no contradiction between support for faith-based initiatives and upholding our constitutional principles. '' senator kerry says , `` i know there are some that say that the first amendment means faith-based organizations ca n't help government . 
i think they are wrong. '' in this instance , i find myself in agreement with both senator kerry and senator clinton . 
we need to stop discriminating against those groups that are motivated by their religious beliefs to help the weakest in society . 
i rise in opposition to this amendment . 
mr. speaker , the gentlewoman from tennessee ( mrs. blackburn ) xz4000320 is so eloquent in her words about freedom and the economy and what makes this country great . 
we have the healthiest economy in the world , and i want to build on the things that my colleagues have said . 
the reason we have the healthiest economy in the world is because we are the freest people in the world . 
as again the gentlewoman from tennessee ( mrs. blackburn ) xz4000320 said , job creation was up in 48 of the 50 states last year , and unemployment was down in all regions . 
it builds on the significant reforms made in the bipartisan workforce investment act improvements that were enacted in 1998 . 
this change will enable more job seekers to be served with no reduction in services . 
the bill protects the rights of faith-based groups willing to participate in the nation 's job training system . 
the bill includes a number of provisions designed to strengthen the 1973 rehabilitation act in a continuing effort to help individuals with disabilities become employable and achieve full integration . 
i want to make a comment about a wonderfully significant thing that happened in the fifth congressional district last week related to increasing jobs , and that was that dell manufacturing broke ground for a $ 100 million plant in forsythe county . 
they are going to hire 700 people in the first year . 
workers are going to assemble two of dell 's desktop models , the dimension and the optiplex , in the new plant . 
we are about 2 weeks away from the start of a process where people can express interest in being hired for the first 200-250 jobs , then dell will hire another 500 people . 
we are so excited to have dell manufacturing in forsythe county . 
again , i think this is an indication that the policies of this president and the policies of this congress are working in terms of reducing taxes and making our south a very good place to bring new jobs . 
mr. chairman , i rise in opposition to the scott amendment , which seeks to strike important protections for religious organizations included in the bill . 
we know that many religious organizations in our hometowns and across america provide invaluable job training services in our communities . 
we must help religious organizations , whether they be churches , synagogues , or mosques , maintain their integrity while continuing to provide these vital services to those in need . 
a secular group , such as planned parenthood or the sierra club , that receives government money , is currently free to hire based on their ideology and mission but still use federal funds in accordance with the terms of the program . 
if we deny them these protections , many of them would have to compromise their missions or not apply at all for assistance in implementing these services . 
nowhere in the civil rights act of 1964 does it state that a faith-based organization loses its rights if it accepts federal funds . 
talking about being well spoken , she certainly is , and i appreciate the way that she is addressing the great things that are beginning to or continuing to happen in the economy . 
and i have seen it , and you have expressed it , and you feel it in east texas . 
there is an industry that is looking at reopening a plant in lufkin , texas . 
we were having hearings a couple of weeks ago and finding that one of the drains on the medical economy is the fact that 70 percent of all the massive number of physicians who are sued are dropped without any finding of fault and without paying anything in settlement . 
students of history , and i was talking with some students and teachers from grace high school in tyler , texas , and they have been studying a number of aspects of this . 
and i tell you , we have put way too much trust in government . 
we can fix social security so young people today can have the benefits of the free market economy instead of struggling in poverty with what little bit social security pays . 
as it says above the speaker 's head , `` in god we trust. '' and we need to make use of the trust that god has given us . 
american workers need access to job-training in order that they may obtain the skills to perform the jobs of the 21st century . 
they also want a career , a future , and financial independence in retirement . 
in a dynamic and changing world economy , many americans are faced with the reality that they might have to change careers multiple times . 
this plan will strengthen the ties between job training programs , adult education and vocational rehabilitation programs and the people they serve so they can continue to grow in their careers . 
of particular importance to me and my colleagues who support this plan is provision i proposed that is reflected in the bill we 're voting on today . 
the men and women of our armed forces who have given of themselves should not only be honored , but aided as much as possible in starting life again upon their return . 
the job training improvement act is a crucial step in taking the american workforce into the 21st century , and i encourage my colleagues to support its passage . 
mr. speaker , about 50 percent of americans or so are employed in small businesses , and obviously if something is employing almost half of americans that are working , that should be a priority . 
and one can imagine my surprise the other day to find out about a guy who drove up to a bank in an old ford , about a 15-year-old ford pickup truck , with rust holes in the floor . 
he said , why in the world did this guy have to take a $ 2 million loan out ? 
and it particularly seemed out of place with this guy with his old rusty holes in his pickup truck . 
i had heard stories like that before , but there it was right in front of me . 
so what this bill is seeking to do is to try to make it possible that we do not destroy farms and small businesses that employ close to half the people that have jobs in our country ; and that seems to be only reasonable . 
mr. speaker , i rise in opposition to s. 256 . 
this bill helps big credit card companies at the expense of working families in crisis . 
mr. speaker , i rise today against the pomeroy substitute and in full support of h.r. 8 , the death tax repeal permanency act of 2005 . 
the joint economic committee noted that the death tax reduces the stock in the economy , listen to this now , approximately one-half of $ 1 trillion . 
financial literacy goes hand in hand with helping our citizens of all ages and walks of life to negotiate the complex world of personal finance . 
recognizing this fact , congress included provisions in the fair and accurate credit transactions act to address the issue of financial literacy . 
these provisions are designed to ensure that those who enter the bankruptcy system will learn the skills to more effectively manage their money in an increasingly complicated marketplace . 
mr. speaker , the number of bankruptcies remain at a historic high , over 1.6 million bankruptcy cases were filed in federal courts in 2004 . 
with this in mind , i urge my colleagues to support this bill . 
recognizing this fact , congress included provisions in the fair and accurate credit transactions act to address the issue of financial literacy . 
these provisions are designed to ensure that those who enter the bankruptcy system will learn the skills to more effectively manage their money in an increasingly complicated marketplace . 
it authorizes phone and internet counseling for both the pre-filing and pre-discharge education requirements to assist debtors in rural and remote areas . 
in addition , either or both requirements may be waived if services are not available or in exigent circumstances . 
this will ensure that congress can evaluate the effectiveness of these financial literacy provisions in the long-term . 
mr. speaker , the number of bankruptcies remains at a historic high -- over 1.6 million bankruptcy cases were filed in federal courts in 2004 . 
with that in mind and in the spirit of financial literacy month , i urge my colleagues to pass s. 256 , the bankruptcy abuse prevention and consumer protection act , which contains important financial literacy provisions that will provide americans with the skills needed to successfully navigate the world of personal finance . 
the death tax represents all that is unfair and unjust about the tax structure in america because it undermines the life work and the life savings of americans who want only to pass on to their children and grandchildren the fruits of their labor and the realization of their american dream . 
in my state of georgia , farmers , many of whom are widow women , are faced with losing their family farms because of this death tax . 
mr. speaker , i want to rise in support of the rule that will allow us to consider the permanent repeal of the death tax . 
well , in my district , do my colleagues know that it affects thousands of farmers , thousands of small business owners who are very upset about the death tax ? 
for too long the death tax has been a major factor in the failure of family businesses . 
in addition , it discourages savings and investment , and it is costing our economy hundreds of thousands of new jobs . 
small business owners get it , seniors get it , the farmers in my district get it . 
mr. speaker , i urge my colleagues to join the leadership and to support this rule in favor of h.r. 8 . 
mr. speaker , i appreciate my namesake 's courtesy in permitting me to speak on his substitute . 
i appreciate his hard work and clarity in dealing with this issue and a step forward to stop a cynical game that i have watched be played here in this congress since i was first elected 9 years ago . 
nobody expects over the long haul that we are , in fact , going to eliminate in its entirety the inheritance tax . 
our republican friends have been involved with a roller coaster of a 10-year phase-out , and then insanely reinstating it in its entirety . 
it is not an insignificant number , in the neighborhood of $ 1.5 to $ 2 trillion over the period of time we are talking about . 
the pomeroy amendment would immediately raise that threshold to $ 6 million , with further adjustments to $ 7 million in 4 or 5 years from now , i forget the exact period of time ; he will correct me , i am sure . 
i strongly urge the adoption of the pomeroy substitute , which will solve the problem once and for all for the vast majority of the family farms , the small businesses , and , in fact , a number of people of significant wealth ; and it will provide resources so that we can solve problems like social security and the alternative minimum tax and be about our business . 
mr. speaker , for as long as i 've been in congress i have supported bankruptcy reform on two simple principles ; i believe people should pay their debts , if they are able , and that we should end abuses in the system , whether by people who deliberately run up their bills or by businesses who exploit the gullible and the unfortunate . 
my first vote in favor of bankruptcy reform was cast with reservations because some of the provisions of the bill seemed unduly harsh , but i had hoped that the legislative process would ultimately improve the product . 
in 2001 there were 5 billion solicitations by credit card companies . 
s. 256 maintains a homestead exemption that allows people with lots of money to shield their assets by purchasing multimillion dollar homes in certain states . 
o.j. simpson was able to shield many of his assets by doing this in florida . 
perhaps the most glaring example of the majority 's unwillingness to compromise is the rejection of an amendment that would protect soldiers injured in iraq and afghanistan from the unfair i have had meetings over the years with individuals who represent all sides of this issue : the bankruptcy trustees , judges , and lawyers who represent the debtors , and the people who extend credit to businesses large and small and to individuals rich and poor . 
as a result of these meetings , it is clear that the loopholes do remain and that the abuses of lending practices are not being reigned in . 
this is going to shut down programs like the legal clinic at lewis and clark law school in portland and will make it harder for legitimate creditors to be able to get their money back in a timely fashion . 
until that point , i can not support s. 256 in good conscience . 
i rise in support of the bill that would repeal this tax . 
by not repealing the tax permanently , we created an incredible situation for those people who would have an estate that was not taxable at all in 2010 , but is highly taxable in 2011 . 
in fact , we have all heard about the impact on small businesses and family farms , but it bears repeating as we consider this legislation today . 
the idea that you give your son $ 2 million overlooks the vast numbers of family members in this country who actually are working side by side with their son or daughter . 
in fact , $ 2 million is quite a bit below the alternative that the gentleman will vote for and suggests that amount somehow would be okay to give in his vote , but not okay to give in his speech . 
add in the value of farm equipment and business inventory , suddenly there is a lot more money than you thought you could accumulate . 
on friday of this week , i am going to visit with mark and kim larson who own a family farm right outside of joplin in my district . 
mark tells me he and his family spend a lot of money , money which would otherwise go into continuing to grow their family business , simply trying to comply with a tax code that says if somebody dies in 2010 , your family deals with one set of circumstances ; but if they die the next year , you are impacted by the return of the death tax . 
medium-to-large farms like the larsons ' produce more than 80 percent of agricultural products in america . 
let us put some certainty in the future for those kinds of families . 
mr. speaker , i rise in strong support of h.r. 8 , legislation that would permanently repeal the death tax , a tax that haunts millions of small business owners and farmers nationwide . 
throughout my twenty-two years in congress , i have proudly voted for every major tax cut initiative considered by the house . 
people will not hide this much-needed relief under their mattress or store it in their closet ; instead they will purchase necessary goods and services . 
my favorite four-letter word -- do n't worry , it 's a four letter word that can be used in polite company -- is jobs . 
i urge my colleagues to join me in supporting h.r. 8 , and put an end to this unfair , unjust , and inefficient burden on our economy . 
this reform is strongly in the interests of consumers . 
that person today is fifth in priority for the receipt of payment under the bankruptcy laws . 
the reform before us today elevates the spouse support recipient to number one in priority . 
the bill requires that repayment while allowing a discharge in bankruptcy of the debts that can not be repaid . 
in so doing , it responds to the broad misuse of chapter 7 's complete liquidation provisions that we have observed in recent years . 
many of them talk about protecting veterans and making sure that veterans have the support they need when they return from protecting this country 's freedom in iraq . 
at the same time , the republicans passed a budget that calls for $ 800 million in cuts to the va over the next 5 years . 
hundreds of thousands of reservists and national guardsmen are currently activated in support of the ongoing military operations . 
mr. speaker , i rise in support of senate bill 256 and urge its adoption by the house . 
whether or not we have a cost of $ 400 per household or some other cost , i think it is clear to all americans that we pay a cost if we have excessive bankruptcies in america . 
for more than 7 years now , almost as long as i have been in congress , we have struggled with the rising tide of bankruptcy abuse which threatens the delicate balance in this country between creditors and debtors . 
we have crafted fair and balanced legislation dealing in a straightforward manner with a problem that has vexed the nation for the past decade and threatens economic growth and stability . 
by the way , the bankruptcy act has not been amended for 25 years in a serious way . 
this bill is a rare achievement of reducing disparity in the bankruptcy system . 
additional judgeships are sorely needed in a number of districts across the country , including my state of utah . 
in that regard , i would like to thank the gentleman from georgia ( mr. kingston ) xz4002210 who has worked tirelessly on the issue of expanding the number of bankruptcy judges we have to meet this need . 
mr. speaker , at this point i will place additional information on the bill in the record . 
nevertheless , this provision should not be construed to invalidate all key employee retention programs for companies that may someday wind up in chapter 11 . 
where appropriate , key employee retention programs may be necessary to bring a company in financial distress successfully through the chapter 11 process . 
accordingly , section 331 of s. 256 should not be applied to invalidate such programs where there is no evidence of insider negligence , mismanagement , or fraudulent conduct contributed to a company 's insolvency -- in whole or in part . 
if so , i will work with my colleagues in the house and senate to address any such inconsistencies . 
i ask that a letter from the association of insolvency and restructuring advisors be printed at this point in the record . 
as board members we work to further the aira 's goal of increasing industry awareness of the organization as an important educational and technical resource for professionals in business turnaround , restructuring , and bankruptcy practice , and of the certified insolvency and restructuring advisor ( cira ) designation as an assurance of expertise in this area . 
we write to make you aware of serious concerns we have regarding a provision contained in s. 256 , the `` bankruptcy abuse prevention and consumer protection act of 2005. '' the provision in question effectively prohibits the use of key employee retention plans in chapter 11 reorganizations . 
when a company is operating in chapter 11 , a primary responsibility of management is to maintain and grow the company 's value for the benefit of all of its stakeholders . 
companies that fail to successfully reorganize in chapter 11 are liquidated . 
for a court to approve a kerp under existing law , however , a debtor must use proper business judgment in formulating the program , and the court must find the program to be reasonable and fair . 
if a kerp is not appropriate or if it is not in the best interest of the company 's creditors , the judge can refuse to approve it . 
in the last few years , there has been a trend , with which we agree , towards stricter judicial scrutiny of proposed kerps by bankruptcy judges . 
such a trend seems appropriate in the wake of numerous high profile bankruptcy filings where management 's misconduct or mismanagement has led to the chapter 11 filing . 
judges have discretion to deny kerps in these circumstances , and they do so when the facts and circumstances warrant . 
unfortunately , s. 256 as reported by the senate judiciary committee includes an amendment authored by senator edward m. kennedy xz4002142 ( the kennedy amendment ) that places significant limits on retention bonuses and severance payments to employees of companies in chapter 11 . 
it would prohibit a bankruptcy judge from approving retention bonuses in every chapter 11 case unless he or she finds that the company in question has proven that the employee has a bona fide job offer at the same or greater rate of compensation ; was prepared to accept the job offer ; and the services of that employee are `` essential to the survival of the business. '' the amendment also places significant caps on the amount of such bonus and payments . 
the kennedy amendment appears to be motivated by a desire to combat kerps in chapter 11 cases where employee-related fraud substantially contributed to the bankruptcy of the company . 
in turn , bankrupt companies would have less flexibility in trying to retain or attract necessary employees . 
this result will cause considerable harm to companies in bankruptcy , their employees , and their creditors . 
whether there currently is or is not sufficient judicial scrutiny of kerps is a valid question , insofar as the overall bankruptcy system allows debtors a fair amount of flexibility in exercising reasonable judgment -- but there must be an approach better than handcuffing the judiciary and stakeholders in bankruptcy cases by essentially precluding all use kerps . 
current law provides bankruptcy judges with the discretion necessary to deny a kerp in such circumstances and bankruptcy judges do deny kerp payments in these circumstances . 
unfortunately , s. 256 , as reported by the committee , goes too far and should be amended so as not to unnecessarily limit the bankruptcy court 's ability to determine what is in the best interest of each individual bankruptcy estate . 
mr. speaker , i rise today in support of the permanent repeal of the death tax . 
mr. speaker , we have before us today a bill that provides a safety net for people who have lost a job , had health problems , or served in the military and can not repay their debts . 
bankruptcy to a small business triggers a change in its bottom line . 
mr. speaker , i rise today in strong support of the rule and the underlying legislation . 
i am proud to be a cosponsor of h.r. 8 and thank the gentleman from missouri for his leadership in offering this bill . 
i was proud to be in this chamber 4 years ago on the day congress began phasing out the death tax . 
bringing back the death tax will drive the final nail in the coffin for america 's next generation of small business owners . 
in the absence of the death tax , these small businesses become a legacy for one generation to pass on to the next . 
the wall street journal wrote in 1999 that 60 percent of small businesses would add jobs if death taxes were not on the books . 
to help owners hire new workers and continue to invest in their business , they need to know that the death tax is gone for good . 
i hope that my colleagues will join me today in supporting the rule and the underlying legislation . 
so if members are fiscal conservatives and are concerned about the cost of this bill on our children and seniors and if members want predictability in the estate tax , this legislation does not give it to us . 
their actions are not fair to the vast majority of americans who work hard to pay their debts in full , and congress should act to limit irresponsible use of our bankruptcy system . 
i have in the past supported reasonable bankruptcy legislation , and although this bill does contain some good provisions , i regret that i can not vote for the bill before the house today . 
in other words , `` one strike , you 're out. '' i am disappointed that we did not add some reasonable flexibility measures to the `` means test. '' the stated purpose of the bill 's means test is to prevent consumers who can afford to repay some of their debts from abusing the system by filing for chapter 7 bankruptcy . 
unfortunately , the bill before us does not offer any relief in these or other tragic circumstances . 
i am disappointed that here in the house , the judiciary committee failed to close a popular loophole used by the very wealthy to shield millions of dollars by setting up asset protection trusts . 
if the majority were truly interested in creating a more fair bankruptcy system for all americans , this would have been included in the bill . 
the judiciary committee also failed to rein in some of the practices of credit card companies that are in part responsible for the rise in bankruptcy filings . 
they refused to provide credit card users with more detailed information to assist them in handling debt . 
the number of senior citizens in bankruptcy tripled from 1992 to 2001 , representing the largest increase of any group of americans . 
an amendment in the other body that would have required companies that dropped retiree health benefits to reimburse each affected retiree for 18 months of cobra coverage upon reemerging from bankruptcy was defeated . 
we know the result , which is that many end up with much more severe conditions and many wind up in nursing homes . 
in the last few years , the ways and means committee has held fifteen hearings on a bill to reduce social security number theft , and last year , we reported out a responsible bipartisan bill , but it was not brought to the floor . 
mr. speaker , i rise today in strong support of s. 256 , the bankruptcy abuse and consumer prevention act . 
mr. speaker , we have seen a sharp increase in bankruptcies in the past 25 years . 
in 2003 , consumer filings peaked at over 1.6 million filings , a 465 percent increase from 1980 . 
these costs will be shifted to american families who are paying the price for this debt , some studies reflect $ 400 per year in every household , by higher interest rates on their credit cards , auto loans , school loans and mortgages . 
in an effort to better educate consumers and improve financial literacy , the legislation requires many filers of bankruptcy to attend financial counseling . 
this change coupled with congressional encouragement for schools to incorporate personal finance curricula in elementary and secondary education programs are both useful methods of curbing future debt . 
mr. speaker , i am submitting for the record the following remarks from mr. arkadi kuhlmann , ceo of ing direct , in opposition to the bankruptcy reform legislation under consideration . 
statement of arkadi kuhlmann , ceo , ing direct mr. speaker , i am arkadi kuhlmann , ceo of ing direct , a federally chartered thrift headquartered in wilmington , delaware . 
ing direct launched in the u.s. in september 2000 to challenge traditional banking by touting the high interest , no fee and no minimum orange savings account as its signature product , with a brand vision to lead americans back to saving . 
with over 2.5 million customers and more than $ 43 billion in assets , ing direct is the fourth largest thrift in the u.s. the house is now considering consumer bankruptcy legislation that would make major changes to how consumers ' debts and obligations are treated in the bankruptcy process . 
one significant oversight is the bill 's failure to consider one of the biggest problems we face in business today : identity theft . 
the washington post ran a story recently about a woman whose identity was stolen , yet her credit card company forced the fraudster 's debt on her by using the arbitration clause in her card agreement . 
in addition to overlooking the problem of identity theft , this proposal had additional shortcomings . 
mr. speaker , i rise today in strong support of s. 256 , the `` bankruptcy abuse and consumer prevention act of 2005. '' it has been seven years since we made our first attempt to reform the bankruptcy system in the 105th congress and thanks to the tireless efforts of chairman sensenbrenner 's committee , we can see a real chance for passing a full and comprehensive bill this year . 
mr. speaker , we have seen a sharp increase in bankruptcies over the past 25 years . 
in 2003 , consumer filings peaked at over 1.6 million filings -- a 465 percent increase from 1980 . 
american families are paying the price for this debt -- some studies reflect $ 400 per year in every household -- by higher interest rates on their credit cards , auto loans , school loans and mortgages . 
in an effort to better educate consumers and improve financial literacy , the legislation requires many filers of bankruptcy to attend financial counseling . 
this change , coupled with congressional encouragement for schools to incorporate personal finance curricula in elementary and secondary education programs , are both useful methods of curbing future debt . 
this increase is long overdue , as the bankruptcy caseloads in delaware continue to exceed other districts ' caseloads for chapter 11 businesses cases . 
last year alone , weighted filings for delaware judges were 11 , 789 , while the national average was 1 , 763 -- in other words , the delaware caseload was 10 times the national average . 
mr. speaker , i rise in strong support for this long overdue legislation . 
i want to thank the chairman of the committee on the judiciary , the gentleman from wisconsin ( mr. sensenbrenner ) xz4003650 , for his leadership and his efforts in making this bill a reality . 
in 1915 the supreme court wrote that our bankruptcy laws were intended to give honest debtors a chance to `` start afresh , free from obligations and responsibilities consequent upon business misfortunes. '' this view was later reaffirmed in the 1934 case , local loan company v. hunt , in which the court wrote that `` the purpose of the act has been again and again emphasized by the courts in that it gives to the honest but unfortunate debtor a new opportunity in life and a clear field for future effort , unhampered by the pressure and discouragement of preexisting debt. '' over the last several decades , bankruptcy protections have expanded to cover basically anyone and everyone , not just those who truly need it . 
statistics reveal that in 2004 approximately 1.5 million individuals sought bankruptcy protection . 
it requires those who have the means to repay debts to do so while protecting those who truly need the assistance provided by chapter 7 , such as those with serious medical conditions , the men and women of our armed services who are on active duty , as well as those disabled veterans who served in years past . 
mr. speaker , this is the most special interest-vested bill that i have ever dealt with in my career in congress . 
it massively tilts the playing field in favor of banks and credit card companies and against working people and their families . 
they hang around the bases and lure them in . 
please , if we do not do anything else in the 109th congress , let us not let this bill get out of the house of representatives . 
this is an 8-year-old bill , and the gentleman has been foremost in this process for all of those years . 
we should all be embarrassed that instead of repealing the biggest loophole in the bankruptcy code , we have had 8 years to study it , the homestead exemption , the bill places only weak obstacles in its path . 
by passing this measure in this form , the majority is telling the american people , republicans are telling the american people , it is more important to help credit card companies than innocent spouses and children ; that it is more important to protect corporate scam artists than workers losing their pension ; that it is more important to protect unscrupulous lenders than disabled veterans . 
mr. speaker , i rise in support of this rule and the bill authored by the gentleman from missouri ( mr. hulshof ) xz4001900 and commend him for his great work on behalf of america 's job creators . 
i just heard the democratic member say that only a tiny fraction of the people who die in america and their families have to pay this death tax . 
even though we deal with it year in and year out , we still can not figure it out . 
the only people who will actually be hurt by the burden of these new complex rules and laws will be people who we do not want to pay the tax in the first place . 
if at the time that one of one 's loved ones dies , just to file the return , not pay the tax , they are going to have to plow through all of these helpful instructions that are in such small print that even a high school student might need reading glasses to get through some of these 40 pages . 
but here is the kind of helpful thing one will find when a loved one dies : `` generally , you may list on schedule m all property interests that pass from the decedent to the surviving spouse and are included in the gross estate . 
we are trying to eliminate the complexity of this law which hurts every single person who works for a small business in america . 
when that small business is liquidated in order to pay the death tax because it is a tax on property of small businesses , people lose their jobs , and that is where the burden and the incidence of this tax falls . 
if his amendment got rid of any aspect of carryover basis in death tax i would vote for it . 
and as the gentleman from north dakota just mentioned , we do not have a carryover basis in its entirety . 
we have simply a step up in basis for both the spouse and for the children . 
now you have to ask yourself , in advance of your death , do you know what the assets and inventory of your business is going to be 10 years , 20 years , 30 years down the road ? 
you are going to have to do that tax compliance year in and year out . 
tax compliance , the cost of actual accountants and lawyers and life insurance and all the other things that you have to do to deal with the death tax year in and year out is $ 20 billion a year . 
it is a drag on economic growth , and it is the greatest disincentive to invest additional capital in family businesses in america . 
this is the most complex part of one of the most complex tax systems in the world , and it is time to drive a stake through its heart . 
and that is why we must vote against this amendment and in favor of the total repeal of the death tax . 
and it is if you or i had it in our pocket . 
and if you are trying to employ some people , you have 10 , 11 , 12 people that work for that business , what are you going to say to them when they lose their jobs because the family business has to be liquidated on the death of the entrepreneur in order to come up with the actual cash to pay for it ? 
the irs is not going to accept shares of stock in the family business in payment of the death tax . 
they are going to say , go sell those shares , go liquidate the business , go sell the assets in order to pay off the tax plan . 
mr. speaker , i think a number of important points have been made today , but i rise today in strong support of this bill and in opposition to the estate tax . 
i know the gentleman 's predecessor jennifer dunn and i and a number of people from this side of the aisle had worked hard together to look for a commonsense way that we could end this burden which , in my opinion , is an extreme burden on the small business community and on the farm community . 
in north alabama where i come from , we have some of the most productive farm families of any district in the country . 
for generations , they have struggled and used tax lawyers and tax strategies to try to find a way to effectively pass that farm on to the next generation that we want to continue engaging in that farm business . 
in 2001 , we did a good step , not a great step but a good step . 
according to the congressional research service , estates that included farm or business assets represented 42.5 percent of the 30 , 000 plus taxable estate tax returns filed in 2003 . 
in this day and time , assets are accumulated in a different way than they were 20 years ago , 25 years ago , 30 years ago or even more than that . 
it would remove critical automatic stay provisions that currently prevent the eviction of those who are seeking to clear arrearages in their rent . 
bankruptcy is intended to provide a `fresh start ' to those who file -- not leave them sinking in financial quicksand . 
the sponsors of s. 256 claim that the rising number of people filing bankruptcies in our nation is evidence that there is widespread abuse of our current bankruptcy protections . 
actually , the rise in bankruptcy filings is a powerful and tragic reminder that our administration 's economic policies are not raising living standards but are instead contributing to the increases in bankruptcy filings . 
i note that bankruptcy filings actually decreased in 2004 . 
in the economic report of the president delivered to congress in february of this year , the administration wrote that the `` president 's policies are designed to foster rising living standards at home , while encouraging other nations to follow our lead. '' the president 's policies are not worthy of emulation in other nations -- and they are not worthy of continuation in our nation . 
job creation in our nation is failing to keep pace with the growth in the labor force . 
the brookings institution has noted that since the year 2000 , there has been a 2 percent decrease in workforce participation among young people aged 25-34 , which is unprecedented since world war ii . 
perhaps not surprisingly , the congressional research service found that in 2001 , 27 percent of families in the lowest one-fifth of household income distributions had debt obligations that exceeded 40 percent of their incomes . 
while workers are not seeing increases in their purchasing power , they are also being left without health insurance to cover their medical expenses . 
forty-five million americans are now uninsured -- and countless millions more regularly experience lapses in coverage . 
more than 38 percent of those who filed bankruptcy for medical reasons were found to have experienced some type of lapse in their insurance coverage during the two years preceding their filing . 
in fact , 90 percent of the bankruptcies filed are by those who have been injured , are sick , have been laid off , and/or are going through a divorce . 
all the while , credit card company abuses are mounting in the form of deceptive marketing practices , irresponsible accounting practices and other predatory practices . 
the minute a tragedy strikes and a debtor falls behind in one payment , debtors are often swarmed upon by all of their credit card companies -- who want to collect immediately . 
and now , congress is poised to add insult to uninsured injury by destroying the basic protections that our bankruptcy laws have offered to those most in need . 
mr. speaker , the increase in personal bankruptcy filings in our nation is not proof that our bankruptcy laws need reform . 
mr. speaker , i rise today in strong support of the pomeroy substitute to house resolution 8. and i argue that anyone in this body who is currently concerned about our ballooning national debt should vote in favor of the substitute . 
it is clear from the debate today that the majority of members in this body believe that our farmers and small businessmen and -women need relief from the estate tax , and i will do all i can to ensure that these hardworking americans get their due tax relief . 
in my opinion , the pomeroy substitute does this by increasing the estate tax exemption level in 2006 by $ 3 million for individuals and $ 6 million for couples . 
additionally , from 2009 forward , the tax exemption level would be $ 3.5 & lt ; center & gt ; & lt ; pre & gt ; [ page : h1939 ] & lt ; /pre & gt ; & lt ; /center & gt ; i know my friends on the other side of the aisle desperately want to make sure that the paris hiltons of america are fully covered , but they have done pretty good the last 100 years ; and i am sure under the pomeroy bill in the future they will continue to do pretty good . 
it is important to the president , and it is important to many of us in congress . 
i will do all that i need to do in order to support estate tax relief for farmers and small business owners in my district . 
you had a chance in 2002 to increase the benefits by giving the tax relief to the estates of all americans . 
in addition to that , be rest assured , if you are a consumer , you will not benefit one penny from this bill . 
the american people are the losers here , unless you happen to be a senior executive of a credit card company or an investor in credit card companies , because they are going to make a good score here today , but the american taxpayer is going to pay for it . 
the bill is nothing more than a public subsidy for one of the most profitable businesses in our economy . 
loan sharking used to be a crime in this country . 
mr. speaker , to listen to this majority , we have a crisis in this country -- one brought on by spendthrifts defrauding the public via our bankruptcy system . 
last year , more than a million-and-a-half families resorted to declaring bankruptcy -- a full half of which occurred not because of any irresponsible behavior but because of unexpected medical expenses brought on by an illness or death in the family . 
these families -- widows and widowers , mothers and fathers , many in the middle-class -- are hardly `` gaming the system '' -- they are doing the best they can under unbelievable circumstances that have left them with no choice but to resort to the only recourse they have : filing bankruptcy , wiping their debt and trying their best to start anew . 
and as with previous incarnations of this legislation , there is virtually nothing in the bill that would require creditors to curb their outrageous predatory lending practices that mislead even the most educated consumers into debt . 
this bill is especially bad for women , who are the single largest group currently in bankruptcy . 
it appeals to the worst in all of us , painting honest middle-class families who are working hard and taking personal responsibility for their actions as liars , cheaters and spendthrifts . 
at the same time it lets off the hook those who do act irresponsibly by preserving loopholes which allow wealthy bankruptcy filers to hide their true wealth in mansions and trust funds . 
mr. speaker , i rise in opposition to this latest republican assault on social security and on fiscal sanity . 
at a time of apparently unending war and the largest budget deficits in american history , our republican colleagues are intent on solving a crisis that does not exist . 
today , what they propose is to borrow from the social security trust fund and to borrow from the medicare trust fund in order to give more tax breaks to the richest one-tenth of 1 percent of the people in this country . 
that is borrowing from social security for purposes that have nothing to do with the social security system because they think some rich folks in this country do not have wallets that are fat enough . 
there is another democratic substitute coming out today that is going to exempt 99.7 percent of all estates from this tax , and only cover the richest .3 percent of the wealthiest estates in this country . 
that means you are not going to have a small business in east austin or west mcallen or a family farm in karnes county that is covered if they are even covered now , which the vast majority of them are not . 
they keep talking about the guy in the pickup who is working extra hours to try to make ends meet . 
social security is not in crisis today , nor is medicare , but if you keep passing bills that drain $ 750 billion from the treasury at the very time more people are retiring , you will have a crisis . 
mr. speaker , i rise in opposition to h.r. 8 , which continues , in my view , the policies by the majority of three tax cuts , in 4 years , with four straight record-breaking deficits that have added $ 2 trillion in 4 years to the nation 's debt . 
and here again the majority offers $ 850 billion of tax cuts to the wealthiest families in this country . 
when you get in a hole that is $ 2 trillion deep , rule one , stop digging . 
if you can not figure that out , you can not produce any more when it comes to economic growth for this country or jobs or resolving the health care crisis or the educational crisis we have in the country . 
just 2 weeks ago there was a report out by the irs and others showing that $ 350 billion a year goes unreported in taxes where people are not complying and cheating . 
that is where we should be focusing , on simplifying the code and taking away the incentive to cheat , which is what we have today in our code . 
with all the economic challenges we are facing today in the area of health care , energy , education , eliminating the estate tax , fully eliminating , should be the last of our priorities . 
that is a true deficit we have in this country , a retirement and savings deficit . 
as late former supreme court justice louis brandeis once said , `` we can have democracy in this country or we can have great wealth concentrated in the hands of a few , but we can not have both. '' mr. speaker , there is no doubt which one this bill will achieve . 
throughout my service in the u.s. house , i have been a strong supporter of estate tax relief for family farmers and small business owners . 
the unfortunate reality of our situation is that we have witnessed the most dramatic fiscal reversal in our nation 's history . 
our budget surpluses have been frittered away , and our nation is now drowning in red ink with ever- growing budget deficits and increasing federal debt . 
this substitute provides an estate tax exemption of $ 3 million for individuals and $ 6 million for couples beginning in 2006 , and the exemption would increase to $ 3.5 million and $ 7 million respectively in 2009 . 
mr. speaker i rise in strong opposition to the misnamed `` bankruptcy abuse prevention and consumer protection act , '' ( s. 256 ) . 
it hurts middle-class consumers in a variety of ways : the bill would allow landlords to evict battered women without bankruptcy court approval , even if the eviction poses a threat to the women 's physical well-being ; and , it permits credit card companies to reclaim common households goods which are of little value to them , but very important to the debtor 's family . 
in my judgment , it is a grave mistake to punish these individuals while rewarding credit card companies and business lobbyists at a time when corporate greed has already destroyed the lives of millions of american workers . 
i will support a balanced bankruptcy reform bill , but s. 256 is in no way balanced and i believe does more harm than good , therefore i strongly oppose this bill . 
taxes have already been paid , and every bit of profit that they might make in a year is taxed as well . 
currently , the repeal of the death tax is set to expire in 2010 ; and , mr. speaker , i can not understand how anyone would allow the federal government to hand a grieving family in 2011 a bill for the death of their loved one . 
many of our smaller manufacturers have had to sell out to larger manufacturers ; and as a result , we have double-digit unemployment in a number of jurisdictions that used to be the home to small manufacturers . 
a factor in their selling out was the federal death tax because they would not have the cash to pay when death knocked on the door . 
if we pass this bill , we will help the job situation in those types of jurisdictions in the united states . 
let me tell the members under the current law the really rich in this country trust and foundation themselves out of the federal estate tax . 
he has got a father that is in charge of his foundation . 
and i predict that if we pass this bill , the incentive to set up those trusts and foundations that avoid taxes will not be there and in the long run the treasury of the united states will benefit because we will still get the capital gains tax when the assets are sold . 
in addition , the bill allows more family farmers to qualify for chapter 12 relief by doubling the debt limit and lowering the percentage of income that must be derived from farming operations . 
in addition , s. 256 prevents fraud . 
they are passed along in higher charges and rates to hard working people . 
mr. speaker , i rise in strong support of the `` bankruptcy abuse prevention and consumer protection act of 2005. '' bankruptcy filings are at an all time high . 
in addition , the bill allows more family farmers to qualify for chapter 12 relief by doubling the debt limit and lowering the percentage of income that must be derived from farming operations . 
in addition , s. 256 prevents fraud . 
what these people may not realize or care about is that these debts do not just disappear -- they are passed along in higher chargers and rates to hard-working folks who pay their bills on time . 
s. 256 ends this fraudulent practice by requiring bankruptcy filers to pay back nondischargable debts made in the period immediately preceding their filing . 
for example , this legislation helps children by strengthening the protections in the law that prioritize child support and alimony payments . 
in addition , it protects consumers from `` bankruptcy mills '' that encourage people to file for bankruptcy without fully informing them of their rights and the potential harms that bankruptcy can cause . 
specifically , this legislation restores fairness and equity to the relationship between the u.s. trustee and private standing bankruptcy trustees by providing that in certain circumstances , after an administrative hearing on the record , private trustees may seek judicial review of u.s. trustee actions related to trustee removal . 
mr speaker , i rise today in opposition to this bill . 
this bill will weaken homestead protections currently in place under state laws , hurting my constituents , the citizens of texas , and the citizens of any other states that have laws protecting individuals ' homes valued over $ 125 , 000 , which is the limit this bill sets . 
texas , which has the longest and oldest history of homestead protection laws in our country , has no cap on homestead protection , along with kansas , iowa , florida , and south dakota . 
the median resale price of a home in california is $ 215 , 000 . 
in nebraska it 's $ 70 , 200 . 
while i understand there must be a sensible cap on exemptible home equity to ensure the law is not protecting million dollar mansions , $ 125 , 000 is unreasonable given the skyrocketing price of real estate in texas and many other parts of the country . 
mr. speaker , i rise in support of h.r. 8 , which will finally free america 's hard-working farmers and small business owners from the specter of the death tax . 
benjamin franklin said : `` in this world nothing is certain but death and taxes , '' but i doubt even the inventive mr. franklin imagined the taxation of death itself . 
all of this wasted money , energy and over 100 , 000 jobs lost per year and for what , a tax that the joint economic committee says costs just as much to collect as it generates in revenue . 
it hurts the people it is intended to help , and it reduces stock in our economy by $ 497 billion a year . 
i urge my colleagues to drive the final nail in this coffin so 6 years from now americans will not wake up to find that , like a vampire , this unfair tax has arisen from the dead to once again suck the blood from a lifetime of hard work and sacrifice . 
many of our small family businesses are wrapped up in a loved one 's estate . 
and we all know they 're the real job creators in our economy . 
the rule provides for consideration of the amendment in the nature of a substitute printed in the committee on rules report accompanying the resolution , if offered , by the gentleman from north dakota ( mr. pomeroy ) xz4003230 or his designee , which shall be considered as read and shall be separately debatable for 1 hour equally divided and controlled by the proponent and an opponent . 
finally , mr. speaker , the rule waives all points of order against the amendment printed in the report and provides one motion to recommit with or without instructions . 
i commend the gentleman from missouri ( mr. hulshof ) xz4001900 for championing an end to the death tax , as my former friend and colleague , jennifer dunn , did while serving in congress . 
through jennifer 's tireless efforts , in 2001 congress acted in a bipartisan fashion to gradually phase out the death tax and fully eliminate it in 2010 . 
however , if congress does not extend the death tax repeal beyond 2010 , in 2011 small business owners and family farmers will once again be assessed the full death tax at the maximum 2001 rate . 
the last thing families in central washington and across the nation should have to worry about when a loved one dies is losing the family farm or business in order to pay the internal revenue service . 
mr. speaker , i yield myself such time as i may consume to remind my colleagues that the rule that we are debating here to talk about the repeal of the death tax makes in order the substance of the subject that the gentleman from massachusetts talked about , the pomeroy substitute . 
in the 106th congress , on a bipartisan basis , with 279 votes in favor , this body voted in favor of permanently eliminating the death tax . 
in the 107th congress , again on a bipartisan basis , the house voted to eliminate the death tax permanently . 
unfortunately , in the reconciliation of trying to put the differences between the two houses together , we put the date of the 2011 when that would expire . 
in the last congress , once again the house addressed this issue and voted to permanently eliminate this death tax . 
the bill that we will address when we pass this rule is exactly the same as the bill that we passed on a bipartisan basis in the last congress . 
2. notwithstanding any other provision of this resolution , the amendment made in order under the first section of this resolution shall be modified by adding at the end the following new section : section __ . 
transfers to social security. & lt ; p & gt ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; ( a ) findings. -- congress hereby finds that -- & lt ; p & gt ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; ( 1 ) permanent repeal of the estate tax will cost $ 290 billion over the 10-year budget window , & lt ; p & gt ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; ( 2 ) this $ 290 billion understates the long-term cost of repeal -- in the last year of the budget window repeal of the estate tax will cost $ 70 billion , & lt ; p & gt ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; ( 3 ) in the next decade , the cost of repealing the estate tax together with the increased interest cost to the united states would be substantially above $ 1 trillion , & lt ; p & gt ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; ( 4 ) the enormous cost of repealing the estate tax would only benefit the wealthiest 0.3 percent of all families in the united states , & lt ; p & gt ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; ( 5 ) permanent repeal of the estate tax would result in a substantial reduction in income tax receipts , and could result in lower receipts in the social security trust funds because of that tax avoidance , & lt ; p & gt ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; ( 6 ) the provisions of this act would prevent the reduction in social security receipts that could result from permanent repeal and it would preserve funds necessary to meet commitments made to the social security system or other programs , & lt ; p & gt ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; ( 7 ) the provisions of this act provide immediate and substantial estate tax relief , exempting 99.7 percent of all estates from the estate tax , & lt ; p & gt ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; ( 8 ) the united states is faced with many other fiscal challenges , including the requirement to meet the commitments made through the social security system , and & lt ; p & gt ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; ( 9 ) the amounts saved by enacting this act as compared to permanent repeal -- & lt ; p & gt ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; ( a ) in the long run on an annual basis would equal the current costs of the operations in iraq , & lt ; p & gt ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; ( b ) could be used for improvements in veterans benefits , and & lt ; p & gt ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; ( c ) would close half of the shortfall faced by the social security system. & lt ; p & gt ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; ( b ) transfers to social security. -- section 201 of the social security act ( 42 u.s.c . 
401 ) is amended by adding at the end the following new subsection : & lt ; p & gt ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; `` ( o ) for purposes of ensuring that amounts are available to meet the commitments of the social security system , the secretary of the treasury shall , from time to time , transfer from the general fund in the treasury to the federal old-age and survivors insurance trust fund , the savings from the enactment of the certain and immediate estate tax relief act of 2005 as compared to the permanent repeal of the estate tax by the bill h.r. 8 ( as introduced in the 109th congress ) as follows : & lt ; p & gt ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; `` ( 1 ) for fiscal years 2010-2015 , the transfers in each year shall total for each fiscal year specified in the following table , the amount specified in connection with such fiscal year , as follows : & lt ; p & gt ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; amount & lt ; p & gt ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; `` fiscal year : & lt ; p & gt ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; transferred : & lt ; center & gt ; 2010 & lt ; /center & gt ; $ 6.1 billion & lt ; center & gt ; 3011 & lt ; /center & gt ; $ 35.4 billion & lt ; center & gt ; 2012 & lt ; /center & gt ; $ 39.4 billion & lt ; center & gt ; 2013 & lt ; /center & gt ; $ 42.7 billion & lt ; center & gt ; 2014 & lt ; /center & gt ; $ 47.9 billion & lt ; center & gt ; 2015 & lt ; /center & gt ; $ 50.5 billion . 
`` ( 2 ) for fiscal years beginning after september 30 , 2015 , the transfers in each year shall total the amount the secretary of the treasury determines to be the savings from the enactment of such act as compared to such permanent repeal of the estate tax. '' . & lt ; p & gt ; mr. speaker , i yield back the balance of my time , and i move the previous question on the resolution . 
mr. speaker , i rise today as a cosponsor of h.r. 8 and in support of this rule . 
and those that do , the government can step in and take over half of what they worked their entire life to build . 
recently , i spoke to a rancher in my district who has worked hard nearly 30 years building up a cattle ranch operation . 
but with sadness in his voice he told me , you know what , congressman ? 
and it is not fair that the federal government can step in and automatically inherit 55 percent of the family farm , a family business or a family nest egg . 
mr. speaker , i rise in strong support of legislation to bury the destructive death tax once and for all ; and i might mention that my personal experiences , even with my own family and others , has been just the opposite of the gentleman who just spoke before . 
nearly everywhere i go throughout my largely rural , agricultural district in northern california , i hear from businessmen and businesswomen and many farmers and ranchers who have had to liquidate and sell a family business or farm just to pay the federal estate tax . 
four years ago , i joined with president bush and a majority of representatives and senators in an effort to enact into law historic tax relief legislation , including repeal of the death tax . 
consider that the heirs of those who pass away in 2010 will face no death tax whatsoever , while those whose families are unfortunate enough to pass away in 2011 or thereafter will face tax rates of up to 55 percent on their assets , forcing many of them to have to sell . 
studies have found that family businesses spend up to $ 125 , 000 on attorneys , accountants and financial experts to assist in estate planning . 
mr. speaker , i favor cutting unnecessary , ineffective or unfair taxes , but in balanced and fiscally responsible ways . 
i have been one of the few democrats in congress who has been willing to cross party lines to vote for tax cuts . 
i have voted to eliminate the estate tax in the past . 
with a war in iraq and looming postwar costs , increased expenses for domestic security and a ballooning budget deficit , congress must exercise restraint on both revenues and spending to prevent fiscal policy from spiraling out of control . 
the consensus in favor of balancing the budget over the long term must be re-established . 
add in the interest costs of borrowing the funds to pay for this measure , and the true 10-year cost is nearly $ 1.3 trillion . 
the substitute increases the estate tax credit to $ 3 million , $ 6 million for married couples , beginning in 2006 . 
under the substitute , the credit would be increased to $ 3.5 million , $ 7 million for couples , in 2009 . 
mr. speaker , today the national debt is the largest in history . 
here we have another tax cut that is not being paid for , even as the bush administration and the leadership of this congress spend more than the american government has ever spent on homeland security and on all the other expenses of running the government -- especially the huge costs of the war in , and occupation of , iraq . 
moreover , these deep deficits threaten to increase interest rates in the future -- making it harder for americans to buy homes and afford higher education and making it harder for businesses to raise capital . 
i urge my colleagues to join me in supporting permanent reform of the estate tax , but not irresponsibly repealing it . 
in fact , the bill before us today overly penalizes working families . 
in fact , the bill before us today takes no action against reckless and predatory lending . 
in 2001 , 1 , 398 , 864 people filed for bankruptcy in the united states . 
according to the center for american progress , in 2003 there were a record number of 5.5 personal bankruptcy filings for every 1 , 000 people living in the united states . 
in 2003 , my own state of new jersey ranked slightly below the national average at 4.8 filings per every 1 , 000 residents . 
in my own state of new jersey , citizens have seen a similar increase in bankruptcy filing over the past three years . 
with those facts in mind , i strongly support the principle of increased personal responsibility of debt . 
while the bill purports to elevate the priority of child support payments , in reality credit card companies would receive repayment of debt at the same rate as child support obligations . 
the provision in the bill dealing with `` asset protection trusts '' also does not adequately address the problem of wealthy individuals stashing millions away the bill also imposes artificial deadlines and cumbersome new paperwork requirements on small businesses trying to reorganize , and it unnecessarily limits the discretion of bankruptcy judges in crafting the best possible result for small-business debtors and creditors . 
in fact , it is estimated that the credit card industry mails out five billion unsolicited credit card offers a year . 
mr. speaker , i rise in opposition to h.r. 8 , legislation that unwisely imperils our nation 's financial security in order to advance the interests of an elite few . 
estate tax reform is extremely important for all the people in the 15th district of california . 
in keeping with this spirit , i intend to support a democratic alternative to h.r. 8 that will benefit almost all americans . 
offered by representative earl pomeroy , the democratic substitute will increase the estate tax exemption to $ 3 million for individuals and $ 6 million for married couples effective january 1 , 2006 with a scheduled increase in 2009 . 
once fully in effect , h.r. 8 will cost $ 1 trillion over 10 years . 
current income tax law provides for a `` step-up '' in the basis of an inherited asset to its fair market value at the time of decedent 's death . 
h.r. 8 repeals the step-up basis and substitutes carryover basis rules in which the capital gain would be measured by the difference between heir 's selling price and the asset 's cost at the time when the decedent acquired it . 
the legislation before us today is an indefensible gift to the credit card industry , and i urge my colleagues to join me in voting against it . 
another 40 percent have been driven into bankruptcy , at least in part , after suffering a job loss , divorce , or death in the family . 
in a final insult , the republican leadership denied the opportunity for democrats to offer amendments that would have protected veterans and other vulnerable communities . 
the bill does nothing to reign in credit card companies that engage in reckless lending , and it allows wealthy debtors in five states to declare bankruptcy and keep their multimillion-dollar homes without penalty . 
mr. speaker , i was very interested in the last presentation . 
for years , house republicans have proclaimed that the elimination of the inheritance tax , a tax , now hear me on this side of the aisle , i know you want to hear this , a tax first proposed by theodore roosevelt in 1906 . 
but , today , not according to the gentleman from maryland ( mr. hoyer ) xz4001890 , not according to the gentleman from north dakota ( mr. pomeroy ) xz4003230 , not according to all the democrats in this house or in the senate , according to the republican department of agriculture , i tell my friend from missouri , the republican department of agriculture says more farm estates would have increased tax liability from the carryover basis rules in this bill than would benefit from repeal of the inheritance tax . 
in other words , if we pass this bill , family farmers and small businesses are going to pay more taxes . 
that means that 99.7 percent of the people in america would never pay an estate tax . 
so this argument , i tell my friend from missouri , is about the three-tenths of 1 percent of the very largest estates in america . 
now we are pretty well off in congress . 
mr. speaker , under current law , the joint economic committee estimates that only 7 , 500 estates , in a nation of 290 million people where some 3 million people die every year , 7 , 500 estates out of the 3 million people that die would have any estate tax liability in 2009 . 
there are a lot of taxes on all of us , and we have a lot of services in this country . 
we borrowed $ 118 billion last february , from foreigners mostly , which we are putting our kids deeply in hock to china , to japan , to germany . 
in sharp contrast , i tell my friend from missouri , and i wish there were more people on this floor , but it is only giving away , you know , $ 250 billion to $ 1 trillion . 
three-tenths of the estates would be left in 2009 and , as a result , exempt 99.7 percent of all estates from estate tax liability . 
on behalf of the lead democratic sponsor , my colleague , the gentleman from alabama ( mr. cramer ) xz4000840 , as well as the over 200 bipartisan members who have co-sponsored this bill , i am pleased that we are poised to pass in this body this commonsense legislation . 
i would like to talk about a couple of constituents , particularly a constituent named howard effert who is a resident of columbia , missouri , who in 1965 began a lumber yard business there in columbia . 
of course , they want this family business that has been in their family since its modest beginnings in 1965 to be able to be passed on pursuant to the american dream , that is , to create a legacy , to help your children be better off than you were . 
in 2001 we passed historic legislation that let all income tax payers keep a little bit more of what they earned , and this historic legislation included a repeal of the federal death tax which was a top tax priority for a lot of small business and family farm groups . 
currently it is $ 1.5 million shielded from this very confiscatory tax , and at the same time we chip away at that top rate , which was as high as 55 percent , and in fact , in a few isolated instances as high as 60 percent tax . 
as things now stand , it will rise from the grave in 2011 , and it will revert to its form prior to 2001 . 
now , this quirk in the law can be directly attributed to the senate 's byrd rule , which applies to the consideration of reconciliation bills . 
and if it was good policy when we enacted it in 2001 , it remains a good idea today . 
conversely , the tax forces taxpayers to engage in a host of economically inefficient activities to avoid the very punitive nature of the tax . 
with a tax like the death tax , a family business or farm has no choice but to divert these precious resources , as in the case of the effert family , to plan financially for the financial impact for the tax : money that could be used to expand the business , to purchase a forklift , to bring another person on the payroll , whatever is in the best interest of that business . 
instead , this money is diverted in anticipation of this very punitive tax . 
for that and for a variety of reasons , we will have the opportunity , i hope , in a good debate , in a civil discourse . 
the bill , h.r. 8 , actually does allow for a step up in basis of $ 3 million for a surviving spouse and another $ 1.3 million for surviving heirs . 
mr. speaker , i appreciate in large measure the tone of the debate . 
what i would say to the gentlewoman who just spoke and to others who raised the red herring of social security is to remind folks , first of all , the federal receipts from the federal death tax represent less than 1.5 percent of all revenues , first of all ; and , secondly , that none of the income tax money generated from the estate tax goes to social security for the trust funds , and eliminating the tax in no way will affect or impact current social security benefits . 
in fact , i think one gentleman said something , from massachusetts , about we need to pay our fair share . 
well , then let me tell you a very quick personal story , a story of a farm family in missouri , a young married couple who in 1956 left portageville , missouri , in the district of the gentlewoman from missouri ( mrs. emerson ) xz4001210 , with $ 1 , 000 in their pocket , and that was going to be the stake that they had . 
that married couple happened to be my parents , and over the last 2 1/2 years i have had the unfortunate reality that obviously death is inevitable , and i have had the unfortunate experience in our family of having both my father pass away in late 2002 and my mother one year ago . 
i do not mind sharing with you , a 514 acre farm , a modest life insurance policy , the house that i grew up in , a combine , three tractors and some irrigation equipment , and that is it . 
and i am sitting across the mahogany desk from our long-time family accountant with the adding machine with a tape on it , and he is plugging in an arbitrary value for these assets that my parents invested their soul into . 
and i am breaking out into a cold sweat wondering whether or not this business that they built and wanted to pass on is going to fall above an arbitrary line or below an arbitrary line that we in congress have set . 
mr. speaker , i claim the time in opposition . 
and let us hope and pray that as permanent repeal occurs , if it occurs , in the outyears that we will not be in that war on terrorism . 
in essence , the letter reads as follows : the groups listed below support permanent estate tax repeal , ask for this body to vote for h.r. 8 , and the letter goes on to say , individuals and families own virtually all of the farms and ranches that dot america 's rural landscape . 
in 2001 , congress recognized the harm that death taxes cause family businesses and voted to repeal this onerous tax . 
sincerely , mr. speaker , to my friend from south carolina , i am not sure if any of those groups happen to represent farm families in his district , but i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from south carolina ( mr. barrett ) xz4000160 . 
so i will mention some of these folks who have come and testified in front of the committee on ways and means . 
martin whalen testified about his family-owned and -operated company , etline foods corporation , a distributor of food service products in york , pennsylvania . 
when they purchased the business , 48 employees ; in 1997 , 105 employees . 
his father farmed until his father 's death in 1993 . 
several parcels of land in south dakota were liquidated in order to pay the federal tax . 
what about roger hannay of hannay reels , incorporated , a small manufacturer in the foothills of the catskill mountains about 25 miles from albany , new york , a small manufacturer employing 150 employees ? 
what about richard forrestal , jr. , a principal in cold spring construction , a firm specializing in highway and bridge construction ? 
what about carol loop , jr. , president of luke 's nursery and greenhouses , a wholesale plant nursery operation in jacksonville , florida ? 
or christopher and kimberly clements of golden eagle distributors in tucson , arizona . 
what about robert sakata , a vegetable farmer from brighton , colorado , or jean stinson , a railroad track manufacturing company in barto , florida , running the r. w. summers railroad contractors ? 
their family had to shut down a facility in north carolina , laying off two-thirds of the 110 employees to pay the estate tax . 
or jack cakebread , founder of cakebread cellars in napa valley , california . 
it is a rhetorical question , and the gentleman from north dakota ( mr. pomeroy ) xz4003230 knows it , and i do not mean to put him on the spot , but he can not answer the question because when we draw a line , an arbitrary line , wherever we draw that line , we still are going to have those entrepreneurs that have been willing to invest in their businesses , hire employees , build local communities ; and as long as the death tax remains in existence , they are going to have to do some sort of estate planning . 
as the gentleman from north dakota recognizes ; and , again , i do not think he meant to misspeak , but the underlying bill , h.r. 8 , does provide a step up in basis of $ 3 million for the surviving spouse and a $ 1.3 million step up in basis for surviving heirs . 
mr. speaker , notwithstanding the gentleman 's props , i would commend to him for his reading leisurely `` the economics of the estate tax : an update , '' a joint economic committee study dated june 2003 which in essence states the estate tax raises very little , if any , net revenue because of distortionary effects of the estate resulting in income tax losses roughly the same size as the revenue collected . 
growing up on a family farm in eastern washington , i have seen firsthand the negative impacts the death tax has on our families and our businesses . 
one of my top priorities in congress is to grow jobs and expand the economy in the pacific northwest . 
i believe that the repeal of the death tax will help accomplish this goal , especially for the farmers and small businesses in my district . 
without a doubt , death taxes hurt our farmers and our ranchers by forcing family farms to sell land , buildings or equipment needed to operate their business in order to pay for this excessive tax . 
i support the passage of h.r. 8 in order to end this unjust , unfair , and inefficient tax burden on our families , businesses and especially our farming communities . 
let me first say , mr. speaker , how much i appreciate my friend from north dakota as we have done this in a number of sessions of congress , and i appreciate the tone , and he is a friend of mine , and i have a lot of respect for him and the intent with which he comes to this debate . 
let me answer a couple of points that have been raised in particular , first of all , about the tax simplification . 
tax day is 2 days away , and i am sure taxpayers , in particular small businesses and family farmers , would appreciate anything that we can do to simplify our tax laws , and i would submit that permanent repeal of the death tax does just that . 
in fact , h.r. 8 is one simple paragraph , and it reads as follows : `` section 901 of the economic growth and tax relief reconciliation act of 2001 shall not apply to title v of such act. '' basically , we repeal the sunset . 
in 2010 , it magically disappears , and then on january 1 of 2011 it springs back to life , and the uncertainty , how would one as an estate planner advise a client when the tax is gone today and comes back again in the very next year ? 
the form itself , the blank form i am holding here , form 706 , is 40 pages in length for the estate tax return , 40 pages in length , and it comes with a handy dandy 30-page instruction booklet . 
lastly , when it comes down to the nuts and bolts of it , whether or not the pomeroy substitute , and again , in the effort to pursue the american dream , whether those businesses are going to be shielded by the pomeroy substitute or not shielded , the fact is that as long as the tax is on the books , as long as congress draws some line in the sand , and that is all we are doing with the substitute , is just some arbitrary line , we are still going to have those family businesses that are going to be taking some of their resources and these convoluted schemes , legal , but efforts to avoid the tax . 
not so , and i go back to the original discussion , that small family in columbia , missouri , the eiffert family who spends $ 52 , 000 a year just to buy term life insurance because they might have to face the estate tax . 
in other words , if you work hard , you play by the rules , if you scrape together your savings , and , again , we as an industrialized nation , not only do we have even under the pomeroy substitute a 47 percent death tax rate which would be the second highest in the world , but the fact is that we are not very good at savings and investments . 
in fact , if you are looking at your 1040 right now , look at line eight because it says if you have been thrifty and you are able to generate a little interest income , guess what , uncle sam says put this amount here because we are going to take our bite of the apple . 
but as a former estate planner and a scholar in both law and economics , i confess that i was mistaken . 
they have saved , contributing to a common pool of capital whose benefits manifest , for example , in lower interest rates , inure to all . 
and they have refrained from spending all of their wealth on themselves. '' in fact , professor mccaffrey across the capitol some years ago i think before the senate finance committee said , to paraphrase scripture , the reason he changed his mind , i was blind but now i see . 
under my friend 's substitute amendment , the rate imposed would be locked in at 47 percent . 
we have been described as non-patriot in other debates ; in war and peace , scoundrels and socialists . 
but i think it is important for the american people to understand that we are engaging in a democratic process to be able to allow a voice of opposition to be heard for a tainted , stale and stagnant piece of legislation that has been bought and paid for by special interests . 
our desire is to possibly encourage our colleagues in the house to take a serious and deliberative review of s. 256 . 
i can tell you that the constituents in the 18th congressional district never saw that money . 
we are in the depth almost of a deficit that is about to stagnate and stifle us . 
so let me suggest to you as i look at the medical conditions , i would ask my colleagues on the other side of the aisle does their stale old bill , this stack of old papers respond to the medical causes of bankruptcy that shows that because there is death in the family , illness or injury , people who go try to repay their bills and they fall into bankruptcy and this old stale 1998 bill does not respond to that . 
my next question , mr. speaker , is whether or not this old stale bill deals with the military , the military who is in iraq right now , does this old stale bill deal with it ? 
even if it had been a flawless piece of legislation then , and it surely was not , the events of the past eight years have dramatically changed the economic and social environment in which you must consider this bill . 
in the eight years since this bill was introduced , new cases have burst on the scene . 
the names are burned in our collective memories : enron , worldcom , adelphia , united airlines , usairways and twa , ltv steel , k-mart , polaroid , global crossing . 
while the actual number of consumer bankruptcy cases has declined slightly in the past year , many of the largest corporate bankruptcy cases in american history have occurred since the senate last reevaluated the bankruptcy laws , and some of those cases are already legend for the corporate scandals that accompanied them . 
companies in chapter 11 that cancel pension plans and health benefits , leaving thousands of families economically devastated . 
sub-prime mortgage companies , financed by some of the best names in american banking , have unlawfully taken millions of dollars from homeowners , then fled to the bankruptcy courts to protect their insiders and bank lenders . 
in the eight years since this bill was introduced , there has been a revolution in the data available to us . 
we now know : one million men and women each year are turning to bankruptcy in the aftermath of a serious medical problem -- and three-quarters of them have health insurance . 
after he lost a $ 33 million lawsuit in california , o.j. simpson moved to florida , explaining to a reporter that the unlimited exemption would permit him to protect a multimillion-dollar house . 
abe grossman ran up $ 233 million in debts in massachusetts and rhode island , then fled to florida to purchase a 64 , 000 square foot home valued at $ 55 million . 
some physicians are reportedly dropping their malpractice insurance and putting all their assets in their homes -- where they ca n't be touched by bankruptcy . 
the time-lines in s. 256 would have denied reorganization to more than a third of the small businesses that eventually saved themselves -- destroying value for the companies , their creditors , their employees and their communities . 
this bill would be the first in american history to discriminate affirmatively against small businesses . 
for the first time ever , congress would pass a law that says companies like enron and worldcom do n't have to file extra forms , enron and worldcom do n't have to schedule meetings with the office of the united states trustee , and enron and worldcom do n't have to meet fixed deadlines that a judge can not waive for any reason -- but every troubled small business in the chapter 11 system would have to file those papers , undergo that supervision and meet those deadlines or be unlike eight years ago , we need not have a theoretical debate about the economic impact of bankruptcies on credit card company profits . 
in the eight years since this bill was introduced , credit has not been curtailed . 
companies have admitted that for every dollar they claim the customer borrowed , they are demanding two more dollars in fees and interest . 
cases continue to surface like in re mccarthy , in which a woman borrowed $ 2200 , paid back $ 2010 in the two years before bankruptcy , and was told by her credit card company that she still owed $ 2600 more . 
the means test in this bill , section 102 , has been one of its most controversial provisions . 
the means test aside , virtually every consumer provision aims in the same direction . 
there are provisions that will make chapter 13 impossible for many of the debtors who would file today , provisions that make it easier than ever to abuse the unlimited homestead provisions in some states and yet at the same time hurt people with more modest homesteads in those same states . 
other provisions will compromise the privacy of millions of families by putting their entire tax returns in the court files and potentially on the internet , making them easy prey for identity thieves . 
it assumes that everyone is in bankruptcy for the same reason -- too much unnecessary spending . 
a person cheated by a sub-prime mortgage lender and lied to by a credit counseling agency is treated the same as a person who gamed the system in every possible way . 
do not enact a proposal written for 1997 when the problems of the american corporate economy in 1997 deserve far more attention and the problems of the american middle class can no longer be ignored . 
when the middle class grows in size and security , our country gets stronger . 
and when more american families save and invest in their children 's future , america grows stronger still ... .. 
today , the average american family is earning $ 1 , 500 less than in 2000 . 
do you know that currently , more that 1 of every 100 adults in america files bankruptcy each year ? 
research shows that approximately 50 percent of all families are forced to file bankruptcy due to medical expenses ; and other 40 percent of families file bankruptcy due to divorce , job loss or death in the family . 
in a study of african american families , the typical family had debt of 30 percent of its assets , while the debt of the typical white family was 11 percent of its assets . 
i offered amendments to the bill that included : ( 1 ) closing a new loophole that threatens to undermine the comprehensive scheme to compensate victims of nuclear accidents , which congress enacted long ago in the price-anderson act ( paa ) ; ( 2 ) increasing the amount of tuition expenses allowed under the chapter 7 means test ; and ( 3 ) precluding the discharge of debt arising out of suits against sex offenses ; ( 4 ) striking the means test ; and ( 5 ) supporting an amendment by my colleague mr. schiff to offer relief to those who are victims of identity theft . 
when the bill was considered in the senate , the majority rejected over 25 democratic amendments , including one that would have helped debtors to keep their homes if they have been driven into bankruptcy by medical expenses . 
the banking industry has spent $ 22 million on federal lobbying in the past five years . 
in fact , according to the new york times , `` the main lobbying forces for the bill -- a coalition that included visa , mastercard , the american bankers association , mbna america , capital one , citicorp , the ford motor credit company and the general motors acceptance corporation -- spent more than $ 40 million in political fund-raising efforts and many millions more on lobbying efforts since 1989. '' clearly , the republican majority has shut democrats out of the process in order to appease these special interest groups -- to the detriment of middle-class and elderly americans . 
as an african american , i am troubled by the fact that both african american and hispanic families , both of whom are over-represented in bankruptcy , would suffer disproportionately if this bill becomes law . 
in fact , the weight of the evidence demonstrates that this legislation will increase the cost of bankruptcy for every family , and decrease the protection of bankruptcy for every family , regardless of income or the cause of financial crisis . 
mr. speaker , i reject this legislation not only because it is flawed in and of itself but also because the process by which it is being considered is severely flawed . 
mr. speaker , benjamin franklin noted over 200 years ago that `` in this world nothing can be said to be certain , except death and taxes. '' unfortunately , the convergence of these two inescapable events , in the form of the federal estate tax , results in a number of destructive outcomes in terms of slower economic growth , reduced social mobility , and wasted productive activity . 
for these reasons , among others , i urge my colleagues to join with me in support of permanent repeal of the federal estate tax . 
the estate tax has been enacted four times in our nation 's history -- each time in response to the exigent financial straits deriving from war . 
in three of those instances ( 1797-1802 , 1862-70 , and 1898-1902 ) , the estate tax was repealed shortly thereafter . 
other supporters of the estate tax point to the $ 22 billion in tax revenues for 2003 , or to the incentive for charitable bequests . 
the estate tax , which is imposed at an alarming 45 to 47 percent rate , is higher than in any other industrialized nation in the world except japan . 
in the minority community there are numerous examples of the injurious effects of the estate tax . 
the chicago daily defender -- the oldest african american-owned daily newspaper in the united states -- is a good example of the unique problem presented for minority families . 
for this reason , cash resources to pay federal estate taxes , based on the way valuation is made , would force my family to sell the store in order to pay the irs within 9 months of my death . 
only one minority business owner in three has been able to take any steps whatsoever to prepare for the ramifications of the estate tax . 
one in four believes that his or her heirs will be forced to sell off at least part of their businesses to pay the estate tax liability . 
however , i find these arguments in support of the estate tax unconvincing in the face of substantial evidence otherwise . 
similarly , tax planning techniques such as gift tax exclusions or valuation discounts reduce the size of the gross estate but do not appear in the irs data causing effective tax rates to be overstated for many larger estates . 
the institute for policy innovation recently revealed evidence of this fact in a study showing that the effective tax rate on the most valuable estates was actually lower than that on medium-sized estates . 
according to the president 's fiscal year 2005 budget , the estate and gift tax brought in $ 22.8 billion in revenues to the federal government in 2003 . 
in 2003 , congress ' joint economic committee reported that the death tax brought in $ 22 billion in annual revenue , but cost the private sector another $ 22 billion in compliance costs . 
allen sinai for american council for capital formation and center for policy research , federal tax receipts would rise in response to a stronger economy , feeding back 20 cents of every dollar of estate tax reduction . 
in fact , over the years 2001 to 2008 , estate tax repeal would increase real gross domestic product by $ 90 billion to $ 150 billion , and u.s. employment by 80 , 000 to 165 , 000 . 
for example , a construction company or grocery store with less than $ 27.5 million in annual receipts is considered a small business . 
more significantly , without significant reform or , more appropriately , repeal , these same small businesses face the prospect of estate tax rates as high as 60 percent beginning in 2011 . 
permanent repeal of the estate tax will provide american families with fairness in our tax system and remove the perverse incentive that makes it is cheaper for an individual to sell the business prior to death and pay the individual capital gains rate than pass it on to heirs . 
it will allow wealth created in one generation to be passed on to the next thereby establishing sustainable minority communities through better jobs and education , better healthcare , and safer communities . 
mr. speaker , i rise in opposition to s. 256 , the bankruptcy abuse prevention and consumer protection action . 
if passed , this act will be a boon for credit card and financial lending institutions and a nightmare for american families who are struggling to stay strong in an economically depressed society . 
a closed rule was employed , resulting in thirty-five democratic amendments being rejected from consideration . 
not only were members of the house prevented from engaging in debate but also the american people have been denied the opportunity to hear legitimate debate regarding this act we are considering today . 
further , the wealthiest citizens in our country are able to insulate their assets by placing them in trusts that are protected in bankruptcy proceedings . 
democrats were denied the opportunity to offer amendments , the american people have been denied a full opportunity to determine the full implications of the changes in bankruptcy law , and the act is fundamentally anticonsumer . 
the numerous activations and extended tours of duty in iraq and afghanistan are causing our military families to face debt and serious financial strain . 
four out of 10 reservists , for example , take a drop in pay once they are deployed overseas . 
i have met with military families in san diego who are facing the realities and the financial strain that come with activation . 
i worry about the military spouse whose husband is activated to serve in iraq for a year and must leave his job or his business . 
the senate did include provisions exempting military personnel serving in combat from certain provisions of the bill . 
mr. speaker , i rise today in strong support of making estate tax relief permanent so that family-owned farms and businesses can be passed down from generation to generation . 
the estate tax should be updated and modernized to reflect both the economic growth many americans have experienced in recent years , and the hard work of millions of entrepreneurs and those just trying to make a living . 
under current law , in 2010 , `` carry-over '' basis rules ( with a $ 1.3 million exemption ) replace the `` stepped-up '' basis rules , creating burdensome mr. speaker , it is our responsibility to avoid towering deficits and reduce the debt future generations will inherit . 
i can not , in good faith , support legislation that will put our country further into deficit spending with a tax cut that will hurt future generations for the unforeseeable future . 
mr. speaker , i rise today in support of this legislation because the current system needs reform to protect those people truly in need of debt relief , while holding accountable those who can repay their debt . 
bankruptcy filings have risen steadily in recent years , an indication that our current system is an ineffective one that discourages consumers from saving and planning responsibly and ultimately is n't good for consumers , families , or a society that values individual responsibility . 
the system in place now gives incentives to people in trouble and encourages them to steamroll headfirst into chapter 7 liquidation of all their debts , even when they could get back on their feet through a reasonable repayment plan or basic credit counseling . 
while s. 256 is not a perfect bill , i do believe it goes great lengths in addressing the growing problem of bankruptcy in this country . 
bankruptcy costs are passed on to other consumers , and the average family pays hundreds of dollars each year in higher prices . 
there have been accusations that this bill will be detrimental to the most needy ; in fact , there are a great deal of safeguards . 
in addition , this legislation will create new disclosure requirements for lending institutions to provide better information to consumers about credit cards and debt . 
it is important to note that this legislation is only the first step in addressing the bigger problems underlying savings in this country . 
addressing this problem must be our next goal , and we must encourage more personal responsibility in consumers . 
mr. speaker , i am proud to vote in favor of s. 256 , the bankruptcy abuse prevention and consumer protection act of 2005 . 
the legislation reduces the unfair disparity of treatment in the bankruptcy system by establishing more uniform and predictable standards . 
mr. shapiro testified in support of these patient health provisions before the u.s. senate committee on the judiciary subcommittee on administrative oversight and the courts on june 1 , 1998 . 
the passing of this legislation marks the culmination of mr. shapiro and ms. peterman 's tireless efforts to protect patients ' interests in bankruptcy cases . 
on behalf of my colleagues in congress , i offer my sincere gratitude for their dedication to fair bankruptcy policy . 
i will vote in favor of this legislation , just as i have supported similar bills in the past , and i encourage my colleagues to pass s. 256 without amendments so it can go directly to the president for his signature . 
because commercial institutions have to pass their losses on to everyone else in the form of higher prices and higher interest rates . 
the bill also makes common-sense revisions to homestead exemptions to reduce the ability of a wealthy individual shielding his money in an extravagant home just prior to filing bankruptcy . 
put simply , this legislation helps restore the fundamental concept of personal responsibility in the bankruptcy system . 
mr. speaker , almost half of the bankruptcies in the united states are connected to an illness in the family , whether people had health insurance or not . 
today i rise in support of the pomeroy substitute to h.r. 8 , the estate tax repeal permanency act , and in opposition to the underlying bill . 
the republicans ' call for repealing the estate tax comes at a time when our government is already in fiscal crisis . 
with a $ 400 billion deficit projected this year , now is not the time to add trillions in debt to the tab that future generations must pay . 
in addition , the house recently passed a budget that cuts $ 20 billion from medicare and underfunds critical priorities including veterans ' health care and homeland security . 
we must work to meet our existing obligations rather than cutting taxes for the wealthiest 0.3 percent of families in america . 
based on internal revenue service data for 2004 , out of approximately 10 , 000 deaths in my home state , only 312 rhode island decedents filed estate tax returns . 
i urge my colleagues to join me in supporting permanent reform of the estate tax , but not irresponsibly repealing it . 
our small business owners are in need of relief , and we must provide it without leaving future generations to pay the bill . 
mr. speaker , it is fascinating if you would think if there was a proposal in the substitute to eliminate the whole list of taxes that the gentleman referred to , but i have never heard one case where they have talked about eliminating any tax , only increasing taxes . 
let me just say , i come to this as someone who grew up in a family farm operation , a family small business . 
nothing stands in the way more for families and small businesses to be successful , to continue , than the death tax . 
that is the lifeblood of this nation , and nothing destroys it more than the death tax ; and that is why we have to kill this death tax to make sure that we can experience the american dream in this country . 
mr. speaker , in a few words , this is fiscal madness . 
the national debt is now $ 4.6 trillion , $ 6.3 if we add in social security funds . 
as mentioned , this bill would add $ 290 billion in debt , and who would benefit ? 
that is the lamest argument brought to this floor in recent memory . 
my colleagues will indulge in it again i guess , and i hope , once again , the senate will come to our rescue . 
mr. speaker , i rise in opposition to the bankruptcy bill before the house . 
the first problem is that the bill does not distinguish between those individuals who abuse their credit and then seek to wipe the slate clean through chapter 7 , and those who enter bankruptcy as the result of a costly medical emergency or after one of the breadwinners in a family loses their job . 
the study looked at 1771 bankruptcy filers in five states . 
the results were striking : half of the people in the study said that illness or medical bills drove them into bankruptcy . 
most of these people actually had some health insurance ; but high co-payments , deductibles , exclusions from coverages left them liable for thousands of dollars in out-of-pocket costs when serious illness struck . 
other people in the study suddenly lost their jobs and therefore their health insurance . 
in many cases , people were let go from their jobs soon after the onset of a debilitating illness , so the medical bills begin to arrive just as the insurance and paychecks disappear . 
the second fundamental problem left unaddressed by the bill is the credit card industry 's role in the surge of bankruptcy filings in recent years . 
the lending policies of the credit card companies themselves is a major factor in driving consumers into bankruptcy , yet the legislation before the house does nothing to end these abuses . 
i include with my statement an article from the march 6 edition of the washington post entitled , `` credit card penalties , fees bury debtors ; senate nears action on bankruptcy curbs. '' credit card penalties , fees bury debtors ; senate nears action on bankruptcy curbs for more than two years , special-education teacher fatemeh hosseini worked a second job to keep up with the $ 2 , 000 in monthly payments she collectively sent to five banks to try to pay $ 25 , 000 in credit card debt . 
`` i was really trying hard to make minimum payments , '' said hosseini , whose financial problems began in the late 1990s when her husband left her and their three children . 
`` all of my salary was going to the credit card companies , but there was no change in the balances because of that interest and those penalties. '' punitive charges -- penalty fees and sharply higher interest rates after a payment is late -- compound the problems of many financially strapped consumers , sometimes making it impossible for them to dig their way out of debt and pushing them into bankruptcy . 
`` cleveland municipal judge robert j. triozzi said last fall when he ruled against discover in the company 's breach-of-contract suit against another struggling credit cardholder , ruth m. owens . 
owens tried for six years to pay off a $ 1 , 900 balance on her discover card , sending the credit company a total of $ 3 , 492 in monthly payments from 1997 to 2003 . 
triozzi denied discover 's claim , calling its attempt to collect more money from owens `` unconscionable. '' the bankruptcy measure now being debated in congress has been sought for nearly eight years by the credit card industry . 
twice in that time , versions of it have passed both the house and senate . 
the republican majority , along with a few democrats , has voted down dozens of proposed amendments to the bill , including one that would make it easier for the elderly to protect their homes in bankruptcy and another that would require credit card companies to tell customers how much extra interest they would pay over time by making only minimum payments . 
no one knows how many consumers get caught in the spiral of `` negative amortization , '' which is what regulators call it when a consumer makes payments but balances continue to grow because of penalty costs . 
the problem is widespread enough to worry federal bank regulators , who say nearly all major credit card issuers engage in the practice . 
banks agreed to the new rules after , in the words of one top federal regulator , `` some arm-twisting. '' but bank executives persuaded regulators to allow the higher minimum payments to be phased in over several years , through 2006 , arguing that many customers are so much in debt that even slight increases too soon could push many into financial disaster . 
`` it 's to encourage people to pay their bills the way they said they would in their contract , to encourage good financial management , '' said nessa feddis , senior federal counsel for the american bankers association . 
`` if you are a good customer and have an occasional mishap , they 'll waive the fees , because there 's so much competition and it 's too easy to go someplace else. '' banks are also willing to work out settlements with people in financial difficulty , she said , because `` there are still a lot of options even for people who 've been in trouble. '' many bankruptcy lawyers disagree . 
u.s. bankruptcy judge david h. adams of norfolk , who is also the president of the national conference of bankruptcy judges , said many debtors who get in over their heads `` are spending money , buying things they should n't be buying. '' even so , he said , `` once you add all these fees on , the amount of principal being paid is negligible . 
under the law , `` the credit card company is legally entitled to collect every dollar without a distinction '' whether the balance is from fees , interest or principal , said retired u.s. bankruptcy judge ronald barliant , who presided in chicago . 
john rao , staff attorney of the national consumer law center , one of many consumer groups fighting the bankruptcy bill , says the plight consumers face was illustrated last year in a bankruptcy case filed in northern virginia . 
manassas resident josephine mccarthy 's providian visa bill increased to $ 5 , 357 from $ 4 , 888 in two years , even though mccarthy has used the card for only $ 218.16 in purchases and has made monthly payments totaling $ 3 , 058 . 
those payments , noted u.s. bankruptcy judge stephen s. mitchell in alexandria , all went to `` pay finance charges ( at a whopping 29.99 % ) , late charges , over-limit fees , bad check fees and phone payment fees. '' mitchell allowed the claim `` because the debtor admitted owing it. '' mccarthy , through her lawyer , declined to be interviewed . 
the interest is much , much more than the principal. '' samuel j. gerdano , executive director of the american bankruptcy institute , a nonpartisan research group , said that focusing on late fees is `` refusing to look at the elephant in the room , and that 's the massive levels of consumer debt which is not being paid . 
despite , or perhaps because of , the large increase in cards , there is a `` fee feeding frenzy , '' among credit card issuers , said robert mckinley , cardweb 's president and chief executive . 
`` late and over-limit fees alone can easily rack up $ 900 in fees , and a 30 percent interest rate on a $ 3 , 000 balance can add another $ 1 , 000 , so you could go from $ 2 , 000 to $ 5 , 000 in just one year if you fail to make payments. '' according to r.k . 
hammer investment bankers , a california credit card consulting firm , banks collected $ 14.8 billion in penalty fees last year , or 10.9 percent of revenue , up from $ 10.7 billion , or 9 percent of revenue , in 2002 , the first year the firm began to track penalty fees . 
the way the fees are now imposed , `` people would be better off if they stopped paying '' once they get in over their heads , said t. bentley leonard , a north carolina bankruptcy attorney . 
under 7 debtors are required to forfeit all of their property other than the exempt assets in exchange for having their debts extinguished . 
but unlike this bill , current law provides a presumption in favor of granting relief to the debtor . 
my constituents in santa clara county live in a high-cost area . 
almost nobody will be able to discharge their debts in bankruptcy from santa clara county because of that high cost , no matter how meritorious for their claim for relief . 
one in five skipped meals . 
one in five was forced to move . 
in fact , half went without needed prescriptions . 
please join me in opposing this unfair bill . 
illness and injury as contributors to bankruptcy abstract : in 2001 , 1.458 million american families filed for bankruptcy . 
to investigate medical contributors to bankruptcy , we surveyed 1 , 771 personal bankruptcy filers in five federal courts and subsequently completed in-depth interviews with 931 of them . 
medical debtors were 42 percent more likely than other debtors to experience lapses in coverage . 
`` if the debtor be insolvent to serve creditors , let his body be cut in pieces on the third market day . 
even so , bankruptcy leaves painful problems in its wake . 
debtors ' names are often published in the newspaper , and the fact of their bankruptcy may show up whenever someone tries to find them via the internet . 
nearly 1.5 million couples or individuals filed bankruptcy petitions in 2001 , a 360 percent increase since 1980 . 
research has been impeded both by the absence of a national repository for bankruptcy filings and by debtors ' reticence to discuss their bankruptcy , in population-based surveys , only half of those who have undergone bankruptcy admit to it . 
in his 1972 book , sen . 
edward kennedy ( d-ma ) gave an impressionistic account of `` sickness and bankruptcy. '' the likelihood of incurring high out-of-pocket costs was incorporated into older estimates of the number of underinsured americans : twenty-nine million in 1987 . 
our study provides the first extensive data on the medical concomitants of bankruptcy , based on a survey of debtors in bankruptcy courts . 
( 4 ) does inadequate health insurance play a role in bankruptcy ? 
`` bankrupt '' is not synonymous with `` broke. '' `` bankrupt '' means filing a petition in a federal court asking for protection from creditors via the bankruptcy laws . 
states may regulate these exemptions , which often include work tools , clothes , bibles , and some equity in a home . 
in chapter 7 the trustee liquidates all nonexempt assets -- although 96 percent of debtors have so little unencumbered property that there is nothing left to liquidate . 
in chapter 13 the debtor proposes a repayment plan , which extends for up to five years . 
under both chapters , taxes , student loans , alimony , and child support remain payable in full , and debtors must make payments on all secured loans ( such as home mortgages and car loans ) or forfeit the collateral . 
this study is based on a cohort of 1 , 771 bankruptcy filings in 2001 . 
in addition , we conducted follow-up telephone interviews with about half ( 931 ) of these debtors . 
we used cluster sampling to assemble a cohort to households filing for personal bankruptcy in five ( of the seventy-seven total ) federal judicial districts . 
we collected 250 questionnaires in each district , representative of the proportion of chapters 7 and 13 filings in that district . 
with the cooperation of the judges in each district , we contacted the trustees who officiate at meetings with debtors . 
questionnaires ( which were available in english and spanish ) included a cover letter explaining the research project and human subjects protections and encouraging debtors to consult their attorneys the questionnaire asked about demographics , employment , housing , and specific reasons for filing for bankruptcy , it also asked whether the debtor had medical debts exceeding $ 1 , 000 , had lost two or more weeks of work-related income because of illness , or had health insurance coverage for themselves and all dependents at the time of filing , and whether there had been a gap of one month or more in that coverage during the past two years . 
in joint filings , we collected demographic information for each spouse . 
during the spring and summer of 2001 we collected questionnaires from consecutive debtors in each district until the target number was reached . 
the written questionnaire distributed at the time of bankruptcy filing invited debtors to participate in future telephone interviews , for which they would receive $ 50 ; 70 percent agreed to such interviews . 
in total , we collected in-depth medical information on 391 people with health problems in 332 debtor households . 
we used data from the self-administered questionnaires ( and court records ) obtained from all 1 , 771 filters to analyze demographics , health coverage at the time of filing , and gaps in coverage in the two years before filing . 
under the rubric `` major medical bankruptcy '' we included debtors who either ( 1 ) cited illness or injury as a specific reason for bankruptcy , or ( 2 ) reported uncovered medical bills exceeding $ 1 , 000 in the past years , or ( 3 ) lost at least two weeks of work-related income because of illness/injury , or ( 4 ) mortgaged a home to pay medical bills . 
data from the 931 follow-up telephone interviews were used to analyze hardships experienced by debtors in the period surrounding their bankruptcy , including problems gaining access to medical care . 
most debtors owned homes ; their occupational prestige scores place them predominantly in the middle or working classes . 
extrapolating from our data , the 1.5 million personal bankruptcy filings nationally in 2001 involved 3.9 million people : 1.9 million debtors , 1.3 million children under age eighteen , and 0.7 million other dependents . 
nearly half ( 46.2 percent ) ( 95 percent confidence interval = 43.5 , 48.9 ) of debtors met at least one of our criteria for `` major medical bankruptcy. '' slightly more than half ( 54.5 percent ) ( 95 percent ci = 51.8 , 57.2 ) met criteria for `` any medical bankruptcy. '' a lapse in health insurance coverage during the two years before filing was a strong predictor of a medical cause of bankruptcy ( exhibit 3 ) . 
( more detailed coverage and cost data for the subsample we interviewed appears below. ) medical debtors resembled other debtors in most other respects ( exhibit 1 ) . 
privations in the period surrounding bankruptcy . 
in our follow-up telephone interviews with 931 debtors , they reported substantial problems . 
medical debtors experienced more problems in access to care than other debtors did ; three-fifths went without a needed doctor or dentist visit , and nearly half failed to fill a prescription . 
among the total sample of 1 , 771 debtors , those with more than $ 1 , 000 in medical bills were more likely than others to have taken out a mortgage to pay medical bills ( 5.0 percent versus 0.8 percent ) . 
in three-quarters of cases , the person experiencing the illness/injury was the debt or spouse of the debtor ; in 13.3 percent , a child ; and in 8.2 percent , an elderly relative . 
our in-depth interviews with medical debtors confirmed that gaps in coverage were a common problem . 
only 2.9 percent of those who were uninsured or suffered a gap in coverage said that they had not thought they needed insurance ; 55.9 percent said that premiums were unaffordable , 7.1 percent were unable to obtain coverage because of preexisting medical conditions , and most others cited employment issues , such as job loss or ineligibility for employer-sponsored coverage . 
in the year prior to bankruptcy , out-of-pocket costs ( excluding insurance premiums ) averaged $ 3 , 686 ( 95 percent ci = $ 2 , 693 , $ 4 , 679 ) ( exhibit 5 ) . 
those with continuous insurance coverage paid $ 734 annually in premiums on average over and above the expenditures detailed above . 
for example , a man insured through his employer ( a large national firm ) suffered a broken leg and torn knee ligaments , he incurred $ 13 , 000 in out-of-pocket costs for copayments , deductibles , and uncovered services -- much of it for physical therapy . 
bankruptcy is common in the united states , involving nearly four million debtors and dependents in 2001 ; medical problems contribute to about half of all bankruptcies . 
they differed from others filing for bankruptcy in one important respect : they were more likely to have experienced a lapse in health coverage . 
in other cases , even continuous coverage left families with ruinous medical bills . 
as in all surveys , we relied on respondents ' truthfulness . 
first , just prior to answering our questionnaire , debtors had filed extensive information with the court under penalty of perjury -- information that was available to use in the court records and that virtually never contradicted the questionnaire data . 
they were about to be sworn in by a trustee ( who often administered our questionnaire ) and examined under oath . 
at few other points in life are full disclosure and honesty so aggressively emphasized . 
second , the details called for in our telephone interview -- questions about out-of-pocket medical expenses , who was ill , diagnoses , and so forth -- would make a generic claim that `` we had medical problems '' difficult to sustain . 
third , one of us ( thorne ) interviewed ( for other studies ) many debtors in their homes . 
finally , our findings receive indirect corroboration from recent surveys of the general public that have found high levels of medical debt , which often result in calls from collection agencies . 
in sum , bankruptcy is an imperfect proxy for financial ruin . 
trends in medical bankruptcy . 
in 1981 the best evidence available suggests that about 25 , 000 families filed for bankruptcy in the aftermath of a serious medical problem ( 8 percent of the 312 , 000 bankruptcy filings that year ) . 
since the number of bankruptcy filings rose 11 percent in the eighteen months after the completion of our data collection , the absolute number of medical bankruptcies almost surely continues to increase . 
our data highlight four deficiencies in the financial safety net for american families confronting illness . 
first , even brief lapses in insurance coverage may be ruinous and should not be viewed as benign . 
while forty-five million americans are uninsured at any point in time , many more experience spells without coverage . 
only a handful of medical debtors with a gap in coverage had chosen to forgo insurance because they had not perceived a need for it ; the overwhelming majority had found coverage unaffordable or effectively unavailable . 
the privations suffered by many debtors -- going without food , telephone service , electricity , and health care -- lend credence to claims that coverage was unaffordable and belie the second , many health insurance policies prove to be too skimpy in the face of serious illness . 
as in canada and most of western europe , health insurance should be divorced from employment to avoid coverage disruptions at the time of illness . 
the low rate of medical bankruptcy in canada suggests that better medical and social insurance could greatly ameliorate this problem in the united states . 
in 1591 pope gregory xiv fell gravely ill . 
according to legend , the resulting depletion of the papal treasury is reflected in his unadorned plaster sarcophagus in st . 
i am sure my colleague was not here , but i would like to remind him that it was a republican , president roosevelt , teddy roosevelt , who strongly supported an estate tax in the first place . 
the reason this place was in recess is because we were over there giving out $ 8 billion to oil companies . 
those poor people , whose profits have quadrupled in the last 2 years , that is what we did a little while ago . 
three-quarters of the money that comes in comes from people with estates over $ 2.5 million . 
we create an oligarchic class in this country from whom the money can never be taxed . 
the real losers in this are not only the american people . 
now if you can give your kid $ 2 million and say , now , johnny , here is two million bucks , i think that ought to kind of get you a start in the world . 
we are in debt to the world . 
those things in the social security trust fund , that is just paper . 
further , as the washington post pointed out today , permanently repealing the estate tax may actually hurt more family farmers and small businesses than it would help because of the cumbersome new reporting requirements and changes in how assets are valued . 
exempting estates up to $ 1 million , the original level before the 2001 bush tax cut , leaves only the top 2 percent of the estates in the country . 
but current law goes well beyond the $ 1 million exemption ; and to hide the real cost of their bad economic policies , the republican leadership included a provision that sunsets the 2001 tax cut in 2011 . 
president bush came into his first term with a surplus and ended his second term with the largest deficit in the history of the united states of america , and now they bring forward another tax cut that costs $ 290 billion according to the joint committee on taxation . 
the wealthiest of the wealthy are getting a free ride at this very difficult time in our history . 
poverty in america is increasing . 
our children are falling behind in math and science . 
the issue is whether or not estates in the billions of dollars should be subject to any taxation . 
it is about the most extremely wealthy companies , the most extremely wealthy people in this country . 
our good colleague from tennessee ( mr. tanner ) xz4003950 in a presentation , i thought , said it best . 
in that category we are not talking about family farms or small businesses . 
this is about protecting the three-tenths of the 1 percent wealthiest people in this country . 
i enter into the record an article that appeared in today 's washington post that really kind of explains what this debate is all about , about how mars candy , gallo wine , and campbell soup fortunes have been lobbying for the complete repeal of the estate tax for some time so they can end all taxation on their inheritance . 
erosion of estate tax is a session in politics in 1992 , when heirs to the mars inc . 
`` i think this train has an awful lot of momentum , '' said yale university law professor michael j. graetz , a former senior official in the treasury department of president george h.w . 
`` a law that constituted the blandest kind of common sense for most of the twentieth century was transformed , in the space of little more than a decade , into the supposed enemy of hardworking citizens all over this country. '' the secret of the repeal movement 's success has been its appeal to principle over economics . 
in 2001 , out of 2 , 363 , 100 total adult deaths , only 49 , 911 -- 2.1 percent -- had estates large enough to be hit by the estate tax . 
that was down from 2.3 percent in 1999 . 
the value of the taxed estates in 2001 averaged nearly $ 2.7 million . 
president bush 's 10-year , $ 1.35 trillion tax cut in 2001 began a decade-long phase-out of the estate tax . 
the portion of an estate exempted from taxation was raised from $ 675 , 000 in 2001 to $ 1.5 million in 2004 . 
the number of estates filing tax return is falling sharply , from 123 , 600 in 2000 to an expected 63 , 800 this year . 
under the 2001 legislation , however , all of the tax cuts , including the estate tax 's repeal , would be rescinded in 2011 . 
`` the ideological fervor that is admittedly still pretty strong in some quarters is now being tempered by the runaway debt that is weighing down this country , '' said pomeroy , who thinks voters are ready for a compromise . 
jon kyl ( r-ariz. ) , a repeal proponent , to find a compromise that could win a filibuster-proof 60 votes in the senate this year , even if it falls short of full repeal . 
repeal opponents have been unable to whip up big support , he said , because they never made the emotional case that the american belief in equal opportunity runs counter to the existence of an aristocracy born to inherited riches . 
the effort caught fire when small-business groups such as the national federation of independent business and agriculture groups led by the national cattlemen 's beef association joined in . 
in 1995 , luntz poll-tested the term `` death tax '' and advised the new gop majority to never use the terms `` inheritance '' or `` estate tax '' again . 
`` there 's been a sustained , determined campaign of misinformation that in the end has left the american people with a very different notion of what the estate tax is and does than actually exists , '' pomeroy said . 
early this year , with soldano 's money , luntz again began polling , this time in the face of record budget deficits and lingering economic unease . 
the small businesses and the family farms , we are all in agreement that they need to be protected . 
the debate is about whether three-tenths of 1 percent of higher income-earners in this country deserve additional tax relief at a time when they are cutting medicaid , veterans benefits , when they are dipping into the social security trust fund . 
right now , this year , we are paying $ 177 billion this year in interest on the debt . 
we need to rein in some of these extravagant tax cuts for the wealthy so that we can get our fiscal house in order here in this country , so we can start taking care of social security in the long term , so we do not have to cut veterans benefits or educational benefits or environmental protection . 
under a wacky provision of the 2001 tax cut designed to disguise the law 's full cost , congress voted to make the estate tax go away in 2010 , but come back in full force in 2011 . 
it falls , in effect , on the heirs to the wealthiest americans . 
fewer than 1 percent of the people who died in 2004 paid an estate tax , and half the revenue from the tax came from estates valued at $ 10 million or more . 
and that is where social security comes in . 
you can reject outlandish claims that social security faces some sort of `` crisis '' and still acknowledge that it faces a gap in funding for the long haul . 
in a little-noticed estimate confirmed by his office yesterday , stephen goss , the highly respected social security actuary , has studied how much of the social security financing gap could be filled by a reformed estate tax . 
what would happen if , instead of repealing the tax , congress left it in place at a 45 percent rate , and only on fortunes that exceeded $ 3.5 million -- which would be $ 7 million for couples ? 
it reflects the substantial reduction that would take effect in 2009 under bush 's tax plan . 
that 's why they 're hoping they can sucker defenders of estate taxes into a so-called compromise that gives away the store -- the store , in this case , going to neiman-marcus shoppers , not to those who rely on target . 
what we are having is not a real debate on the future of social security but a sham discussion in which the one issue that matters to the governing majority is how to keep cutting taxes on the wealthiest people in our country . 
those who vote to repeal the estate tax this week will be sending a clear message : they see the `` crisis '' in social security as serious enough to justify benefit cuts and private accounts . 
the gentlewoman from tennessee talked about the thousands of people in her district that had to pay the estate tax last year . 
i am reading from a report here that said there were roughly 440 taxable estates , or about 2 percent of all taxable estates were made up of farm and business assets in the year 2004 . 
what we are talking about here , and again , if we agree to the pomeroy substitute , is three-tenths of 1 percent of the wealthiest people in this country . 
the difference between our approach is the three-tenths of 1 percent richest people in this country , the paris hiltons of the world , the executives at campbell soup , the heirs of campbell soup or mars candy if you read the washington post today . 
in a climate where the majority is cutting medicaid , cutting veterans benefits , cutting programs that help feed the most vulnerable in our country , to go out and protect and to try to extend a special tax cut to those richest people in this country , i think , is unconscionable . 
let me again , just for the record , point out that the pomeroy substitute would provide $ 3 million in relief for individuals immediately , $ 3.5 million by 2009 , and $ 7 million per couple . 
what we are talking about here is the richest of the rich in this country . 
but what the majority is suggesting is that somehow we need to do something to help the three-tenths of 1 percent of the richest people in this country at a time when they present budgets that cut medicaid , that cut veterans benefits , that cut educational programs , that cut programs for the poor . 
how can you come here with a straight face and say that we need to help the three-tenths of 1 percent richest people in this country , when so many people who are struggling in the middle class , so many struggling to get in the middle class , are having such a difficult time ? 
health care costs , not spending sprees , are the single largest causes of bankruptcies in america . 
medical bankruptcies have gone up by more than 2 , 000 percent in the last 25 years . 
what a way to treat the men and women in uniform fighting on behalf of the united states . 
another blatant unfairness is that this bill allows millionaires to shield their assets in estates in florida and texas , but no such homestead exemption exists for middle-class families who suffer serious medical expenses . 
mr. speaker , i did not say the bill did not pay for service members ' medical expenses who are injured in iraq or afghanistan . 
we should not do it to people serving in iraq and afghanistan . 
this excessive , unnecessary cut will pass despite the fact that , within the last few legislative sessions , this congress has voted to take 300 , 000 families off food stamps , to take 300 , 000 children off daycare , to run the risk , by taking $ 20 billion out of medicaid , that as many as 7 million very poor elderly people dependent on government help in nursing homes will not get that assistance . 
you know , i think that we would all agree that we believe in equal opportunity . 
but in this country , unfortunately , when you see the effect of these tax cuts , that equal opportunity is really dependent upon the accident of birth . 
millions of people in our country are suffering for the accident of birth , without health insurance , without any real prospect of getting decent schooling . 
i originally supported bankruptcy reform in 1998 with former representative george gekas . 
ironically , the legislation was drawn from the recommendations of the bipartisan national bankruptcy review commission that was established through legislation passed in 1994 by a democratic-controlled congress . 
we want a system that allows a fresh start to those in financial trouble , but also one that promotes personal responsibility and is not susceptible to fraud and abuse . 
the means test in this bill carves out a series of exemptions to steer those who can afford to repay at least part of their debt toward a chapter 13 repayment plan . 
back in 1998 , i encouraged supporters of the bill to improve its consumer protection provisions . 
they responded by making child support a priority in a repayment plan , requiring credit counseling prior to filing for bankruptcy , and limiting abuses caused by a few unscrupulous individuals who hide their wealth behind a state 's homestead provisions . 
there were several other consumer protections we were unsuccessful in getting included . 
last year , 1.6 million consumers filed for bankruptcy , a figure just short of the number of filings in 2003 , which represented the most in our nation 's history . 
s. 256 has been criticized for advancing the interests of the credit card industry on the backs of the poor and the middle class , many of whom are in debt because of circumstances beyond their control . 
most families in dire financial straits and filing for bankruptcy will be able to discharge their debts under this legislation . 
they last saw a minimum wage increase in 1997 . 
it is the majority 's overall agenda that is bankrupt and in need of reform . 
mr. speaker , this bill is the worst giveaway to special interests , the worst rip-off of the public , of the middle class than i have ever seen in my public life . 
the people who understand how bankruptcy law functions in the real world , the scholars , judges , trustees and lawyers , whether they represent debtors , creditors , businesses or individuals , have all told us this bill will not work , that it will be costly , and that it will produce unfair and irrational results . 
there is an entire title in the bill just to squeeze more money out of debtors . 
but the republican leadership would not allow us to consider an amendment that would sunset the bill in several years if no savings are passed on to consumers , and they will not be . 
the public will be the victims , and we will rue the day in a few years when the 60 or 70 different ways in which this bill enables the credit card companies to stick their hands in the pockets of low- and middle-income people and extremists going bankrupt because of a medical emergency , and take more money out of that . 
mr. speaker , this bill is the worst giveaway to special interests , the worst rip-off of the public , of the middle class , i have ever seen in my public life . 
mr. speaker , it is fitting that this house take up this 512-page goodie bag for every special interest in town . 
mr. speaker , bankruptcy is notoriously complicated , but the members of this house have certainly never let the complexity of a problem get in the way of a good deal . 
the people who understand how bankruptcy law functions in the real world : the scholars , judges , trustees , and lawyers -- whether they represent debtors , creditors , businesses or individuals -- have all told us this bill wo n't work , that it will be costly , that it will produce unfair and irrational results . 
there is an entire title in this bill just for you to squeeze more money out of debtors . 
more to the point -- why are so many members of congress so willing to believe bankers over the people who we work with day in and day out to protect the rights of children ? 
it will impose new costs on the private sector of more than $ 123 million per year , in violation of the unfunded mandate reform act . 
he may be the only honest lobbyist left in washington . 
if they do n't they will play into the hands of the opponents of the bill -- it would reduce their credibility. '' i agree , but the republican leadership would n't allow us to consider an amendment that would sunset the bill in 2 years if no savings are passed on to consumers . 
so i guess we 're being asked to trust the biggest banks in america not to pocket the extra money . 
the idea that we would be borrowing the money to pay for afghanistan and iraq when by just leaving this tax in place we could pay for those incursions and maybe get the humvees to those men and women who are defending us every single day , or maybe get bulletproof vests to them on time , borrowing the money . 
it is day after day in this institution , borrow money , run up the debt , run up the deficits and then with a straight face say , we are going to repeal a tax that affects 1 percent of the american people , just 1 percent of the american people . 
when i hear people say , as they have said recently in this debate , well it is going to take care of the family farmer , they can not find a farmer that is not taken care of in the legislation that is about to be proposed here . 
this legislation that they are proposing today cuts against the grain of what thomas payne reminded us in `` common sense. '' he was concerned about hereditary power , the idea that the same people would control the wealth of america with the same families that would get to go to the same schools so the same families would have the same doctors and lawyers and accountants so the rest of america might not have a chance to participate . 
whatever happened to the republican party in america . 
teddy roosevelt said this was about thrift and hard work and honesty ; they were blessed to be born in this country . 
when we look at who enjoys the fruits of this money , the smallest number of american people , again the top 1 percent in america . 
we do not live in an aristocracy . 
there is no sense in the house of lords that you can advance yourself . 
here in this house , the people 's house , every walk of life is represented . 
rising debt levels in turn reflect a shift in our economy away from a time when families could afford to save and into a time when their wages are stagnant . 
the families who are in financial straits or the credit card companies who made a record $ 30 billion in profits last year and whose profits have soared almost triple in the last decade ? 
i am very proud of the work of the gentleman from north dakota ( mr. pomeroy ) xz4003230 , our member of congress , a very distinguished member of the committee on ways and means , for his initiative and leadership in presenting to the congress today an alternative that makes sense to the american people , that is fair to america 's families . 
mr. speaker , in the 20th century , in the early part of the 20th century , our country made a decision to honor our american value of fairness by moving forward toward a progressive system of taxation . 
in its analysis of the president 's budget , the nonpartisan congressional budget office found that the tax rate on wage income is nearly twice the rate of capital income , unearned income . 
the pomeroy substitute would provide relief to 99.7 percent of estates in america , 99.7 percent ; and .3 percent of estates would not be covered under the bill . 
think of it : if we pass the gentleman from north dakota 's ( mr. pomeroy ) xz4003230 bill , the savings would cover one half of the shortfall in social security down the road . 
basically , it all comes back to our deficit , to our budget , and whether we have fiscal soundness in our budget or not . 
what the republicans are proposing is saying to average working families in america every day they go to work , and every paycheck money is taken from their paycheck for social security . 
what the republicans are doing today is putting their hand into that pot and saying we are taking that money and we are going to subsidize the super-rich in our country , the largest , wealthiest estates in our country , .3 percent . 
mind you , the gentleman from north dakota ( mr. pomeroy ) xz4003230 has covered 99.7 percent , which is most , of course , 99.7 percent of the people in america . 
so anyone listening to this is not , odds are , affected in any positive way by what the republicans are proposing . 
in fact , they will be hurt because of what it does to social security and what it does in terms of capital gains for over 71 , 000 families in america . 
but that does not mean we take money from working families to give more money to the wealthiest families in america . 
and this at the same time as the tax cuts that the administration has proposed to make permanent , that would give people making over $ 1 million a year over $ 125 , 000 in tax cuts . 
so let us come down and vote for america 's workers , let us come down in favor of america 's families , and let us recognize that everybody , the wealthiest as well as those not so wealthy , everyone in america benefits when we have fairness in our tax code , where we have balance in our budget in terms of our values and in terms of our fiscal responsibility . 
mr. speaker , we all agree that every person in our country must be financially responsible , that we take responsibility for our action , for our debts and we do so in a way that is honorable . 
in the course of our country 's history , our economy , our government has always provided for people to get a fresh start under the bankruptcy law to enable them to go forward to make a contribution to our economy and our society . 
recognizing that tradition and recognizing the appreciation that we have for personal responsibility , i regretfully rise in opposition to this bill because this bankruptcy bill seeks to squeeze even more money for credit card companies from the most hard-pressed americans . 
we tried to take a legislative course of action in our previous question , which is a technicality , is a procedure here on the floor ; but we were not able to get any republican support to address the issue of identity theft and how individuals can be protected from identity theft under the bankruptcy bill . 
proponents claim that there is a bankruptcy tax in which honest americans are footing the bill for abusive users of credit cards . 
in fact , a recent study indicated that 45 percent of those filing for bankruptcy had skipped a needed doctor 's visit , 25 percent had utilities shut off , 20 percent went without food . 
they are not using this money that they should be paying in for luxuries . 
as a distinguished group of law professors wrote : `` some people do abuse the bankruptcy system , but the overwhelming majority of people in bankruptcy are in financial distress as a result of job loss , medical expense , divorce , or a combination of those causes . 
this bill attempts to kill a mosquito with a shotgun. '' i have a problem with the bill on several counts as to what is contained in the bill . 
the bill neglects the real causes of bankruptcies , as i just mentioned , medical concerns , divorce , in some cases death , while rewarding irresponsible corporate behavior . 
it lets those who truly abuse and game the bankruptcy system , the wealthy debtors who shield their assets in asset trusts and homestead exemptions , keep their loopholes and get off , in some cases , scot-free . 
current law already allows a bankruptcy judge to deny a discharge in chapter 7 to prevent abuses . 
i just would like to quote keith lundin , a federal bankruptcy judge in tennessee and an authority on bankruptcy repayment plans . 
these judges say the effect of the overhaul would be to discourage most forms of personal bankruptcy , which -- for nearly two centuries has served as a safety net for people in economic trouble . 
`` the folks who brought you `those who can pay , should pay ' are pulling the stuffing out of the very part of the bankruptcy law where debtors do pay , '' said keith lundin , a federal bankruptcy judge in the eastern district of tennessee in nashville and an authority on bankruptcy repayment plans . 
in interviews , a dozen current or former bankruptcy judges , whose names were suggested by proponents as well as opponents of the overhaul legislation , described what they saw as the problems that could result from key provisions of the new measure . 
repayment plans `` are pretty fragile documents to begin with , but they 're going to get a lot more fragile under these conditions , '' said ronald barliant , a former bankruptcy judge from the northern district of illinois in chicago . 
`` it 's going to take away a lot of the incentives '' for people to enter repayment plans , said david w. houston iii , a bankruptcy judge from the northern district of mississippi in aberdeen . 
he was referring to article 3 of the u.s. constitution , under which judges in the regular federal court system are appointed for life . 
as matters now stand , financially distressed americans generally have two options in bankruptcy . 
they can file a chapter 7 case , in which they forfeit most of their assets in return for cancellation of most debts and a debt-free `` fresh start. '' or , they can file a chapter 13 case , in which they get to keep most of their property but must agree to repay a portion of their debts over a period of time . 
some advocates for changing the system have contended that these provisions should be rewritten to address a kind of moral laxness in bankruptcy practices . 
`` when you have seen a system that has gone from a few hundred thousand cases to 1.5 million last year -- most of that increase during the fat years of the clinton administration -- you must conclude something is not right , '' said edith h. jones , a federal appellate court judge in houston who served on a blue-ribbon panel to review bankruptcy law in the 1990s and is widely believed to be seen as on president bush 's short list for a position on the supreme court . 
the senate passed the measure this month in a 74-25 vote . 
however , largely overlooked in the debate has been a series of proposed changes in chapter 13 that critics say would make it harder for debtors to stick with repayment plans -- the opposite effect of what supporters say they want . 
critics , including bankruptcy judges in california , north carolina , massachusetts , and florida say there is nowhere near the fraud in the system that advocates claim . 
they cite a study by the nonpartisan american bankruptcy institute , which concludes that only about 3 percent of those who wipe out their debts in chapter 7 could afford to repay a portion in chapter 13 . 
those opposed to the changes contend that most people who file for bankruptcy are truly distressed finanacially -- and say the success that courts have in collecting as much as they do under chapter 13 shows the system is working . 
according to figures from the u.s. trustee program , a justice department agency , chapter 13 debtors repaid almost $ 3.6 billion in 2003 , the latest year for which figures are available . 
by reducing what debtors owe auto lenders in this fashion , the law ensures more money for other creditors . 
`` that 's going to be a big deal , '' predicted a. thomas small , a bankruptcy judge for the eastern district of north carolina in raleigh . 
in the meantime , the debtor immediately begins making payments to a court-appointed trustee . 
todd zywicki , a law professor at george mason university in virginia , said the shift away from the `` fresh start '' philosophy is justified because another bedrock american value -- that people who incur debts should pay them -- is being sullied under the current system . 
`` if you 're confronted with a mountain of debt and have no hope of getting out from under it , you 're either going to go underground or turn to crime , '' said kenneth n. klee , a former republican congressional staffer who was one of the chief authors of the last major bankruptcy law change in 1978 and now teaches law at ucla . 
`` it 's part and parcel of the american dream. '' mr. speaker , while this bill fails to improve the bankruptcy system , the bill succeeds in being harsh , punitive and mean-spirited . 
the bill is particularly harsh on women who are often the primary care givers for their children or their parents and are the largest single group in bankruptcy ; on older americans who are the fastest growing group in bankruptcy due to medical costs ; and on children . 
parents seeking child support will compete with credit card companies and other lenders in state courts , but will have little protection and fewer resources than the large credit card companies they are up against . 
national guard and reservists make up nearly 40 percent of those serving in the iraqi theater . 
i would hope that our republican colleagues would join us in a bipartisan way to support our motion to recommit that would give some opportunities for the national guard not to be treated this way under the bankruptcy bill . 
while bankruptcy filings have increased 17 percent in the last 8 years , credit card profits have increased more than 160 percent , from $ 11 billion to more than $ 30 billion . 
in fact , the other body rejected an amendment to tell customers how much it would cost in additional interest if they make only minimum payments on their credit card bills . 
if the point is to honor a tradition in our country where people are entitled to a fresh start so they can begin contributing back to our economy and to our society , then we should uphold that ; and if people are abusing the system , existing law already covers that . 
mr. speaker , i thank the gentleman for yielding me this time , and i rise in strong support of the rule and the death tax repeal permanency act of 2005 . 
it happens to be an unfortunate anniversary in my family , but on april 13 , 1988 , we said goodbye to my father . 
now , the rich american that i saw was a man who started out in a very small business in columbus , indiana , and worked tirelessly to raise his four sons and two daughters and build a business that employed several hundred local people in support of their families . 
it is really , with the memory of my father in mind , that i rise in vigorous support of the permanent repeal of the death tax . 
and we come into this well today on behalf of small business owners and family farmers just like my dad to put to an end permanently this truly immoral death tax in america . 
in fact , they know that more than 70 percent of family businesses do not survive to a second generation ; 87 percent do not make it to a third generation . 
well , i put the majority of the blame in practical terms at the doorstep of the death tax . 
it has waged war on small business and family farmers all across america , and we will begin to reverse that in a permanent way today . 
so in the tender memory of my father , of his earnest labors , and with it in my mind the men and women who to this day labor to raise their families and build small businesses and family farms all across america that i extol the authors of this bill . 
much has been accomplished over the last few years in that regard . 
the proposal that i am offering as a substitute would double from where we are today and in a very certain and immediate way bring to $ 6 million the estate tax exclusion for couples . 
couples across this country possessing less than $ 6 million in assets , no estate tax . 
by 2009 , there could be $ 7 million in a couple 's estate . 
looking across this country , 99.7 percent of estates in this country no longer have estate tax issues under the substitute that i am advancing . 
but beyond that , going forward , there is yet another very important wrinkle in the majority proposal . 
right now in the handling of an estate , there is no capital gains tax . 
at a time when we are talking about how we address the long-term solvency of social security , to just , without a concern , pass a $ 290 billion bill to help three-tenths of 1 percent of the most affluent in this country seems to be standing priorities directly on their head . 
the very people that favor privatizing social security , which is going to add risk in the social security benefit , which is going to reduce benefits sharply because they change the inflation index going forward , that is going to reduce the benefits on our children and grandchildren , want to now run up the debt on our children and grandchildren in order to help that three-tenths of 1 percent , the very wealthiest among us . 
so we have proposed something quite different , immediate and certain estate tax relief , $ 6 million per couple , $ 3 million per individual , right now , and in 2009 , $ 7 million per couple , $ 3.5 million per individual . 
i think in the consequence of our floor discussions today it is important to talk about both concepts , the immediate and certain estate tax relief alternative that we are advancing and what we could do with the difference . 
they say this estate tax has to be repealed , that it is the most unfair thing in the world . 
that is more unfair in my opinion . 
we can make estate tax go away for 99.7 percent of the people in this country , take the balance between the bills , invest it in the social security trust fund and deal with almost half of the problem of the underfunding over the next 75 years . 
mr. speaker , i thank my colleague , the gentleman from massachusetts , for leading the debate on this important rule in this fashion . 
it is important that we talk about real facts today and , honest to goodness , some of the language does not reflect what reality would be relative to the estate tax if you would pass the pomeroy substitute and set it at $ 6 million per couple , taking care of , making estate tax completely go away for 99.7 percent of the people in this country . 
we heard about the immorality of taxing for the wealthiest three out of the 1 , 000 estates in this country . 
in my opinion , that is immoral . 
what i think we ought to have captured in this debate on estate tax is the trade-off , because they say it is just estate tax ; believe me , it is also social security . 
in context , we are looking at a 75-year solvency figure that the president has found so troublesome he wants to privatize social security . 
let us make the estate tax go away for 99.7 percent of the estates in this country . 
it brings us almost halfway there in terms of keeping all of the guarantees , while meeting the funding challenge over the next 75 years . 
that is what is advanced by the minority proposal in this debate , and i hope it will get my colleagues ' close consideration . 
mr. speaker , i am pleased to begin the presentation of the amendment in the nature of a substitute by yielding such time as he may consume to the distinguished gentleman from maryland ( mr. hoyer ) xz4001890 , the minority whip . 
we , like 2009 , take that up to $ 7 million in a joint estate circumstance . 
so as to the question he asked , i do not know the particulars of those cases , but i expect that a number , if not all of them are covered , because 99.7 percent of the estates in this country are under that amount . 
but there is a feature of the majority proposal that is not represented in our substitute , and i want to talk about it right now , and this involves the imposition of capital gains liability at the handling of an estate under the majority bill . 
i can just imagine members in the majority , some of them that might have signed that `` no new tax '' pledge that was going around last congress , just wringing their hands because they are about to vote for a tax increase , a tax increase in the form of capital gains taxation on estates . 
section 541 of the bill that the majority proposal would make permanent reads this way : termination of step-up in basis at death . 
number of estates today with capital gains issue , zero ; and that is because the taxable basis in the property is established at time of transfer in an estate . 
well , we know that there are 71 , 000 estates in the year 2011 that are likely to have reportable amounts , in other words , gross valuation over $ 1.3 million . 
it means going back in and trying to establish what the value of the property was at the time mom and dad acquired it . 
and that is well-established in the congressional record . 
because i have here the hearing , i have here the ways and means record at the time the committee considered testimony to repeal the carryover basis , the very provision they want to re-establish in tax law . 
you see , it passed once before , in 1976 . 
so says the american farm bureau in their 1979 testimony . 
it will increase the tax burden and compound the illiquidity of estates of farmers , ranchers and other family business operators who sell inherited property in the normal course of business , and i quote , and find it in the record from the national cattlemen 's association . 
so says the national federation of independent business , the very group that they have cited as trying to re-establish carryover basis in the tax code and put capital gains back on estates . 
no capital gains in the pomeroy substitute . 
you know , anyone in the accountant or tax-planning profession worrying about losing business because of the estate tax is going to be smiling broadly at the end of tonight when we pass this re-creation of capital gains tax and estates . 
in fact , the aba task force report devotes almost 70 pages to discussing the problems that exist with the new carryover basis rules in their legislation . 
the problems identified in the report include unequal treatment of capital losses , difficulty in applying basis adjustments to property sold during the administration of the estate , treatment of property with debt and excessive basis , treatment of installment loans , unequal treatment of pension assets , administrative problems with allocation to spousal property , discrimination in favor of spouses in community property states . 
mr. speaker , in light of the imbalance of time , i would be happy to have my friend from missouri burn up a little more of his time , unless he has no further speakers . 
mr. speaker , i am feeling a bit like the man in the middle as we approach this debate . 
obviously , we have heard from the other side they believe this is too low , but i would say to my friends in the majority , and listen to this carefully , those who approach this issue with an all-or-nothing mentality are likely to get nothing . 
we can not tell what is going to happen in the year 2010 . 
there is not a nickel 's worth of certainty in that . 
and we all know , because as damaging as this is to the budget in the first 10 years , with $ 290 billion of revenue loss , debt service added , this is a $ 326 billion hit to the budget in the first 10 years , look what happens in the second 10 years : $ 1.3 trillion impact in the second 10 years when we count the value of the debt service . 
do any of us think that we are really going to allow this to happen in the future years ? 
so for three-tenths of 1 percent we offer an alternative that has no capital gains , that is one-quarter of the cost , that immediately phases in estate tax relief and is far and away the superior way to go . 
with the death tax in place , that is not true . 
with the repeal of the tax , more small businesses and farms will stay in the hands of those families . 
and we see this all the time in agriculture , that when the grandparents die they have to sell off a portion of the land so that the government gets their share so that they break up the very asset that made that farm what it was . 
that is a great cause of the loss of rural communities and small-time agriculture in this country , and i think that we can all agree that that is a shameful loss to our nation . 
the death tax is a virtue tax in the sense that it penalizes work , penalizes savings and thrift in favor of large-scale consumption . 
in other words , if those same families had sold off everything and spent it , then they would not be subject to the death tax . 
but the fact that they made a decision to hold something , to build it , to grow it so that their children and grandchildren might have a farm to continue to cultivate the bread basket for the world in , then they are taxed . 
where is the fairness in that ? 
unquestionably , the death tax plays a tremendous part in that statistic . 
that is what we call it in the south , mr. speaker , where you have all of your assets tied up in things . 
during the past three congresses , the house has voted repeatedly in a bipartisan fashion to eliminate the death tax . 
small businesses and farmers , in particular , are unfairly penalized for their blood , sweat and tears -- paying taxes on already-taxed assets . 
in fact , some studies have found that it may actually cost the government and taxpayers more in administrative and compliance costs than it raises in revenue . 
mr. speaker , my rural and suburban district in western new york is home to countless small businesses and family farms . 
they 're owned by hard-working families who pay their taxes , create jobs and contribute not only to the quality of life in their communities , but to this nation 's rich heritage . 
the fact is that they paid their taxes in life -- on every acre sown , on every product sold , and on every dollar earned . 
they should n't be taxed in death , too . 
included in this bill is a sensible provision that sharply limits to $ 125 , 000 the homestead exemption that many ceos and corporate officers have used to shield their assets from creditors after they plunder their shareholders ' wealth . 
by empowering the government to go after the ill-gotten gains that crooked corporate officers tie up in offshore mansions , shareholders and pensioners who have been swindled can have their hard-earned savings returned to them . 
in addition , this bill prohibits people convicted of felonies like securities fraud from claiming an unlimited exemption when filing for bankruptcy , protecting taxpayers from having to bear the cost of corporate malfeasance . 
by agreeing to this legislation , congress will make the existing bankruptcy system a needs-based one and correct the flaw in the current system that encourages people to file for bankruptcy and walk away from debts , regardless of whether they are able to repay any portion of what they owe ; and it does this while protecting those who truly need protection . 
i commend my colleagues for their hard work on this legislation , and i strongly urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this report and help honest taxpayers by closing the loopholes in the current bankruptcy system . 
mr. speaker , i rise in strong opposition to the so-called bankruptcy abuse prevention and consumer protection act of 2005 . 
the only thing that this bill does is distort our bankruptcy laws so that working families are treated more like criminals than people in need of relief . 
instead of helping struggling families in debt , this bill erects harsh legal and monetary roadblocks for people who are trying to file bankruptcy . 
the vast majority of people who file for bankruptcy , 9 out of 10 , do so because they have either lost their job , suffered a medical emergency , or there has been a divorce or separation in their family . 
we are talking about young men and women in our armed forces returning home after serving their country in iraq . 
it is harmful to struggling families and goes against the basic policy of our bankruptcy laws , helping families in financial trouble get a fresh start . 
mr. speaker , this is actually one of the more absurd debates that i have ever heard in my life , and i think anybody who turns on the television and wonders what is going on here in congress will then conclude that the reason that this institution is held in so low regard is because we have debates like this . 
let us look at what is going on in america today . 
study after study shows that real wages for american workers are going down ; and in the last 4 years , 4 million more americans have entered the ranks of poverty . 
the richest people in america have never had it so good . 
in america today we have the most unfair distribution of wealth and income in the history of our country and of any major country on earth . 
the richest people in america said several years ago , hey , yes , we are worth billions of dollars . 
nobody in the middle class , nobody in the working class , no low-income person pays one penny in the estate tax . 
they are increasing our deficit , increasing our national debt , all on behalf of the richest people in this country . 
our motion simply shields financially distressed national guard and reservists from the means test found in s. 256 while they are in service and for the 2 years after they have transitioned back to civilian life if a substantial portion of their debt is due to their service . 
some of these patriotic americans are facing financial crisis not because they are exploiting loopholes in the bankruptcy law , they are not scheming to avoid paying their debts , they are in a financial hole their country dug for them . 
on behalf of the dav , i ask you please keep in mind the sacrifices of the brave men and women of our armed forces as you consider s. 256 , the bankruptcy abuse prevention and consumer protection act of 2005 . 
mr. speaker , what the gentleman suggested was , if someone has overwhelming medical bills , hundreds of thousands in medical bills , that they can file under chapter 7. that is not true . 
mr. speaker , pursuant to house resolution 211 , i call up the senate bill ( s. 256 ) to amend title 11 of the united states code , and for other purposes , and ask for its immediate consideration in the house . 
mr. speaker , i rise in support of s. 256 , the bankruptcy abuse prevention and consumer protection act of 2005 . 
the only winners in the current bankruptcy system are those who game the system for personal gain . 
this legislation represents the most comprehensive reform of the bankruptcy system in more than 25 years . 
as many of us know , bankruptcy reform has been subject to exhaustive congressional review for more than a decade , beginning with the establishment of a national bankruptcy review commission in 1994 . 
in addition , the bill prevents violent criminals or drug traffickers from using bankruptcy relief to evade their creditors . 
the bill closes the `` millionaire 's mansion '' loophole in the current bankruptcy code that permits corporate criminals to shield their multi-million dollar homesteads from deserving creditors . 
with respect to these reforms , the national child support enforcement association stated that s. 256 is `` crucial to the collection of child support during bankruptcy. '' some might ask why congress has been so concerned about abuse in the bankruptcy system . 
as a result , every abusive bankruptcy filing impacts hard-working americans in the form of higher interest rates and increased costs of goods and service . 
our economy and the hard-working americans who sustain it should not suffer any longer from the billions of dollars in losses associated with abusive bankruptcy filings . 
mr. speaker , this legislation not only deals with abuse in the bankruptcy system ; it includes many vital consumer protections as well . 
the bill also helps america 's family farmers and fishermen confronting economic hard times by providing more tools to assist in their bankruptcy reorganization . 
the bill includes protections for medical patients in bankruptcy health care facilities and pro-privacy provisions that protect against the unwanted disclosure of personal information . 
there are several other critical reforms contained in this comprehensive legislation , but the limits of time prevent an exhaustive recitation . 
bankruptcy reform legislation has been subject to more process , more consideration , more deliberation , more debate , and more voting than virtually any other legislative item in the past decade . 
we also have before us a historic opportunity to return a measure of fairness and accountability to the bankruptcy system in a manner that will curb bankruptcy abuse while rewarding the vast majority of hard-working americans who play by the rules and pay their bills as agreed upon . 
mr. speaker , i urge my colleagues to seize this opportunity to join me in supporting this legislation . 
mr. speaker , over the many years this legislation has been pending in the congress , many members , senators , and staff members have devoted themselves to making s. 256 a reality . 
beginning with my colleagues in the house , i would like to mention the many contributions of the chairman of the subcommittee on commercial and administrative law ( mr. cannon ) xz4000590 for his hard work on behalf of this legislation . 
in addition , i would like to mention the following staff on the judiciary committee for their contributions : phil kiko , majority committee general counsel and chief of staff ; rob tracci , chief legislative counsel and parliamentarian ; raymond smietanka , chief counsel , subcommittee on commercial and administrative law ; perry apelbaum ; david lachmann ; matt iandoli , legislative director for representative cannon ; todd thorpe , chief of staff for representative cannon ; laura vaught , deputy chief of staff for representative boucher ; jean harmann , house legislative counsel and dina ellis , counsel for the house financial services committee . 
her technical expertise in a complex area of law has resulted in dramatic improvements in successive drafts of bankruptcy reform legislation and helped establish a record of legislative history that elucidates the legislation we consider today . 
i would also like to acknowledge the countless contributions of our colleagues in the other body . 
in addition , the following individuals must also be acknowledged : harold kim and tim strachan , counsels for senator specter ; perry barber , rene augustine , and former staffer makan delrahim , counsels for senator hatch ; and ed pagano , chief of staff for senator summary of principal provisions of s. 256 , `` the bankruptcy abuse prevention and consumer protection act of 2005 '' abuse prevention : s. 256 instills a greater level of personal responsibility by closing various loopholes and eliminating incentives in the current bankruptcy system that encourage opportunistic consumer bankruptcy filings and abuse . 
debtors who have committed crimes of violence or engaged in drug trafficking will no longer be able to use bankruptcy to hide from their creditors . 
spousal and child support protections : s. 256 prioritizes the collection and payment of spousal and child support in bankruptcy cases by giving these claims the highest payment priority ( current law gives these claimants an only 7th level payment priority ) . 
it also allows state child support enforcement agencies to intercept closes the `` mansion loophole '' for greedy corporate culprits : under current bankruptcy law , debtors living in certain states can shield from their creditors virtually all of the equity in their homes . 
in light of this , some debtors actually move to these states just to take advantage of their `` mansion loophole '' laws . 
s. 256 closes this loophole for abuse by requiring a debtor to reside in the state for at least 2 years before he or she can claim that state 's homestead exemption -- the current residency requirement is only 91 days ! 
in addition , s. 256 requires a debtor 's homestead exemption to be reduced for to the extent attributable to the debtor 's fraudulent conversion of nonexempt assets ( e.g. , cash ) into a homestead exemption . 
the bill also requires debtors , after they have filed for bankruptcy , to participate in financial management instructional courses so they can hopefully avoid future financial distress . 
in addition , s. 256 requires certain monthly credit card billing statements to include specified disclosures regarding the increased interest and repayment time associated with making minimum payments . 
promotes greater certainty in the financial market place : s. 256 reduces systemic risk in the banking system and financial marketplace by minimizing the risk of disruption when parties to certain financial transactions become bankrupt or insolvent . 
the bill responds to this problem in several key respects : it more than doubles the debt eligibility limit and requires it to be periodically adjusted for inflation ; it lowers the requisite percentage of a farmer 's income that must be derived from farming operations ; and it gives farmers more flexibility with respect to how certain creditors can be repaid . 
in addition , s. 256 makes chapter 12 a permanent component of the bankruptcy laws and extends the benefits of this form of bankruptcy relief to family fishermen . 
transnational insolvencies : in response to the increasing globalization of business dealings and operations , s. 256 establishes a separate chapter under the bankruptcy code devoted to transnational insolvencies . 
privacy protections : under current law , nearly every item of information supplied by a debtor in connection with his or her bankruptcy case is made available to the public . 
s. 256 prohibits the disclosure of the names of the debtor 's minor children and requires such information to be kept in a nonpublic record , which can be made available for inspection only by the court and certain other designated entities . 
in addition , if a business debtor had a policy prohibiting it from selling `` personally identifiable information '' about its customers and the policy was in effect at the time of the bankruptcy filing , then s. 256 prohibits the sale of such information unless certain conditions are satisfied . 
protections for employees : s. 256 requires certain back pay awards granted as a result of the debtor 's violation of federal or state law to receive one of the highest payment priorities in a bankruptcy case . 
in addition , s. 256 streamlines the appointment of an erisa administrator for an employee benefit plan , under certain circumstances , to minimize the disruption that results when an employer files for bankruptcy relief . 
in light of the disaterous impact that bankruptcy cases like worldcom and enron have had on their employees , reforms that more than double current the monetary cap on wage and employee benefit claims entitled to priority under the bankruptcy code . 
other provisions would protect retirees in cases where chapter 11 debtors mr. speaker , i reserve the balance of my time . 
there is a means test that is contained in this bill , but 11 united states code , section 1307 which permits the conversion of a chapter 13 case to a chapter 7 case is not amended at all in any respect . 
any waiver of the right to convert under this subsection is unenforceable. '' so if chapter 13 is such a straight jacket , the way out is through the conversion as provided for in section 1307 . 
my friend , the gentleman from massachusetts , says that someone who is injured in iraq and comes home is not going to be protected from medical expenses . 
secondly , he says that this bill continues the millionaires ' exemption in the eight states that have unlimited exemption . 
and if this bill goes down , a corporate crook can build a multimillion dollar mansion on the intercostal waterway in florida and be able to shield that asset from bankruptcy . 
what this bill does is it does plug that unlimited exemption and it plugs it in a way that was negotiated out in a bipartisan manner in the conference committee two congresses ago with a motion that was made in that conference committee by my senior senator , herb kohl , who is a democrat . 
mr. speaker , one does not need to get a good grade in economics 101 to realize that those who pay their bills as agreed end up having to pay for the cost of debts that are ripped off in bankruptcy . 
we all pay for bankruptcy abuse in higher down payments , higher interest rates and higher costs for goods and services. '' the credit union national association , which is a national organization of nonprofit credit unions that are owned by their members , said that , as of 2002 , they lost over $ 3 billion from bankruptcies since congress started its consideration of bankruptcy reform legislation in 1998 ; and cuna estimates that over 40 percent of all credit union losses in 2004 will be bankruptcy related , and those losses will total approximately $ 900 million . 
they are owned by their members , and those members have to pay additional costs of the services of their own credit unions because of the huge write-offs that have been described in this report . 
now if my friends on the other side of the aisle were so concerned about bankruptcy abuse and the fact that this bill does not deal with the problem , they could have spent the time drafting an amendment in the nature of a substitute . 
they were offered by the committee on rules and i requested the committee on rules to make such a substitute in order , but , no , all they want to do is criticize , attack and come up with no positive alternatives . 
if this bill goes down , eight states and the district of columbia will continue to have an unlimited homestead exemption where corporate crooks can hide their assets from bankruptcy in a homestead and , once they get their discharge , sell that mansion and go off on their merry way . 
we have heard an awful lot about asset protection trusts that become the law in a number of states . 
well , the people who are complaining about medical bills put a tin ear on to the testimony that has been submitted in this extensive hearing record . 
in the last congress , the congress enacted the servicemembers civil relief act , public law 108-189 , which gives protection to people on active duty from collection of these debts by those that they have become indebted to , and this law puts a cap on interest at an annual rate of 6 percent on debts incurred prior to a person 's entry into active military duty service . 
let us not listen to the inaccurate statements that have been made by people who have been opposed to bankruptcy reform beginning 8 years ago , long before the military actions in iraq and afghanistan . 
mr. speaker , i rise in opposition to the motion to recommit . 
people who fall behind the lines of the needs-based test will continue to have bankruptcy protection under chapter 7 as is provided in the current law . 
the times also recognized that the news was apparently slow in reaching those who would have to interpret and enforce the law , which apparently includes the people who are offering this motion to recommit . 
already there is in law , signed by president bush in 2003 , we have responded to the special financial burdens that members of the military may encounter . 
crs has said the servicemembers civil relief act provides protection for servicemembers in the event their military service impedes their ability to meet financial obligations incurred before their entry into active military service , as well as during that service . 
i am in favor of the hulshof bill to repeal the death tax simply because it is the right thing to do . 
to go in and tax almost half of someone 's estate because they have accumulated a lot and to make death an incident of taxation is wrong . 
mr. speaker , i rise in support of h.r. 8 , the death tax repeal permanency act , although the base bill does not address the estate tax in the manner i believe to be most prudent . 
in 2003 , congressman doug bereuter and i introduced the estate tax relief act , which would increase the estate tax exclusion to $ 10 million and lower the top rate to the level as the top income tax rate ( currently 35 percent ) . 
because estate and gift taxes have had devastating effects on small businesses -- many of which are forced to liquidate assets simply to pay taxes ranging from 35 to 55 percent of the value of the business -- i think we need to provide significant relief in this area . 
in the last congress , i voted for today 's base bill because if it is not enacted the estate tax , which is being phased-out over a period between 2001 and 2010 , will return in 2011 with an exemption of just $ 675 , 000 and a top rate of 55 percent . 
mr. chairman , i rise in support of s. 256 , the bankruptcy abuse prevention and consumer protection act . 
it is a basic principle of commerce in our country that when a person makes an obligation to pay someone for a good or service , they do so . 
we ought to address the fact that our nation had over 1.6 million bankruptcy filings last year , and an estimated $ 44 billion in debts are discharged annually . 
when creditors are unable to collect money owed to them , we all pay the cost in the form of higher costs , higher interest rates and higher downpayments . 
we require the men and women in uniform to risk the ultimate sacrifice ; and from our richest families , we say zero sacrifice under the estate tax . 
they want to vote for a bill that takes $ 290 billion out of the treasury in its first 4 plus years and about $ 70 billion a year thereafter and make it impossible for the federal government to ever give any relief for those other taxes . 
so it is not just a loss to the federal treasury , it is a loss to our hospitals and a loss to our universities , who are strangely silent on this bill because they are afraid of angering 1/4 of 1 percent of the families in the united states who happen to be a huge chunk of their donors . 
under their bill , more compliance work and sharp restrictions on the step up in basis . 
they have lost their spouse , and now you want them to lose their step up in basis as well . 
$ 290 billion in the first 4 plus years . 
we turn to our men and women in uniform and say , stand ready to make the ultimate sacrifice ; and we turn to the richest families in america and say , you should make a zero sacrifice . 
this bill is part of an overall plan that keeps in effect the electrical tax , the sales tax , the telephone tax , the income tax , the payroll tax , the marriage tax , the cable tax , and the fuel tax . 
allowing corporations to avoid american taxes just by renting a hotel room in the bahamas , $ 8 billion . 
telling our soldiers in the field that it is the billionaire families who are the ones who have sacrificed too much for america , priceless . 
mr. speaker , in the last 2 years , the economy has created over 3 million new jobs . 
we must ensure that debtors actually belong in bankruptcy and are not using the system to avoid their obligations . 
this bill stops abuse by eliminating incentives in the current bankruptcy system that actually encourage consumer bankruptcy filings and abuse . 
this bill also contains provisions i support to address those who abuse state homestead laws and attempt to shelter their wealth in multi-million dollar mansions . 
mr. speaker , i rise in strong opposition to s. 256 , legislation that will make it harder for individuals to eliminate their debts after liquidating most of their assets by filing bankruptcy . 
in fact , women are the fastest growing group to file for bankruptcy . 
more than 1 million women will find themselves in bankruptcy court this year , outnumbering men by about 150 , 000 . 
in addition , the bill would make it much harder for women to collect child support payments from men who file for bankruptcy because the bill gives credit card companies , finance companies , auto lenders and other commercial creditors rights to a greater share of the debtor 's income during and after bankruptcy . 
another huge tax cut or break for the less than 1 percent of the richest americans while they turn their back and cut medicaid , refuse to recognize that social security is not in crisis but needs some adjustment , cut head start , cut programs for housing , cut programs for the environment , fail to provide the promised benefits to our 140 , 000 servicemen in iraq , turn their back on all that is american to give a few dollars to the very richest of americans . 
i find that many of the republicans who have actually worked for a living at some point in their lives , and not just either inherited money or been at the trough of the government , actually oppose this bill . 
we could get rid of the doughnut hole in the poorly constructed medicare drug benefit . 
we could eliminate the proposed cuts to medicaid which will hurt the poorest children in this country . 
i might add to my friend from missouri of his people in the lumber business , if their children can not get the first $ 7 million handed to them and then get a 50 percent down payment on the balance of the business and be given 10 years at less than 6 percent to pay off the balance of that , they are probably too dumb and would lose the business in no time at all anyway . 
in fact , 99.7 percent of all estates would be exempt from the estate tax if we just extend the tax as it applies in 2009 . 
they can only show that gives billions , $ 300 to almost $ 1 trillion over 20 years , to the very smallest , most select group of rich people in this country . 
it is indeed a follow on of the republican mantra , give money to the rich , give it to them in huge amounts and cut back on education , cut back on health care , do not help the environment , cut back on support for our troops and cut back on improving america 's infrastructure , all in the name of helping the few rich who may be contributors to the republican party . 
mr. speaker , i yield myself enough time to remind the historians here that it was the republicans in the 1800s who established the original inheritance tax to prevent a nobility class from forming , an idle nobility class , in this country . 
rather , it provides a simple , temporary 90-day delay in bankruptcy proceedings once a servicemember is released from active duty . 
it is simply a reaction to a real problem that has been highlighted in countless news stories , by the national military families association , disabled veterans of america , and individual servicemembers . 
i thank my dear colleague for her efforts in this behalf . 
mr. speaker , in 1997 , jennifer dunn , a republican from washington , and i started this debate on the estate tax . 
at that time the country was in much different shape financially than it is today . 
we did not want to be like england where whoever got control of the land and money , and 1 , 450 still had it 26 generations later and people who were hardworking could not break through that ceiling because of the nobility that was enshrined in their tax code . 
it is because , as i look in the faces of these young people , you are looking at a house , a senate and an administration that has embarked since 2001 on the most radical , irresponsible financial riverboat gamble that this country has ever seen . 
there has been no political american leadership that has ever done what this group of people who currently hold the power of government here in washington have done to this country . 
since april of 2001 , in your name and mine , this government has borrowed $ 1.2 trillion in hard money . 
a former official of the people 's bank of china , the country 's central bank and now an economist in hong kong , was recently quoted as saying that the u.s. dollar is now at the mercy of asian governments . 
in your name , we are borrowing at the rate of $ 13 , 300 a second . 
since this debate started , in our names we have borrowed $ 48 million and given the bill to those little children sitting up there . 
if you take thousand-dollar bills and stack them up like that , to get to a million dollars it is a foot high ; to get to a billion dollars , it is as high as the empire state building ; and to get to a trillion dollars , which is what has been borrowed in the last 46 months in your name , it is a thousand times as high as the empire state building , one thousand dollar bills like this . 
what we have done has created a financial vulnerability vis-a-vis the rest of world that is every bit as big a security interest as anything else we are going to face in the future . 
mr. speaker , in pertinent part , section 202 of s. 256 , the `` bankruptcy abuse prevention and consumer protection act of 2005 , '' amends section 524 of the bankruptcy code by making the discharge injunction inapplicable to certain acts by a creditor having a claim secured by a lien on real property that is the debtor 's principal residence , so long as the creditor satisfies certain criteria . 
first , the creditor 's act must be in the ordinary course of business between the creditor and debtor . 
second , such act is limited to seeking periodic payments associated with a valid security interest in lieu of pursuit of in rem relief to enforce the lien . 
section 202 was included because congress recognized that there are many consumer debtors who , despite filing bankruptcy , desire to repay secured obligations in order to retain their principal residences . 
moreover , despite the express reference in this provision to liens on real property , section 202 should not , by negative inference or implication , be construed as limiting any rights that may have developed through existing case law , or otherwise , that permit secured creditors to send , or consumer debtors to request and receive , monthly billing statements or payment coupons for claims secured by real or personal property . 
see , e.g. , ramirez v. gmac ( in re ramirez ) , 280 b.r. 253 ( c.d . 
2002 ) ; henry v. associates home equity services , inc ( in re henry ) , 266 b.r. 457 ( bankr . 
if we want to talk about values , as so many people did in the last couple of months leading up to this , let us talk about the value of supporting one 's family and supporting one 's community . 
eighty percent of court cases are commercial in nature . 
according to the small business administration , in 2001 in the dayton , ohio , metro area , which is in my district , nearly 62 , 000 people worked for businesses that employ less than 20 people . 
three of my constituents , jenell ross ; her mother , norma ; and her brother rob , run a small business , ross motor cars in centerville , ohio . 
when jenell 's father unexpectedly passed away in 1997 , the ross family received a tax bill for nearly half the value of their family business . 
i would like to tell their story in jenell ross 's words . 
`` when he died unexpectedly in 1997 , the overwhelming responsibility of keeping the family business afloat fell squarely '' to us . 
we could never have prepared ourselves for the shock of receiving a tax bill nearly half the value of the dealership , where nearly 90 percent '' of the assets were `` tied up in nonliquid assets such as inventory , equipment , buildings , and land . 
mr. speaker , i do not support this bill in its present form -- and , since the republican leadership has made it impossible for the house to even consider any amendment , i have no choice but to vote against it . 
in recent years , colorado has been one of the states with the greatest increase in bankruptcy filings . 
so , i am not opposed to any change in the current bankruptcy laws , and in fact i think some of the bill 's provisions would make reasonable adjustments in those laws . 
in particular , i think that the bill should have been amended to more appropriately address the financial problems being encountered by some members of the regular armed services as well as by members of the national guard who have been called to active duty in iraq or elsewhere . 
in fact , this bill overly penalizes working families and takes no action against reckless and predatory lending . 
mr. speaker , in addition to my reservations about the legislation , i also strongly object to the rule under which s. 256 is being debated . 
as to the substance of the legislation , it is no secret that the number of bankruptcies has risen considerably in the past twenty years . 
in 1980 , there were 330 , 000 bankruptcies in the united states . 
in 2003 , that number rose to over 1.66 million . 
the number of filings has dropped 3.8 percent in 2004 down to 1.59 million . 
though this is headed in the right direction , i understand that more has to be done . 
it imposes a rigid means test , endangers child support , and allows millionaires to continue to shelter their assets in mansions . 
these provisions result in an unbalanced and punitive measure that will have a devastating effect on women , the unemployed , and the elderly . 
reform in this bill is skewed toward restricting the consumer 's access to relief from overwhelming debt , while making it easier on those creditors who encourage additional unwise borrowing . 
more specifically , one loophole in the bankruptcy bill leaves the victims of domestic violence and their children left with no resources should they file for bankruptcy . 
please note , this relief would have only been available if a domestic violence debtor is certified , under penalty of perjury , that the debtor was in fact a victim of domestic abuse and that their physical well-being or the physical well-being of the debtor 's child would be threatened if this debtor were evicted . 
they send them all of this unsolicited mail , and they telephone them unrelentlessly to get them involved in taking these credit cards . 
mr. speaker , those of us who started this process 6 years or so ago in the good faith belief that there were problems with the bankruptcy system , in the sense that people were gaming the system , and felt that there needed to be genuine reform can not help but be disappointed today because , in the process , we have lost sight of the objective of reforming to do away with the sinister influences and the advantageous corruption that is going on in the system . 
the second thing is we have built in a set of perverse incentives for easy credit now . 
and for people above the means test there is no incentive for lenders to be responsible in their lending practices , because they know now they have this system that is going to protect them from people that they have made irresponsible loans to . 
i have supported this measure in the past and have introduced similar legislation to make the death tax repeal permanent . 
i believe it is important that we accomplish the goal of passing this in the house and the senate and seeing this bill enacted into law . 
i have spoken in the past about a constituent of mine , danny sexton of kissimmee , fl and owner of kissimmee florist . 
he joined me several years ago in washington to highlight the adverse impact the death tax had on his family business . 
mr. sexton , who comes from a family of florists , inherited his uncle 's flower shop and was faced with paying almost $ 160 , 000 in estate taxes . 
the people who worked in mr. sexton 's florist were not rich , but they lost their jobs because of the death tax . 
in a recent survey conducted by the national federation of independent businesses , 89 percent of small business owners favored permanent repeal of the death tax . 
in current law , the death tax is phased-out , completely repealed in 2010 . 
but that is not good enough because in 2011 , the tax reemerges in full force . 
the bill before us preserves that right for those individuals who simply get in over their heads and have no other way out unfortunately , some dishonest individuals have taken advantage of our bankruptcy laws by hiding assets , racking up debt in anticipation of filing for bankruptcy , using bankruptcy as a financial planning tool , and walking away from that which they owe . 
mr. speaker , over the last 18 months the house leadership has passed bills that are windfalls for the pharmaceutical industry , big oil , and they have given massive tax breaks to corporations while the deficit in this country continues to grow by records . 
this is resulting in severe economic hardships , business closures , homes foreclosures and bills unpaid . 
but we 've done this several times in the past and each time it has gotten bogged down in the other body . 
small businesses create two-thirds of all jobs in the united states , and 40 percent of gdp in the united states is generated by small businesses . 
mr. speaker , i rise today in support of the bankruptcy abuse prevention and consumer protection act of 2005 . 
mr. speaker , the bankruptcy abuse prevention and consumer protection act reforms existing bankruptcy law to stem the rise in bankruptcy abuse while maintaining its protections for those who really need them . 
the death tax began in 1916 in order to fund world war i , a noble cause but a cause that has long since passed . 
mr. speaker , i rise today in support of this rule and h.r. 8 . 
i applaud the efforts of the leadership and the gentleman from missouri in bringing forward h.r. 8 to finally bury the death tax once and for all . 
one thing i have learned in the short time i have sat here is that the democrats really look at the person whom this bill would affect , and , by the way , i do not think any of them are watching this on tv right now because they are all probably at work , but they are looking at the person whom this bill would affect as someone who got up early , worked hard all his life , looked after his family , built infrastructure , saved money , put capital back into this system , provided jobs , benefits , health care for people , and the democrats look at this individual as a gift who keeps on giving . 
anyone can work hard and be whatever they want to be in this country . 
it allows people who earn that money to keep more of it in their pocket . 
we have seen this in the reagan tax cuts that led to the boom of the 1990s and in this president 's tax cuts that have brought us out of the recession that this country experienced after 9/11 . 
and most times the assets of a family business are not in cash , or easily so . 
when a family business is hit with an estate tax , it often requires the selling of a large amount of inventory or other assets in order to pay the debt . 
more than 70 percent of small family businesses do not last beyond the second generation , and the estate tax plays a large part in that . 
if their assets are not in cash , as in most family businesses they are not , they have to make a huge burden and sacrifice that they are not ready for by having to get somebody else to advise them about how to take care of their families and their children . 
and in spite of all this , the death tax does not even generate that much revenue or `` windfall profit '' for the government , yes , a `` windfall profit '' for the government , while placing this huge burden on the families of this country . 
the idea of the tax coming back in 2011 is amazing . 
although i was not in congress when the phase-out of the death tax began , i am thrilled to be here today to cosponsor and vote for it to be completely eliminated . 
in louisiana , our family-owned farms have been faced with decreasing profitability and in many instances the death tax is an additional burden that they can not carry ; this tax is a leading cause of the dissolution for thousands of family-run businesses across the country . 
it also diverts resources from investment in capital , slowing research and development at a time when our country is facing growing competition around the world . 
compliance costs each year can be almost as high as the tax itself , around $ 22 billion in 2003 ; thus every dollar raised by the death tax is $ 2 that could have been invested in capital and new jobs . 
the rate of taxation is as high as 47 % , and this is in addition to the taxes that were already paid on the assets subject to this tax . 
the death tax is the largest threat to the vitality of family-owned businesses and farms because most of their owners have the entire value of their business or farm in their estate . 
i think it is a bit disingenuous to say in a loud tone , demanding an answer to some rhetorical question , and then demand , well , i hear none , when all of us here are observing the rules and not interrupting . 
she died in july of 1986 , and shortly thereafter land was dumped on the market . 
if anybody in the family wanted anything , we had to show up at the auction and buy it . 
so if you want to talk about the death tax in real facts , here it is . 
mr. speaker , today i rise in support of permanently repealing the death tax . 
i would like to thank the gentleman from missouri for his leadership on this issue and his good timing , for in 2 days the tax man cometh . 
as i look at these young people in the gallery today , i say to them , this bill is about you . 
it is about the youth in this country . 
in addition to being bad policy , the death tax is morally wrong . 
i could tell you about the berdolls from austin , texas , in my district who , after paying off a 30-year mortgage , spent 20 more years paying this unfair tax burden . 
mr. chairman , i rise today in opposition to the rule on h.r. 1817 , the homeland security authorization act for fy2006 . 
in april , the department of homeland security inspector general ( dhsig ) and the government accountability office ( gao ) both released reports that indicate that our airport screening system still needs improvement . 
the recent dhs ig report clearly stated that the `` lack of improvements since our last audit indicates that significant improvement in performance may not be possible without greater use of technology. '' further , the tsa concurred with the 9/11 commission recommendation that we must `` expedite the installation of advanced ( in-line ) baggage screening equipment. '' in addition , in-line baggage screening systems have a much higher throughput than stand-alone systems . 
the tsa and airport operators rely on commitments in letters of intent ( lois ) as their principal method for funding the modification of airport facilities to incorporate in-line baggage screening systems . 
tsa further estimated that it could recover its initial investment in the in-line systems at these airports in a little over one year . 
in total , the gao reports that 86 of 130 airports surveyed are planning or are considering installing in-line baggage screening systems throughout or at a portion of their airports . 
yet , the tsa has stated that it currently does not have sufficient resources in its budget to fund any additional lois .

3. the amendment referred to in section 2 is as follows : amendment to h.r. 1817 offered by mr. barrow xz4006280 of georgia and mr. markey xz4002530 of massachusetts at the end of title v of the bill , insert the following ( and conform the table of contents of the bill accordingly ) : & lt ; p & gt ; sec .

& lt ; p & gt ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; ( c ) a material that is highly explosive ; and & lt ; p & gt ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; ( d ) any other material designated by the secretary to be extremely hazardous . 
i also thank the committee on rules for making in order an amendment by myself and the gentleman from florida ( mr. mica ) xz4002730 that will help perfect the federal flight deck officer program . 
we still do not have secondary barriers in the planes . 
my colleague , the ranking democrat on the subcommittee on aviation , wanted to offer an amendment to mandate that the taxes we are collecting from the traveling public to pay for enhanced security at the airports ; that is , to put in-line explosives detection systems at airports that do not have it across america to find explosives in checked bags , and possibly that same equipment could be used for cargo on those planes , was not allowed . 
the last wakeup call we are probably ever going to get before the day when planes start falling out of the sky was in russia where two terrorists , women , boarded planes with explosives , we do not know exactly whether they were in their carry-on bags or whether they were wearing suicide belts , but here in the united states of america we are doing nothing to find suicide belts or explosives in bags . 
yet aviation was attacked and aviation in russia was attacked by what i think , as does the chairman of the committee , is the most likely future threat , which is explosives . 
we need to move ahead with more robust acquisition of that equipment in the near future and this bill does not mandate that . 
the president refused to create a homeland security cabinet-level position or department until one day when an fbi agent was spilling her guts here in washington , d.c. , to a committee and karl rove wrote out the plan on the back of a napkin . 
congress is just starting to make sense of what the department of homeland security will be in the future . 
mr. speaker , i thank my friend for yielding me this time , and i rise in strong support of this rule and the underlying legislation . 
the fact that when we refer to men and women in uniform on the front line , they are no longer just the men and women in our armed forces , they are now men and women who wear the uniforms of firefighters and law enforcement officers . 
we have focused on ensuring that people who pose a terrorist threat to us are not able to get documents that have been easily fabricated in the past . 
frankly , i will say that we are continuing to work on that , and i urge my colleagues to join in cosponsoring h.r. 98 , which will help us produce a counterfeit-proof social security card so we can diminish the flow of illegal immigration with the magnet of jobs that draws people across our southern border and instead allow our border patrol , which is increased in this authorizing legislation , to focus their attention on criminals and those who pose a terrorist threat to the united states of america . 
he was unable to serve on the committee in this congress because of the exclusivity of the committee on rules , but as the gentleman from california ( mr. cox ) xz4000830 pointed out , he is serving as the committee on rules liaison focusing on these very important new homeland security issues . 
we will be having a full 5 hours of debate on this issue , and i am pleased we made in order a democratic substitute which is 221 pages long , a full substitute which frankly includes many of the amendments that have been proposed by both republicans and democrats . 
a number of those are included in the substitute . 
i am also very proud of the fact that we were with the daughter , son-in-law and grandson of our distinguished ranking minority member , the gentlewoman from rochester , new york ( ms. slaughter ) xz4003780 , and we were able to make in order two amendments which the gentlewoman has proposed to the committee . 
i will say that of those 25 amendments , 13 of them have been offered by democrats , made in order , 10 by republicans , and two are bipartisan amendments with democrats and republicans coming together to deal with this issue . 
but the mere passage of this legislation , the mere passage of this legislation and moving it to the president 's desk will , i believe , help us address a lot of the concerns that some whose amendments were not made in order have been trying to address . 
i appreciate my colleagues ' support in this effort . 
some of the vital features of h.r. 1817 , the homeland security authorization act , include funding to train and prepare first responders , improvements in cyber security , improvements in container security and enhanced border security . 
most importantly , i am pleased the rule we passed last night allows the gentleman from georgia ( mr. norwood ) xz4002960 to have his amendment made in order . 
the problem of illegal immigration has grown in part because local and state authorities have been uncertain of the jurisdiction regarding the apprehension , detention and deportation of illegal aliens . 
sheriffs departments throughout my congressional district have been burdened with unnecessary expenses in detaining and housing illegal alien criminals prior to ice involvement . 
but it is not just the gentleman from florida ( mr. mica ) xz4002730 and i. it is the state department which released a report saying that shoulder-fired missiles are the leading cause of loss of life in commercial aviation around the world . 
they were used in december of 2003 against an israeli jetliner in kenya . 
there are hundreds of thousands of these systems available around the world in the hands of 27 separate terrorist groups including al qaeda . 
if a single shoulder-fired missile is fired at an american aircraft , mr. speaker , we are not going to be worried about $ 115 million in this bill . 
mr. speaker , i rise in opposition to the structured rule only insofar as it restricts both the number of amendments made in order and the time allowed for debate of such a grave piece of legislation . 
just yesterday , we in the house passed the appropriations act for fy 2006 , h.r. 2360 , by a margin of 424-1 . 
i joined my committee colleagues in considering this bill from its incipiency as it passed in both the committees on homeland security on april 28 , 2005 and judiciary on may 12 , 2005 unanimously by voice vote . 
during the 13-hour homeland security committee markup session that ended at 11 : 15 p.m. , i was able to secure sincere commitments from the majority leadership to work with me for inclusion of some of my major initiatives : funding and more clearly defining the citizen corps and the citizen corps councils -- which will include consideration of a stand-alone bill that i will introduce shortly ; and increasing capacity for historically black colleges and universities , hispanic serving institutions , and tribal institutions in homeland security procurement and in employment with the department of homeland security . 
in addition , i was fortunate to have had my amendment , co-sponsored by the gentlelady from california , ms. lofgren , that seeks to authorize the funding of programs for the education of minorities in the areas of cyberscience , research , and development to close the gap in achievement in those areas and to make america better equipped to fight terrorism overall . 
i hope that my colleagues will keep that in mind as we work to debate the amendments that have been made in order . 
mr. speaker , i rise in opposition to this restrictive rule which does not make in order several key amendments that could go a long way to enhancing our security efforts and addressing serious vulnerabilities . 
case in point : the cargo security amendment offered by the gentleman from massachusetts ( mr. markey ) xz4002530 and just spoken of by the gentleman from connecticut ( mr. shays ) xz4003700 . 
while it is not as far reaching as many of us had hoped , h.r. 1817 takes several critical steps in improving our nation 's security and preparedness . 
it authorizes sufficient funding to hire an additional 2 , 000 border patrol agents , which will help us meet the goal of 10 , 000 new agents over 5 years set forth in last year 's intelligence reform bill . 
the measure also streamlines the background check system for those working in sensitive positions , creates an assistant secretary for cybersecurity , and requires reform of the homeland security alert system so that more specific and targeted information can be provided to those who need it . 
finally , this bill will improve our intelligence and information capabilities by allowing new recruiting tools to attract the best-qualified analysts and mandating increased coordination in the dissemination of threat information to state , local , and private sector officials . 
that is why i will be supporting a substitute amendment offered later today by the gentleman from mississippi ( mr. in closing , mr. speaker , let me again thank the gentleman from california ( chairman cox ) and the gentleman from mississippi ( mr. thompson ) xz4004021 , ranking member , for their hard work on this legislation . 
these are men and women who were there for us on 9/11 and now we have turned a cold shoulder to them in their time of need . 
it is modeled after the disaster area health and environmental monitoring act , h.r. 5329 in the 108th congress . 
this amendment would send a message to future responders that if you risk your life in responding to a disaster , we will be there for you if you get sick . 
for example , one of the amendments would have been one made by the gentleman from connecticut ( mr. shays ) xz4003700 and myself which would have ensured that all cargo which is placed upon passenger planes in the united states was screened , so when the people in this gallery and people around the country step on planes they have to take off their shoes , their bags go through , they are screened , their bags are put in the belly of the plane , they are screened , but the cargo , the cargo , which is placed on the very same plane , is not screened . 
that on a plane is where the least resistance is , in the cargo bay . 
it is wrong for the republicans not to have a debate about this incredible , glaring vulnerability in passenger aircraft as hundreds of millions of americans put their families on planes , especially as we are nearing the fourth anniversary of 9/11 . 
the republicans would not put in order an amendment that would ensure that a rule-making by the federal government would be put in place in order to make sure that we would increase the security for the shipment of these hazardous materials through the cities and towns of the united states of america . 
mr. speaker , the republican leadership in the committee on rules have done it again . 
last night , on a party-line vote , the republicans in the committee on rules refused to allow the house to consider two important amendments which would have improved safety on airplanes and would have notified the flying public about the safety of the airplanes they fly on . 
yesterday , the gentleman from massachusetts ( mr. markey ) xz4002530 asked that the committee on rules make in order an amendment that would have required all cargo to be screened within 3 years . 
mr. speaker , i do not think that is too much to ask for , but the republican leadership in the committee on rules decided not to make these amendments in order . 
i asked the distinguished chairman of the committee on rules why these amendments were not made in order , and all he could say is they decided not to . 
mr. speaker , legislation on homeland security should result in a safer public . 
unfortunately , the leadership is going in exactly the wrong direction when they denied these two amendments from being made in order . 
mr. speaker , i intend to support the rule , but i think it is very important that at this juncture in proceeding with this important homeland security authorization that some things are said and also some items for the record are noted . 
sometimes in homeland security we spend a lot of money and we do not get a great deal of results . 
i view , as chairman of the house subcommittee on aviation , one of the greatest threats that we face other than a suicide bomber or several of them getting on planes , which they can easily do in our flawed system today , i view the second greatest threat as shoulder-launch missiles . 
with the conflict in the world , particularly in the middle east , thousands of these shoulder-launched missiles have gone on the market . 
yesterday we were wise in appropriating what the administration requested for funding the program , but this authorization is lacking . 
i would have preferred to have his amendment in here . 
my purpose for being here on may 18 , 2005 is to remind us that they missed in kenya an israeli plane in november 2002 with many passengers . 
they missed in iraq in 2003 a dhl plane that also could have been taken down by shoulder-launched missiles . 
ladies and gentlemen of the house , we have been very fortunate so far and we can not be remiss in making available the best technology to protect the traveling public . 
i regret that the gentleman from new york 's amendment was not included in this . 
as good as the bill is , however , i must rise in opposition to the rule . 
it would be a national tragedy if we had to wait until another attack similar to madrid to occur in the united states in order to commit the resources necessary to properly secure our rail and transit systems . 
enhanced detection capabilities , communications equipment and redundancy in critical operating control functions could allow for a quicker shutdown and evacuation of a passenger rail transit system exposed to multiple attacks thereby significantly reducing the causality rate . 
the economic consequences to a major metropolitan region would be devastating , not to mention the impact on the federal government if an attack occurred in washington , dc . 
yet , no funds have been allocated to perform a comprehensive decontamination demonstration project in a transit or rail environment . 
local emergency responders in urban areas with potential targets of key infrastructure and national icons understand this threat , but are limited on what they can do to prevent an attack . 
this presumption is now being tested in the courts . 
the amendment would have expanded what is already in place , called the `` american shield initiative , '' to ensure that every inch of the borders is monitored at all times , either through technology or resources . 
unfortunately , the committee on rules voted against making this amendment in order on a straight party-line vote . 
so when we talk about common sense , i stand here this morning wondering what in the world are we thinking when we do not want to have an amendment like this that gives us a long-term strategy for knowing what this congress needs to do to reinforce and secure this nation 's border . 
regrettably , it was not made in order . 
mr. speaker , i often wonder if common sense and congress have anything in common . 
it provides that in lieu of the amendments recommended by the committee on homeland security , the committee on energy and commerce , and the committee on the judiciary now printed in the bill , the amendment in the nature of a substitute printed in part a of the committee on rules report shall be considered as the original bill for the purpose of amendment and shall be considered as read . 
it waives all points of order against the amendment in the nature of a substitute printed in part a of the committee on rules report and makes in order only those amendments printed in part b of the committee on rules report . 
these amendments may only be offered in the order printed in the report and only by the member designated in the report . 
they shall be considered as read , debatable for the time specified in the report equally divided and controlled by the proponent and an opponent , and shall not be subject to amendment or a demand for the division of the question in the house or in the committee of the whole . 
finally , this rule waives all points of order against the amendments printed in part b of the committee on rules report and provides for one motion to recommit with or without instructions . 
mr. speaker , i rise today in strong support of this rule and its underlying legislation , the first ever homeland security authorization legislation . 
through the authorization of over $ 34 billion in homeland security spending in 2006 , this legislation will ensure that our nation 's highest funding priorities are met . 
it also includes a number of other legislative and oversight measures to strengthen and improve the safety of americans here at home , including : deploying counterterrorism technologies within 90 days so that federal , state , local , and private sector officials can prevent domestic terror ; funding 2 , 000 additional border patrol agents ; assessing the effectiveness of operations at the departments of customs and border protection and immigration and customs enforcement so that spending on these programs is efficient and effective ; consolidating the current background check system , so that individuals can be prescreened by checking their names and biometric identifiers against terrorist watch lists and other criminal databases ; adopting risk-based cargo screening , and expanding the number of foreign ports where customs and border patrol agents screen incoming containers from 36 to approximately 50 ports ; improving information analysis and infrastructure protection recruiting ; improving nuclear and biological intelligence ; establishing a one-stop shop within the department of homeland security for reliable , comprehensive , and accessible open-source intelligence information and analysis ; providing better information to local leaders by requiring that any threats be communicated in a manner that limits confusion and operational conflicts ; clarifying the color-based threat system so that specific information is given directly to regions , states , localities , and private sector industries ; creating a national terrorism exercise program to coordinate and establish minimum standards for all federal , state , and local terrorism drills ; and providing for greater federal , state , and local homeland operations collaboration that needs to take place . 
by providing leadership and guidance on these issues and many others , chairman cox and his committee have provided this house with a product that i believe is effective in providing for the security of our homeland , which deserves the support of every single member of this body . 
the chairman , the gentleman from california , not only listened to them but he worked with the chairman of the committee on homeland security , the gentleman from california ( mr. cox ) xz4000830 , on perfecting this bill by adding in amendments . 
we have had a number of our colleagues make observations , just as the gentleman from oregon did , about the importance of not only the debate that takes place here in the house but also about our desire to make homeland security even better , more robust , more dynamic , aiming at the threat . 
we know that we talked yesterday in the committee on rules about the canadian border and how the canadian border needs the attention that they not only deserve but also with the flow of goods and services with the economies that are affected and products and services that are denied when the backlogs occur . 
it just makes me very proud today to see our members who are able to cogently come up with not only good answers and better decision-making processes but an abiding faith in what we are doing here today . 
i think the committee on rules was wise in what it did . 
the committee on rules did not put it in the bill , but it is not in the democrat substitute either , so the democrat leadership chose not to include that in their substitute . 
for those members who are interested , air cargo will be in the substitute ; it will be in section 519 . 
i know we all have strong feelings about a lot of things , and sometimes someone could say we may not be right but we are never in doubt . 
i want to say i am not in doubt on this issue , and i think i am right . 
i think it is an outrage that we do not inspect the cargo that is in the belly of a passenger aircraft . 
and i think it is an outrage , frankly , that the gentleman from massachusetts ' ( mr. markey ) xz4002530 amendment was not made in order so we could at least debate this . 
and we worked on an amendment , and we put and got in the bill a few years ago that there had to be deadlines for eventually inspecting all baggage that went in the belly of an aircraft . 
and the gentleman from massachusetts ( mr. markey ) xz4002530 informs me , and i did not know it , that 22 percent of what is in the belly of an aircraft is cargo uninspected . 
if the argument is that we do not have the technology , which we do , or we do not have enough of the technology , which is right , we allowed under the gentleman from massachusetts ' ( mr. markey ) xz4002530 amendment for a 3-year phase-in : 35 percent the first year , 65 in the second , and then 100 percent in the third year . 
but if one still did not want to vote for that bill , we asked for another amendment to be made in order . 
even that amendment was not made in order . 
i got the call at 11 in the morning that said she thinks her daughter was on this aircraft but 30 kids were not , 30 people were not ; and she hoped and prayed her daughter was one who could not get on it . 
mr. speaker , famed writer and political commentator george orwell once wrote that `` people sleep peaceably in their beds at night only because rough men stand ready to do violence on their behalf. '' that statement should have a special resonance for americans in today 's world . 
we are fighting a new kind of war every day here in america . 
our struggle against terror is one that requires us to focus our resources inward like no time in our history , because today the battlefields are the streets and sidewalks of this country and not some faraway land . 
with such a weighty mandate , i would like to congratulate the committee on homeland security in putting together their first committee authorization . 
but i would have wished today for an open rule , and we are still faced with serious issues of accountability and trust in the management of the department of homeland security . 
this is in no small part as a result of the bush administration 's unwillingness to fill critical job vacancies at the senior levels of the agency . 
in fact , the department of homeland security has had two secretaries and three deputy secretaries in 2 years . 
for example , in my district , the peace bridge , which connects buffalo to canada , continues to face obstacles in moving to alleviate traffic congestion . 
we recently discovered that the infamous homeland security terror alerts , which were raised so often in the months leading up to the presidential election , and rarely since , if ever , were repeatedly elevated over the objections of the homeland security secretary and his staff . 
the terror alerts were raised on what secretary ridge himself called `` flimsy evidence '' by individuals in the administration who were really aggressive about raising it , which shows that they were used for political purposes . 
i know i am not the only one who questions why in the 5 1/2 months since election day there has not been a single terror alert . 
perhaps mr. ridge 's comments put the answer in the proper perspective . 
that constitutes a violation of trust with the american people , and we can not afford that in this war on terror . 
we ought not to employ the tactics of fear as a means of control in our pursuit to keep the homeland secure . 
such draconian measures are not in keeping with the spirit of america . 
it is beneath us as a nation to have partisan politics injected into our national security apparatus in an ugly and manipulative way . 
we dare not trade in a currency of fear , but rather should strive to liberate ourselves from fear through awareness of our world and an honest understanding of the challenges which lay before us . 
despite the serious problems at dhs , which still must be addressed , there is much in this authorization bill that i believe every member of congress will support . 
this funding would mark a welcome change in the administration 's approach to handling border security issues away from an economically disastrous agenda of imposing passport requirements on our citizens who want to cross our northern border and towards a more sensible policy of effective border enforcement , one which maximizes security resources and safeguards the freedoms and options our citizens and our trading partners deserve . 
we need a true commitment from this congress to put more agents in the field . 
the house leadership 's decision to include in this rule two amendments of mine suggests there may be room for common ground on the critical border issue after all . 
but there are many others , i know , we would all like to debate here on the floor today ; but of 89 , only 25 were ruled in order , which is less than 30 percent . 
but just as we can not afford to live in fear in this age of terrorism , we also can not fear engaging in genuine debate in consideration of those matters which may be controversial for some , but which are clearly important for the safety of all americans . 
and here in the cradle of democracy , we diminish those most american of values at our own peril . 
mr. speaker , extremely hazardous materials are transported through virtually every community in the nation . 
one way we are going to tell it is a fair rule is because people who do not like certain amendments being made in order from certain committees will object . 
they do not want to hear about congress ' jurisdictional fights , how we believe we have this in this committee and this in this committee , and therefore we are immobilized in congress . 
two were made in order , and arguably the two most important were not . 
i withdrew them in front of the committee on rules after talking with the gentleman from california ( mr. cox ) xz4000830 and the other relevant committees . 
but in fact , the challenge here of inland immigration is somewhat a different problem , as is deportation , from the border question as it relates to homeland security . 
similarly , a second amendment i had on intelligence that is trying to coordinate this proliferation of intelligence agencies , and we seem to create a new one every 6 months , both in congress and in the administration , one or the other of us , and we are getting all this stovepiping and no coordination which is exactly opposite of what the 9/11 commission proposed . 
where it clearly falls under homeland security , these amendments need to be in order and this committee needs the authority to address it . 
many members are very frustrated that they did not get their amendments in order . 
i am frustrated that i did not get two of mine in order , but this is a complicated process . 
today is the first step and the committee on rules has made an important first step in allowing 25 amendments , many over the objections of people who are objecting to jurisdiction , and keeping enough out that we can keep a coalition together to show the american people we want to move homeland security bills and this house will not be held up by jurisdictional fights over homeland security . 
mr. speaker , i rise in opposition to this rule . 
as a ranking member of the committee on homeland security , i strongly believe this base bill is deficient in a number of significant areas . 
this 79-page bill fails to address a number of critical aspects of homeland security and does not deliver on the homeland security commitments made in the 9/11 act . 
that is why i , like many of my colleagues in the house , felt compelled to submit amendments to the committee on rules for this bill . 
it would have required airport workers to be physically screened before accessing planes in restricted areas of airports . 
the rule also denies consideration of an amendment offered by the gentlewoman from california , this rule also prevents the gentlewoman from the district of columbia ( ms. norton ) xz4002950 from presenting her amendment to close gaps in the public transit and rail system . 
mr. speaker , i have every intention of supporting today 's homeland security authorization bill , but i think this bill could be dramatically improved , especially regarding the rail safety standards that apply to the shipment of extremely hazardous materials in local communities all across our nation . 
three days after i took office this year , an early morning train carrying three rail cars filled with chlorine gas slammed into a parked rail car in the town of graniteville , south carolina . 
in all , over 240 people were sickened by the gas and 10 people died because of the accident . 
mr. speaker , what happened in graniteville was not an isolated incident . 
train accidents occur frequently in the united states . 
since the graniteville incident , i have met with a number of safety experts , and i guarantee that if any members of this congress were to sit down with these representatives they would be shocked to learn how many commonsense safeguards are out there that have not been implemented to address rail safety in this country . 
the amendment that the gentleman from massachusetts ( mr. markey ) xz4002530 and i offered yesterday helps close this gap in rail security measures . 
it implements coordination and communication plans in the event of an accident or an attack , it develops new technology to make rail cars more resistant to punctures and , most importantly , it requires prenotification for local law enforcement whenever hazardous materials are being shipped through their communities . 
mr. speaker , i rise in support of h.r. 810 , the stem cell research enhancement act of 2005 . 
stem-cell research holds tremendous promise for advances in health care for all americans . 
indeed , mr. speaker , our own top scientists and officials at the national institutes of health , nih , have stated that the president 's 2001 limitations have caused us to fall behind in this research field . 
the nih should be leading this cutting-edge research , yet it is in jeopardy of failing in this role should the president 's policy be allowed to continue . 
this means researchers and scientists would be eligible to utilize their federal funds for research on a new stem-cell line as long as it met the strict ethical guidelines contained in the bill . 
h.r. 810 allows research to take place in a safe , structured , and ethical manner . 
while all stem-cell research is important , the unique ability of embryonic stem cells to give rise to any tissue or cell in the body that makes these stem cells critically important to medical research . 
mr. speaker , i rise today in strong opposition to h.r. 810 . 
this bill , which we have already heard today , would reverse the embryonic stem cell policy instituted by the president of the united states in 2001 , and i believe it is very misguided , in my opinion . 
now , an embryo may seem like some scientific or laboratory term , but , in fact , the embryo contains the unique information that defines a person . 
my own daughter wrote a little story , and i will read it , about step three : `` i lived with 40 others in a compound supervised by cool , efficient orderlies . 
jamie thompson and his team were the first to derive and culture human embryonic stem cells in a lab . 
these cells can be described as the parent cells of all tissues in the body . 
why are we curtailing scientific progress in america while scientists in other countries rapidly seize the opportunity inherent in advancing this research ? 
it just arrived in our office , may 23 , and the lead article in it says `` why bush 's ban could be reversed. '' it is talking about stem cell research . 
in view of the interest all across america and in view of the fact that tomorrow we are going to be voting on a bill , i thought it might be well this evening to spend a few minutes putting this debate in context . 
our first chart is a depiction of the development of early embryos and then all of the tissues in the body which develop from this embryo . 
of course , that is the hope of embryonic stem cell research , that we might induce a cell to develop into a tissue , an organ or cells which will be useful in treating diseases . 
this is a very abbreviated depiction of the early development of the embryo because it skips the morula stage , and we will come back to that in a few moments because that is the stage where most of the attention is focused now . 
here we see in the gastrula the development of what we call the germ layers . 
i guess you would say that a cell from each of these three germ layers , a cell from the endoderm , a cell from the mesoderm or a cell from the ectoderm , are all stem cells because they are destined to become a lot of different tissues and organs in the body . 
and then the endoderm , although widely dispersed in the body represents less mass in the body because it is the lining of the lung and the digestive tract . 
my chart shows the germ cells , the sperm in the male and the egg in the female . 
now there are cells in all of these that one could say were stem cells . 
tissue , and blood is a tissue , the tissue which has the most obvious stem cell that students were taught at least 50 years ago when i first was studying these things , is the stem cell in the bone marrow from which a number of different blood cells develop . 
in other words , you need to convince the cell that it is not exactly what it is as a result of the development process , that it returns to its original undifferentiated , or relatively undifferentiated state , and then it can make other tissues . 
they are useful in treating diseases that result from tissue or organ deficiencies . 
it , by the way , represents the largest cost of all the diseases in this country . 
this is probably the one that in my experience is the most heart wrenching because i have seen these little children come to my office . 
many times during the day and frequently at night they have to prick their finger , their hand , their ear lobe , something in their body to get a drop of blood , and now we have new instruments that require a pretty small drop of blood , and then this new almost miracle instrumentation analyzes that blood to see what the glucose content is so that they know how to set that pump . 
many of them have embedded in their side a little hockey puck size pump that pumps insulin . 
circulation in their legs may be so bad that their toes become gangrenous and have to be removed . 
and they will not live so long , they will not live so well as the average person in spite of all the miracles of medicine today because insulin does not cure diabetes . 
but if through embryonic or adult , for that matter , if you could do it , stem cell research , if you could develop islet of langerhan cells , you could then put them anywhere in the body . 
in our bodies , they reside in the pancreas . 
the pancreas secretes a large number of enzymes for digestion in the small intestine and the islet of langerhan cells just happen to be resident there . 
they could be in your tongue , they could be in your toe , they could be in your ear lobe . 
although it was not specifically diagnosed in my mother because she had other ailments that were easier to diagnose , she lived to be 92 and i am sure that she had alzheimer 's because she had many of the symptoms . 
and she was way back 50 years earlier in her memory . 
very early in our embryonic development , we have a very special kind of life cell which we call t cells . 
very early in embryonic development , they are imprinted with who you are . 
there are 6.5 billion of us in the world and these t cells are smart enough to recognize a difference . 
there may be somebody out there close to you , but nobody out there quite like you ; and you try to take their body organ and put it in you , these t cells are going to recognize it as foreign and move to reject it . 
sometimes for reasons we do not understand , these immune reactions in the body get confused , and they attack the body itself . 
indeed , if you will talk to the researchers and the experts in this area , they will all tell you to a man and to a woman that the potential for embryonic stem cell application to medicine should be greater than adult stem cell application just because embryonic stem cells , they are called totipotent , they can produce anything and everything that is in the body . 
the adult stem cells have already been differentiated , at least to some extent ; and so they are limited in their potential application . 
fifty years ago when i was studying and teaching in this area , there was an experiment where the researcher went into a mother black mouse and took a little patch of skin in the uterus from one of her little black babies and then he took that little patch of skin , and he went into the uterus of a white mouse with her white babies , and he cut a little patch of skin out of the white mouse and put in that little patch of black skin and when the white mouse was born with that patch of black skin , it did not reject it . 
the debate that we are going to vote on tomorrow and the debate which was the subject of the special order just before i spoke has to do with whether or not we can effect the needed cures in medicine from adult stem cells or whether we need to move to embryonic stem cells to make this happen . 
early in this debate , i had a personal involvement which was kind of an interesting one . 
in a former life , i got a doctorate in human physiology . 
i went out to nih in 2001 , before the president made his executive order . 
it was an information meeting at nih where the scientists working in this field were briefing , they were largely staff members from the hill . 
that is what happens in identical twinning . 
the mother that ordinarily sloughs one ovum a month this month sloughed two ovums and the sperm , and there are a whole lot of those , millions of them , they found both of them and they fertilized both of them and the uterus was receptive so they both were implanted in the uterus . 
this presentation looks very much like the dizygotic , that is from two eggs , dizygotic twins that implanted in the uterus very close together . 
knowing that in identical twinning , regardless at what stage it occurs and it can occur all the way from the two-cell stage clear up to the inner cell mass and there are several stages between these two , but no matter where it occurs , the embryo has lost half of its cells and both parts go on to produce a perfectly healthy baby . 
either they misunderstood your question or something because these are the same people that go into a single cell and take out the nucleus and put another nucleus in the cell . 
and so the president came out with his executive order which said that federal funds could be used in research only on the cell lines that had been developed from embryos that had been killed in the process of developing them , that no new cell lines could begin with embryos that had to be killed . 
my concern , mr. speaker , is that we in congress ought to be a player in this , and now we are standing on the sidelines . 
battey , who is the spokesman for embryonic stem cell at nih , and what the letter says is , and i will come back to it in a few moments to read a couple parts from it , that what we are proposing to do is certainly possible ; that there is no medical or scientific impediment to doing this . 
i just wanted to put to bed the suggestion that nih says what we are doing can not be done in spite of the fact that that is what karl rove thought they said . 
in my office just a few months ago , nih kind of sheepishly admitted that there was some misunderstanding in conversation because they had never said that we could not go into an early embryo and take a cell . 
but the earlier we get the stem cell , the more totipotent it ought to be and the more efficacious it ought to be in treating the diseases . 
it is at the eight-cell stage , and i am jumping a little ahead here , it is at the eight-cell stage in a petri dish . 
this is what happens in the body . 
if this kind of thing happens , they can fertilize it in a petri dish . 
it is at this eight-cell stage in more than 1 , 000 times now in clinics . 
it started in england . 
it is now in this country . 
in other words , they determine whether or not there are any genetic defects like down 's disease , for instance , in which case they would not want to implant that embryo . 
all they are doing here is seeing what genetics are there , and if there is no deficiency in the genetics , they implant the six or seven cells that remain , and more than 1 , 000 times they have had a normal baby . 
all of this happened in the intervening years between 2001 and now . 
i did not know that it was going on , but just a few months ago , this report came out , and now i spent the other day , for a half-hour , probably , talking with two investigators here in virginia who are doing this . 
operation snowflake where parents can adopt one of these embryos and have them implanted in a mother other than the one from whom the ovum was taken . 
in the proper environment , this is a human being . 
put it in the mother 's womb , and it will become a very distinct human being , unlike any other out of the 6.5 billion people in the world . 
this is from a scientist at the johns hopkins university school of medicine , one of the best medical schools in the world : `` as a physician-scientist who has done research involving umbilical cord blood stem cells for over 20 years , i am frequently surprised by the thought from nonscientists that cord blood stem cells may provide an alternative to embryonic stem cells for research . 
do they have a place in treating ? 
the argument on the other side is that it is immoral , that we should not take one life to support another life ; and in making those claims , they state the following : this kills human embryos . 
out of 6.5 billion in the world , you may not see that as human life , but it clearly is . 
then , even if it has gone that far , in one trial only one out of 18 attempts produced a stem cell line , and in another trial only three out of 40 produced a stem cell line . 
yes , we have not developed perfection yet in these techniques ; but 275 stem cell lines is more than 10 times more than all the stem cell lines we have now , which , by the way , i think are almost all in this country contaminated with mouse feeder cells . 
the highlighted part says : `` it may be some time before stem cells can be reliably derived from single cells , '' the process we have been talking about , `` extracted from early embryos and in ways that do no harm to the embryo , '' thus biopsy . 
they do a very good job of discussing this in the body of the text . 
but in this case , if they did preimplantation genetic diagnosis and if they developed a repair kit from that , then all that we would ask for is that a few surplus cells from the repair kit could be made available for a new stem cell line . 
what our bill asks for is simply federal money to do research on animals , on nonhuman primates , that is , the great apes , which genetically are remarkably similar to humans , if it works there , it probably would work in humans , to determine the efficacy and the safeness of doing this . 
they simply state in their recommendation section that they consider it unethical to go to an embryo and take a cell out of it just to establish a stem cell lot . 
it must be that a different person wrote the recommendations at the end as compared to the person or persons that wrote the text in the front , because they certainly should have mentioned the parents ' decision to develop a repair kit , the parents ' decision to make sure that their baby did not have a defect . 
these are decisions that parents make , i think , ethically to the benefit of their baby and for all that we would hope in the future . 
the next chart shows another development chart , and i would just like to reemphasize : now , imagine this is not in the mother ; this is an infant dibulum , in the ovary and the fallopian tube here . 
imagine that this is in a petri dish and not in the mother , and we fertilized the egg , and it has now developed to the eight-cell stage , and we can take a cell from that stage and do a preimplantation genetic diagnosis . 
they address this in the president 's white paper . 
there are now two kinds of cells in what we call the embryo . 
so if you take cells only from the inner cell mass , they could never become an embryo because these cells have lost all of their ability to produce the decidua , but they retain all of the ability to produce the cells of the body , the great variety of cells in the body . 
it may take some time , taken from early embryos in ways that do not harm the embryo . 
mr. speaker , i know that all america will be watching this debate ; they just voted $ 3 billion in alaska to pursue this . 
you suggested that creating hesc lines in this manner would avoid ethical questions surrounding the fate of a human embryo . 
in addition , long-term studies would be needed to determine whether this procedure produces subtle or later-developing injury to children born following pgd . 
also , it is not known if the single cell removed from the 8-cell stage human embryo has the capacity to become an embryo if cultured in the appropriate environment . 
yury verlinsky in the reproductive genetics institute in chicago that showed that a hesc line can be derived by culturing a human morula-staged embryo ( reproductive biomedicine online , 2004 vo . 
it is also worth noting , however , that in these experiments , the entire morula was plated and used to derive the hesc lines . 
at the april 26th meeting , nih agreed that such experiments might be pursued in animals , including non-human primates . 
nih also does not know whether these experiments have been tried and failed in animals and/or humans and , therefore , have not been reported in the literature . 
even with hescs derived from the inner cell mass of the human blastocyst , the odds of starting a hesc line from a single cell are long , perhaps one in 20 tries . 
it is possible , however , that improvements in technologies for deriving and culturing hescs may improve these odds . 
it also bears keeping in mind that it may take years to determine the answer . 
at the april 26th meeting , you had mentioned that twins can develop when the inner cell mass splits in the blastocyst and forms two embryos enclosed in a common trophoblast . 
in animal studies , it has been shown that the blastocyst can be pierced to remove cells of the inner cell mass and the embryo appears to retain its original form but it is not known whether the embryo will result the birth of a healthy baby . 
since this experiment in human embryos at either the morula or the blastocyst stage would require evaluations of not only normal birth but also unknown longterm risks to the person even into adulthood , it would have to be considered a very high risk and ethically questionable endeavor . 
you had also asked nih about the latest stage in development that an embryo can be artificially implanted into the womb . 
we know that infertility clinics transfer embryos at the blastocyst stage ( approximately day 5 in human embryo development ) as well as at earlier stages . 
in this white paper , the pcb raised many ethical , scientific and practical concerns about alternate sources for deriving human pluripotent stem cells without harming the embryo . 
your proposal is specifically discussed in this report . 
madam speaker , there have been a number of articles in the recent press relative to stem cell research , with particular reference to embryonic stem cell research . 
i thought it might be well in starting this little discussion to take a look at what we mean by stem cells . 
i have here a chart which shows in very abbreviated form the development of an early embryo . 
this is the ectoderm , and the mesoderm , and the endoderm , and then those very specialized cells , which in the female will be the germ cells in the ovary , the ova , and in the male will be the millions and millions of sperm that are in the gonads of the male . 
if we look back , madam speaker , at these stem cells that are present here in the gastrula , where we have these three , as we call germ layers , we see the ectoderm can further differentiate into skin and nervous system and some of the pigment cells in our body ; and then the mesoderm , the middle layer , that differentiates into what is most of us by mass and weight , cardiac muscle , our big skeletal muscles , the bone , the smooth muscle , all of our blood , and the blood is an organ , it happens to be a liquid organ that is dispersed through the body ; and then the endoderm . 
this is much more limited in volume and in variety , but still very important . 
it might be worth just a moment , madam speaker , to take a look at our next chart , which kind of puts this in context . 
what we show here are all the stages that were omitted in that first chart . 
this is one-half , as the little diagram here in the upper left shows , of the reproductive tract of a female . 
what it shows , madam speaker , is that fertilization takes place well up in the fallopian tube , and that begins day one . 
there are two kinds of stem cells , adult stem cells , and those are derivatives of the cells that we showed in the previous chart . 
for instance , in the humans we have adult stem cells in our bone marrow . 
these are cells which are differentiated to the point that they will produce a limited variety of cells , but still undifferentiated to an extent because these stem cells in the bone marrow can produce red blood cells and polymorphonuclear leukocytes , part of the white blood cells , and the thrombocytes , those are the cells , the platelets as we call them , that are associated with clotting . 
since we have been working with embryonic stem cells for now just a little over 6 years , we have not had the opportunities for medical applications we have had in adult stem cells , but this does not dim the hopes of the scientific community and the medical community that ultimately there may be more and better applications of embryonic stem cells to treatment of diseases than adult stem cells , simply because of what they are , puripotent cells retaining the ability to produce any and all of the tissues of the body . 
they may end up producing tumors and cancer-like growths in the organism in which you put them . 
we have now had 58 applications of adult stem cells in helping to treat some of the diseases . 
ordinarily , one thinks that the greatest potential for the use of stem cells would result from use in diseases from tissue deficiency rather than diseases that result from some organism , although if there is an infection in the body and a tissue is damaged , there is the hope that it might be replaced with stem cell application . 
this is the most costly disease in our country . 
it costs more to treat the diabetics in our country than any other single disease . 
i have no idea why nature placed the islets of langerhans in the pancreas . 
with these stem cell applications if we could create islet tissue , they could be placed in the person . 
it could be placed in the groin , under their arm , under the skin , anywhere . 
it does not have to be in the pancreas . 
a person with juvenile diabetes faces the prospect that they probably will have a shortened life , problems with their vision as the vascular bed in the back of the eye breaks down , and they may have problems with circulation in their extremities , particularly in the feet where there is some difficulty getting blood back uphill to the heart . 
as many people in this country know through relatives and friends , this results frequently in sores that do not heal and results in gangrene , so the toes or a foot may need to be taken off . 
she was maintained in the home . 
when we are developing as embryos in our mother 's womb , there are certain cells in our circulatory system called t-cells located in the lymphatic tissue , and the t-cells are imprinted with who we are because once we get out of the mother 's womb , we are going to be in a hostile environment , exposed to bacteria and viruses , and so it is important that the body knows what it is so the defense mechanisms in the body can be marshaled to eject the intruder . 
these t-cells identify what is you and what is not you , and they alert some of the specialized cells in our white blood cell system so they are attracted to the site , and they eject , they may consume , they eject the intruder . 
of course , what we are doing now in the laboratory is not done in the uterus . 
all of this is done in a petri dish . 
the in vitro is in glass . 
in vivo means life . 
he , as i am , is a strong pro-life advocate and the president had a problem with taking one life because that embryo produced in the laboratory in surplus and in vitro fertilization had the potential when implanted in a receptive mother to become a baby and the president 's problem was that he had a moral problem with taking one life with the hope of helping another . 
as the next chart shows , when we were talking about the potential for embryonic stem cell lines , i remembered my training of more than 50 years ago when i got my doctorate at the university of maryland and had a course in advanced embryology and then went on to teach medical school for 4 years and postgraduate medicine doing basic research at the national institutes of health . 
i remembered what everybody knows , because they had the course in advanced embryology it was in my mind , that whenever we have identical twins what has really happened is that half of the cells have been taken from the early embryo . 
now these early embryos can split either at the two-cell stage or at the inner cell mass stage or anywhere in between , presumably . 
carl , i said either they are funning you or they misunderstand you , because these are the same people that can take a single cell and take the nucleus out of that cell and put another nucleus in it . 
i said , of course , if they can take the nucleus out of a cell and put another nucleus in it , they can certainly take a cell or two out of what is a relatively big embryo . 
this is the result of a technique which is used to facilitate the replication of these cells in the tissue culture , and they are now all contaminated with mouse feeder cells so that although they are perfectly good for research and a lot of research is being done , they are not good for medical application because you would not want to put the cells contaminated with mouse feeder cells in a human . 
one of the potential solutions to this problem is included in h.r. 810 , the castle-degette bill ; and the argument made in this bill is that there are about 400 , 000 surplus embryos out there from in vitro fertilization . 
you see , to make sure that the doctor is going to have a good embryo or two or three to implant in a mother , because they do not all take , he will produce more embryos than he will probably need . 
then he will look at them under the microscope and pick the strongest looking of those embryos and may put two or three or so in the mother . 
one of our members , the rohrabachers , are now the proud parents of triplets from in vitro fertilization . 
it was a compelling argument to a majority of people in the house , and now they are considering this bill in the senate . 
but to those in the pro-life community , there is another way of looking at these embryos . 
be it enacted by the senate and house of representatives of the united states of america in congress assembled , & lt ; p & gt ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; section 1. short title. & lt ; p & gt ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; this act may be cited as the `` respect for life pluripotent stem cell act of 2005 '' . & lt ; p & gt ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; sec . 
the use of cells from embryos has drawn great interest in the scientific community but also raises very serious ethical concerns for many americans , because as practiced today it requires the destruction of human embryos to obtain their cells . 
( 2 ) the president 's council on bioethics in its may 2005 white paper : `` alternative sources of pluripotent stem cells , '' describes several potential methods to derive stem cells like those now derived through the destruction of embryos , but which would not involve doing harm to embryos . 
some methods propose to involve embryos in ways that do not harm them , while others propose to reprogram adult cells to produce cells with the capabilities of embryonic stem cells without producing or involving embryos at all. & lt ; p & gt ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; ( 3 ) such proposals should be thoroughly tested in animal models before being applied to humans , to establish that they do not involve creating or harming human embryos. & lt ; p & gt ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; ( 4 ) several scientific reports also suggest that some subclasses of adult stem cells ( derived from postnatal tissues , umbilical cord blood and placenta ) show a flexibility comparable to that of stem cells now derived through the destruction of embryos. & lt ; p & gt ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; ( 5 ) american scientists should be encouraged to pursue all ethical avenues of stem cell research and to explore morally uncontroversial alternatives to research requiring the destruction of human embryos. & lt ; p & gt ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; sec .

such authorization is in addition to other authorizations of appropriations that are available for such purpose. '' . & lt ; p & gt ; madam speaker , the gentleman from georgia ( mr. gingrey ) xz4001510 has joined us . 
i would like to yield to him before i go through the history of how we got to this bill and the people we talked to and exactly what is in the bill . 
i did not come to the congress , and that was 13 years ago , until i was 66 years old ; and i am very fortunate to have some prior life experiences that have permitted me to understand some opportunities here in the congress that might not have been so obvious to others who did not have this background . 
that is why in our bill we advocate animal model research rather than beginning with humans . 
now , as a matter of fact , a russian scientist working in this country , verlinsky , says he has , in fact , done that . 
on july 20 of last year , for instance , we had an extended meeting in my office with representatives from nih , with representatives from health and human services , and with representatives from the white house . 
there appeared in the literature a paper , a very interesting paper , on preimplantation genetic diagnosis . 
and what these medical people were doing , and this was in england , the first paper came from a clinic in england , what they were doing was going into the eight-cell stage and taking a cell or two out to do a preimplantation genetic diagnosis to see if the baby would have a genetic defect . 
that is now being done in this country just outside washington , in virginia . 
a few weeks ago i spent probably a half hour or more on the phone with two of the medical scientists there who were involved in this research . 
the members of the president 's , and i have the white paper here i am going to refer to in just a moment , council on bioethics think that that is not feasible . 
but , madam speaker , if we were to wait just a little later to take the cell to the inner cell mass , and i probably ought to put that chart of the uterus back up here so that i can point to what i am referring to here , in the laboratory they are going at the eight-cell stage and taking a cell or two out and doing a preimplantation genetic diagnosis . 
the cells in the inner cell mass are going to produce the baby . 
the three germ layers that we talked about at the very beginning and the cells in the trophoblast are going to produce the decidua . 
the decidua is the amnion and chorion , the tissues that support the baby , and we can see those starting to develop down here in day 8 and 9 when the embryo has attached itself to the wall of the uterus and the uterus grows and produces some tissues and there is a growth of this decidua here and we have the placenta , these big opposing vascular bags through which food and oxygen and co 2 and hormones and so forth are exchanged between the baby and the mother . 
by the way , madam speaker , this is a pretty hazardous journey ; and we do not know the exact percentage , but maybe less than half of all of the ova here that get fertilized actually implant in the uterus . 
they simply place a foreign object here in the uterus , and the uterus reacts to the presence of that foreign by not permitting the fertilized egg , the embryo , to implant there . 
while we are carrying on these discussions with the white house and nih and hhs and with the outside groups , the president 's council on bioethics submits a white paper ; and in this white paper they go over four potential techniques that might produce pluripotent stem cells , which is another way of saying the equivalent of embryonic stem cells , without destroying or harming an embryo . 
and what our bill does , madam speaker , is simply ask nih to please explore these potentials , first of all , in animal models ; and the bill gives them $ 15 million to begin this exploration . 
i just wanted to spend just a moment talking about the four things that are in here because it may be of interest to a number of people . 
the second procedure , and the next chart shows a little clip from that , is one in which , down at the bottom here , it says `` a similar idea was proposed by representative roscoe bartlett. '' this was my recommendation in 2001 . 
our bill simply asks the nih to do this in animal models to make sure that it is safe and efficacious . 
because in the cytoplasm of the egg outside the nucleus of the egg , there are some factors which turn on and turn off genes and kind of control what happens inside the nucleus . 
now , sometimes , you can take a cell and kind of put it in an environment where you have confused it , you have shocked it , you have done something to it , so it forgets what it was supposed to be , and it starts making cells , tissues that it would not ordinarily make in that stage of differentiation . 
in the few moments left , madam speaker , i would like to note that there have been a plethora of articles very recently about this , and i would like to submit these for the record . 
and then just today , in congressional quarterly , congress considers numerous stem cell bills . 
it mentions our bill in the house , and that bill frist is expected to draft a related bill in the senate . 
you suggested that creating hesc lines in this manner would avoid ethical questions surrounding the fate of a human embryo . 
in addition , long-term studies would be needed to determine whether this procedure produces subtle or later-developing injury to children nih is not aware of any published scientific data that has confirmed the establishment of hesc lines from a single cell removed from an 8-cell stage embryo . 
yury verlinsky in the reproductive genetics institute in chicago that showed that a hesc line can be derived by culturing a human morula-staged embryo ( reproductive biomedicine online , 2004 vo . 
it is also worth noting , however , that in these experiments , the entire morula was plated and used to derive the hesc lines . 
at the april 26th meeting , nih agreed that such experiments might be pursued in animals , including non-human primates . 
nih also does not know whether these experiments have been tried and failed in animals and/or humans and , therefore , have not been reported in the literature . 
even with hescs derived from the inner cell mass of the human blastocyst , the odds of starting a hesc line from a single cell are long , perhaps one in 20 tries . 
it is possible , however , that improvements in technologies for deriving and culturing hescs may improve these odds . 
it also bears keeping in mind that it may take years to determine the answer . 
at the april 26th meeting , you had mentioned that twins can develop when the inner cell mass splits in the blastocyst and forms two embryos enclosed in a common trophoblast . 
in animal studies , it has been shown that the blastocyst can be pierced to remove cells of the inner cell mass and the embryo appears to retain its original form but it is not known whether the embryo will result in the birth of a healthy baby . 
since this experiment in human embryos at either the morula or the blastocyst stage would require evaluations of not only normal birth but also unknown long term risks to the person even into adulthood , it would have to be considered a very high risk and ethically questionable endeavor . 
you had also asked nih about the latest stage in development that an embryo can be artificially implanted into the womb . 
we know that infertility clinics transfer embryos at the blastocyst stage ( approximately day 5 in human embryo development ) as well as at earlier stages . 
in this white paper , the pcb raised many ethical , scientific and practical concerns about alternate sources for deriving human pluripotent stem cells without harming the embryo . 
your proposal is specifically discussed in this report . 
right now , it 's possible only in theory , or on animals . 
senate majority leader bill frist and other gop lawmakers are considering legislation drawn from a report in may by bush 's council on bioethics , which studied research that might carry medical promise but is in its infancy . 
in some cases , the research is ethically objectionable , the panel wrote . 
bush has repeatedly said he would veto a bill the house passed last month backing standard embryonic stem cell research and any similar version by the senate , which is expected to turn to the issue in july . 
senator rick santorum , r-pa. , who also attended the meeting with bush , said he may try to amend one of congress ' must-pass spending bills to provide federal money for specific studies outlined in the bioethics council 's report . 
senator gordon smith , r-ore. , said that in his own talk with bush , he found the president `` looking for a way to stay within his ethical boundaries. '' almost two-thirds of americans say they support embryonic stem cell research and a majority of people say they would like to see fewer restrictions on taxpayer funding for those studies , according to recent polling . 
the proposal may free senators from a tight spot between bush 's veto threat and public pressure for embryonic stem cell research , which has shown promise in the search for cures for parkinson 's , alzheimer 's and other diseases . 
some of the techniques have not even been attempted in animals . 
`` that is the direction i think we should explore. '' those are the same boundaries set out by bush , who in a 2001 executive order prohibited federal funding of any research using human embryonic stem cells harvested after aug . 
the processes studied by the council could theoretically develop embryonic stem cell lines -- which can develop into any cell in the body -- without harming the embryo . 
however , in vitro fertilization clinics frequently extract one cell , called a blastomere , from a younger , eight-celled embryo to perform genetic testing -- to tell , for instance , whether some embryos will have a disease like cystic fibrosis . 
one such technique is called `` altered nuclear transfer , '' essentially cloning in a way that grows only tissue , not an actual embryo . 
in one corner we have embryonic stem cells , obtained by destroying one-week-old human embryos . 
the cells are `` pluripotent , '' capable of producing all the 210 cell types in the human body . 
in the other corner are stem cells obtained harmlessly from adult tissues , umbilical cord blood and placentas . 
just before congress 's july 4 recess , representative roscoe bartlett ( r-md ) introduced the `` respect for life pluripotent stem cell act. '' it instructs the national institutes of health to fund research in obtaining `` pluripotent '' stem cells without creating or harming human embryos . 
in physiology , and bases his proposal on a report by the president 's council on bioethics and the latest research findings . 
the bill would fund such efforts in animal embryos , to see if this can be safe enough to consider doing in humans . 
in addition , cutting-edge research suggests that adult cells can be `` reprogrammed '' in several ways into pluripotent stem cells . 
signals in the egg activate a much wider range of genes in that nucleus , so it no longer directs one specialized type of cell but begins the development of a whole new organism . 
what if the egg and the body cell were altered in advance so that , from the beginning , the result is not a one-celled embryo , but a pluripotent stem cell like those now obtained by destroying embryos ? 
`` it would get you outside of the boundaries of the ethical constraints. '' but because the value of these new scientific methods remains speculative , they have complicated the political calculus in the highly partisan senate , which could take up the issue as early as next week . 
`` but do n't tell me we should stop doing [ embryo ] research until we find out , because people 's lives are at stake. '' in may , the house easily passed bipartisan legislation allowing federally funded scientists to study stem cells derived from some of the thousands of human embryos destined for disposal at fertility clinics -- a significant expansion of the bush policy . 
until this week , senators arlen specter ( r-pa. ) and orrin g. hatch ( r-utah ) expressed confidence that they had more than enough votes to pass the same bill in the senate , despite threats of a presidential veto . 
at least a handful of senators have hinted in recent days that they may transfer their vote to the new bill , hill sources said -- among them hatch , johnny isakson ( r-ga. ) and kay bailey hutchison ( r-tex. ) . 
`` do n't stop embryonic stem cell research now , hoping there will be some other way to do it in the future , '' senator tom harkin ( d-iowa ) said in an interview . 
in one , a single cell is removed from a days-old embryo created for fertility purposes and coaxed to become a self-replicating colony of stem cells , leaving the remainder of the embryo to develop normally . 
in worcester , mass. , who pioneered it . 
`` you might find that late in life , there are some strange differences between those people and others. '' hurlbut is the leading proponent of a different approach , which he calls altered nuclear transfer , or ant . 
because a placenta is required for an embryo to implant in a woman 's womb , the altered embryo would be genetically incapable of becoming a fetus or a baby . 
researchers have tried the technique in mice with some success , but its usefulness as a source of human stem cells remains hypothetical . 
some , such as weissman , think the difficulties inherent in making such a system work are being overlooked by hurlbut , who is a physician but not a research scientist . 
`` i 've been telling bill , `why do n't you go work in a lab this summer ? 
mr. speaker , i rise in strong support of h.r. 2520 , the stem cell therapeutic and research act of 2005 , legislation i have cosponsored along with the honorable gentleman from new jersey ( mr. smith ) xz4003801 , who is in the chamber . 
every year , nearly two-thirds of the approximately 200 , 000 patients in need of a bone marrow transplant will not find a marrow donor match within their families . 
the gentleman from florida 's ( mr. young ) xz4004391 lifesaving work is evident again today in the program 's new design and goals . 
i do not see the gentleman from florida ( mr. young ) xz4004391 in the chamber , but at the appropriate time when he does arrive , i hope that the body will give him a standing ovation for his work in this area . 
the bill before us today authorizes a new grant program to provide subsidies to cord blood stem cell banks to expand the inventory of high-quality cord blood units that will be included in the new , expanded cell transplantation program . 
in addition to expanding the number of cord blood units available for clinical use to save lives today , the bill would also expand the number of cord blood units available for research . 
my wife and i are expecting a child in september , and we are working with the cord blood people as we speak so that my son , and it is going to be a little boy and we are going to name him jack ryan , that we are going to save his cord blood so that some day in the future , if he needs it , it will be available . 
so in this case i can honestly say , in addition to sponsoring the bill , i am beginning to practice what i am preaching today . 
she has been tireless in the last several months working on this bill . 
in the last few weeks , she has been able to forge a compromise that ultimately was acceptable to all the advocates of both bone marrow and cord blood . 
through the legislation introduced today , they acknowledge the important role congress has played and must continue to play in ensuring that the more than 14 , 000 americans in need of these types of transplants have access to them . 
in 1986 , representative young 's vision of a single integrated national bone marrow donor registry became a reality . 
as evidence supporting cord blood as a source of the same cells found in bone marrow and peripheral blood has grown , the national registry , operated by the nmdp , has expanded the expansion of the program will benefit patients most if they are able to access the new sources of cells easily and efficiently . 
the bill although this bill is a step in the right direction , it is critically important that the program also have the authority to establish criteria and standards that provide transplant physicians with the assurances they need to be confident that when they compare various cord blood units and/or adult donors , they have the same type of information about each unit or donor . 
in addition , the nmdp urges members to recognize that transplant patients may encounter other barriers to accessing cellular therapy transplants . 
the need for assistance in addressing barriers to access should be extended to all recipients of transplants under this program , regardless of cell source . 
statement of administration policy -- may 24 , 2005 the administration strongly supports house passage of h.r. 2520 , which would facilitate the use of umbilical-cord-blood stem cells in biomedical research and in the treatment of disease . 
cord-blood stem cells , collected from the placenta and umbilical cord after birth without doing harm to mother or child , have been used in the treatment of thousands of patients suffering from more than 60 different diseases , including leukemia , fanconi anemia , sickle cell disease , and thalassemia . 
researchers also believe cord-blood stem cells may have the capacity to be differentiated into other cell types , making them useful in the exploration of ethical stem cell therapies for regenerative medicine . 
h.r. 2520 would increase the publicly available inventory of cord-blood stem cells by enabling the department of health and human services ( hhs ) to contract with cord-blood banks to assist them in the collection and maintenance of 150 , 000 cord-blood stem cell units . 
this would make matched cells available to treat more than 90 percent of patients in need . 
the bill would also link all participating cord-blood banks to a search network operated under contract with hhs , allowing physicians to search for matches for their patients quickly and effectively in one place . 
the bill also would reauthorize a similar program already in place for aiding the use of adult bone marrow in medical care . 
there is now $ 19 million available to implement the cord blood cell bank the administration also applauds the bill 's effort to facilitate research into the potential of cord-blood stem cells to advance regenerative medicine in an ethical way . 
some research indicates that cord blood cells may have the ability to be differentiated into other cell types , in ways similar to embryonic stem cells , and so present similar potential uses but without raising the ethical problems involved in the intentional destruction of human embryos . 
h.r. 2520 is an important step in that direction . 
this bill , by itself , is an extremely important advance for those of us that believe you can use medical research ethically to help find cures for existing disease and enhance human life both now and in the future . 
it is a good piece of legislation and , by itself , is a major advancement in the state of the art that we have today . 
let us pass in a strong bipartisan fashion the smith-barton-young adult cord blood bone marrow bill , and then go on to the next issue . 
but there are some of us , and i am in that camp today , that believe it is not an easy issue . 
i come to the floor as a 100 percent lifetime voting member on prolife issues , minus one vote , in over 21 years . 
well , part of it is personal and part of it deals with tragedies in my family in the past . 
my first granddaughter , bryn barton , died in the womb 2 days before delivery with complications of the umbilical cord , which had become crimped , and she was actually born dead . 
my wife terri and i are expecting a baby in september , jack kevin barton , named after her late father and my late brother , jon kevin barton . 
and maybe the breakthrough is going to come in adult stem cells . 
now , the president adopted a position in early 2001 that said the existing stem cell lines then in existence could be federally funded for research . 
but in any event , none of those lines that are currently allowed to be used for research purposes at the federal level have been shown to have that breakthrough stem cell . 
there are 200 adult cells in the body . 
this number is far below the estimated number of stem cell lines that were thought to exist in august of 2001 , when the president announced his stem cell policy . 
in recent conversations with leading stem cell researchers , they indicated to me that all lines of embryonic stem cells eventually become exhausted . 
in order to produce clinical therapies , it is likely that researchers will also need more embryonic stem cell lines , of different genetic variations , than are presently eligible to receive federal support . 
in addition , the majority of the existing embryonic stem cell lines eligible for federal support use mouse feeder cells , which will make it nearly impossible for these embryonic stem cell lines to be adopted in clinical use . 
for my entire career in congress , i have been a staunch defender of the culture of life and opposed all forms of abortion . 
at the same time , i believe we have an obligation to improve existing lives and do what we can to make them better in the future . 
my decision was shaped , in part , by the painful experiences of my own family . 
we lost my brother jon in 2000 , at the age of 44 , after a long struggle with liver cancer . 
he was a state district judge in texas . 
we tried everything and , in fact , his cancer went into remission . 
jon died in just three months short of his 44th birthday . 
i come to my decision on this vote because i believe in life , and in the future . 
i believe that my obligation is to help advance science to make human life better now and in the future , in a manner that is consistent with judeo-christian ethics . 
now , you might say , yes , but in those instances they were adults and they had free will and they voluntarily made a choice that they might have to sacrifice their lives . 
but i would say this : if they did , out of the 400 , 000 that we think may be in existence , if you narrow that down to the 2.8 percent that the gentleman from texas ( mr. delay ) xz4001040 talked about that are probably not going to be used for reproductive purposes , if they did , would not some of them , knowing the stakes , volunteer ? 
and since they can not , because they do not have consciousness , under a traditional law in this united states of america we give custody to the parents . 
a parent will make a decision at some point in time , or a family member will make a decision at some point in time that perhaps they do not want to put up for adoption , which is the decision i would make . 
in addition to the cord blood bill that we have just passed , why not make it possible for some of these under the conditions in the castle/degette bill for some to be used for research purposes . 
mr. speaker , it is conservative to conserve , and this bill utilizes stem cells that have already been discarded , discarded because in most cases those who undergo in-vitro fertilization have excess fertilized cells available . 
mr. speaker , i rise in strong support of h.r. 810 . 
in order to explore all of the possibilities , scientists must have access to all three kinds of stem cells : adult , embryonic , and those from the umbilical cord blood . 
the two are not in opposition ; they are complementary . 
you know , i believe that everybody engaged in this debate today means well , and this is one of those great debates that we have on this floor . 
while we do not know where embryonic stem cell research might lead us , we do know that engaging in this form of research would require ending a human life for the purpose of experimentation . 
and in my opinion , we would be giving away our humanity , our sense of ethics , for the mere hope , the mere hope that this form of research would someday yield results . 
this research is going to take place in the united states and around the world . 
the question is whether the united states government 's official policy will remain frozen in place , or whether we will exert the same type of leadership that we have exerted in other areas of research , technology , and dealing with human health . 
for the sake of life , for the sake of health , for the sake of our families , i hope that this legislation passes , that we will be able to make sure that the federal government exerts its appropriate role in making sure that we have the resources , the direction , and the control to do this successfully . 
this debate is defined in so many ways by the conscience of each member ; and as each member comes to the floor , as each member speaks , i think my colleagues can see that this debate uniquely is based on their own view of this and their deeply founded view of this . 
in fact , the whip 's office is not real busy today , because we are not whipping this vote . 
some states like the state of california recently decided they would fund this in a significant way . 
we are not at the point in this issue where we can firmly say we are not doing harm . 
i do not agree with it myself , but i particularly do not agree that we should take the tax money of millions and millions of taxpayers who believe this is absolutely wrong and pay for this research in that way . 
mr. speaker , every invention , each new scientific concept , every technical advance in the history of mankind has been challenged and analyzed and debated , and properly so . 
change makes us uncomfortable , forces us to design new paradigms ; but in the final analysis , it is man 's fundamental obligation to use science for the betterment of mankind . 
in this instance , we are called upon to heal diseases that have plagued and bewildered us for centuries . 
it would be unconscionable and irresponsible should we fail to live up to our obligation in this critical matter . 
the moral and ethical question is this , do we destroy embryos , simply discard them , embryos that will never be implanted in a womb but which can advance stem cell research to cure historic illnesses ? 
the answer is , no , we should move forward with important scientific research , forward movement which will be enhanced in a measured way by passage of the measure before us . 
mr. speaker , i rise in strong support of h.r. 810 . 
i would like to thank the chairman for all of his work in bringing this bill to the floor , and i would like to thank my leadership for allowing a vote on this important legislation . 
as representatives , we are in the unique position to frequently meet with a wide cross-section of people , many of whom are suffering from debilitating diseases , injuries , and ailments . 
i would also like to state that there is no funding for the derivation of the lines and the lines must be ethically in accordance with the principles the president has laid out in his policy . 
today , mr. speaker , we will consider two bills that have significant bearing on the future of medicine and medical research in our country . 
cord blood and bone marrow have several therapeutic uses in common : first and foremost , the treatment of blood diseases . 
in addition to the therapeutic uses of cord blood , this bill makes cord blood stem cells available for research purposes . 
there is clearly therapeutic potential in the use of cord blood and adult stem cells . 
some of the most important research in this area is taking place in ohio , in northeast ohio , where i call home , at the national center for regenerative medicine , a partnership of case western reserve university hospitals , and the cleveland clinic in cleveland . 
and it is in the research area that the distinctions between these two bills takes on the greatest significance . 
in the castle-degette bipartisan bill , it focuses on embryonic stem cell research . 
for example , while adult stem cells represent an important advance in the treatment of blood disorders , these cells simply do not occur in every tissue in the body . 
because there are no adult stem cells , for example , in the pancreas , the potential of adult stem cells to develop into therapies for a disease like diabetes is very limited . 
embryonic stem cell , on the other hand , can grow into any type of cell in the body , making potential use of these far more diverse and far more valuable . 
it is irresponsible and even dangerous for members of this body to distort the value of one form of research in order to stifle another promising avenue of research . 
we in this congress have a responsibility to support medical research and to foster its development , as the committee of the gentleman from texas ( mr. barton ) xz4000180 committee has done well over time . 
millions of lives have been saved and improved because of the brilliant research conducted in this country . 
the fact is , if we invest in all three types of research , we may finally be able to find cures for debilitating illnesses , cures that are currently beyond our reach . 
researchers in other nations , researchers in private institutions in this country , are pursuing embryonic stem cell research because they know that it is possible to accomplish this research in an ethical manner . 
instead , it decreases the number of embryos that are destroyed in vain . 
mr. speaker , i urge members to vote in favor of both the smith-barton bill and the castle-degette bill . 
we in no way want to restrict it to just one or the other like my friends on the other side of the aisle . 
president bush said , `` most scientists believe that research on embryonic stem cells offers the most promise because these cells have the potential to develop in all of the tissues in the body. '' i hear my friends on the other side of the aisle argue that we really only need cord blood stem cell research , that that will lead us to all that we need . 
and the president said about that , that `` no adult stem cell has been shown in culture to be pluripotent. '' and he said , `` embryonic stem cells have the potential to develop into all or nearly all of the tissues in the body. '' i then hear my friends on the other side of the aisle talk about research , that this is going to lead to so much more research . 
yet at the same time we have seen no increase , flat-lined spending , budgeting on the national institutes of health , something that many of us , the gentlewoman from colorado ( ms. degette ) xz4001010 and many of the rest of us , have thought we should increase spending on , medical research all across the board in all kinds of medical research . 
yes , in order to make room for the president 's tax cuts that have gone overwhelmingly to the wealthiest in our country , we have simply cut medical research and not done what we should as a nation do overall in medical research . 
mr. speaker , i come from florida , and a lot of people think that only retirees and seniors live in florida , but i want to put a face on a couple that was very successful with in vitro fertilization . 
they had a daughter born as a result of in vitro fertilization . 
mr. speaker , i rise today in strong support of h.r. 810 , the stem cell research enhancement act of 2005 . 
i stand with 200 of america 's most respected research organizations in support of this bill . 
in my congressional district on the gulf coast of florida , i have had the pleasure of meeting holly , a 47-year-old mother of two . 
like many americans , holly and her husband had trouble getting pregnant , and their first daughter was born through in vitro fertilization . 
as with most in vitro fertilization procedures , holly and her husband had several embryos left over after the procedure . 
this couple was then blessed by a second miracle daughter who was conceived without in vitro fertilization the happy couple decided not to have any more children , and had to make a choice about what to do with their frozen embryos . 
until you put the batteries in , a flashlight will not produce light . 
likewise , only when an embryo is implanted in a uterus to grow , can life be sustained . 
embryos sitting frozen in a clinic help no one . 
the embryo does not grow in the frozen state , so human life is not being created and nurtured . 
in addition , when the couple stops paying the daily fees to store the embryos , unless they have the medical donation option , their remaining embryos will be disposed of as medical waste . 
mr. speaker , these embryos are too important to linger in a frozen test tube or to see discarded without helping mankind . 
additionally , i have yet to hear in this entire debate what opponents of h.r. 810 would do with those embryos that are not adopted , and eventually go to waste in a cryogenic freezer . 
i do rise in opposition to this bill today . 
there is nothing in the laboratory , and there is certainly nothing in the clinics available to patients . 
the president , i think , wisely put parameters , set boundaries around this type of research back in 2001 . 
a couple who has an embryo developed in an ivf clinic is perfectly free to take that embryo to a lab at harvard or california and have a stem cell line developed . 
the reality is in a poll of my reproductive endocrinologists back home : that never comes up as an issue . 
mr. speaker , i think it is important that we follow the money in this debate . 
if there is one thing we learned in the last presidential election , it was that both major candidates asserted that life begins at conception , and we are talking about taking a life . 
with heart disease affecting so many of us in this nation , the promise of embryonic stem cell research has advancements for the human heart which are incredible to think of . 
for example , it could facilitate the testing of new medications and treatments , not in time for my daughter 's life , but for her young children 's generation . 
in each of these cases , stem cell research holds out promise . 
as we have discussed , each year thousands of embryos no bigger than the head of a pin are created in the process of in vitro fertilization . 
mr. speaker , i rise in support of h.r. 810 . 
for years , our country has led the world in medical advancements , and people from around the globe travel here for medical education as well as for lifesaving care . 
today , the house is considering opening new lines of research -- research that will help the united states retain its place as a world leader in this burgeoning new field , while helping to alleviate the pain and suffering of many around the world . 
current federal policy , put into place by president bush on august 9 , 2001 , allows federal funds to be used to support research from the stern cell lines that existed on that date , but it bans the creation of additional stern cells from embryos that are stored at in vitro fertilization clinics . 
in fact , only 22 lines are available and some of these were found to have been contaminated from contact with mouse `` feeder '' cells . 
in addition , the 22 available lines were developed using science that has since seen significant improvements . 
they are grateful for the federal research funding that congress has provided in past years , particularly the doubling of the nih budget over a five year period , and they look to the future with hope that more effective treatments and someday , cures , will be forthcoming . 
two of the finest academic medical centers are located in baltimore -- the university of maryland medical center and the johns hopkins university medical center . 
this bill stipulates that all embryos used for research must have been originally created for in vitro fertilization and are in excess of clinical need ; it requires that the embryos would not have been implanted and would have otherwise been discarded ; and it requires donors to provide written consent before embryos may be donated for research . 
it is not certain that stem cell research will result in cures , but it is fairly certain that if we close off promising avenues , such as stem cell research , finding those therapies and cures will take much longer . 
in 2001 , two months before president bush issued his stem cell policy , sue stamos and her daughter , faith , came to visit me in my office . 
back in june of 2001 , our knowledge of stem cell research 's potential was nowhere near what it is now , and we did not yet know what the president would propose . 
mr. speaker , in closing , i must note that stem cell research is a controversial and emotional subject . 
it allows us to support the efforts of the brilliant scientists in our research institutions who have dedicated their careers to alleviating the suffering of others . 
it allows us to honor the wishes of in vitro fertilization donors who want to make a contribution toward medical advancement . 
i urge my colleagues to join me in supporting h.r. 810 . 
while adult stem cells have been very useful in treating some cancers , embryonic stem cells appear to have a far greater potential for treating disease than adult stem cells . 
scientists regard embryonic stem cell research as one of the greatest hopes for the cure of medical conditions such as parkinson 's disease and diabetes due to their unique ability to develop into virtually any type of cell in the body . 
this research is already taking place around the globe , and right here in america . 
this debate is about american leadership in this world . 
for generations america has led the world in scientific advances . 
we must continue to support the work of our brilliant scientists and help them once again lead the world in this vitally important new field . 
the cells used in this research will be donated voluntarily by patients of in-vitro fertilization clinics . 
we must not block advances in life-saving and ethically conducted science . 
mr. speaker , i rise today in support of h.r. 2520 , which establishes a national cord blood stem cell inventory , a cord blood system , and to reauthorize the national bone marrow registry . 
mr. speaker , just speaking to the members perhaps back in the offices listening , i have 820 , 000 constituents in delaware , and probably more than a third of them have some kind of a disease that might be able to be benefited by embryonic stem cell research . 
that is true of the figures in the country . 
there is not a person in this room who has not had many , many visits by people who have very , very serious needs , whose lives are going to be shortened . 
i am all for the first bill we debated today because i think it might help somewhat , but i have also looked at some statistics and i have come to realize that of the 15 leading diseases , adult stem cells can not do anything about 14 of them and can do a only little bit about heart diseases as they deal with only blood diseases in terms of what they can do . 
if you read the vast body of research in the united states of america on this subject by people who are truly knowledgeable , you are going to learn there is more potential here than anything that has ever happened in medicine in the history of the united states of america . 
i do not have time to go through the whole in vitro fertilization process except to say that we create embryos in that particular process . 
we want to give them the opportunity to say , within that embryo there are stem cells which could help other people live better lives and give them the opportunity to be able , instead of having it put in a bag for hospital waste , sitting at that table , to be put over here , and the state to be able to do the research . 
mr. speaker , i rise today in support of h.r. 810 , the stem cell research enhancement act . 
i have been in public office for over 30 years and throughout my career , i -- just like all of you -- have had the opportunity to change and improve public policy so this country may continue to flourish on the principles it was founded . 
and the 820 , 000 people i represent in the state of delaware are a constant reminder to me of this responsibility . 
i am their voice in the congress of the united states . 
some of you may be wondering why i have become so interested and involved in embryonic stem cell research . 
year by year the groups would grow in number and soon we would have to get bigger rooms for our meetings . 
in the early years we would discuss the necessity of funding the national institutes of health , and i was proud to be able to support newt gingrich and the republican party 's drive to double funding for the nih . 
but in the past few years , the number one topic on these groups ' minds was embryonic stem cell research . 
one little girl stands out in mind . 
i met her a few months ago at an event back in delaware . 
so when diana degette and i began discussing how to expand the president 's policy in an ethical manner , i went right back to the speech he gave to the nation in 2001 . 
we wanted to be as consistent as possible with the ethics he laid out in his speech as we worked to update the policy . 
i will read them to you and ask that you think about them very closely : ( 1 ) embryos used to derive stem cells were originally created for fertility treatment purposes and are in excess of clinical need ; ( 2 ) the individuals seeking fertility treatments for whom the embryos were created have determined that the embryos will not be implanted in a woman and will otherwise be discarded ; and , ( 3 ) the individuals for whom the embryos were created have provided written consent for embryo donation and without receiving financial inducement . 
they are created in a petri dish , are about 5 days old and are the size of a pine head . 
of the 400 , 000 frozen embryos in in vitro fertilization clinics throughout the u.s. , about 2 percent are discarded annually -- that is about 8 , 000 -- 11 , 000 embryos that could be slated for research . 
allowing the option of donating these excess embryos to research is similar to donating organs for organ transplantation in order to save or improve the quality of another person 's life . 
on the other hand , embryonic stem cells are `` master cells '' -- they have the potential to grow into any type of cell in the body , they are easier to identify , isolate , purify and grow and they are capable of continual reproduction . 
this means that embryonic stem cells may be pluripotent -- that is , able to give rise to cells found in all tissues of the embryo except for germ cells rather than being merely multipotent -- restricted to specific subpopulations of cell types , as adult stem cells are thought to be . 
in 2003 , 1.6 million people died of heart disease , cancer , diabetes , alzheimer 's , kidney disease , liver disease and parkinson 's . 
embryonic stem cells were only isolated in 1998 . 
the united states has always been the premier leader in biomedical research in our country and around the world . 
or do we want to be the congress that says , we back science , we want research to flourish and we played a small role in making that happen . 
sometimes there are issues of such critical social importance that it is only right that the congress of the united states do this in the open , and they did that and for that we should all be very appreciative . 
there are 110 million people just in the united states of america out of 290 million who have some sort of illness that potentially could be helped by the use of embryonic stem cells . 
we know that anything other than just the use of adult stem cells in blood tissues has been experimental at best and probably will never work . 
we talk about life , and i do not necessarily want to get into that argument back and forth , but the bottom line is there are a lot of lives that are being foreshortened in the united states of america and across the world that perhaps could be lived out to their fullest if that opportunity was given to the individuals involved . 
our ethic standards in this bill , and if you read it , it is only 3 pages long , exceed any ethical standards that have ever existed before including what the president had before . 
this means that embryonic stem cells may be pluripotent , that is , able to give rise to cells found in all tissues of the embryo except for germ cells rather than being merely multipotent , restricted to specific subpopulations of cell types , as adult stem cells are thought to be. '' that is where the science is . 
there are no dollars used directly in the destruction of embryos at an in vitro fertilization clinic . 
there are dollars used in the research ultimately . 
if you do not like that , you better go out and lobby against what they are doing in in vitro fertilization clinics , and i do not think that we want to do that . 
i would just close by saying that 14 out of the 15 diseases that are most likely to kill people in the world are not ever going to be helped by adult stem cells . 
sadly , passage of this bill will put the government and taxpayers in the position of sanctioning and funding the destruction of that human life . 
that is why i am so supportive of the rapid progress being made in the fields of adult and umbilical cord stem cell research . 
while i recognize that many proponents of this bill offer their support with good intentions , in this case we do have clear alternatives , and i would strongly urge my colleagues to support adult and umbilical and reject this bill . 
established in 1986 , the national registry has facilitated more than 21 , 000 lifesaving transplants involving cord blood , peripheral blood , and bone marrow . 
through the nmdp today , individuals in need of a cord blood transplant already have access to the largest listing of cord blood units in the united states -- more than 42 , 000 units . 
in addition , the nmdp lists more than 9 million i am particularly proud of the work of the nmdp , especially its strong support for cord blood and because of its partnership with the st . 
another 3 are in the process of becoming partners . 
this bill is a step in the right direction because it builds upon the existing registry . 
therefore , i urge my colleagues to vote in favor of h.r. 2520 , which provides for an integrated national program . 
mr. speaker , i rise in strong support of h.r. 810 . 
we are talking about improving the lives of countless numbers of people in this country . 
we are talking about putting american health care and researchers in the best position to finding the cures for today 's diseases tomorrow and to preventing the diseases of tomorrow today . 
from eradicating polio to advances in diabetes , american research has been on the forefront . 
if there are only 10 , we will use 10 unless they can be adopted , which i also support in this bill . 
if you take a look in animals , they have actually saved spinal cords in animals , in heart , in alzheimer 's , but they just have not done it in humans . 
i had a 6-year-old in the committee that said , duke , you 're the only person who can save my life . 
but you can not look a child in the eye when the only chance they have to live is this research . 
a lot of times i disagree with my colleagues because i think in some cases they would go further , and a fact that many people will not take under their wing is that many of these stem cells are going to be thrown away , either cryogenically they deteriorate and they throw them away , or a woman says `` i do n't want to keep them for 1 , 000 years '' and they discard them . 
they literally throw them in the toilet . 
and we have hope in the future . 
i want to say something about the cord blood bill in particular . 
we talk a great deal about health care disparities , and we ought to talk about health care disparities in this country ; but rather than talk , this bill acts . 
mr. speaker , the reason that this cord blood bill made it to the floor is in large measure because rather than digging in in opposition to stem cell opposition , as strongly as the gentleman from new jersey ( mr. smith ) xz4003801 feels about this issue , rather than digging in in opposition , the gentleman worked with the scientific community , he worked across the aisle to try to find another approach . 
if we would somehow as an institution learn from his example , if we figured out how , rather than digging in and deciding how much we disagree with each other , what other ways exist , what ways can we find to work together , we would not have a 34 percent approval rating as an institution . 
i am hopeful that all of the technological advances that have happened in the last several years , with cord blood cells and with stem cells , can make a significant difference . 
in the absence of the federal government , the states are already taking the lead . 
new jersey has followed suit , and seven other states are in the process of doing so . 
the federal government in general , and nih in particular , must be involved . 
opponents argue that it is the product of a utilitarian world view , that somehow this is a zero-sum game , if the members will , in which life is taken in order to give life . 
under this bill , federal research will proceed using those embryos not used in fertility clinics , embryos voluntarily given that would otherwise be destroyed , that is , embryos that held the promise of life but are certain not to fulfill that promise . 
that is why they have not proven to be useful in some of the early studies . 
that is because we are in the very promising early stages of that research . 
and the adult stem cells have been used in their narrow milieu to cure diseases and to help with diseases that are blood specific . 
if people do not want to do embryonic stem cell research , they can look in the eye of our colleague , the gentleman from massachusetts ( mr. langevin ) xz4002300 and others and say to them , we do not want to do the research that could cure your disease , and i challenge them to do that . 
in conclusion , curt civin , m.d. , who is a doctor at johns hopkins university school of medicine and a researcher , says `` as a physician-scientist who has done research involving umbilical cord stem cells for over 20 years , i am frequently surprised by the thought from nonscientists that core blood stem cells may provide an alternative to embryonic stem cells for research . 
last year it was really $ 25 million , and the reason is because the president 's policy , issued in august of 2001 , has not worked . 
and of those lines , all of them were contaminated with mouse `` feeder '' cells , and many of them were not available to researchers here in country . 
in 1995 , two members of congress , mr. dickey and the gentleman from mississippi ( mr. wicker ) xz4004320 , inserted language in the appropriations bill , which is there every year and has been there every year i have been in congress , and it says : `` no federal funds shall be used to create or destroy embryos. '' now , those on the other side of this debate say they do not think federal funds should be used for this research , even though by their own admission the majority of americans support this research . 
what it says is , people who go to in vitro fertilization clinics , there are leftover embryos as part of the process . 
they can decide one of two things : number one , do they want to not discard the embryos and either donate them to other couples , and they can be these snowflake children , or to store them in a freezer ? 
just as the president 's executive order in august of 2001 allowed stem cell lines to be researched with federal funding , but he limited those lines , we are allowing more of those lines . 
more than 100 years ago , justice oliver wendell holmes recognized that we are living in an increasingly complex world and that `` the chief worth of civilization is just that it makes the means of living more complex. '' this world , he says , `` calls for great and combined intellectual efforts instead of simple , uncoordinated ones. '' the truth of justice holmes ' words in today 's complex world is best seen in the state of scientific research . 
in 2001 , the president issued his executive order establishing the current embryonic stem cell research policy in an attempt to balance bioethics and science . 
in the last 4 years , it has become clear that the policy has failed on both counts . 
research has been stymied in this country , going into private hands and offshore . 
it gives another option for embryos created for in vitro fertilization , embryos created in petri dishes , that would otherwise be destroyed so that they can be used to potentially save or extend lives . 
both of these boys have type 1 diabetes , and both of them have been diagnosed since they were 2. a couple of months ago , little noah had convulsions in the middle of the night from low blood sugar . 
let us reclaim the federal government 's role as the leader in ethical basic research . 
mr. speaker , i am proud to stand on the house floor today to speak in favor of the stem cell research enhancement act , legislation which will bring hope to millions of people suffering from disease in this nation . 
i want to thank congresswoman degette and congressman castle for their tireless work in bringing this bill to the house floor for a vote . 
embryonic stem cells have the potential to form any cell type in the human body . 
i have voted against it in the past . 
however , that is vastly different from stem cell research and as an ovarian cancer survivor , i am not going to stand in the way of science . 
the policy president bush announced in august 2001 has limited access to stem cell lines and has stalled scientific progress . 
this congress must not stand in the way of that progress . 
in addition , mr. speaker , we plan to consider the military quality of life appropriations act for fiscal year 2006 sometime later in the week . 
the rules committee did make an announcement tonight about filing amendments in a timely fashion . 
in working with the minority leader 's office and your office , there have been requests to accommodate some members and start this debate early in the afternoon instead of early in the morning . 
i would , along with the unanimous-consent request , anticipate us working out an agreeable time , and i would expect after discussions already being held that we would anticipate the debate to start on that bill somewhere early in the afternoon and running for the length of time agreed to by both sides . 
even though we would discourage any amendments to this very important issue , we would want to have opportunities for every member to participate in the debate . 
as the gentleman knows , this house passed the highway bill some weeks ago and the senate just finished the highway bill in their chamber . 
so he is obviously a major player in this process . 
hopefully , we can work this out in the conference committee so that the president will not have to mar his record by vetoing a bill . 
i would just point out to the gentleman that in the good old days that he refers to , yes , this house had a great reputation for wanting to spend more money , and those days have changed in that the president is adamant about spending and spending the right amount of money to do the job and the house has concurred in that many times and have voted in the house . 
now , that debate will be , among other things , controversial , because the proponents of embryo destruction in the name of progress believe it is not the embryo destruction its opponents oppose , but rather progress itself . 
this bill , which provides for federal funding of research using adult stem cells which have , unlike embryonic stem cells , proven medical benefits in treating more than 60 separate diseases , will pass with the overwhelming support of both sides of this debate . 
now , this bill , sponsored by the gentleman from new jersey ( mr. smith ) xz4003801 will , for the first time , provide for taxpayer-funded research on well-developed stem cells from umbilical cords , expand federal funding in bone marrow stem cell research , and provide for the development of a national stem cell therapy database for medical practitioners and researchers . 
kill some in hopes of saving others . 
progress , in fact , is the opposite of such a choice . 
mr. speaker , i yield 1 minute to the gentleman from georgia ( mr. price ) xz4006261 , a physician for 25 years in georgia and a member of the faculty at emory university . 
mr. speaker , i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from florida ( mr. weldon ) xz4004271 , who has graduated with honors , is a physician in internal medicine , and also has degrees in biochemistry . 
the gentlewoman says that no federal funds can go to destroying an embryo in order to have research . 
that is what this whole bill does is to allow funding of embryonic stem cell research , and in order to do that research , you have to destroy the embryo . 
in fact , if the gentlewoman would like , i would be willing to entertain a unanimous consent request that if , indeed , that does not happen in her bill , i will be glad to accept it and i will vote for the bill . 
mr. speaker , i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from louisiana ( mr. boustany ) xz4006360 , a heart surgeon , a graduate from lsu , and chief resident of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery at the university of rochester in rochester , new york . 
for all the arguments we have heard today , scientific , ethical , political , the debate for and against the castle bill , for and against the authorization of federal taxpayer dollars to fund medical research predicated on the destruction of human embryos is in essence a question of the level of respect and dignity our government chooses to grant human life in its earliest stage . 
it is one , and as such , just like a newborn or a toddler or a teenager , possesses instead the internally directed potential to grow into adulthood , to become in a sense what he or she already is . 
these children have been adopted through different programs , but particularly the snowflake embryo adoption program , who under the castle bill and its predictable progeny might otherwise have been destroyed in a petri dish , these children that were embryos . 
what level of respect and dignity , then , should our government grant such little creatures , these tiny beings who our eyes suggest are not like us but who our hearts and minds know in fact are us ? 
the castle bill is very clear , and though i oppose it , its clarity well serves both sides in this debate . 
after all , human embryos are being harvested for medical research every day in this country . 
we just do not think the government should be forcing the american people to pay for it , especially considering the discouraging track record of the kind of research the castle bill has in mind . 
embryonic stem cell therapies which are by design definitely untherapeutic to the embryos have in fact proven to be similarly harmful to those patients the treatments were supposed to help . 
in truth , then , it is not the ends that would supposedly justify the grizzly means of the castle bill , but the mere aspiration to those ends . 
in other words , mr. speaker , the castle bill would throw taxpayer money at the same unsuccessful research that companies with the financial motivation for developing such research are avoiding . 
indeed , one might say the stubborn advocacy of embryonic harvesting in the face of the overwhelming clinical evidence of its futility might be a genuine case of ideology trumping science . 
well , in that case , mr. speaker , we would still be right to oppose it because in the life of men and nations , some mistakes you can not undo . 
if the mere aspiration of ends justify the means here , in our first ethical challenge of the biotechnology age , how could we hope for a higher standard the next time ? 
given the biological fact of a human embryo 's membership in the human family , given the technological necessity of embryonic destruction as a precondition of embryonic stem cell research , given the medical reality of embryonic stem cell research 's consistent therapeutic failure , given the moral catastrophe of means-justifying-the-ends morality , and given the physical revulsion people instinctively feel when considering the destruction of defenseless human life by scientists in lab coats ; given all these factors , the answer a proponent of taxpayer-funded embryonic stem cell harvesting and research must give is `` none. '' for if we afford the little embryos any shred of respect and dignity , we can not in good faith use taxpayer dollars to destroy them . 
the issue is a test in which we are asked out of good and pure intentions just this once , just this tiny little bit , to let the ends justify the means , to let the noble aspirations justify ignoble actions . 
in this test , in this vote , then , we have an opportunity today to speak truth to the power of biotechnology , to rise up against the prevailing winds of human excess and hold fast to the dignity of human life upon which all other worldly truths are based : to ensure our appetite for knowledge is checked by our knowledge of our appetites ; to stand up , as only america can , in the name of the least among us , whom we serve , and become the people we are . 
mr. speaker , in 1999 young tessa wick was diagnosed with juvenile diabetes . 
in a week and a half , we mark the first anniversary of ronald reagan 's passing . 
and while i am concerned that there is disagreement with the president of the united states , i hope that we will be able to , at the end of the day , work out a bipartisan agreement that will include the president of the united states in this effort . 
mr. speaker , as an original cosponsor of h.r. 810 , the stem cell research enhancement act of 2005 , i rise in strong support of this legislation . 
there are ethical concerns over the use of embryonic stem cells in research , and we should not treat stem cells as just another laboratory product . 
but it is important to recognize that , as part of the process of in vitro fertilization , many embryos are created that are never used and are slated to be destroyed . 
the current state of stem cell research suggests that there is significant progress to be made if we move forward in this area . 
leading scientists have testified that adult stem cells and umbilical cord stem cells do not share the ability of embryonic stem cells to replicate all other cells in the human body . 
if we do n't invest in stem cell research , millions of americans with some of the most debilitating diseases will not be able to avail themselves of the treatments or cures that might result . 
in addition , if we fail to invest federal resources in embryonic stem cell research , the u.s. will lose its competitive advantage in this essential area of science . 
the limited federal support for stem cell research is just one area of science in which the u.s. is falling behind . 
nearly 40 percent of u.s. jobs in science or technology requiring a ph.d . 
are now filled by people born abroad -- that 's up from 25 percent in 1990 . 
we now rank below 13 other countries -- including japan , germany , and south korea -- in the percentage of 24-year-olds with a college degree in a science or engineering field -- that 's down from third in the world 25 years ago . 
mr. speaker , this legislation will help the u.s. to move forward on our moral imperative to perform stem cell research in an ethically responsible way . 
mr. speaker , i have a profound deep and abiding belief in the right to life . 
two years ago i visited the bader peach orchard in campbell . 
cody is a handsome and articulate young man who happens to live in a wheelchair because of a car accident . 
each life is precious , and so i must follow my heart on this and cast a vote in favor of h.r. 810 . 
and i rise in support of h.r. 2520 , the stem cell therapeutic and research act of 2005 . 
in their words , `` given the enormous promise of stem cell therapies for so many devastating diseases , nih believes that it is important to simultaneously pursue all lines of research. '' our loved ones deserve science 's best hope for the future . 
mr. speaker , i rise in support of this bill , which will expand funding for embryonic stem cell research , and i am proud to be an original cosponsor of it . 
what i would like to say today is the following : scientists have informed us , the professional scientists in our country , not political scientists , but scientists , and what they have told us from their considerable work and research is that this issue represents hope . 
it represents hope for the cure of diseases that plague so many of our people , from juvenile diabetes all the way to the other part of life , which is alzheimer 's , and so many diseases in between . 
it is up to us to have an ethical standard in this debate . 
we have a responsibility in terms of our compassion , in terms of the instruction that our nation 's scientists have given to us . 
mr. speaker , i rise in support of this bill which will expand funding for embryonic stem cell research , and i 'm proud to be an original cosponsor of it . 
under this bill embryonic stem cell lines will be eligible for federal funding only if the embryos used to derive stem cells were originally created for fertility treatment purposes and are in excess of clinical need . 
we should allow parents who choose to donate these embryos for use in federally-funded stem cell research to do so . 
it is the largest state-supported scientific research program in the country . 
this initiative places california at the forefront of the field and exceeds all current stem-cell projects in the united states . 
over 3 , 000 people die every day in the united states from diseases that may some day be treatable as a result of stem cell research . 
in 2001 , president bush crafted a policy to allow limited federal support for some embryonic stem cell research . 
under h.r. 810 , embryonic stem cell lines will be eligible only if embryos used to derive stem cells were originally created for fertility treatment purposes and are in excess of clinical need . 
we should allow parents to donate these embryos for use in federally-funded stem cell research . 
this initiative puts california at the forefront of the field and exceeds all current stem cell projects in the united states . 
however , with the federal government on the sidelines , scientists are still reluctant to pursue stem cell research and the private sector is unwilling to invest in the field . 
stem cell research is the next `` big thing '' in biotechnology after the human genome project . 
biotechnology is at a stage of development similar to where information technology was in the late 1980s -- ready to explode . 
for our leadership in science and technological leadership , where innovative leading-edge research is carried out matters a great deal , but under the current policy we 're leaving the field even before the game has begun . 
he may succeed in stifling stem cell research in our country , but he will not stop scientific progress . 
if the u.s. fails to embrace stem cell research , we will only slow progress in treating disease and cede our leading role as a technological leader . 
the federal government should be in the business of encouraging and assisting research that can help save the lives of its citizens . 
i urge all my colleagues in the house to support this legislation . 
mr. speaker , i rise in support of h.r. 810 , the stem cell research enhancement act . 
advances in medicine have made virtually obsolete killer diseases like smallpox and polio , have increased life expectancy and improved the quality of life for people around the globe . 
however , because of important discoveries and advances in medicine and medical treatments , by the year 2000 life expectancy had increased to over 76 years of age . 
the advances in medicine that resulted in this dramatic increase in life expectancy did not happen by accident . 
they occurred as a result of visionary leadership in both the public and private sectors . 
while the advances we have made in medicine in the last century have been both impressive and historic , we have a long way to go . 
far too many people in our society suffer from debilitating diseases like parkinson 's , alzheimer 's and diabetes for which there are no cures . 
mr. speaker , i rise in support of h.r. 810 because we need to support studying every kind of stem cell , from cord blood to adult to embryonic . 
i was diagnosed when i was in my mid-40s and michael j. fox , for example , was much younger than that . 
they also believe that the advances in parkinson 's research will lead to accelerated cures for other illnesses such as alzheimer 's . 
only embryonic stem cells hold enormous potential in order to treat these patients . 
these doctors are among some of the most talented , dedicated , and well-respected doctors in this country . 
what we in congress should be advocating for is the continuing advancement of adult stem cell research , a true scientific success story , which has benefited thousands of americans already . 
perhaps nowhere is this success more evident than in the advancement of cord-blood stem cells . 
the bill also takes on the recommendations of the institute of medicine , providing a national network that would link all the cord-blood banks participating in an inventory program into a search system , allowing transplant physicians to search for cord-blood and bone marrow matches through a single-access point . 
the stem cell therapeutic and research act advances true stem cell research , research with real promise , grounded in proven science ; and it is ethically sound . 
i urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important and timely legislation . 
the debate over embryonic stem cell research is important because there are no more important issues that we deal with in this chamber than when we debate life and death . 
mr. speaker , as i stand here in this chamber today , i am a human being . 
at some point in our history , every single person here was also an embryo . 
it is not just , as some have suggested , a couple of cells in a petri dish . 
today , we are debating embryonic stem cell research , a type of stem cell research in which a tiny member of the human family must die . 
my answer to that is an emphatic `` no. '' it is our duty to ensure that we spend our money on things that work , and there are no therapies in humans that have ever successfully been carried out using embryonic stem cells . 
and that is really what this whole debate is about , paying for what works and paying for it in a way that is consistent with the morals of our taxpayers . 
look , even the president and ceo of the juvenile diabetes research foundation , a group that is a strong supporter of destroying human embryos for research , he said , `` there have been more promising results in adult stem cells than there have been in embryonic stem cells. '' he predicted that their foundation would soon be spending more on adult cells research than embryonic research . 
physiologist who taught years ago in medical school and taught physiology but , more importantly , has also taught the subject matter , which is difficult to understand . 
i was there in medical school . 
medical students get maybe in a 4-year period of time , 6 months ' worth of embryology ; and of course , to hear my colleague from maryland explaining the embryologic process , it sort of takes me back to those days . 
there are no embryologists other than maybe the gentleman from maryland ( mr. bartlett ) xz4000170 in the body ; so it is not an easy concept to understand . 
but with this icsi technique , they literally can obtain sperm by a biopsy in someone who has just a few sperm , not 1 , 000 , not 60 million , but maybe just a few ; and take one sperm from that biopsy and under the proper laboratory techniques , maybe a specialized microscope , take the wife 's egg and inject that sperm with a needle , with a very fine needle , under the microscope . 
and after several days in cell multiplication , as the gentleman from maryland ( mr. bartlett ) xz4000170 was explaining , then that is implanted in the mom 's uterus , and the miracle of birth can occur for that couple . 
this is being done right in my community of marietta , georgia , by reproductive endocrinologists , those doctors who specialize in infertility and doing those kinds of things ; and it has been going on for 10 , 12 years now . 
for goodness sake , we put a man on the moon in 1969 . 
that is to obtain embryonic stem cells without destroying or indeed even harming the embryo , and that analogy , that explanation of twinning and how the mono-zygotic single egg identical twin that the egg divides at a certain stage ; and indeed , they are taking away 50 percent of the cells , and in most instances , if the division is complete , they have two perfectly identical , beautiful children that develop . 
they were born at 26 weeks , right at that point where it is perfectly legal with very little prescription in our respective states to destroy those lives . 
and we are going to be talking , mr. speaker , tomorrow in this chamber about the great successes that we are achieving today with stem cell technology , but not embryonic stem cells . 
we are talking about the great success , 58 different research endeavors where progress has been made in these various diseases that the gentleman from maryland ( mr. bartlett ) xz4000170 described , utilizing either stem cells obtained from umbilical cord blood or from adult stem cells , bone marrow and other tissues . 
mr. speaker , i thank the gentleman for yielding , and i thank my friend , the gentleman from nebraska ( mr. osborne ) xz4003030 , for being here with us tonight and for his very , very pertinent remarks in regard to where do you draw the line as far as life . 
physiologist knows about the definition of pre-embryo , but i never learned that in embryology or any medical school course i took or in my obstetric and gynecology training and my 30 years of experience in the field . 
but i think so many people , mr. speaker , and even some of our colleagues , need to understand that in getting those embryonic stem cells , the life is destroyed . 
and when you ask that question , well , wait a minute now , if you are talking about sacrificing one life to get these cells in hopes that they might lead to at some point in the future a cure , no , i am not for that . 
and when you get this and you start down this slippery slope in regard to what the south koreans are doing , suppose , mr. speaker , that the harvesting of these stem cells from these cloned embryos that the results are not very good , as they have not really been very good in the embryonic stem cells we have retained from these so-called throw-away babies , these 400 , 000 in these fertility clinics . 
but what i am saying , and i will wrap this up pretty quickly because i know the gentleman 's time is running short , in these cloned embryos , if it is not working too well with the fetal cells , the embryonic cells , why not let these babies develop , maybe to the point 26 weeks , the stage at which my precious twin granddaughters were born , and then you have got an organ that you can transplant , a liver , a pancreas , and you can then just simply destroy the child at that point and take their organs ? 
mr. speaker , i rise today in strong support of the gentleman from new jersey ( mr. smith 's ) stem cell therapeutics and research act of 2005 , and commend the gentleman for his courageous and principled stand for the sanctity of life . 
as a physician member , i know that significant successes are being reported from the use of umbilical cord stem cells in the treatment of 67 diseases , including sickle cell anemia , leukemia , osteoporosis and lymphoma . 
there is great promise in this research . 
umbilical cord stem cells , unlike embryonic stem cells can be matched to a recipient by blood type , gender , ethnicity , that results in fewer tissue rejections . 
aside from the fact that harvesting embryonic stem cells results in the destruction of innocent life , embryonic stem cells are gathered without knowledge of blood cell type , without assurance that they are free from infection , and without screening for genetic defects . 
mr. speaker , i rise this evening in opposition , strong opposition , to h.r. 810 , not as a physician , not as an obstetrician-gynecologist , but as a pro-life catholic who firmly believes in the sanctity of life . 
you have members , republicans and democrats , who are for the bill , indeed the authors , and you have republicans and democrats who are in opposition to the bill . 
one of the gentlemen on my side of the aisle said that we need the federal government , we need the federal government involved in embryonic stem cell research and the funding of that to provide ethical guidelines to the states . 
well , if the federal government is involved in a program where taxpayer dollars are spent to destroy human life , what ethical advice can they give to my state of georgia , i ask ? 
you see , i firmly believe in the sanctity of life , and i believe that life does begin at conception , and these embryos are definitely living human beings . 
let me just say in conclusion , the gentleman from new jersey talked about his development , his growth and development , and going backwards in his life . 
he stood in this well and said , `` i am an adult man today . 
but yesterday i was a teenager , and before that i was a toddler. '' but he did not go the opposite direction and say `` in 20 years i will be a senior citizen , and after that i may be in a nursing home and i may have alzheimer 's . 
i know the gentleman from maryland as he started this special order hour discussed the fact that of the so-called throwaway embryos , throwaway babies as we see it in these in vitro fertilization clinics that exist across this country , i think somebody estimated there were 400 , 000 of them and that in some instances couples who had gone through in vitro fertilization and completed their families truly would have some extra embryos that they at least at a certain point in time had no intention of having reimplanted . 
but those of us who feel very strongly about the sanctity of life truly believe that there is no such thing as an excess human life at either extreme , the very youngest embryonic stage or the very oldest , many of whom i would be referring to , our octogenarians and older who might be in a nursing home suffering from alzheimer 's disease at the final stages of their lives , but all of these lives are extremely important ; and as the gentleman from maryland pointed out , there are actually 100 or close to 100 little babies , up to 6 , 8 months old now who were referred to as the snowflake babies . 
as the gentleman from maryland points out , there are a lot more of those little lives that are still on ice , if you will ; and the gentleman from maryland is so right in pointing out that , hey , maybe one of those would be an einstein one of these days , the next einstein . 
i do not think , madam speaker , that we will ever get to the point in this chamber , as much as i , and i am sure the gentleman from maryland is of the same mind-set , of wanting to do things in a bipartisan fashion with our colleagues on both sides of the aisle , this issue , this pro-life/pro-choice issue . 
this opportunity , basically , as he is pointing out with his posters in regard to the ability , with some research , to be able to obtain embryonic stem cells without destroying human life , without destroying the embryo , i have heard him refer to this almost like an embryonic biopsy . 
as i understand the bill , it is an opportunity to encourage , with the president 's blessing , increased funding through the nih for research on nonhuman primates to make sure that this biopsy , actually it has already been done in genetic counseling studies on couples who have a really strong family history of inheritable diseases , something like hemophilia or duchenne 's muscular dystrophy where maybe if it is an adult child , it has a 50 percent chance of having one of these life-threatening , eventually fatal diseases . 
we are already doing testing on those embryos to make sure that it would be safe to put them back into the mother 's womb to grow and develop and become a full-term fetus and there has been no harm in those instances . 
physiologist , a doctor of physiology who has taught in medical school . 
madam speaker , when i was in medical school , it was my instructor who taught me physiology , the functioning of the human body in a healthy situation , whether we are talking about the heart , the lungs , or any organ system of the body . 
it gives us an opportunity to address this issue of trying to find a way with stem cells , whether they are adult or embryonic ; and i tend to agree with the gentleman from maryland that embryonic stem cells probably do have a little more potential , although we have had great success in adult stem cells and a lot of these diseases that our colleagues have talked about and we have seen there is no argument , i do not think , in this body , in a partisan way about wanting to help and wanting to use science to the best of our ability to look for a cure . 
but the point is the president in august of 2001 was absolutely right , in my humble opinion , in regard to his decision to put a moratorium on the harvesting of stem cells , embryonic stem cells that would result in the destruction of human life . 
at that point , there were some 60 cell lines already in existence that our university research scientists at nih and other places were using . 
those lives have already been destroyed in obtaining those stem cell lines . 
the president , this president , george w. bush , is the very first president that , in fact , allowed federal funding for research on embryonic stem cells . 
so those who criticize or suggest , madam speaker , that this president is insensitive and uncaring , i suggest to my colleagues that this president is the most caring that we have ever had in regard to this issue . 
he does not deserve to be criticized , but rather applauded for his efforts in this regard . 
and i think he is steadfast in his determination not to destroy human life because , as the gentleman from maryland has pointed out and as i just said , we do not know those so-called extra embryos , those throwaway embryos . 
and even the couples who think , madam speaker , that they would never use those embryos , we have witnessed tragedies every day in the news , this 24-hour cable news that we are subjected to , but we read about children that are kidnapped , abused , murdered , the situation in aruba , the situation in nebraska . 
there is a companion piece of legislation , as i understand ; it originating in the other body . 
madam speaker , i wanted to mention to the gentleman that as an ob/gyn physician , of course i have had some experience with some of the processes that can occur in reproductive endocrine laboratories and the technique dealing with infertile couples , and i have had a discussion with the gentleman from maryland about this . 
but in a situation where the couple is infertile and it is because of male infertility , there is nothing wrong with the egg , but there is a very , very low sperm count in the male , and normally it takes probably 1 , 000 sperm to successfully fertilize an egg in the natural way . 
in fact , the normal sperm count in a male is about 60 million . 
but even a sperm count as low as 1 , 000 , pregnancy can occur in the normal , natural way . 
there is an acronym for everything , it seems , even though this is not in the military . 
and these biologists working with reproductive endocrinologists , medical doctors who specialize in infertility , can literally take a single sperm and with a needle inject that sperm into the egg and create a life , and that has been done many times , and not just at the nih , but in a lot of these infertility clinics across this great country , in my state of georgia . 
so what the gentleman from maryland ( mr. bartlett ) xz4000170 is talking about in this poster presentation in regard to waiting to just the right point for these scientists to be able to develop a technique to obtain embryonic stem cells without destroying that embryo and beyond the point where that single cell itself would be an embryo , he knows of what he speaks . 
the castle/degette bill will expand research on embryonic stem cells , which would have the ability to reproduce indefinitely and to evolve into any cell type in the body . 
these tremendous people , as well as countless more in each of our communities , know what it is like to live every day waiting for your cure . 
slamming the door on stem cell research slams the door in their faces . 
she was diagnosed with alzheimer 's in the mid-1990s . 
but by voting today for both these bills , we can help maybe the next generation , instead of sticking our heads in the sand . 
representatives castle and degette have crafted this bill meticulously , which would allow the use of surplus embryos from in vitro fertilization treatments and require donor consent . 
real political courage and leadership -- on both sides of the aisle , in the house and senate -- was required to bring us to this point . 
parkinson 's , cancer , alzheimer 's , juvenile diabetes , spinal cord injuries -- cures for these and other serious ailments may lie in stem cell research . 
many in this body like to talk about `` values. '' today , i say to them : using discarded embryos to find scientific cures for fatal diseases is our moral obligation . 
mr. speaker , i rise in support of the legislation to help us have continued success in the funding for research for uses for adult stem cells . 
i believe it is this congress 's duty to help support that , because certainly we will have many people who have benefited already and additional people in the future who can benefit from this kind of research . 
in fact , the university of pittsburgh in my hometown just announced about a week or so ago that they are doing clinical trials regarding the use of bone marrow stem cells to help reverse chronic heart failure . 
i met a gentleman actually who was involved in the research , and they talked about trials that have already been done in south america that have been successful . 
mr. speaker , i thank the majority leader for yielding me this time , and i am rising in opposition to the legislation that would fund the destruction of embryos in order to take the stem cells for research . 
this morning , i met several families , parents with young children who are here in washington . 
they have been referred to a little bit today , but for those just joining the argument , the snowflake babies are born from what would have been discarded embryos in fertilization clinics . 
and , in fact , the children i met today were wonderful evidence of that . 
and , in fact , there is no proof that embryonic stem cell research can be successful . 
this is an advance similar to advances in past years of blood transfusions and organ transplants . 
and to be fair , some patients do not want to take part in blood transfusions and organ transplants for personal reasons . 
to help us understand this humane line of research , let us look at in vitro fertilization . 
several decades ago , many people raised concerns about this procedure ; everywhere there were attacks using the term `` test tube babies. '' but today there are 400 , 000 young people who are the products of in vitro fertilization , and in every case , there are eggs , fertilized eggs , that were not brought to full-term birth . 
mr. speaker , i rise today in strong support of the bipartisan stem cell research enhancement act , h.r. 810 , legislation that will dramatically expand the number of stem cell lines available for federally funded research . 
adult stem cells , on the other hand , have not shown this ability to differentiate into specific types of cells , have not yet been identified in all vital organs , and are difficult to identify , purify , and grow . 
according to the national institutes of health , nih , only 22 of the 78 stem cell lines that were deemed eligible for federal funding by president george bush in 2001 are currently available to nih investigators . 
the defense authorization bill , mr. leader , do you expect at this point in time to have that on a particular day of the week ? 
i thank the gentleman for that information and would ask that certainly the substantive democratic amendments be made in order . 
this , obviously , is a very important bill , a large sum of money , critically important at a time when we are confronting terrorists in iraq and around the world and our men and women are in harm 's way . 
all of us want to make sure that we have our ideas on how we can best strengthen our efforts in that bill . 
so to the extent that the leader can prevail upon the rules committee to allow such amendments as democratic members and , for that matter , republican members want to offer , i think that would be in the best interests of full consideration . 
i know we are going to be meeting monday night and going to come in early tuesday . 
i thank the leader for that information and appreciate his working with leader pelosi in determining that , because this is important . 
i think all members will want to make sure that that time frame in which it will be considered , they will be available to be on the floor or be watching the floor debate with the ability to come to the floor to offer their thoughts . 
as we know , the highway bill is now more than 2 years overdue in terms of reauthorization , has been sitting for some period of time . 
i thank the leader for that observation and hopefully we can , in fact , move on that . 
now it is a little bit in between that . 
and then the president , of course , will have to do what he thinks is best and make a determination , and then we might have a shocking event and he may veto a bill and send it back to us , and i am relatively confident we would work our will at that point in time . 
mr. speaker , reclaiming my time , i recall that democrats , when they were in charge , had a slightly different perspective , believing we were a co-equal branch of the government . 
we would adopt our policies based upon what we believed to be in the best interests of this country , and that the president , as a co-equal branch of the government , would make his determination , and if we disagreed we would override his veto . 
mr. speaker , i have been here for some period of time , as the leader knows , and the only bill that ronald reagan vetoed that was overridden by the congress was a bill in which he said we did not spend enough money in 1983 . 
this is , i think , one of the most important bills that we will consider for the welfare of people not only in this country , but throughout the world . 
thus , mr. speaker , i believe the issue before this house today is this : will we foster embryonic stem cell research , research that holds great promise for the potential treatment or cure of diseases such as als , lou gehrig 's disease , alzheimer 's , parkinson 's , and other diseases , and offer hope to those with spinal cord injury and other injuries of the nervous system , or will we stand in the way ? 
but , in fact , this legislation requires the department of health and human services and the national institutes of health to issue guidelines for ethical considerations ; it requires a determination that the embryos would never have been implanted and would have been discarded ; and it requires the donor 's written , informed consent . 
it is important that we do so in a thoughtful and principled way . 
everyone in this room was an embryo at one time . 
lincoln asked a very haunting question at a small military cemetery in pennsylvania . 
he asked whether a nation conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal can long endure ? 
the first one is , for the first time in our national history , taxpayers ' dollars are going to be spent for the killing of innocent human life . 
in world war ii , 1940 , before america got in the war , there was a publication called the yearbook of obstetrics and gynecology . 
joseph delee wrote in that yearbook something that applies to us today . 
`` at the present time , when rivers of blood and tears of innocent men and women are flowing in most parts of the world , it seems almost silly to be contending over the right to life of an unknowable atom of human flesh in the uterus of a woman . 
on the contrary , it is of transcendent importance that there be in this chaotic world one high spot , however small , which is safe against the deluge of immorality and savagery that is sweeping over us . 
`` that we , in the medical profession , hold to the principle of the sacredness of human life and the rights of the individual , even though unborn , is proof that humanity is not yet lost. '' i believe humanity is not yet lost , and this vote will tell us the answer to that question . 
connie davis , the medical director of university of washington 's kidney and kidney-pancreas transplant program , put this discussion in perspective when i was talking to her yesterday . 
she reminded me that the donation of a kidney used to be a controversial issue in this country . 
he and his wife had , in fact , had an in vitro fertilization . 
mr. speaker , i rise today in strong support of this important bill . 
in 1990 , when she was eleven years old , brooke was hit by a car , which left her paralyzed from the neck down . 
even with this hardship , she graduated from harvard university in 2000 , harvard 's kennedy school of government in 2004 , and she is currently a ph.d . 
candidate in political science at stony brook university . 
i have worked with her to raise public awareness of the importance of stem cell research , and under the unanimous consent agreement , i am including an essay that brooke wrote on the issue in the congressional record . 
yet , despite this underlying and widely accepted notion of several voices speaking on behalf of many , this does not always appear to be the case and , in fact , those making collective decisions can become inextricably linked to their own , myopic ideology , failing to understand the situations of others or hear their voices . 
in september of 1990 , when i was eleven years old , i was hit by a car while walking home from my first day of 7th grade . 
tasks that , to others , might seem mundane or be taken for granted are strenuous challenges , sometimes taking long hours instead of mere minutes , causing frustration both from what can not be at present and potential being lost in the future . 
to ignore the voices and dash the hopes of those most in need is bad policy . 
in the context of stem cell research legislation , these are bad policies , yet policies that are being upheld . 
this forces millions to wonder things like , `` if i could be freed from the on august 9th , 2001 , from his ranch in crawford , texas , president bush announced that he would significantly limit federal funds to stem cell research , only agreeing to fund research conducted on to stem cell lines already in existence at the time . 
in the president 's own words , `` i worry about a culture that devalues life , and believe as your president i have an important obligation to foster and encourage respect for life in america and throughout the world ... ... . 
similar to other issues facing our nation today , the decision of whether or not to fund embryonic stem cell research is now left in the hands of the states , with the legislatures and governors picking up where the u.s. congress and president have left off . 
california , with its proposition 71 , has been the most recent state to make substantive progress on the issue , passing a referendum to support research conducted in the state . 
california joins new jersey in leading the charge for state-funded stem cell research . 
with researchers , scientists , and human lives waiting in the wings for advances , opportunity wasted is opportunity lost . 
in its most basic description , stem cells are the undifferentiated , unspecialized cells that can be extracted from embryos in their earliest stages of development , three to five days after fertilization . 
the embryos , known in this initial developmental form as blastocysts , contain only about 30 cells . 
to hold such a belief is to view the world in black and white terms , thereby ignoring the much more complex gray areas . 
these blastocysts are those that will go unused after in vitro fertilization procedures and will never be used to bring about life . 
these blastocysts , which some proclaim represent the sanctity of life , will only be kept in freezers at fertility clinics until they have expired and then will be discarded completely . 
to rob the stem cells of their other potential of life , which is to cure diseases or to help regenerate parts of the body that are not regenerating on their own , is really to devalue life in another , otherwise avoidable way . 
orwell 's 1984 has somehow come to life in 2004 , with the speculations made by some of about unintended , science-fiction consequences . 
science has given medicine more promise than ever before , with the potential to heal and restore people in ways once unfathomable . 
it is appropriate to have a marriage today of two very vital and important legislative initiatives , one dealing with adult stem cell research , which is vital and done along ethical lines and will help many in our community that have a number of significant diseases ; in particular , alzheimer 's and sickle cell anemia . 
let me tell my colleagues about an individual that i love and admire in my community , reverend m.l . 
jackson , exciting , exuberant , a leader in our community . 
unless federal funding for stem cell research is expanded , the united states stands in real danger of falling behind other countries in this promising area of research . 
i would mention that the national academy of sciences recently issued a set of guidelines to ensure that human embryonic stem cell research is conducted in a safe and ethical manner . 
mr. chairman , i rise this morning in support of the `` stem cell therapeutic and research act of 2005. '' this measure , sponsored by christopher h. smith , joe barton , and artur davis would promote research on a type of stem cell , known as an adult stem cell , taken from umbilical cord blood . 
in addition , the bill creates a new federal program to collect and store umbilical-cord-blood stem cells , and expands the current bone-marrow registry program . 
researchers hope to be able to study stem cells to better understand how diseases develop and eventually use them to generate tissues that could replace damaged or diseased tissues and organs in patients . 
adult stem cells are unspecialized cells found in specialized tissue such as bone marrow or skeletal tissue . 
initially , scientists viewed their medical applications as limited in what they can become to the cell types from which they were extracted . 
as you can see , these are complicated issues , but i think we are headed in the right direction . 
mr. speaker , i rise today in support of h.r. 810 , the `` stem cell research enhancement act of 2005. '' as a supporter of the bill , i would argue that it is necessary to expand the number of stem cell lines that can be used in federally funded research in order to accelerate scientific progress toward the cures and treatments for a wide variety of diseases and debilitating health conditions -- including parkinson 's disease , diabetes , alzheimer 's disease , als , cancer , and spinal cord injuries . 
according to the national institutes of health , nih , of the 78 stem cell lines that were declared eligible for federal funding in 2001 , only about 22 lines are actually available for study by and distribution to researchers . 
these nih-approved lines lack the genetic diversity that researchers need in order to create effective treatments for millions of americans . 
the embryos could be used only if the donors give their informed , written consent and receive no money or other inducement in exchange for their embryos . 
unless federal funding for stem cell research is expanded , the united states stands in real danger of falling behind other countries in this promising area of research . 
while it is important to recognize that this bill has nothing to do with cloning , it is also important to recognize that other countries are moving ahead in stem cell research . 
this bill provides a limited -- but nonetheless highly significant -- change in current policy that would result in making many more lines of stem cells available for research . 
passage of this bill would provide hope for those millions of americans suffering from diseases that may be treated or even cured as a result of stem cell research before concluding , i would just mention that the national academy of sciences , nas , recently issued a set of guidelines to ensure that human embryonic stem cell research is conducted in a safe and ethical manner . 
specifically , h.r. 810 requires that : the stem cells must be derived from human embryos that were donated from in vitro fertilization clinics , and that were created for the purpose of fertility treatment , but were in excess of the clinical need of the people seeking such treatment ; the embryos would not have been used for fertility treatment , and would otherwise be discarded ; the individuals seeking fertility treatment donated the embryos with informed written consent and without any financial payment or other inducement to make the donation . 
in addition , the bill requires that not later than 60 days after enactment , hhs , in consultation with the national institutes of health , issue final guidelines to carry out the requirements of this bill . 
the report must include a description of whether , and to what extent , these activities were carried out in accordance with the requirements of this bill . 
in closing , i urge my colleagues to support h.r. 810 . 
since the federal government 's science officials have abdicated their traditional role in setting ethical rules for medical experimentation , the national academy of sciences has filled the void with useful guidelines for research with human embryonic stem cells . 
acting on behalf of scientists around the country , the nas last week issued stem cell research guidelines that should become a blueprint for ethical behavior in both the public and private sector . 
with the federal government 's role limited , research has been proceeding without clear , consistent guidelines ... ... .these and other recommendations are a good start toward ensuring that stem cell research is conducted in an ethical way ... .. 
i rise in strong support of the legislation before us which i consider to be extremely important . 
these free citizens would simply exercise their right and their conscience in donating embryos that would otherwise be discarded , destroyed , as waste . 
but if you believe that life begins when the fertilized egg is implanted in the mother 's womb , which , of course , is essential for it to realize its potential for life , then using a fertilized egg that has not been implanted is not a taking of life . 
if , further , you believe that life begins later in the process , then you are not taking life . 
so i ask each of my colleagues to think carefully in conscience when life does begin ; and , on that issue , your vote on this bill rests . 
h.r. 810 represents another step forward in our battle against diseases and illnesses which we have spent billions of dollars trying to research , treat , and cure . 
mr. speaker , h.r. 810 does not usher us into uncharted waters : we are already engaged in both the federal funding and the federal oversight of this research . 
in my district case western reserve university , the cleveland clinic , and university hospital have embarked on a monumental and groundbreaking project to establish the national center for regenerative medicine . 
while this research is basically focused on adult stem cell and umbilical cord research , we must continue to move forward with research in a responsible , compassionate , and humane way . 
today we in the congress are debating the essence of human life , the creation of life and the destruction of life . 
but i know one thing : on a matter of life and death , congress should proceed carefully , thoughtfully and in an informed manner . 
some evidence indicates stem cell research from nonembryonic sources now has made a difference in treating 58 different diseases . 
then , where is the committee record that helps us struggle with the essential moral question of : how exactly does one destroy life in order to save it ? 
where is the committee transcript that reveals to the majority of members not on the committee the ethical questions that we and every family should be addressing concerning the proprietary nature of the dna in any embryonic cell ? 
how is her husband or mate legally protected in this relationship ? 
mr. speaker , there is a lot of money to be made in this new field of life science . 
i find it most coincidental that last week the south koreans doing research in this arena announced that they had cloned cells , making it appear as though , if congress did not act today , america would fall behind in the world research community . 
in my opinion , the subcommittee and committees of jurisdiction have not met their responsibilities to this congress , by abdicating their hearing responsibility . 
on a matter of such magnitude , where some human embryos will be destroyed in the hope that new cures are made possible , the congress needs to be more responsible . 
i am a diabetic myself , and for the last decade i have been working with stem cell research in my own district . 
the karmanos cancer institute , world renowned in our community and in michigan , and part of the former detroit medical center , is a leader in research . 
in many instances , 90 percent of the time , those cords are displaced and thrown away . 
so i rise in support of h.r. 2520 as another means for us to prolong life , to give life , from stem cords , umbilical cords of women that are heretofore thrown out . 
in our community , we are educating women and asking for their permission that medical research is able to use the cords , the umbilical cords of the fetus . 
our country is first in medical science ; and this act that we are taking today will continue research and development , healthier lives and longer lives . 
mr. speaker , i rise in strong support of this legislation . 
and just to be clear once again during this debate , this bill limits the use of only those embryos that will be discarded or destroyed from in vitro fertilization clinics with the consent of the donors . 
i rise in support of this legislation not because it promises cures for diabetes , parkinson 's , spinal cord injuries , alzheimer 's , but because it gives us yet another opportunity to discover cures for these ailments . 
but let us also allow the federal government to get more involved in embryonic stem cell research . 
we are already falling behind the rest of the world in this research in light of south korea 's recent announcement last week . 
mr. speaker , i rise today in strong support of h.r. 810 , the stem cell research enhancement act of 2005 . 
important advances in the science of embryonic stem cell research have been made since the august 2001 policy was set . 
earlier this year , researchers at the university of wisconsin in madison figured out how to grow human embryonic stem cells without using mouse feeder cells . 
this is exciting news since mouse feeder cells are thought to be a source of contamination if the cells are ever to be used therapeutically in humans . 
in fact , dr . 
in 2003 , this esteemed researcher received the frank annunzio award , given to recognize the innovative research of american scientists who devote their careers to improving the lives of people through their work in science . 
but this legislation is not only important because of the potential for advances in science and technology . 
i strongly urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important legislation that will allow science to move forward unimpeded , has the potential to revolutionize the practice of medicine , and can offer hope to the millions of americans suffering from debilitating diseases . 
the net result in death or disability can not be accepted . 
i find this information in the military tribunals under control council law no . 
nearly all of us are the sons and daughters of people who took risks to come to build a new life in a new world . 
we take risks , we try new things ; and for 200 years the future came first to americans , the most dynamic and forward-thinking people in all of human history . 
americans now receive more nobel prizes in medicine than all other european countries combined . 
mr. speaker , i do rise today in strong support of h.r. 810 . 
over the past two decades , three-quarters of the scientists who have won the nobel prize in medicine have studied or taught in the united states . 
our nation has created an environment that values innovation and discovery , especially in biological sciences . 
h.r. 810 will help america continue to lead in this crucial field . 
of course , there is more at stake in this debate than america 's global standing . 
the bill requires that embryos be in excess of clinical need . 
it could result in saving millions of lives . 
mr. speaker , i rise in strong support of h.r. 810 , and i want to acknowledge the bipartisan effort that has gone into this legislation and the incredible grass roots movement that has built support for this groundbreaking medical research . 
at age 16 , i was an explorer scout in my hometown police station . 
one afternoon , in the police locker room , a gun accidentally discharged . 
this experience shapes my perspective in so many ways . 
by permitting research only on excess embryos created in the in-vitro fertilization process , and by establishing a clear , voluntary consent process for donors , h.r. 810 meets this responsibility . 
i believe one day families will no longer watch in agony as a loved one with parkinson 's or alzheimer 's gradually declines . 
there are few moments in medical history when we can clearly identify a giant step forward in improving countless lives . 
today we have a historic opportunity to make a difference in the lives of millions of americans and for people around the world . 
i urge my colleagues to vote in favor of h.r. 810 . 
mr. speaker , i rise today in support of h.r. 810 , the stem cell research enhancement act and h.r. 2520 , the stem cell therapeutic and research act that we debated earlier today . 
this issue is about medical research coupled with high ethical standards and providing hope to those most in need -- it should have no role in any party 's political agenda . 
in 2001 , president bush announced that for the first time federal funds could be used to support limited research on human embryonic stem cells , specifically `` existing stem cell lines where the life and death decision has already been made. '' under this policy , only 78 embryonic stem cell lines are eligible for use and according to the national institutes of health ( nih ) , only 22 of those lines are viable for human research . 
both bills -- the stem cell therapeutic and research act that would create a new federal program to collect and store umbilical-cord-blood cells and expand the current bone-marrow registry program and the stem cell research enhancement act that would increase the number of stem cell lines that can be used in federally funded research -- establish much-needed ethical standards and expand the possibilities of stem cell research for new treatments and cures . 
according to the nih , in the united states more than 4 million people suffer from alzheimer 's disease ; one in every four deaths is from cancer ; and every hour of every day , someone is diagnosed with juvenile ( type 1 ) diabetes . 
the president was quoted by the associated press over the weekend saying , `` i made it very clear to the congress that the use of federal money , taxpayers ' money to promote science which destroys life in order to save life is -- i 'm against that . 
mr. speaker , i urge my colleagues join me today in advancing science and supporting h.r. 810 . 
mr. speaker , we do not know yet , but the possibility is very real that stem cell research may be the greatest breakthrough in the history of science . 
how in heaven 's name can we deny the promise of such research ? 
there is consensus at this time in this body and in the research community that scientists should not play god in attempting to clone human beings , but we are at a stage of human existence where there is a practical possibility that a blastocyst that would otherwise be thrown away as waste can , in a petri dish , be used to help solve these incredible diseases , from alzheimer 's to parkinson 's to diabetes to cancer . 
not to open the door is to put our heads in the sands and foreclose the prospect of a better life for many , many americans . 
mr. speaker , as an original co-sponsor of h.r. 810 , i rise in support of the stem cell research enhancement act . 
diabetes in particular is a huge problem , and like many other diseases , minority communities are disproportionately affected by it . 
in my district in alameda county , approximately 13.4 percent of african americans have been diagnosed with diabetes compared to 4.5 percent of whites . 
mr. speaker , i rise in support of the stem cell research enhancement act . 
the vast majority of the remaining usable lines are in other countries that have shown little interest in making them available to u.s. researchers . 
as a result , our researchers are falling behind their counterparts in other countries , and our citizens are watching their hopes for cures within their lifetimes slip away . 
furthermore , delay in effectively resolving this issue could for countless americans be a matter of basic health or indeed life . 
keeping in mind the essential federal role in critical basic health research , i believe that it is essential that we support this bill so our country can continue in the lead in exploring the frontiers of science and medicine . 
elizabeth nable of the national heart , lung and blood institute said , `` because u.s. researchers who depend on federal funds lack access to newer human embryonic stem cell lines , they are at a technological disadvantage relative to researchers funded by california , as well as investigators in asia and europe . 
this bill is a modest proposal compared to california 's , but it is still an important step ; and that is why it is supported by all the major educational research institutions in california . 
i include their letter of support in the record . 
dear representative lofgren : we are writing to express our support for changing federal policy on human embryonic stem cell research to allow an expansion in available cell lines . 
as you probably know , a vote on legislation that would alter current policy is expected in the coming weeks , and we urge your `'yes '' vote . 
the castle-degette bill would expand current policy to allow federal funding for research with stem cell lines discovered after the mandated august 9 , 2001 , cut-off date as well as lines derived in the future . 
with regard to future stem cell lines , the bill applies only to lines derived from days-old blastocysts that otherwise would be discarded from in vitro fertilization clinics , but that instead are voluntarily donated to research by consenting individuals , without compensation . 
this expansion in policy will further facilitate and accelerate the research conducted in our state . 
when the current federal embryonic stem cell research policy went into effect in 2001 , the notion was that 78 cell lines would be available for research . 
mr. speaker , i am proud to be a cosponsor of h.r. 810 , and i rise in strong support of this critical legislation . 
i am proud to be a cosponsor of h.r. 810 , and i rise in strong support of this critical legislation . 
in my judgment we now have a moral obligation to pursue each opportunity and provide crucial funding , support and oversight for this critical research . 
like many of you , i believe that strong guidelines must be in place with vigorous oversight from the nih and congress before allowing federally-funded embryonic stem cell research . 
the legislation before us today would strengthen the standards guiding embryonic stem cell research and would ensure that embryos originally created for the purpose of in vitro fertilization could be made available for research only with the consent of the donor . 
with the appropriate guidelines in place , we are closer than ever to remarkable discoveries and on the brink of providing hope to millions of individuals who otherwise have none . 
mr. speaker , i rise today in support of h.r. 810 , the stem cell research enhancement act of 2005 . 
mr. speaker , i have met with doctors , scientists , and researchers in my district 's leading medical institutions who warn of a `` brain drain '' as their best and brightest relocate to places where funding for embryonic stem cell research is not restricted . 
i have spoken with lawmakers in the state of new york , who have garnered $ 1 billion in embryonic stem cell research funding , but without federal funding , stem cell research will move forward without crucial oversight and guidelines . 
in 2003 , over 900 , 000 americans died of heart disease and more than 550 , 000 succumbed to cancer . 
i am sure that many in this chamber have seen friends suffer through the misery of cancer and the indignities of chemotherapy . 
in fact , it is a moral imperative . 
hope is the most important four-letter word in the language . 
vote for hope for a beloved mother whose loss of balance leads to falls in the night . 
vote `` yes '' so that the next generation of children will have to turn to the history books to know that there ever was such a thing as juvenile diabetes or parkinson 's or alzheimer 's or any of these plagues that affect our nation today and are going to turn into a crisis in the next generation . 
mr. speaker , while europe and singapore and california and korea are moving forward in an effort to relieve human suffering , the united states congress , 435 theologians , have gathered here to decide a values decision . 
there was no in vitro fertilization or stem cell research when jesus walked on the earth . 
the decision comes down to this : a man and woman come in to a physician . 
they put them in a jar or they put them in a petri plate , and it becomes an embryo . 
they put it in the mother . 
to watch somebody drown in their own secretions , someone that you know and care about , and then come in here and say we are not going to look for a way to relieve that kind of agony , we will not worry about a 13-year-old kid who gets diabetes and has to give himself thousands and thousands of shots and loses the length of life that most of us expect because of that disease ; we will say to them , well , jesus wanted us to do this . 
this legislation takes the critical first step in expanding the number of stem cell lines that are eligible for federally funded research . 
for years , the united states has been the preeminent world leader in the field of biotechnology . 
we have made extraordinary advancements in the treatment , management and prevention of a wide range of disabilities . 
they are living longer , healthier lives due to our investments in scientific research . 
in fact , just last week , scientists in south korea successfully created the world 's first human embryonic stem cells that are patient-specific . 
this advancement was applauded around the world as a major step in the effort to produce cell-based therapies that wo n't be rejected by the body 's immune system . 
and in my home state of massachusetts , viacell and new world laboratories , two small biotech companies , have made notable progress in their research on spinal cord injuries and tissue regeneration . 
we are at a pivotal point in our nation 's history , and i hope that my colleagues will carefully consider this issue , leaving out partisan politics . 
with federal support , this research could have a real and tangible impact on millions of lives in this country . 
i urge my colleagues to join me in supporting h.r. 810 . 
we are here to decide whether our nation will move forward in the search for treatments and therapies that will cure a multitude of dreaded diseases that afflict an estimated 128 million americans . 
and today , along with the tremendous number of americans living with cancer , approximately 1.5 million new cases were diagnosed in the united states last year . 
today , we can vote for h.r. 810 , and in doing so , choose to save lives and help to end the suffering of so many americans . 
stem cells are the foundation cells for every organ , tissue , and cell in the body . 
mr. speaker , i rise in support of h.r. 810 , the stem cell research enhancement act , to put science and compassion ahead of ideology and fear . 
scientists believe that this unique ability might lead to breakthroughs in a number of illnesses that are now untreatable . 
as one researcher at harvard medical school and boston 's children 's hospital recently wrote in the new england journal of medicine , `` the science of human embryonic stem cells is in its infancy. '' restricting stem cell research now `` threaten [ s ] to starve the field at a critical stage. '' it 's critical to understand the science of stem cell research to weigh the moral and ethical issues involved . 
in vitro fertilization is a technology that has allowed millions of couples to share in the joy of childbirth . 
it results in the creation of embryos that are never implanted into the womb , never grow to be more than a handful of cells , and would otherwise be discarded . 
as one of the world 's foremost centers of medical research , massachusetts has much at stake in the stem cell debate . 
not only are our hospitals , research facilities , and institutions of higher learning on the cutting edge of conquering disease , they are also major economic drivers keeping us competitive in the global economy and employing tens of thousands of people . 
mr. speaker , america should be leading the world in using our compassion and our scientific knowledge to develop lifesaving therapies . 
mr. speaker , i rise in very strong support of the stem cell research enhancement act , which will expand the federal policy and implement stricter ethical guidelines for this research . 
embryonic stem cell research is necessary in discovering the causes of a myriad of genetic diseases , to testing new drug therapies more efficiently on laboratory tissue instead of human volunteers , and to staving off the ravages of disease with the regeneration of our bodies ' essential organs . 
according to the majority of scientists , if these stem cell lines were transplanted into people , they would provoke dangerous viruses in humans . 
h.r. 810 will also strengthen the ethical standards guiding the federal research on stem cell lines and will ensure that embryos donated for stem cell research were created for the purposes of in vitro fertilization , in excess of clinical need , would have otherwise be discarded and involved no financial inducement . 
in february 2005 , the civil society institute conducted a nationwide survey of 1 , 022 adults and found that 70 percent supported bipartisan federal legislation to promote embryonic stem cell research . 
public interest is best served when the medical and the scientific community is free to exercise their professional judgment in extending and enhancing human life . 
i urge all my colleagues to vote in favor of the stem cell research enhancement act . 
it can be used in multiple ways . 
in the area of umbilical cord blood , one of the cases , because in my practice , i oftentimes dealt with children with developmental disabilities . 
one case of the new england journal of medicine reports 90 percent success rate with hurley 's syndrome , a developmental disorder , autosomal dominant one , which ends up in severe developmental delays and death . 
you are taking something that has been discarded in the normal process of pregnancy and birth . 
and it does not involve the ending of any life in the process . 
now i have no doubts about the compassion and convictions of both sides on this issue , but i take issue with the direction of their convictions , because in the end a life without a name is still a life . 
further , let me state that president clinton 's bioethics council stated : `` embryos deserve respect as a form of human life. '' in 1999 the council said : `` funding of embryonic stem cell research should be done only if there are no alternatives. '' the research that we have reviewed today and has been reviewed by this congress in the past when these amendments have been looked upon over the last decade , is that there is still no alternative in the sense that the research is showing that cord blood stem cell research and adult stem cell research is where the results are found . 
i have worked with developmentally disabled kids all my professional life and would love to see cures for them , but i want to see the funding go in the direction where we can see success , where that direction has been achieved and we will continue to see that . 
but above all , let us remember that there are other things in medical research and medical ethics which come together here because you can not divorce the two . 
if we say it is all right to use lethal methods in our research to remove the life of an embryo , what next ? 
i looked at that little baby , and i was in love with her when i went to ultrasound and we saw her , even before she was born . 
when i see these little children , i know their intrinsic value ; and how we treat people , in whatever form of development , depends on how we perceive them . 
when we talk to many who have great knowledge about this , and i appreciate the doctors in our presence , we should never spend the american taxpayers ' dollars to take the life of an innocent human being . 
mr. speaker , i rise today in opposition to h.r. 810 . 
i believe in the transforming and the lifesaving power of research and science , and i have seen firsthand how cutting-edge research can make a big difference in the lives of americans who suffer with all sorts of diseases , and , i understand the value of federally funded research . 
h.r. 810 is merely the first step in an effort to spend federal money -- not only on the destruction , but on the creation of cloned embryos for research . 
i ask my colleagues to join me in opposing this bill . 
progress has been achieved in the laboratory in animal studies and in human application . 
an editorial in america magazine said it well : `` the debate over embryonic stem cell research can not be fully resolved because it is ignited by irreconcilable views of what reverence for life requires. '' let us recall louise brown , the first test tube baby . 
her life began as a single cell , fertilized egg , in vitro . 
there are many leftover potential louise browns , potential human beings as cryogenic embryos conceived in the laboratory . 
i can not get over the reality that human life is created in creating an embryo , whether in vitro or whether in utero . 
let us resolve any uncertainty in favor of life . 
i do not have that depth , but i would just like to reflect on the dilemma that many members will be placed in tomorrow as we decide on this particular vote . 
as the gentleman has mentioned , those who are in favor of embryonic stem cell research , many of them are people who have children who have juvenile diabetes . 
probably , in many cases , most of us would say an 8-month-old fetus would not be appropriate to do some harm to . 
many will argue that adult stem cells are more productive in research . 
then i guess the last thing that i would mention is that there is the ethical question , should we use public funds in doing research that is so divisive , that has so many people on both sides of the fence ? 
it seems we should have more unanimity in using public funds to do this type of research . 
so i applaud the gentleman for the proposed legislation that he has before us , because in this legislation is the prospect of using embryonic stem cells without destroying the embryo . 
so we think that the legislation , even though it is in its early stages , certainly has great promise and is one that we ought to pay very close heed to and one that would certainly be much more appealing to me than the other alternatives at the present time . 
i understand most of what is in there . 
one other thing that is also mentioned is the fact that when these frozen embryos are thawed out , many of them die , as the gentleman mentioned ; and some of those apparently will yield stem cells in the early stages . 
ironically , an example of this process may be found in h.r. 2520 ; some research indicates that adult stem cells may be as useful or more useful to medical science than either embryonic or umbilical cord stem cells . 
in fact , the supporters of embryonic stem cell research may have a point when they question the effectiveness of umbilical cord mr. speaker , there is no question that h.r. 810 violates basic constitutional principles by forcing taxpayers to subsidize embryonic stem cell research . 
mr. speaker , this is an important day for us in congress . 
i myself am deeply indebted to the gentlewoman from colorado ( ms. degette ) xz4001010 and the gentleman from delaware ( mr. castle ) xz4000700 for their great leadership and courage in bringing this legislation to the floor . 
this is important legislation because every family in america , every family in america is just one phone call away , one diagnosis , one accident away from needing the benefits of stem cell research . 
what we are doing here today is recognizing the miraculous power to cure that exists at the national institutes of health and in other institutes of excellence in research throughout our country . 
what we are saying is when these embryos are in excess of the needs of in vitro fertilization , rather than be destroyed , they will be used for basic biomedical research . 
it is interesting to me because when i first came to the congress , some of the same forces out there that are against this embryonic stem cell research were very much against in vitro fertilization . 
it is difficult to imagine that now , but they were against in vitro fertilization and considered it not to be on high moral ground . 
in order for our country to be preeminent in science , we must have the most talented , the most excellent scientists . 
as we all know , in science as in business , talent attracts capital , the capital to build the labs and all that is needed to do the research , and those labs in turn attract the excellent scientists , and that makes us first in the world , preeminent in science . 
i am particularly proud of my state of california where the people of california in a bipartisan way , as we are doing today , voted a commitment of resources to invest in embryonic stem cell research . 
we in california will become the regenerative capital of america , indeed , probably of the world . 
we have ethical standards in california . 
while i have the utmost respect , and the gentlemen know i do , for those who oppose this bill on moral grounds , i believe faith and science have at least one thing in common : both are searches for truth . 
i believe strongly in the power of prayer ; but part of that prayer is for a cure , and science can provide that . 
the episcopal church in its letter in support of this legislation says : `` as stewards of creation , we are called to help men and renew the world in many ways . 
the episcopal church celebrates medical research as this research expands our knowledge of god 's creation and empowers us to bring potential healing to those who suffer from disease and disability. '' this is what they wrote , and much more , in support of this legislation . 
i urge all of my colleagues to support this bill , thank all of our colleagues on both sides of this issue for their very dignified approach to how we are dealing with this legislation today , but also say that today is a historic day , that the gentleman from delaware ( mr. castle ) xz4000700 and the gentlewoman from colorado ( ms. degette ) xz4001010 have given us the opportunity to move forward , again to answer the prayers of america 's families , to meet their needs , to allow the science to use its biblical power to cure ; and for that i am deeply in their debt . 
there is such enormous promise , mr. speaker , in adult stem cell research , the ethical research that has been under way for decades and has produced to date treatments to nearly 67 diseases including sickle cell , leukemia , osteoporosis , just to name a few . 
even last october , a korean woman who had been paralyzed for 19 years took a few steps for reporters in seoul with the aid of a walker and ethical adult cord blood stem cells injected into her spine . 
i just spoke today to a young man in my congressional district who was injured last saturday night and now faces a lifetime in a wheelchair . 
mr. speaker , i rise today in respectful opposition to this sincerely conceived , but ill-founded , legislation known as castle-degette , a bill that authorizes the use of federal tax dollars to fund the destruction of human embryos for scientific research . 
as we begin this debate , i am confident we will hear the supporters of this bill argue in the name of president ronald reagan , that somehow this research is consistent with his long-held views on the sanctity of life . 
physicians on our side of the aisle will make the case for the ethical alternative of adult stem cell research , and congress today has already voted to greatly expand funding in this area . 
sadly , embryonic stem cell research is completely legal in this country and has been going on at universities and research facilities for years . 
and like 43 percent of the american people in a survey just out today , i have a problem with that . 
despite what is uttered in this debate today , i say again , this debate is not about whether we should allow research . 
there are 20 others like this child here in town today -- the `` snowflakes '' -- babies who developed from embryos given by their biological parents to a couple unable to conceive on their own . 
adult stem cell treatments are helping people walk today , in 67 different diseases and treatments . 
mr. speaker , i rise in favor of adult stem cell research , characterized by the gentleman from new jersey 's ( mr. smith ) xz4003801 bill , and oppose h.r. 810 , the castle legislation , that would propose federal dollars for destroying human embryos for embryonic stem cell research . 
in this one binder there are 67 successful treatments using adult stem cells , and stem cells from cord blood , adult stem cells for treatment of diseases . 
the ordering of genes in our body makes us unique . 
the stuff that sets each person apart is there in this tiny little life that h.r. 810 would destroy . 
early today i met with a man , steve johnson , from reading , pennsylvania , who is in washington for this debate . 
steve was in a bicycle accident 11 years ago and his bike was replaced with a wheelchair , and today steve is a paraplegic . 
i would like to challenge the other side to put up in front of a camera one person treated for spinal cord injury with embryonic stem cells . 
the human being is in all stages of development , or disability , uniquely distinct and infinitely valuable . 
in fact , today she is at home missing her finals because of high blood sugars . 
ashley is north dakota 's delegate for children 's congress through the juvenile diabetes research foundation , taking place here in washington on june 18-22nd . 
ashley 's goal is to enter a health-related field such as a nurse or diabetes educator , because as ashley has said , `` i know the pain that children diagnosed with diabetes go through , and i think i could help in relieving that pain. '' there is currently no cure for juvenile diabetes , a disease that affects another child every hour of every day . 
particularly in the case of diabetes , embryonic stem cell research holds the greatest possibility for understanding and curing this disease , since adult stem cells are not present in the pancreas , the organ attacked by diabetes . 
the bill requires that research only be conducted on stem cells derived from embryos created for fertility treatments that were in excess of the need of the mother and would otherwise have been destroyed . 
my vote today is supported by over 200 major patient groups , scientists , and medical research groups , and i believe that my vote can provide hope to families in north dakota like ashley 's who are suffering through the illness of a loved one . 
mr. speaker , critics of embryonic stem cell research maintain that it is wrong to promote science which destroys life in order to save life . 
as the leading prolife legislator in washington , senator orrin hatch put it , since when does human life begin in a petri dish in a refrigerator ? 
i met with researchers from four of the main stem cell institutes in america . 
it is too late for my cousin who died a tragic , cruel death from juvenile diabetes while still in his 20s ; but it is not too late for the 100 million other american people counting on us to support funding for life-saving research on embryonic stem cells . 
mr. speaker , critics of embryonic stem cell research maintain it is wrong to `` promote science which destroys life in order to save life. '' as the leading pro-life legislator in washington , sen . 
orrin hatch put it , `` since when does human life begin in a petri dish in a refrigerator ? 
instead , these surplus embryos are being thrown into the garbage and treated as medical waste. '' only 22 of the 78 stem cell lines approved by the president in 2001 remain today . 
it 's too late for my cousin who died a cruel , tragic death from diabetes in his 20 's . 
but it 's not too late for 100 million other american people counting on us to support funding for life-saving research on stem cells derived from donated surplus embryos created through in vitro fertilization . 
mr. speaker , as a proud cosponsor of h.r. 810 , the stem cell research enhancement act of 2005 , i rise in support of this legislation . 
furthermore , we have a moral obligation to do everything we can to help the millions of americans , whose lives we hold in our hands , by allowing federal funding to be used for this promising research . 
the authors of h.r. 810 have gone to great lengths to guarantee that safeguards are in place to ensure the ethical use of embryonic stem cells . 
embryos used for stem cell research under h.r. 810 , will come from donor participation in in vitro fertilization , ivf , so embryos will not be created or cloned for research . 
today we have the opportunity to ensure that the rest of the world does not continue to take the lead in health care advances . 
i urge all of my colleagues to vote in favor of h.r. 810 , not only because u.s. based researchers deserve to be at the forefront of the development of promising new treatments , but also for all of our constituents , friends , and family members who are counting on us to support the effort to find cures for so many different diseases and illnesses . 
mr. speaker , i rise today in strong support of h.r. 810 , the stem cell research enhancement act of 2005 . 
embryonic stem cells can become any cell type in the body , and their promise lies in the ability to tailor-make cellular treatments , heart muscle for heart disease , pancreas cells for diabetes , or nervous system cells for spinal cord injury . 
stem cells are relatively new on the research scene ; it was only in 1998 that the techniques were developed to isolate stem cells from humans , and we have a lot to learn about how to make the cells develop in the ways that will be essential for therapeutic application . 
today , i would like to highlight how the reeve-irvine research center has made significant head way in making the promise of embryonic stem cells a reality . 
moreover , as report in journal of neuroscience , his group has been successful in transplanting these cells into an acute spinal cord injury . 
once transplanted , these cells have been able to survive in a living organism , move to areas where they are needed , and do what they are supposed to . 
the result is a significant improvement in walking ability , at least at an early time point post injury . 
his group has learned how to maintain the embryonic stem cells , no small feat in itself . 
they have learned how to transform the cells into differentiated cells , they have learned how to use the cells to treat new spinal cord injury in animals . 
all this in less than 4 years , and in one lab . 
the reeve-irvine research center is one of a handful of places in the u.s. that has the know-how to use embryonic stem cells . 
in addition , more researchers would be able to devote their talents to this area of research . 
mr. speaker , i stand today in strong support of the bipartisan stem cell research enhancement act of 2005 . 
during her testimony last week in a hearing in chicago , clara said , `` there are things i do n't like about diabetes . 
for example , there are no adult stem cells in the pancreas . 
that means that adult stem cell research will be inadequate in helping clara or any other patients who are patients hoping for a cure for diabetes . 
we do a grave disservice to millions of children and adults living with serious illness , as well as the millions who will develop these conditions in the future , by prohibiting promising research . 
as steven teitelbaum of washington university in st . 
i also thank them for giving me the opportunity to cast one of the most important votes i will ever make in congress . 
embryonic stem cell research has the potential to cure disease and save lives in ways never dreamed of . 
these are discarded embryos that were never in the womb . 
sometimes ideology can box you in and cause you to make wrong and harmful decisions . 
the world is in fact round . 
i want history to look back at this congress and say that in the face of the age-old tension between religion and science , the members here allowed critical scientific research to advance while respecting important ethical questions that surrounded it . 
mr. speaker , i rise in strong support of the castle-degette amendment . 
he is in the bloom of health . 
after causing john 's brother to overproduce stem cells , doctors at strong memorial hospital in rochester , removed the excess stem cells and put them in john . 
without advancements over the years in stem cell research , john would not have had the option for a stem cell transplant . 
the u.s. has the finest research scientists in the world , but we are falling far behind other countries , like south korea and singapore , that are moving forward with embryonic stem cell research . 
but this must complement , not substitute , scientific research on embryonic stem cells -- which is much more promising and will yield to advancements in the prevention and treatment of almost every disease american families face . 
but how can we do this , if we are not actively involved in the research ? 
one of the best kept secrets in america today is that umbilical cord-blood stem cells and adult stem cells are curing people of a myriad of terrible conditions and diseases . 
the new program created in our legislation is named for our distinguished colleague , the gentleman from florida ( mr. young ) xz4004391 , because of all of his great work on bone marrow transplantation over the last 2 decades . 
some of those patients came and told their stories yesterday at a press conference , and they are in the gallery watching this debate right now . 
mr. speaker , i say to my colleagues , cord-blood has also been used to treat hurler 's disease and krabbe 's disease , both neurological conditions , which blows away the idea that cord-blood stem cells are limited in the potential and the capacity to turn into other kinds of cells . 
according to a july 2004 study published in the journal of experimental medicine , a research group led by dr . 
kogler found `` a new human somatic stem cell from placental cord-blood with intrinsic pluripotent differential potential , '' which means it can become any type of cell in the body . 
in addition , they found that the cells could expand to 10 quadrillion , or 10 to the power of 15 , cells before losing any pluripotent abilities . 
and cord-blood stem cells are not only ahead in treating real human patients , they are also able to turn into different kinds of cells for research . 
during the entire period where research has been happening in this area of regenerative medicine , the idea that cells can change types and repair organs , both adult and embryo cells have been around in animals . 
and , again , great progress has been made in the cord-blood and the adult stem cell . 
and i pointed out in my opening comments that in the celgene cellular therapeutics first reported back in 2001 that placental stem cells turned into nerve , blood , cartilage , skin and muscle cells , and that since that time other studies have confirmed cord blood 's pluripotent capability . 
that is why those of us who oppose h.r. 810 strongly support pouring millions of dollars into federal funds to support ethical stem cell research to find cures , to alleviate suffering , to inspire well-founded hope and to do it all in a way that respects the dignity and sanctity of human life . 
the castle bill embraces the misinformed notion that there is such a thing as left-over embryos , a grossly misleading and dehumanizing term in and of itself , that they are just going to be destroyed and thrown away and poured down the drain . 
the cryogenically frozen male and female embryos that the genetic parents may feel are no longer needed for implanting in the genetic mother are of infinite value to an adoptive mother who may be sterile or otherwise unable to have a baby . 
mr. speaker , just one adoption initiative , the snowflakes embryo adoption program , has facilitated the adoption of 96 formerly frozen embryos with more adoptions in the works . 
they are not leftovers , even though they lived in a frozen orphanage , perhaps many of them for years . 
the mother , father and i trained together at the medical school in arkansas . 
this family has hope , realistic hope that sometime in the many years of life ahead of them , medical research may give them the possibility of cure or dramatic improvement in her diabetes and his spinal cord injury . 
my patients and i relied on past research done by many good scientists striving in an ethical manner to end the harsh realities of so many diseases . 
i know some of my friends in opposition to this bill today argue that embryonic stem cell research is junk science . 
mr. speaker , i would like to share a letter from a young girl in my district : `` dear house of representatives : `` my name is kelsea king . 
there are many challenges in having this disease , both physical and emotional . 
it is also very difficult knowing what this disease makes us prone to , such as heart disease , liver problems , blindness and in extreme cases loss of limb . 
advocates of federal funding for destructive embryonic stem cell research do three things consistently : ( 1 ) obfuscate the fact that a living human embryo is killed in the process of extracting the cells . 
as chairman of the government reform subcommittee on criminal justice , drug policy and human resources , i sent a letter to the director of the national institutes of health in october , 2002 requesting a detailed report providing comprehensive information about the medical applications of adult and embryonic stem cells . 
it took almost two years to get a response from the nih , and the response omitted many of the advances , applications and trials for adult stem cell research that had already been reported in peer reviewed journals . 
the one thing that was complete in the nih response to our oversight request , was the listing of applications for embryonic stem cells : zero . 
the applications for embryonic stem cell research was zero then , in june of 2004 , and it 's zero now . 
if private industry sees promise in embryonic stem cell research , you can be certain that investors will find it . 
as she wrote in a letter to me , `` i believe it is very wrong to take innocent lives for any reason , even if it benefits me. '' i am submitting miss king 's letter in its entirety for the record . 
avila , in , may 23 , 2005 . 
there are many challenges in having this disease , both physical and emotional . 
it is also very difficult knowing what this disease makes us prone to , such as heart disease , liver problems , blindness , and in extreme cases , loss of limb . 
my sister and i need this , as well as the millions of other children in america who are afflicted with this disease . 
mr. speaker , i rise in strong support of h.r. 810 . 
if you believe it is morally superior to discard a single cell in a freezer rather than to use it to help millions of americans with parkinson 's , alzheimer 's , and diabetes , and you are asked to donate an embryo , then by all means refuse to do so . 
do not tell my constituent don reed and his son roman , who is paralyzed from a high school football accident , that scientists working on stem cell research in california will not be able to collaborate with the nih . 
many in government already think they have the right to tell you whom you can marry , what kind of birth control you can use and how you die . 
beyond my outrage at this arrogance , i am saddened by this country 's precipitous decline in the estimation of the rest of the world . 
mr. speaker , i rise in opposition to h.r. 810 , which i believe promotes human embryonic stem cell research at taxpayers ' expense . 
i remind my colleagues that despite all this money , embryonic stem cell research has not resulted in any documented success whatsoever as compared to the astounding success of adult stem cells . 
nearly 4 years ago , in august 2001 , president bush announced his executive order limiting federal funding to studies on existing cell lines . 
just last week , it was reported that scientists in south korea created scores of cloned human embryos that they then destroyed to produce 11 stem cell lines . 
also recently in the news is the creation of man-animal hybrids , or chimeras , using animal sperm and human eggs , or human sperm and animal eggs . 
the intramural program of the national institute of dental and craniofacial research , idcr , of the national institutes of health , nih , has been a leader in this exciting line of research . 
on april 21 , 2003 , nih scientists reported that for the first time , `` baby '' teeth , the temporary teeth children begin losing around their sixth birthday , contain a rich supply of stem cells in their dental pulp . 
according to the scientists , who published their findings online today in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences , the stem cells are unique compared to many `` adult '' stem cells in the body . 
they are long lived , grow rapidly in culture , and , with careful prompting in the laboratory , have the potential to induce the formation of specialized in addition to the studies of stem cells from dental pulps of deciduous , `` baby '' teeth , there are ongoing studies of stem cells from the periodontium , the region where teeth connect to bone . 
the enthusiasm is based on followup studies , in which the researchers implanted the human adult stem cells into rodents and found most of them had differentiated into a mixture of periodontal ligament -- including the specific fiber bundles that attach tooth to bone -- and the mineralized tissue called cementum that covers the roots of our teeth . 
those of us who believe in the sanctity of life from conception to our last breath , find the logic of the proponents of embryonic stem cell research flawed . 
what about leading the world in ethics and morals by declaring human life off limits to research and to manipulation through stem cell research ? 
what about leading the world in ethics and morals by declaring human life from embryonic stage to old age as valued ? 
you and i , each of us , we all share one thing in common : we were all embryos at one time . 
whether an embryo , a human life , is or is not allowed to grow , to become a unique individual , is a discussion this country really should have , a meaningful discussion , not just a few hours of debate in this chamber . 
this is an ethical discussion i hoped would take place in the halls of congress , in the congressional committee rooms , in homes and workplaces all across america . 
whether it is at the watercooler or in the cloakroom , these ethical and moral issues should and must be discussed as a nation , as a people , as a culture , and as a world leader . 
the other body has just gone through public , political , and senatorial debate on the use of a filibuster in our democracy . 
because of this debate , a healthy discussion occurred in america . 
yesterday in a news show , the commentator asked me why not allow stem cell research on discarded medical waste . 
we will hear today about other research with adult stem cells , cord and placenta cells , bone marrow , fetal tissue , and unraveling our dna through mapping of genome , all in the pursuit of finding medical cures for the dreaded diseases , illnesses , and injuries we all wish to cure . 
this question has not been adequately addressed in this legislation . 
or do we allow the blastocysts to survive in a laboratory culture for up to 14 days and still not call them human life but blastocysts so they are still open to research and experimentation ? 
proponents of h.r. 810 will claim that their legislation will address the ethical manner in which this research will be conducted . 
human embryonic stem cell research is completely legal today in the private sector . 
embryonic stem cell research is eligible for state funding in several states , california and new jersey , and is funded through millions of dollars in private research money , $ 100 million alone at harvard university . 
the national institute of health spent $ 24 million on embryonic stem cell research in fiscal year 2004 , the last year that data was available . 
instead of cures , embryonic stem cell research has led to tumors and deaths in animal studies . 
there have been zero published treatments in human patients using embryonic stem cells . 
recognizing this , the national institutes of health spent $ 568 million in fiscal year 2006 on adult stem cell research . 
adult stem cells are being used today in clinical trials and in clinical practice to treat 58 diseases , including parkinson 's , spinal cord injury , juvenile diabetes , brain cancer , breast cancer , lymphoma , heart damage , rheumatoid arthritis , juvenile arthritis , stroke , and sickle cell anemia . 
are embryonic stem cells more effective in treating injuries and illnesses than the adult tissue stem cells ? 
but i think in this whole issue here , we sort of lose questions . 
in fact , i believe those ethical issues should really be the first question we should ask before we debate the means of obtaining , or even the effectiveness of the proposed treatment . 
professor alan mackay-sim of griffith university in australia published a study showing that olfactory stem cells could develop into heart cells , liver cells , kidney cells , muscle cells , brain cells and nerve cells . 
`` this discovery represents a major breakthrough in stem-cell therapy , '' said dr . 
`` based on our findings we believe these newly discovered stem-cells may have the capacity to generate into most tissue types in the human body . 
this is a very unique property that until this time has only been found in embryonic stem cells. '' 3 . 
in july 2004 , research conducted in germany , led by dr . 
in june 2004 , researchers showed that human bone marrow stem cells have pluripotent potential . 
researchers found bone marrow stem cells in females that received transplants from male donors . 
researchers found the y chromosome in the brain , showing that bone marrow stem cells generated neurons . 
( mezey e et al. ; `` transplanted bone marrow generates new neurons in human brains '' ; proceedings of the national academy of sciences usa 100 , 1364-1369 ; 4 feb 2003 ) 7 . 
in 2002 , catherine verfaille has turned these bone marrow stem cells into skin , brain , lungs , heart , retina , muscle , intestines , kidney and spleen . 
in fact , we just heard again that in fact we throw these cells away when we are done . 
i must ask again , is that what we have come to as a nation that in viewing embryos , that if allowed to grow and divide could become human beings but we will just treat them as human waste ? 
we heard today about other research with adult stem cells , cord , placenta , bone marrow , fetal tissue , and how about unraveling our dna through the mapping of the genome , all in the pursuit of finding medical cures . 
this question has not been adequately addressed in this legislation . 
or do we allow the blastocysts to survive in the laboratory culture for up to 14 days and still then not call them human life , but blastocysts so they are open to experiment and research ? 
life is precious in all forms , and it is important to do all that we can to ensure issues surrounding life and quality of life are given the highest priority . 
stem cells derived from embryos have shown tremendous promise in the fight to rid society of many of these diseases . 
in 2003 alone there were 1 , 681 , 339 deaths from diseases that could benefit from this research . 
many couples across america struggling to have children benefit from in vitro fertilization , a process where embryos are created to provide couples with the potential to have children . 
in many cases , couples have left over embryos that would be destroyed . 
congressional oversight on this ethically sensitive issue is the right balance to ensure that our nation remains diligent in our approach to medical research , while taking important steps to improve the quality of life for those who suffer from debilitating diseases . 
embryonic stem cell research is a new form of research in the early stages . 
in fact , more than 58 diseases have been treated using adult stem cells in contrast to no diseases having been treated by using living embryonic stem cell research . 
well , embryonic stem cell research is being conducted in america with private funding , but that funding is lacking . 
apparently , venture capitalists invest only in projects that are profitable , and you can see it is far from profitable here : 58 to zero . 
mr. speaker , embryonic stem cells have the ability to develop into virtually any cell in the body , and many believe they may have the potential to treat many illnesses such as parkinson 's disease , juvenile diabetes , alzheimer 's , blindness , sickle cell anemia and many other medical conditions , including spinal cord injuries . 
the remarks made on the floor today by my colleagues have reflected the difficulty in dealing with this issue , as many members wrestle with their beliefs and emotions . 
most familiar with this issue know that in august 2001 , president bush announced that federal funds for the first time would be used to support research on human embryonic stem cells . 
however , the funding would be limited to `` existing stem cell lines. '' the national institutes of health ( nih ) has established the human embryonic stem cell registry , which lists stem cell lines that are eligible for use in federally funded research . 
this important legislation increases the number of lines of stem cells that would be eligible to be used in federally funded research . 
specifically , the stem cells must be derived from human embryos donated from in vitro fertilization clinics . 
they also must have been created for the purpose of fertility treatment , but were in excess of the clinical need . 
the embryos must also not have been intended for use in fertility treatment , and would otherwise be discarded . 
my uncle , morris k. udall , who served in this body for decades , suffered from parkinson 's disease . 
we need to foster additional research that is conducted in an ethically responsible way . 
mr. speaker , i rise in support of this bipartisan bill , and i will submit today 's column in the wall street journal written by dr . 
david a. shaywitz , an endocrinologist in stem cell research at harvard , for the record . 
he says : `` presently , only the few lines established prior to the date , '' this is in reference to the president 's initial plan back in 2001 , `` are eligible for government support , a prohibition that has had a crippling effect on researchers in this emerging field. '' it further says , it relates to the cord bill , in essence : `` it seems extremely unlikely that adult blood cells or blood cells from the umbilical cord will be therapeutically useful as a source of anything else but blood. '' mr. speaker , there are few families that i know that have not been impacted by a myriad of these diseases . 
how sad , then , that in the ongoing debate over stem cell research , many conservatives have chosen to abandon their well-founded skepticism and to embrace dubious but convenient data for the sake of advancing their cause . 
presently , only the few lines established prior to this date are eligible for government support , a prohibition that has had a crippling effect on research in this emerging field . 
if this process of specialization could be achieved in the lab , scientists might be able to create replacement pancreas cells for diabetics , or neurons for patient with parkinson 's disease ; these treatments are likely many years away . 
the trouble for such dogmatic critics of embryonic stem cell research is that most americans hold a less extreme position ; given a choice between discarding frozen , excess embryos from in vitro fertilization clinics or allowing the cells to be used for medical research -- specifically , the generation of new embryonic stem cell lines -- most of us would choose the second . 
consequently , conservative stem cell opponents have now begun to argue in earnest that embryonic stem cell research is not just morally wrong , but also unnecessary , an argument that relies on suspect science and appears motivated by even more questionable principles . 
moreover , while stem cells seem to exist for some cell types in the body -- the blood and the intestines , for example -- many adult tissues such as the pancreas , may not have stem cells at all . 
thus , relying on adult stem cells to generate replacement insulin-producing cells for patients with diabetes is probably an exercise in futility . 
in the process , conservatives seem to have left their usual concern for junk science at the laboratory door , citing in their defense preliminary studies and questionable data that they would surely -- and appropriately -- have ridiculed were it not supporting their current point of view . 
in fact , there is little credible evidence to suggest adult stem cells have the same therapeutic potential as embryonic stem cells . 
human embryonic stem cell research represents one of the most important scientific frontiers , and also one of the most controversial : our national debate on it deserves to be informed by our loftiest ethical aspirations -- but also grounded in our most rigorous scientific standards . 
the most compelling arguments for expanding federal funding for stem cell research can be heard in the heart wrenching stories of individuals suffering from debilitating diseases for which there are currently no cures or treatments . 
the united states is poised to assume a role of leading the world in this promising field . 
what we are going to be voting for here will help create a banking system so that if a patient comes in to see me with a particular illness that is amenable to treatment with stem cells , i can enter their genetic information in a computer , find a match of cord blood that would be kept in a freezer , and actually treat the patient . 
you get these young people , kids , coming in your office with these horrible , painful crises where their bones are aching and you end up having to give them narcotics and transfuse them . 
i was reading the may 19 issue of the new england journal of medicine and , lo and behold , another research article , this one on transplantation of umbilical cord blood in babies with infantile krabbe 's disease , a rare disease , a terrible disease , the babies die ; and this cord blood study shows if you catch it early , you can actually cure these kids . 
i know there have been a number of members coming to the floor talking about the embryonic bill that we are going to take up later ; the embryonic stem cells have never been shown to be successfully useful in a human model . 
krabbe 's disease i mentioned earlier , that was just in the new england journal this month . 
embryonic stem cells have not been successfully used to treat diabetes either , but actually in animal models adult stem cells have been used successfully to treat diabetes . 
i think most of the hope and success is in this cord blood . 
the plasticity that some of you extol in these embryonic stem cells make them genetically unstable . 
we call them teratomas in the medical profession . 
indeed , the gentlewoman from colorado said in her opening statement , there is no , no scientific evidence that will show that cord blood or adult stem cells will cure alzheimer 's , parkinson 's or type 1 diabetes . 
parkinson 's disease was successfully treated 6 years ago in dennis turner using an adult stem cell . 
he had an 80 percent reduction in his symptoms . 
this was described at the american association of neurological surgeons annual meeting in april of 2002 . 
in 2003 , science-published harvard researchers announced they had achieved a permanent reversal of diabetes in mice . 
and this lady was in a wheelchair and she can now stand up with adult stem cells . 
and one of the questions i have for my colleagues who have been an advocate for the castle/degette bill is , how , if these embryonic cells were ever proven to be useful , and that has yet to be demonstrated in the literature , how would you override the tissue rejection concerns ? 
they say there are 400 , 000 embryos in the freezers , but the truth is the vast majority of those embryos are wanted , and their own studies suggest only 275 cell lines will be available if this bill becomes law . 
and what i have been saying over and over again , if you actually read the medical journals , the promise and the potential appear to be in the ethically acceptable alternatives of adult stem research and cord blood research . 
i have diabetes in my family . 
but i can say , mr. speaker , that in the end it comes down to not eliminating any type of research , because that is allowable in this country ; it is whether or not we should use federal funds . 
in the end , mr. speaker , this is a very personal decision . 
i consulted with all four of my friends who are medical doctors in this chamber . 
embryonic stem cell research is legal in america today , and nothing in the administration 's current policy has affected the legality of this research . 
but this rule does not in any way limit the private sector from pursuing embryonic stem cell research . 
mr. speaker , i rise today in support of this bill and all of the promise that comes with funding embryonic stem cell research . 
this bill represents an important step forward for the scientific and medical communities in our country , offering hope to the millions of americans who suffer from diseases that stem cell therapies may be able to cure . 
the potential benefits from embryonic stem cell research are almost boundless and would certainly touch the life of a friend or family member of everyone in america . 
mr. bush 's ban on providing federal funds for stem cell research has seriously damaged our nation 's efforts to be a leading voice in the development of this new technology . 
i urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill that will certainly have long-lasting effects in improving the health and well being of millions of americans . 
mr. speaker , i rise in strong support of this stem cell research bill . 
diabetes , alzheimer 's , lou gehrig 's disease , these diseases will be cured either here in the united states or somewhere else in the world . 
many eggs were fertilized in this process and , once a baby is born , many fertilized eggs are left over , created with the intention to create a baby . 
mr. speaker , i rise in strong support of h.r. 2520 , which combines legislation i introduced and passed in the 108th congress to reauthorize the national bone marrow registry with legislation by my colleague from new jersey , mr. smith xz4003801 to authorize a federal investment in building an inventory of 150 , 000 umbilical cord blood units . 
his commitment to providing sound national policy in this area of stem cell transplantation has produced an excellent legislative design that will benefit thousands of patients immediately upon enactment . 
in a matter of minutes , physicians can review the options and reserve the best possible sources for their patients . 
in addition , the new effort will facilitate accreditation of cord blood banks , stimulate research , and collect and share data on the outcomes of all transplants . 
this bill before us has been shaped by the guidance provided through the iom process and during the past year-and-a-half a consensus has been building for moving forward to combine our activities in bone marrow and cord blood . 
through the efforts of the national marrow donor program -- which this congress initiated in 1987 -- many lives have already been saved . 
mr. speaker , we found that the human spirit responded to our efforts in ways that we could not imagine . 
in addition , the program has an additional 41 , 666 units of umbilical cord blood in reserve for transplant through its network of 15 affiliated cord blood banks throughout the country . 
let me repeat -- we have 5.6 million volunteer bone marrow donors signed up in the national program . 
these are true volunteers in every sense of the word . 
they have given of their time to take a simple blood test to be listed in the national registry . 
another 41 , 000 women have donated umbilical cord blood which can be used in the same way as bone marrow , to transplant life giving cells to cure disease . 
thanks to research , cord blood has now become another very important source for obtaining and transplanting the particular cell found in bone marrow and peripheral blood that can restore health to those suffering from so many different diseases . 
in addition , by building up the cord blood inventory , the overall resource will be much more likely to meet the needs of patients from genetically diverse , ethnic populations . 
mr. speaker , there are many people who have been heroes in this effort and need to be recognized for their contributions . 
the first is a little 10 year old girl who died of leukemia at all children 's hospital in my home district of st . 
brandy bly might have been saved from leukemia back in 1987 if matched bone marrow or cord blood cells had been available . 
donnell thomas -- all who helped perfect the science of marrow transplantation and who assisted us in our legislative quest to establish there have been many members of congress , past and present , who have stood together with me over the years to develop and fund the program that we reauthorize and enhance today . 
every patient who has sought a marrow or cord blood transplant has helped in the overall effort to gain more scientific knowledge on perfecting the transplant process . 
and every donor who has rolled up his or her sleeve to sign up for the national bone marrow program , or every family that has decided to donate umbilical cord blood , are heroes for taking part in giving the ultimate gift of life . 
mr. speaker , in closing let me again thank chairman barton and mr. smith for their leadership in enhancing this great national program . 
mr. speaker , i rise today in opposition to h.r. 810 , but in strong support of adult stem cell research as it respects life . 
it is merely at an earlier stage in life . 
just as we find it unconscionable and unethical to exploit human life in the name of science during the latter stages of life , neither should we accept the exploitation of human life at its earliest stages . 
i rise in support of h.r. 2520 , which i really view as a noncontroversial , bipartisan piece of legislation that we should all be able to agree on . 
here we have a piece of legislation dealing with an emerging area of science , but one that has already proven itself to be effective in human application and one that also shows itself to be easily obtained , that is , we either throw away umbilical cords , throw away the umbilical cord and the placenta at the time of birth , or we save the blood that can be captured at that time to make it available such that the stem cells can be taken from that and utilized in this therapeutic fashion . 
we can do it in several ways . 
we can obtain this in very easy ways , voluntarily , asking mothers at the time their children are born to donate these units such that others might be helped . 
we have been laggard in our approach to this particular area of science . 
mr. speaker , just in response to what was said on the floor , this is a statement that has appeared on the floor , and also in print , which says that the bill before us prohibits federal funding used for the destruction of embryos . 
there is a moral dimension in most of the serious issues that we must face . 
would i like to see embryonic stem cell research in the area of cancer where it might have helped one of my sisters who has had cancer ? 
would i like to see it in terms of research of cancer that plagues 4-year-old children like my nephew ? 
we look back in history and , yes , america has oftentimes promoted science . 
but america has made mistakes in the past . 
the worst mistakes we have ever made in the history of this nation have been when we have defined a part of the human family as less than fully human and then done things to them that we would not allow done to ourselves . 
the commonality among all of those mistakes , the greatest mistakes in our nation 's history , has been the ease with which we defined members of the human family as less than fully human . 
we should resolve doubt in favor of life as we do in our criminal justice system , as we do in our civil law system . 
recent advancements in medical technology have created hope for the millions of people , and their families , who suffer from the effects of diseases like alzheimer 's , parkinson 's , and diabetes . 
as a physician i have seen government inject itself in places it ought not go and spend countless dollars on fanciful and distorted claims . 
as a new member of congress , i am proud to stand before you and lend my support to a positive and productive piece of legislation that will bring sunlight to those who have experienced too many clouds , and it will do so in an unquestionable and ethical manner . 
mr. speaker , as a physician , i know that respected scientists believe that misrepresentations and exaggerated claims in this debate are not only scientifically irresponsible , they are deceptive and cruel to millions of patients and their families who hope desperately for cures . 
many in our society have sincere , heartfelt , passionate , ethical questions , worthy of our respect , regarding the scientific or medical use of embryonic stem cells . 
i urge my colleagues to join me in respecting science , in respecting ethical concerns . 
if we do , we will recognize that stem cell research and treatment of disease should actively proceed with those adult and cord stem cells that are providing and will increasingly provide excellent and exciting cures for patients in need . 
decisions in science should be based on the scientific method -- a standardized method of evaluation and implementation of a solution or treatment of a disease . 
if followed , it results in the best outcome . 
this would be true in public policy as well . 
if not followed in a legislative body , then decisions tend to be made based upon who has the largest group of supporters or greatest passion and emotion . 
now there is nothing wrong with numbers , passion or emotion , it just may not get you to the correct solution -- especially in the scientific arena . 
there has been significant misrepresentation of science today and in this debate , because `` science is not a policy or a political program . 
made regarding the purported medical applications of embryonic stem cells reach far beyond any credible evidence , ignoring the limited state of our knowledge about embryonic stem cells and the advances in other areas of research that may render use of these cells unnecessary for many applications . 
it is , in fact , a subordination of science to ideology . 
it seems to me that there is one unmistakable fact : many in our society have sincere , heartfelt , passionate , ethical questions , worthy of our respect , regarding the scientific or medical use of es cells . 
i urge my colleagues to join me in respecting current science -- in respecting ethical concerns . 
if we do , we will recognize that stem cell research and treatment of disease should actively proceed with those adult and cord stem cells that are providing and will increasingly provide excellent and exciting cures for patients in need . 
as professionals trained in the life sciences we are alarmed at these statements . 
in itself , science is not a policy or a political program . 
if such scientists allow their individual faith in the future of embryonic stem cell research to be interpreted as a reliable prediction of the outcome of this research , they are acting irresponsibly . 
second , it is no mere `` ideology '' to be concerned about the possible misuse of humans in scientific research . 
third , the statements you have made regarding the purported medical applications of embryonic stem cells reach far beyond any credible evidence , ignoring the limited state of our knowledge about embryonic stem cells and the advances in other areas of research that may render use of these cells unnecessary for many applications . 
they proliferate rapidly and are extremely versatile , ultimately capable ( in an embryonic environment ) of forming any kind of cell found in the developed human body . 
yet there is scant scientific evidence that embryonic stem cells will form normal tissues in a culture dish , and the very versatility of these cells is now known to be a disadvantage as well -- embryonic stem cells are difficult to develop into a stable cell line , spontaneously accumulate genetic abnormalities in culture , and are prone to uncontrollable growth and tumor formation when placed in almost 25 years of research using mouse embryonic stem cells have produced limited indications of clinical benefit in some animals , as well as indications of serious and potentially lethal side-effects . 
based on this evidence , claims of a safe and reliable treatment for any disease in humans are premature at best . 
some animal trials in research cloning have required placing cloned embryos in a womb and developing them to the fetal stage , then destroying them for their more developed tissues , to provide clinical benefit -- surely an approach that poses horrific ethical issues if applied to humans . 
bone marrow transplants were benefiting patients with various forms of cancer for many years before it was understood that the active ingredients in these transplants are stem cells . 
non-embryonic stem cells have been discovered in many unexpected tissues -- in blood , nerve , fat , skin , muscle , umbilical cord blood , placenta , even dental pulp -- and dozens of studies indicate that they are far more versatile than once thought . 
use of these cells poses no serious ethical problem , and may avoid all problems of tissue rejection if stem cells can be obtained from a patient for use in that same patient . 
clinical use of non-embryonic stem cells has grown greatly in recent in the case of many conditions , advances are likely to come from sources other than any kind of stem cell . 
similarly , autoimmune diseases like juvenile in short , embryonic stem cells pose one especially controversial avenue toward understanding and ( perhaps ) someday treating various degenerative diseases . 
therefore , to turn this one approach into a political campaign -- even more , to declare that it will be a `` top priority '' or receive any particular amount of federal funding , regardless of future evidence or the usual scientific peer review process -- is , in our view , irresponsible . 
it is , in fact , a subordination of science to ideology .

i have held damaged hearts in these hands , and i have seen how powerful human emotions , coupled with hope , can be ; but human emotions coupled with false hope and misinformation are dangerous . 
adult stem cells have been used to treat 58 human diseases , and they do so without taking away what we are trying to preserve in the first place : life . 
for example , heart disease , the number one cause of death in the united states , coronary artery disease , has been successfully treated with adult stem cell therapies ; and there have been 10 clinical trials that have been completed in human patients using bone marrow-derived adult stem cells to treat heart attack patients , damaged hearts . 
and in one trial , patients who were bedridden , not able to walk , were found to be jogging on the beach or climbing eight flights of stairs after successful treatment . 
mr. speaker , i have been a physician for 41 years ; and like my good colleagues who will not be supporting this bill , i would expect we could tell the members stories of all the blood and gore and problems that we have waded through in those years and done our very best . 
for those who have an ethical problem with the bill , i accept the fact that they have that problem and hope that at some point in the future we can sit down and discuss this issue . 
stem cell research , especially embryonic stem cell research , is going to go on apace very rapidly in all parts of the world , whether it is singapore or korea or japan or china or the united kingdom or canada , other places on continental europe . 
we are being left behind in this . 
we have the finest universities in the world , the finest researchers , the ability to bring stem cell research to a point where we will , indeed , have cures for everyday problems such as diabetes , such as parkinson 's , such as alzheimer 's , and perhaps even being able to create neuronal cells to take care of people who have spinal cord injuries . 
that is one of the reasons i have joined this unparalleled and growing bipartisan coalition to cosponsor h.r. 810 , along with over 200 democrats and republicans in this house . 
people from the show me state were polled not too long ago , and three-fourths of them were in support of this research continuing . 
just like polls around the country , when nancy reagan called to lift the bush administration ban on this research in 2004 , three-fourths of americans have come to the support of this cause . 
there is great promise in this research . 
since its isolation of the embryonic stem cell in 1998 , research has made dramatic progress in the u.s. we can not and we must not abandon our leadership role in the scientific community and in establishing strong ethical standards for this research , which are incorporated in this bill . 
i also became involved in this debate because of the extraordinary citizens that have come to advocate on its behalf , advocates like bernie frank , an accomplished st . 
we stand here with the tools in our hands to ease the pain and suffering of so many across the country and around the world . 
mr. speaker , in missouri 's 5th district there are two individuals , jim and virginia stowers , who did not seek a federal grant , but who used $ 2 billion of their own money to begin some very vital research . 
two boys , twin boys were in bed . 
one fell out of the bed in the middle of the morning , and when the parents went in to see him and asked what happened , he said , as he looked up to the bed , i think i was sleeping too close to where i got in . 
even after the president has spoken , we are , as a nation , still sleeping too close to where we got in with regard to research on stem cells . 
but i told her , i am in favor of stem cell research , research that uses stem cells from cord blood and adult stem cell sources , research that is already showing great medical promise and avoids the ethically divisive issue of the destruction of an unborn human embryo , an unborn human person . 
and she told me that if research found a cure using unborn human embryos , that she would not take that cure , that she could not in her conscience take that cure that sacrificed a human life . 
mr. speaker , let us set a new standard , one that aggressively promotes good research to help the sick and injured , one that respects the consciences of tens of millions of americans who do not wish to see their tax dollars used in the destruction of unborn human life , one that supports a consistent life ethic and gives true hope to those who are suffering in our communities . 
mr. speaker , i rise in strong support of h.r. 810 , to provide for human embryonic stem cell research . 
by broadening the federal government 's investment in this nascent technology , i am confident that we will be able to offer help to these men , women , and children that would be impossible by conventional means . 
the room for growth in embryonic stem cell research is exponential . 
according to the national institutes of health , this work may one day be used in gene therapy and to overcome immune rejection . 
my region in western new york has a number of great research institutes that boast a rich history of tackling devastating health afflictions . 
for example , roswell park cancer institute ( rpci ) , located in buffalo , implemented the nation 's first chemotherapy program . 
rpci 's center for pharmacology and therapeutics is one of few in the nation capable of all phases of drug development , from the conceptual stage through manufacturing and testing . 
the institute has sponsored or collaborated on more than 350 clinical trials of promising new cancer treatments and its developing cancer genetics program will rival the world 's leading programs in that field . 
the institute has also made significant contributions to the landmark human genome project , and its new center for genetics and pharmacology will adjoin the university at buffalo 's center of excellence in bioinformatics and life sciences and the new 72 , 000 sq . 
the three centers form a state-of-the-art life science cluster in downtown buffalo that will transform lives in my district and across the world through the cutting edge stem cell and genomic research . 
our innovative institutes , led by some of the best researchers in the world , can make an immeasurable difference in people 's lives . 
like the rest of my colleagues joining me today , i am strongly in support of scientific research to save and improve human life . 
while stem cell research has never been prohibited in the private sector , president bush permitted the usage of embryonic stem cell lines sufficient for extensive government-funded research nearly 4 years ago . 
in these 4 years , government and private research on those stem cells have produced nothing , cured no one ; and there is no indication that that will change . 
in the meantime , ethical research not derived from embryos in the public and private sectors has helped cure almost 60 diseases . 
the private sector has proven the superiority and promise of cord blood in adult stem cell research by choosing to fund those areas . 
this bill , therefore , implies that stem cell research is not already going on , but stem cell research is alive and well in america . 
the embryonic stem cell research in this bill destroys human life , and i believe that we as the american people should not destroy human life with american taxpayers ' dollars , not even in the name of research . 
mr. speaker , i rise in support of h.r. 810 . 
this discussion , while interesting , misses the point of promoting stem cell research in general : scientific breakthroughs that may originate from stem cell examination have the power to better , and even save the lives of our fellow citizens afflicted with terrible diseases . 
stem cell research holds out hope for those suffering with , for example , diabetes , parkinson 's , and coronary heart disease , the number one killer of adults in this country . 
we must encourage this research , and the legislation offered by my colleagues from new jersey and delaware is an important step forward in our attempts to find cures for these diseases . 
moreover , the stem cell research enhancement act promotes the establishment of ethical standards with regard to the procurement of embryos utilized in the research . 
the only embryos that can be utilized are ones that were originally created for fertility treatment purposes and are in excess of clinical need . 
further , the individuals seeking fertility treatments for whom those embryos were created have determined that these embryos will not be implanted in a woman and will be otherwise discarded . 
this bill directs that the national institutes of health develop guidelines to insure that researchers adhere to the highest possible principles in scientific inquiry . 
we , everyone of us in this body , want that . 
dear friends , when you use the product of the callous mistreatment of life , even though you use sterilized gloves , you nonetheless are an accomplice after the fact in encouraging future such destruction and mistreatment -- even though you have the very very best of intentions . 
i thought i was just helping. '' in the recent past , we lost a great american who had been injured in an accident and who encouraged the use of embryonic stem cells . 
his strength and courage and perseverance in the face of unsurmountable odds should be an encouragement for all who face adversity . 
if a child is in a deep hole , america sends all the resources it has to try to save it regardless of cost . 
it is extremely offensive that some would come forward and say basically that in the name of religion , christian and jewish groups support the federal government 's certain destruction of embryos under the possibility that at some point it somehow may lead to possibly saving a life or lives . 
private pharmaceutical and health care industries would be in pursuit knowing that if they find a cure , they will be the most profitable company on the face of the earth . 
it is people wanting grants that will be torn from the pockets of taxpayers against the will of perhaps half of them or more ( polling data from those with an agenda is not all that trustworthy ) and putting it into someone else 's pocket in the name of destroying embryos . 
what many of us are saying about this legislation is , if it is so promising , you go raise the capital privately by buying stock to use in embryonic stem cell research , and let our tax dollars go to the stem cell research that seeks to both save and make lives better . 
i know this is a matter of conscience , and i do so know and believe in the integrity and great intentions of many of those who disagree , but please do not take my tax dollars for money to destroy life . 
let those who feel so compelled , spend your own , but i would hope even then you would spend your own money on the lines with the most promise and not take life in the name of helping life . 
mr. speaker , i rise today in support of h.r. 2520 , as well as the stem cell research enhancement act , as both bills are part of today 's larger debate on stem cell research and the hope being offered with them . 
it is clear that by passing this bill and the stem cell research enhancement act we will not be reading articles in next week 's paper that we found the cure for cancer or any other disease , that we hope to be effected . 
but i feel strongly that the effects of federal dollars and involvement in stem cell research will make an unquestionable difference . 
our country has been a leader in so many areas of medicine . 
both bills are an important step in harnessing the power of optimism . 
mr. speaker , the constitutional amendment to ban the desecration of the american flag has become a ritual here in congress . 
since i started in the house of representatives this issue has come to the floor every congress . 
in my years in congress , no one back home in oregon has ever complained about flag burning . 
the supreme court was right in their rulings to prohibit the shouting of `` fire '' in a crowded theater ; and , equally , the supreme court was wrong to permit flag-burning . 
the burning of the flag is conduct that congress is justified in regulating , and that is what we are doing in this legislation . 
it is not a piece of cloth that rose from the ashes of the fallen twin towers or that was draped from the pentagon in the aftermath of september 11 . 
after that day , the flag suddenly seemed to appear everywhere , overnight , across this land , any size of fabric , even those made by schoolchildren from construction paper , i suppose , flags stuck in flowerpots , pinned on lapels , decals posted on the back windows of our automobiles and trucks . 
it was not just a piece of cloth that appeared in the sky on that day so many years ago , just as it is not a piece of cloth that francis scott key saw over baltimore harbor centuries ago . 
mr. speaker , i rise in strong support of h. j. res. 10 , the flag protection amendment , and i would like to thank the distinguished gentleman from california ( mr. cunningham ) xz4000910 for his efforts to protect our country 's most sacred symbol , the american flag . 
i would also like to thank our distinguished judiciary chairman , the gentleman from wisconsin ( mr. sensenbrenner ) xz4003650 , for his leadership in this area . 
as has been stated , we have had a number of hearings on this in the past . 
if we could do this legislatively , if we could pass a statute as we have done in the past which has been struck down by the supreme court , we would do that . 
many of us believe very strongly in this . 
h. j. res. 10 , which has passed the house in its current form on four separate occasions , would give congress the authority it needs to once again protect the flag . 
mr. speaker , i begin by thanking the gentleman from new york ( mr. nadler ) xz4002890 , my colleague , who is the ranking member on the subcommittee on the constitution and has served us so well across the years in this regard . 
i personally deplore the desecration of the flag in any form , but i still remain strongly opposed to this resolution because this resolution goes against the ideals that the flag represents and elevates a symbol of freedom over freedom itself . 
if adopted , this resolution would represent for the first time in our nation 's history that the people 's representatives in this body voted to alter the bill of rights to limit the freedom of speech . 
it has been said that the true test of any nation 's commitment to freedom of expression lies in its ability to protect unpopular expression , such as flag desecration . 
justice oliver wendell holmes wrote as far back as 1929 , the constitution protects not only freedom for the thought and expression we agree with , but `` freedom for the thought we hate. '' this resolution is in response to two supreme court decisions , texas v. johnson in 1989 and the united states v. eichman in 1990 , two supreme court decisions in one bite . 
in effect , we will be glorifying fringe elements who disrespect the flag and what it stands for while denigrating the constitution itself , the vision of madison and jefferson . 
a constitutional amendment banning flag desecration flies in the very face of this carefully balanced structure . 
the fact that the congress would consider the first-ever amendment to the bill of rights without so much as a hearing in this congress makes this all the more objectionable . 
almost as significant as the damage this resolution would do to our own constitution is the harm it will inflict in our international standing in the area of human rights . 
yet if we pass this action , we will be aligning ourselves with those autocratic regimes , such as in the former soviet union and iran , and diminish our own moral stature as a protector of freedom in all of its forms . 
in may 2005 , just last month , a majority of americans opposed such an amendment by 63 percent to 35 percent because of its first amendment restrictions . 
for those who believe a constitutional amendment will honor the flag , i urge them to actually read the supreme court 's 1989 decision in texas v. johnson . 
we do not consecrate the flag by punishing its desecration , for in doing so we dilute the freedom that this cherished emblem represents. '' i urge my colleagues to maintain the constitutional ideal of freedom and reject this resolution . 
mr. speaker , i stand before you today in strong and wavering support of the flag protection amendment . 
from lexington to gettysburg to falluja , more than a million brave americans have given their lives in defense of our flag and the american ideals it represents . 
we must honor their ultimate sacrifice , and the sacrifices made by the almost 60 , 000 veterans in my home state of wyoming , by defending our flag with the courage and resolve they proved possible . 
czechoslovak christian democracy in the u.s.a . 
national guard association of the u.s. national league of families of american prisoners and missing in se asia . 
sons of the revolution in the state of wisconsin . 
mr. speaker , in the past debates people have brought forth trinkets , ties , gloves , and t-shirts and tried to confuse the issue with the american flag . 
in my district we had a group of hispanics that were protesting over a bill that we passed on this floor years ago and it was on bilingual education , english first . 
they started to burn the american flag in my district . 
it took him 5 years to knit an american flag on the inside of his shirt when he was held prisoner in vietnam . 
he would display this flag at his meetings until the guards broke in one day and brutally beat the prisoner of war , ripped the flag to shreds in the middle of the floor , drug the prisoner out of the cell , beat him unconscious . 
and when they placed him back in the cell , his friends tried to comfort him as much as they could and tend to his wounds , but he was unconscious . 
they went about their meetings , and a few minutes later they heard a stirring in the corner . 
my mother used to tell me stories when she was a young woman in the segregated south that she would drive through parts of rural and western alabama and that she would see crosses burned . 
the burning of those crosses , frankly , did nothing to slow down the march of justice in this country over the 40-or-so years i have been around . 
and here we stand 15 years later in a country that is still deeply patriotic , a country that is still full of love of americans toward each other . 
frankly , i would submit in this last 4 or 5 years we have seen a rising tide of patriotism . 
we feel a greater faith in each other and a greater faith in our fighting forces now than we ever have . 
those of us who believe in this country , those of us who believe in its decency , and those of us who believe in its power , we have won . 
i wish we understood that every time we think about saying that one kind of speech is so obnoxious or so offensive that we ought to get rid of it , every time we even let ourselves think that , we would be so much better off if we trust in our better angels , because the best angels in our nature tell us that flag burners are wrong . 
i thank the gentleman for offering this amendment and for calling us back to an understanding that even this august institution is limited by the united states supreme court , and that even the best values that we pronounce in this chamber are limited by our constitution . 
i rise in strong opposition to the watt substitute and in support of h. j. res. 10 , which would amend the constitution to give congress the authority to prevent the physical desecration of the american flag . 
it may be that the words have never been changed , but the united states supreme court on many , many , many occasions has amended the first amendment and other provisions in the bill of rights by changing the meaning of those words . 
for 200 years , many supreme court justices opined that flag desecration laws which were in effect in 49 states were not in violation of the first amendment of the constitution . 
this is in defiance of the will of the overwhelming majority of the american people , the will of the overwhelming majority of the state legislatures , and as we will see later today , the will of the overwhelming majority of the united states congress . 
however , not all actions constitute free speech , and i am hardly alone in asserting that flag desecration is not speech to be protected under the first amendment . 
in 1989 , the united states supreme court in texas v. johnson unilaterally invalidated flag protection laws in 48 states and the district of columbia , overturning 100 years of federal and state precedent , banning the physical desecration of the american flag . 
following this decision for the first time in our nation 's history , an overwhelming 49 state legislatures petitioned congress to send a flag desecration amendment to the states for ratification . 
to burn a flag in front of a veteran or someone else who has put his or her life on the line for their country is an act not deserving protection . 
our nation is unique in the world because our citizens represent a variety of heritages , religions , ethnicities , and political viewpoints . 
of course , words or other forms of expression do not have to be correct in order to be protected . 
not all actions constitute free speech , and i am hardly alone in asserting that flag desecration is n't free speech to be protected under the first amendment . 
rather , it 's a precious liberty founded in law -- a freedom preserved by respect for the rights of others . 
to burn a flag in front of a veteran or someone else who has put his or her life on the line for their country is a despicable act not deserving protection . 
this amendment does n't , in any way , alter the first amendment . 
as justice rehnquist eloquently observed in concluding his dissent : `` uncritical extension of constitutional protection to the burning of the flag risks the frustration of the very purpose for which organized governments are instituted ... .. 
the government may conscript men into the armed forces where they must fight and perhaps die for the flag , but the government may not prohibit the public burning of the banner under which they fight. '' i am proud to play a part in trying to right that wrong . 
i rise in support and as a cosponsor of h. j. res. 10 , an amendment to the constitution authorizing the congress to prohibit the physical desecration of the united states flag . 
mr. speaker , i rise today in opposition to this amendment . 
at the start of the town hall meeting i host in my district , i always try take a few moments to lead those in attendance in the pledge of allegiance . 
the constitution does n't fly majestically in front of government buildings . 
as a member of congress , i took an oath of office in which i swore `` ... .. 
that i will support and defend the constitution of the united states. '' in fact , new citizens to our great nation make a similar pledge when they are sworn in as u.s. citizens . 
in its more than 200 years , the constitution has been amended only 27 times . 
i believe that the vast majority of americans already respect our flag , and i am unaware of a flag burning epidemic in america . 
to me this resolution is a solution in search of a problem . 
let me be clear , it is wrong to desecrate or defile an american flag in any way . 
we should encourage civic education in our schools and communities . 
i oppose this amendment because i believe that while attempting to preserve the symbol of the freedoms we enjoy in this country , it actually would harm the values and ideals that created of these freedoms . 
mr. speaker , i rise today in opposition to h. j. res. 10 , the proposed constitutional amendment to prohibit the physical desecration of our flag . 
and , in this respect , i take no pleasure in doing so : like the vast majority of americans , i too condemn those malcontents who would desecrate our flag -- a universal symbol for democracy , freedom and liberty -- to grab attention for themselves and inflame the passions of patriotic americans . 
further , i fully appreciate and respect the motivations of those who offer and support this amendment , particularly the patriotic men and women who so faithfully served this nation in our armed services and in other capacities . 
in opposing a similar amendment a few years ago , senator mcconnell stated that it `` rips the fabric of our constitution at its very center : the first amendment. '' he added , `` our respect and reverence for the flag should not provoke us to damage our constitution , even in the name of patriotism. '' those of us who oppose this amendment do so not to countenance the actions of a few , but because we believe the question before us today is how we the united states of america -- are to deal with individuals who dishonor our nation in this manner . 
as the late justice brennan wrote for the supreme court in texas v. johnson : `` the way to preserve the flag 's special role is not to punish those who feel differently about these matters . 
in more than 200 years , our constitution has been amended only 27 times , and nearly all of those amendments guarantee or expand rights , liberties and freedoms . 
i simply do not believe that our traditions , our values , our democratic principles -- all embodied in our constitution and the bill of rights -- should be overridden to prohibit this particular manner of speech , even though i completely disagree with it . 
i remind my colleagues that if we approve this amendment , we put our great nation in the company of the oppressive regimes in china , iran , and cuba -- all of whom have similar laws protecting their flags . 
mr. speaker , i rise to join in this serious debate over the first amendment and our nation 's flag , two of the most sacred institutions to this country . 
america is somewhat unique in its devotion to the nation 's flag . 
or it begins when we attend a memorial day parade with our parents and look in awe at the veterans , young and old , who still carry the flag with such pride . 
seeing our young men and women in uniform carrying out their mission under dangerous and difficult conditions is an inspiring thing . 
seeing their devotion to our flag and all that it represents makes me so grateful to have grown up in this country and to have some small part in helping our troops . 
our men and women in uniform appreciate the freedoms afforded to them , and are eager to see iraqi citizens enjoy these same freedoms . 
our forefathers , in their wisdom , made this the first amendment to the bill of rights . 
in deference to our forefathers and out of respect for the brave patriots today who are serving overseas , i can not in good conscience support this amendment . 
much as i hate the act , it is not right to deny an american the freedom to express himself in this shameful way . 
mr. speaker , today , i rise in opposition to h. j. res. 10 , proposing an amendment to the constitution of the united states authorizing congress to prohibit the physical desecration of the flag of the united states . 
since 1990 , i have voted in opposition to a constitutional amendment banning flag desecration or flag burning . 
i am immensely gratified when i see all the flags flying in the face of terrorist attacks and in support of our troops fighting overseas . 
individual freedom and opportunity have built our nation into the strongest on earth where liberties are enshrined in our constitution . 
the first amendment to the constitution protects free speech and allows us to openly debate any issue in this country . 
in the true spirit of america , freedom must be maintained for those with whom we agree and , yes , those with whom we disagree . 
if enacted , this bill would for the first time in our nation 's history modify the bill of rights to limit freedom of speech . 
some in the past have voted for this amendment assuming that the senate will stop it , that we really will not do this bad thing to our country . 
from yorktown to fort mchenry , from iwo jima to baghdad , our troops have fought behind our flag in the defense of liberty . 
their dedication and their sacrifice in defense of freedom demands that we take this action today . 
and who can forget on september 11 , 2001 , when firefighters in new york pulled our flag out of the rubble of the world trade center and hoisted it in defiance of terror ? 
and who can forget the flag that hangs in the american history museum here in washington , d.c . 
mr. speaker , i rise in opposition to this resolution because i disagree with this attempt to muddle our first amendment rights . 
tested through times of war and peace , americans have been able to write or publish almost anything without interference , to practice their religion freely and to protest against the government in almost every way imaginable . 
mr. speaker , a friend of mine and former senator of virginia , chuck robb , is a man who sacrificed greatly for his nation , in both the vietnam war and in his political career . 
exemplifying a `` profile in courage '' senator robb stood against public popularity when he voted against this amendment in order to defend the very freedoms that the american flag represents . 
in his moving senate floor statement , senator robb described how as a soldier he had been prepared to give up his life in the vietnam war in order to protect the very freedoms that this constitutional amendment would suppress . 
not having fought in a war , i should do no less than senator robb did in defense of die freedom he and so many of my peers were willing to defend with their lives . 
in our hearts and our minds we know that flag burning is not a threat to our freedom , limiting the exercise of individual liberty is . 
i was there in the days after 9/11 . 
i have watched their betrayal by the government of the united states , by the federal and state and local governments which are not providing for their health care , which are not providing workers ' comp when they can not do their jobs because of world trade center health syndrome , which denies that they were present in the workers ' comp proceedings after they get medals for rescuing people . 
quite frankly , the crass political use of the flag to question the patriotism of those who value fundamental freedoms is a greater insult to those who died in the service of our nation than is the burning of the flag . 
i am certain we will hear speeches invoking the sacrifice of our troops in the field as a pretext for carving up the first amendment . 
it is the civic equivalent of violating the commandment against taking the lord 's name in vain . 
people have rights in this country that supersede public opinion , even strongly held public opinion . 
mr. speaker , the fact of the matter is i have seen motion pictures , i have seen movies reflecting the war of 1812 in which the british burned our capital . 
i saw in those movies , actors playing british soldiers burning the flag . 
did we send in the police to arrest the actors for this flag desecration ? 
that is to say , they are not burning the flag as an expression of disdain for our values , as an expression of their opinions on political issues of their disagreement with the administration or with the government in power . 
if we carve out this exception for the first amendment , if we make this the first time that we will limit rights protected by the bill of rights , it will be easier to do it in the future . 
then the next amendment will come along and say that , well , if you say things that we think , that somebody at the moment thinks endangers american troops , you say the war , whatever war it is at the moment , is wrong , our president should n't have done it , whoever the president may be at that moment , our troops should n't be in wherever they are , that is endangering our troops , we will make that illegal . 
how many members of congress , used car dealers , fast-food restaurants , and other seemingly legitimate individuals and enterprises have engaged in the act of using the flag or parts of the flag for advertising , an act which our unconstitutional law defines as flag desecration ? 
now , i know that they will say , we 've held hearings in previous congresses . 
yeah , and we have rejected this amendment in previous congresses . 
i do not recall seeing anybody burning the flag in i do not know how many years . 
so , in other words , if one desecrates a flag to make a nice point , that is a good context . 
mr. speaker , i want to begin by reading excerpts of an article written in the `` retired officer , '' a veterans magazine , by a major james warner , who was a pow in vietnam for 6 years . 
he writes as follows : `` in march of 1973 , when we were released from a prisoner-of-war camp in north vietnam , we were flown to clark air base in the philippines . 
let me explain myself. '' he then goes on to talk about his experience in the pow camp . 
see , the officer said , people in your country protest against your cause . 
in my country we are not afraid of freedom , even if it means that people disagree with us . 
the officer was on his feet in an instant , his face purple with rage . 
while he was ranting , i was astonished to see pain compounded by fear in his eyes . 
`` we do not need , '' he continues , `` to amend the constitution in order to punish those who burn our flag . 
do not be afraid of freedom , it is the best weapon we have. '' this is , as i said , from major james warner , who was a pow in vietnam for 6 years who understands freedom , and therefore opposes this amendment . 
after the one-man , one-vote decision in 1960 , whatever it was , where they said you had to reapportion based on population , there were amendments introduced . 
what is the dire necessity , that in the last 20 years , i heard someone say 119 people have burned the flag . 
but burning the flag to express an unpopular viewpoint , we do not agree with the administration in power about whatever , that would be made a crime . 
burning the flag in connection with unpopular speech . 
if you burn it in connection with popular speech , we respect the flag and we dispose of this , or this connection with popular speech because you are an actor playing the british burning washington in 1814 , that is okay . 
we have no great emotional issue at the moment that have people marching in the streets ; but as the gentleman from arkansas ( mr. snyder ) xz4003830 pointed out , at times in our history we have , and at times in our history people have been persecuted and free speech has been violated . 
we should not make it easier at times of emotion in the future on issues we can not now foresee for unpopular minorities to be bullied . 
we should not make it easier for unpopular minorities in the future to have their free speech trampled or to give weapons to a future government with which to trample free speech . 
no one is divided on that in this chamber . 
but those of us who understand , i think , the meaning of liberty and the meaning of what this country stands for , perhaps in a way , i would want to say better than others , but that would be a little arrogant , but to understand that as we do , understand that the real meaning of this country is to permit free speech , to magnify free speech , to magnify free speech of those we do not agree with , of those we find obnoxious . 
and then came two 5-4 supreme court decisions in the 1980s which allowed flag desecration under the banner of free speech , which has really offended a great many people in this country . 
mr. speaker , i rise in strong opposition to this resolution . 
this is more like a solution in search of a problem . 
we just do not need to amend the constitution for so little a problem that we face in this regard . 
is it not rather ironic today that we have troops dying in iraq , `` spreading freedom '' and , yet , we are here trying to pass laws similar to what saddam hussein had with regard to the flag ? 
mr. speaker , a question i would like to ask the proponents of this legislation is this : what if some military officials arrived at a home to report to the family that their son had just been killed in iraq , and the mother is totally overwhelmed by grief which quickly turns to anger . 
what is the proper punishment for this woman who is grieved , who acts out in this manner ? 
i rise in opposition to this amendment . 
i have myself served 5 years in the military , and i have great respect for the symbol of our freedom . 
according to the pro-flag amendment citizens flag alliance , there were only three incidents of flag desecration in 2004 and there have only been two acts of desecration thus far in 2005 , and the majority of those cases involved vandalism or some other activity that is already punishable by local law enforcement ! 
this is in many ways patriotism with a gun -- if your actions do not fit the official definition of a `` patriot , '' we will send somebody to arrest you . 
for example , sadam hussein made desecration of the iraq flag a criminal offense punishable by up to 10 years in prison . 
it is assumed that many in the military support this amendment , but in fact there are veterans who have been great heroes in war on both sides of this issue . 
he said : our nation was not founded on devotion to symbolic idols , but on principles , beliefs and ideals expressed in the constitution and its bill of rights . 
american veterans who have protected our banner in battle have not done so to protect a golden calf . 
secretary of state , former chairman of the joint chiefs , and two-time winner of the presidential medal of freedom colin powell has also expressed opposition to amending the constitution in this manner : `` i would not amend that great shield of democracy to hammer out a few miscreants . 
those violations are used against red china in the argument that they should not have most-favored-nation status . 
we do not have freedom of expression of our religion in other people 's churches ; it is honored and respected because we respect the ownership of the property . 
in any case , those who believe we have `` no king but christ '' should be troubled by this amendment . 
we must be interested in the spirit of our constitution . 
we must be interested in the principles of liberty . 
mr. speaker , i rise in opposition to the watt amendment and support h. j. res. 10 . 
i was interested because yesterday in my district the aclu , which holds itself as the arbiter of all freedom of speech in the nation and in the world , actually shut down all comments from their own local chapter because one person was speaking out on an issue that they did not want him to speak on with their name hooked onto it . 
so the aclu yesterday in the second congressional district of new mexico actually said no freedom of speech is allowed if you are an aclu officer . 
freedom of speech , we have also seen it compromised in our schools . 
we can talk about certain religions in schools , but we can not talk about christian religions in school and we find that the american public is saying , why ? 
when i see these world war ii veterans coming to me with tears in their eyes knowing they are in the last year or two of their lives and saying , why ca n't we do this finally , it is not a complicated issue . 
they do not see things in the complex legal arguments on the floor of this house or in the supreme court . 
look at the debate right now in guantanamo bay . 
it is time for the congress to speak in the way that the majority of americans would have them to speak . 
mr. speaker , i want to begin by commending the gentleman from california ( mr. cunningham ) xz4000910 for not only his extraordinary and courageous service to our nation in uniform , but for his ongoing service to our country in bringing this important legislation to the floor of the congress . 
when the flag was raised by sergeant mike strank and his makeshift squad , history records that a thunderous cheer arose from our troops on land and sea , in foxholes and on stretchers , across iwo jima and its surrounding waters . 
hope was returned to that battlefield when the american flag began flapping in the wind . 
c.s. lewis said : `` we laugh at honor and are shocked to find traitors in our midst. '' mr. speaker , let us this day cease to laugh at honor . 
i think it is important to put this debate in context because it occurs to me that every time we consider this resolution , we end up cutting veterans health care . 
when the sponsor challenges us to ask wounded veterans in va hospitals what they want us to do , i suspect that they would not be asking us to cut veterans health care at the same time we debate this resolution . 
reserve components make up 50 percent of our forces in iraq and studies show that 20 percent have no health insurance . 
in reality , the only place you ever see a flag burned is in compliance with the federal code at flag ceremonies disposing of a worn-out flag . 
in fact , the only time i have seen a flag burned is at one of these ceremonies . 
so the proposed constitutional amendment is all about expression and all about prohibiting expression in violation of the first amendment principles . 
in fact , the amendment does not even use the term `` burning. '' it uses the term `` flag desecration. '' and by using the word `` desecration , '' we are giving government officials the power to decide that one can burn the flag if they are saying something nice and respectful , but they are a criminal if they burn this flag while they are saying something offensive or insulting . 
mr. speaker , in addition to the violation of the spirit of the bill of rights , this amendment has practical problems . 
and what happens if one desecrates their own flag in private ? 
even if we adopt this constitutional amendment , the first amendment will still be there , and so the amendment is , in fact , redundant , but it makes it clear and reminds people that it is still there . 
but if you are a war protester who burns a flag , you can be arrested , and if you are a veteran , so disgusted with veterans health care , and burn the flag in protest , are we making him a criminal ? 
or if you are a member of a fringe political organization who burns his own flag on his own property , in private , can they be arrested if somebody finds out ? 
mr. speaker , i rise today in support of house joint resolution 10 , which would amend the constitution to grant congress the authority to prohibit the physical desecration of the american flag . 
mr. speaker , the american flag represents the shared history and common future of all americans and our collective commitment to the preservation of the ideals enshrined in our constitution . 
the flag flies proudly in times of peace and war , prosperity and crisis , reminding the world of our unflinching resolve to protect the freedom and equality it symbolizes . 
in the early days of the republic through contemporary times , the flag has rallied and sustained the spirit of the nation . 
in world war ii , it was carried onto normandy beach by soldiers who liberated a continent from darkness , and raised on iwo jima to steel the resolve of embattled marines . 
in 1989 , the federal government and 48 states had exercised this authority . 
however , in the same year , a closely divided supreme court invalidated those laws by holding that burning an american flag as part of a political demonstration was protected by the first amendment . 
the congress quickly responded to this decision , but the following year in another 5 to 4 decision , the court struck down the federal flag protection act in united states v. eichman . 
toward that end , they provided the people with an amendment process embodied in article v of the constitution . 
in december 1792 , james madison asked a question : `` who are the best keepers of the people 's liberty ? 
the sacred trust can be nowhere so safe as in the hands most interested in preserving it. '' all 50 state legislatures have passed resolutions calling on congress to pass a flag protection amendment , and polls demonstrate the overwhelming majority of americans have consistently supported a flag protection amendment . 
the congress must act with bipartisan dispatch to ensure that this issue is returned to the hands of those most interested in preserving freedom , the people themselves . 
america 's soldiers salute the flag of the united states in times of peace , and generations of america 's soldiers have fought and died for it in times of war . 
i urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important measure that provides this unique and sacred american symbol with the dignity and protection it deserves and demands . 
i think one of the reasons why we are here today as a result of both the johnson and eichman decisions was exemplified by a decision of the supreme court of my home state of wisconsin on april 9 , 1998 , in the case of state of wisconsin v. matthew janssen . 
using the precedent that was set by the supreme court in the johnson and eichman cases , the wisconsin supreme court unanimously affirmed the dismissal of the prosecution against mr. janssen and wrote an extensive decision that basically agrees with the arguments that were advanced by the gentleman from new york ( mr. nadler ) xz4002890 . 
the wisconsin supreme court through justice john wilcox said : `` but in the end , to paraphrase justice frankfurter , we must take solace in the fact that as members of this court we are not justified in writing our private notions of policy into the constitution , no matter how deeply we may cherish them or how mischievous we may deem their disregard , '' quoting the barnette case with justice frankfurter dissenting . 
the supreme court of wisconsin concluded by saying : `` if it is the will of the people in this country to amend the united states constitution in order to protect our nation 's symbol , it must be done through normal political channels. '' today , we are doing it through those normal political channels . 
there was a decision early in the country 's history under the constitution that related to the judicial power of the united states . 
so when there is a court decision that has resulted in consequences that the congress and the states collectively deem are so bad that it requires an amendment to the constitution , this congress has not hesitated to propose an amendment to the constitution , and the states have ratified it . 
here we have had resolutions of all 50 state legislatures asking that we propose this amendment and send it to the states for ratification , and that is because the instances of flag desecration that have occurred have been deemed by them to be over the line and that the supreme court of the united states was wrong in its decision and it needs correction . 
let me read you what justice black said in the case of street v. new york , decided in 1969 : `` it passes my belief that anything in the federal constitution bars a state from making the deliberate burning of an american flag an offense. '' the court changed its mind twice at the end of the decade of the 1980s . 
mr. speaker , i have listened attentively to the arguments made by the gentleman from north carolina ( mr. watt ) xz4004240 in support of his amendment , and he said that his amendment is redundant . 
this substitute amendment should be rejected because it would constitutionally ratify the supreme court 's decision in texas v. johnson and united states v. eichman , rather than empower congress to pass legislation to protect the flag from physical desecration . 
in johnson and eichman , the supreme court held that flag desecration is expressive conduct protected by the first amendment . 
in addition , based on these precedents , any law that prohibits the physical desecration of the flag will be struck down as an unconstitutional suppression of free expression , thus defeating the goal of our efforts to provide protection for the flag . 
in other words , if the watt amendment is passed and then a constitutional amendment is passed and ratified by the states , the supreme court can , in the future , recognize that it made a mistake , and that is why this amendment should be rejected . 
mr. speaker , the major argument that we have heard against the base amendment and in favor of the watt substitute is that if we do not pass the watt substitute , we will be amending the bill of rights for the first time in the history of this country . 
in the dred scott decision , chief justice taney claimed that the fifth amendment 's due process clause , which he interpreted to include a substantive right to the protection of property , prohibited restrictions on slave ownership . 
in a similar manner , house joint resolution 10 seeks to correct two supreme court precedents that repudiated 2 centuries of jurisprudence . 
the material proposed to be inserted in the motion to recommit , sections 2 and following , has nothing to do with the subject of prohibiting the physical desecration of the flag and , thus , is not germane under the rules of the house . 
the amendment proposed in the motion to recommit relates to the old age survivors and disability trust fund and is a separate proposition . 
should the gentleman from mississippi offer more nongermane motions to recommit , then i think it is incumbent upon me , as the manager of the bill , to raise a point of order , should the rules of the house be violated by the motion to recommit , as they have been in the past . 
mr. speaker , i rise today in opposition to h. j. res. 10 , which would amend the constitution to allow congress to pass laws banning the desecration of a flag . 
keep in mind the constitution has only been amended 17 times since the bill of rights was passed in 1791 . 
mr. speaker , i rise today in strong support of house joint resolution 4 , the constitutional amendment to prohibit flag desecration . 
it tells the story of victories won -- and battles lost -- in defending the principles of freedom and democracy . 
the flag reminds us of the sacrifices they made at gettysburg , san juan hill , iwo jima , normandy beach , korea , da nang , kuwait , afghanistan , iraq and other places where america 's men and women in uniform placed honor and duty above self . 
i meet with constituents everyday in order to best represent their interests in washington . 
our founding fathers protected free speech and freedom of the press because in a democracy , words are used to debate , persuade and to educate . 
in 1989 , in the case of texas versus gregory lee johnson , the supreme court ruled that a state flag protection statute was unconstitutional . 
the court was in error . 
it was not the thoughts or opinions expressed by mr. johnson xz4002052 that the texas law restricted but the manner in which he expressed his thoughts and opinions . 
in the last congress , the house of representatives overwhelmingly passed this amendment by a vote of 298 to 125 , and will rightfully pass it again this year . 
mr. speaker , i am proud to be an original cosponsor of h. j. res. 4 and ask that my colleagues join me in supporting this important resolution that means so much to so many . 
as secretary of state colin powell said in a letter dated may 18 , 1999 to senator leahy : `` if they are destroying a flag that belongs to someone else , that is a prosecutable crime . 
unfortunately , our history has abundant examples of patriotism being used to hurt those who express views in disagreement with that of the majority . 
let me share some news stories taken from the new york times in years of great strife in america . 
there was much excitement in the main dining room at rector 's last night following the playing of the `star spangled banner. ' frederick s. boyd , a former reporter on the new york call , a socialist newspaper , was dining with miss jessie ashley and miss may r. towle , both lawyers and suffragists . 
the three alone of those in the room remained seated . 
`` boyd was beaten severely when albert dasburg a head waiter , succeeded in reaching his side . 
other waiters closed in and the fray was stopped . 
before magistrate corrigan in night court , boyd repeated that he did not have to rise at the playing of the national anthem , but the court told him that while there was no legal obligation , it was neither prudent nor courteous not to do so in these tense times . 
the ranks of the marchers were broken up by self-organized squads of uniformed soldiers and sailors , red flags and banners bearing socialist mottos were trampled on , and literature and furnishings in the socialist headquarters in park square were thrown into the street and burned . 
there may well be a decrease in public deliberate incidents of flag desecration , acts that we all deplore , if this amendment becomes part of our constitution , although they are already quite rare . 
on the other side of the ledger , if this amendment becomes part of our constitution , in my opinion , it will become a constitutionally sanctioned tool for the majority to tyrannize the minority . 
as evidenced by anecdotes from a time of great divisiveness in our nation 's history , a time much different from today , government , which ultimately as human beings with all of our strengths and weaknesses , may use this amendment to question the patriotism of vocal minorities and will use it to find excuses to legally attack demonstrations which utilize the flag in an otherwise appropriate manner , except for the fact that the flag is carried by those speaking for an unpopular minority . 
i was at a rural county fair in arkansas several years ago where a group had a booth with great patriotic display , in addition to their handouts and signs . 
mr. speaker , i do not think our constitution will be improved nor our freedoms protected by placing within it enhanced opportunity for minority views to be legally attacked , ostensibly because of their misuse of the flag they own , but in reality because of the views that many consider out of the mainstream . 
mr. speaker , i rise in opposition to h. j. res. 10 , which proposes a constitutional amendment to ban desecration of the flag , because what people do with a piece of fabric , however meaningful , is not worthy of congressional intervention . 
instead we are mired in the issues of terri schiavo , steroids in professional sports and flag burning . 
how much pride in our democracy do americans have when they learn that the president was planning to invade iraq months before he bothered to tell them about it ? 
mr. speaker , listening to it in my office earlier , it was claimed that veterans oppose this amendment . 
so it was the supreme court 's decision in texas v. johnson in 1989 , and u.s. v. eichman in 1990 , that overturned two centuries of traditional and commonly accepted legal practice . 
in its present form . 
mr. speaker , i ask unanimous consent , given the gravity of this motion , that the clerk read the motion again since , apparently , no one on this floor , other than i , know what is in it . 
in the last 4 years alone , the national debt has increased by $ 2.1 trillion . 
mr. speaker , if any business in america had taken that money out of the employees ' trust fund -- -- 
mr. speaker , i am opposed to the bill in its present form . 
in the past 4 years alone , this congress , of which i am a part , has taken $ 632 billion out of the social security trust fund that we promised the citizens we would set aside just for social security payments and used to run the country . 
the point of order is to my colleagues , if you think it is wrong to desecrate the flag , i would hope that you would think it is wrong to misspend money taken out of people 's wallets that we promised to spend on their social security and to protect that money in the constitution . 
mr. speaker , in the interests of moving things along , i ask unanimous consent to engage the gentleman from wisconsin ( mr. sensenbrenner ) xz4003650 in about a 3-minute colloquy . 
we have acquired $ 2.1 billion worth of new debt in just the past 4 years , waiving all points of order . 
i hope the speaker will give us an opportunity in the near future for you guys to live up to your promises . 
i am not in support of burning the flag . 
like colin powell , while i personally abhor the thought of anyone burning the american flag , the symbol under which i fought for this nation , i believe the principles embodied in the constitution and the bill of rights are far more important. '' i do not think there is a real need for this amendment . 
and defining desecration is tricky , especially given the widespread commercial and decorative use of the flag. '' and , in particular , i share that newspaper 's view that `` more importantly , tampering with the first amendment opens the way to those laws of the kind that less democratic governments impose to shield themselves from criticism. '' mr. speaker , every day , at home and abroad , our brave men and women in uniform are on guard to defend our country and our constitution from those who have no respect for either . 
in my opinion , anyone who thinks that burning the flag under which they serve would be an effective way to influence public opinion is grotesquely mistaken . 
and i think to say we need to amend the constitution in order to respond to people suffering from that delusion is to give them more importance than they deserve . 
to celebrate that happy event , the white house has announced that scholar and historian lynne cheney , the wife of the vice president , will speak at gunston hall plantation in northern virginia . 
gunston hall was the home of george mason , whom the white house properly described as `` father of america 's bill of rights. '' mason wrote the prototype of the bill of rights for virginia 's constitution in 1776 , and it was his intransigence that led to the adoption of those rights as the first 10 amendments to the constitution . 
mr. speaker , this marks the sixth consecutive term of congress in which i have engaged in this debate . 
i actually , when i first came to congress and the first time i had the opportunity to participate in this , i resented having to go through this . 
but over the years i have come to believe that this is a healthy debate ; and if we conduct it in a dignified way , the debate actually can be good for the entire country , and people can come away with a greater understanding and appreciation of how delicate our constitution framework is . 
this is about how individuals in our country perceive patriotism , the rights of free speech , the rights of protecting the views of people who quite often they may disagree with in content , but that is what our country has been about . 
and i hope that this amendment in the nature of a substitute does not get us off onto a different track , because this is the second or third time i have offered the amendment in the nature of a substitute , and i did it originally for the purpose of trying to get to a higher quality of debate and forcing my colleagues and whoever may be listening to the debate to think about some of these things . 
what rights do we owe to people in our country whose views we may disagree with ? 
what rights do we owe to the people in our country who may express those views in ways that we disagree with ? 
and i am confident that everybody in this body would think that desecration of the flag , burning of the flag would not be something that we would be supporting , so that is not what this amendment is about . 
in over 200 years of history , our constitution has been amended only 27 times and the bill of rights has never been amended , not once has the bill of rights been amended ; and this proposed resolution would be the first time to do that . 
mr. speaker , following the horrific acts of terrorism against our country , our citizens were repeatedly cautioned not to cower in the face of terrorism . 
do not curtail our freedoms , we were told , for to do so would be to surrender our way of life , to give up and give in to the terrorists . 
i think if we pass the amendment as it has been proposed , we give in to those miscreants , as colin powell has characterized them , those people who we disagree with . 
i want to put this in context . 
and in that class with me was a student by the name of duncan kennedy who is now a professor at harvard law school and for whom a whole theory of law has been patterned . 
in that class with me , in that constitutional law class , was a guy named paul gewirtz , who is now a professor of constitutional law at yale university law school . 
i mean , there were good students in the class and then there were people like me who were sitting in the back of the room hoping that nobody would ever realize that we were there and i could avoid getting involved in that high level of debate . 
and one day my senior law partner , a gentleman by the name of julius chambers , called me in and said , i want you to go to eastern north carolina to one of the counties in which native americans represent a high portion of the population , because a number of the native americans in that county have been charged with parading , using tomahawks , parading around ; and they have been charged with resisting arrest and various other criminal offenses . 
i could not wait until the end of the day to get in my car and race back to charlotte , north carolina , and confront my senior law partner . 
i walked in and i said , chambers , why would you send me to this county to represent these indians who were demonstrating against going to school with african americans ? 
his response taught me more about the first amendment than either robert bork or duncan kennedy or paul gerwitz or any of the discussions that i had participated in in law school . 
he said , do you not believe in the first amendment ? 
that is , can you imagine the debate that was taking place in the supreme court ? 
in that sense , the language that i am proposing , i am going to first and foremost acknowledge , is redundant . 
as my colleagues know , whatever we do as a congress is supposed to be subject to everything in the constitution anyway , but i want to remind us that , at the same time , we protect the flag . 
a principle of our nation is also to protect speech , whatever that is ; is it burning the flag , is it hollering `` fire '' in a crowded theater ? 
my colleagues might argue that it is , that it is equal in value , but we at least need to come to grips with that , and that is what the constitution , that is what the supreme court has been trying to do for a number of years . 
we like to punt these things and pretend that we are doing something earth shattering here , but the supreme court , i hope , is still going to be there , and i believe the supreme court is going to wrestle with this as they have in the past . 
what it does is that it codifies and reaffirms and acknowledges the state of affairs that exists right now , that in the final analysis the supreme court is the ultimate arbiter of the constitution and laws of our country . 
i suspect if there were ever anybody in this institution who would be , should be railing against the supreme court , either the current supreme court or supreme courts throughout history , it might be the members of the congressional black caucus who would have the highest standing and right to do that because in a number of cases the supreme court has ruled in ways that were absolutely counter to our interest . 
i just want my colleagues to understand that this document that our drafters crafted for us has survived so much the test of time , the comings and goings of members of the supreme court differing in interpretations , as the gentleman from virginia ( mr. goodlatte ) said . 
i do not think that every time you get a supreme court decision that you disagree with in this country the way to resolve or to express your disagreement is to come to the congress of the united states and propose that we amend the entire constitutional framework that we are operating under . 
so one side of me says this is not a good idea to be amending the constitution in this way . 
and if we pass this amendment , having amended for the first time in 200 years our bill of rights , gone through the whole process , the supreme court is still going to have the same right to do that . 
as i said , i used to resent coming here and engaging in this debate every year or every 2 years . 
democrats and republicans have to exist in our constitutional framework . 
mr. speaker , i appreciate the opportunity to speak in favor of this amendment . 
hampton sides , in his book ghost soldiers , recounts the ranger action to liberate the allied pows from cabanatuan in the philippines . 
`` along the way we saw an american flag set in a turret of a tank . 
it was n't much of a flag , writhing in a weak breeze , but for the men of cabanatuan , the sight was galvanizing . 
all the men in all the trucks stood at attention and saluted . 
all americans are `` endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights. '' among those rights enumerated in our constitution is the right of free speech . 
one can not spray-paint a bald eagle in protest . 
to those who say that these actions have to be taken in context , if one burns a flag for a movie it is different from burning a flag as a protest , i would say that all actions have to be taken in context . 
if one takes another person 's life in process of defending oneself , it is considered in a different context then if they took another person 's life to collect a life insurance policy . 
all actions are always taken in context , and i trust the juries of the united states to take this amendment in proper context when it is carried out . 
i would like to urge my colleagues to vote in favor of the flag protection amendment . 
mr. speaker , the resolution before us represents a promise , a promise by the house of representatives to the american people that not only are we aware of the hindrances to prosperity now existing in the national economy but that we are committed to removing them as soon as possible . 
we are aware those costs are passed along from american businesses to american consumers in higher prices to the tune of $ 8 , 000 per family per year . 
we are aware that exports account for one-sixth of our economic growth , and that one in five american factory jobs and one in three american crop acres depend on customers in foreign markets and that many markets are still closed to our goods . 
we are aware that 60 percent of american businesses are impeded in their growth by the lack of advanced training in the workplace . 
we are also aware that health care is too expensive , coverage too limited , and that small businesses are at a disadvantage in covering their employees . 
mr. speaker , the issue of competition is one that is lived out and dealt with daily in my congressional district , silicon valley . 
every day my constituents tell me that the united states is falling behind our competitors in europe and asia . 
one of the top issues in silicon valley today is stock options . 
what has happened is a decline in investment and a diminishment of innovation . 
today the united states has fallen to 16th in broadband penetration , down from 4th in 2001 . 
the resolution states that energy is a major problem , yet the department of energy 's independent analysts have said that the provisions in the house energy bill will have a `` negligible '' impact on prices , production , consumption , and imports of energy . 
what is missing in the congress is the commitment to reshape the critical policies which will renew our nation 's competitiveness in the 21st century . 
mr. speaker , i thank the gentleman from new york for his leadership in defense of our economy , workers ' rights , and our desire to build on an american economy that can provide opportunity for all . 
but , it might read something like this : whereas , u.s. trade with foreign countries is so imbalanced that the u.s. has a trade deficit with every continent in the world except australia and with nearly every country in the world ; whereas , before nafta , the u.s. exported about an equivalent amount to mexico as it imported to mexico . 
but , after nafta , imports from mexico increased 195 percent , more than double the increase in exports . 
so while increased exports after nafta may have created almost 800 , 000 jobs , according to the economic policy institute in 2003 , increased imports due to nafta destroyed almost 1.7 million jobs . 
every state in the nation lost jobs due to nafta ; whereas , congress will soon be compounding the damage with consideration of cafta , which is modeled on nafta ; whereas , china 's seemingly endless supply of dollars to acquire ibm , maytag , and now unocal is supplied by america 's huge trade deficit with china . 
in fact , since congress agreed to admit china to the wto , granting it permanent most favored nation status , the u.s. trade deficit with china grew by 50 percent in only 2 years . 
now , if congress was to take up legislation for the purpose of removing barriers to the competitiveness of the u.s. economy , it might read like this : whereas , america needs a new trade policy based on the principle that what the u.s. buys from a country should roughly match what it sells to that country ; whereas , the cost of private , for-profit health care is a serious impediment to competitiveness ; whereas , the u.s. paid $ 5 , 270 per capita for health care in 2002 , and two countries with the closest level of spending were germany at $ 2 , 820 and canada $ 2 , 930 , both of which provided universal health care ; whereas , the ceos of ford motor company of canada , gm canada , daimlerchrysler canada wrote in a 2002 letter that `` publicly-funded health care thus accounts for a significant portion of canada 's overall labor cost advantage in auto assembly versus the u.s. which in turn has been a significant factor in maintaining and attracting new auto investment to canada. '' the resolution that we need to hear would say : whereas , h.r. 676 , the u.s. national health insurance act , which has 50 cosponsors , would provide less expensive , high-quality , single-payer health care systems like many u.s. competitors ; whereas , the current course of u.s. economic and health policy is unsustainable , and a day of reckoning could involve the bursting of the housing price bubble , rise of interest rates , budget austerity and the shredding of the social safety net , mass unemployment , and a loss of economic sovereignty . 
therefore , be it resolved , congress has once again lost the opportunity to change the course , correct the trade imbalance , lift up living standards in the u.s. and the world , and set the country on a more sustainable economic course . 
mr. speaker , when i looked at today 's floor schedule , i was pleasantly surprised to see an item addressing the issue of declining united states competitiveness in the world . 
the fact is the issue of competitiveness has not been a priority for republican leaders in this congress or in any preceding one in the last 10 years , and i thought perhaps finally the republicans had woken up . 
that is what i have come to expect in this congress , this republican-led congress : more talk and no action . 
i suspect that you did not consult with any of the people in the tech industry because , if you did , we would have had something with a little meat on it that meant something . 
we need to dramatically improve our math and science education in our country . 
we know that we are falling short , and meanwhile we are continuing to fail in our funding promises to no child left behind . 
we need to reform our immigration policies so that the best and brightest students can come and study in the united states and not be poached by universities who are benefiting in australia and england and elsewhere through our short-sighted and bureaucratic policies ; and we need a sustained commitment to science research and education . 
republicans are like the guy in court who killed his parents and now pleads for mercy as an orphan . 
but i do not associate myself with the sense of the `` whereas '' clauses that america must adopt foreign values and standards in order to compete economically . 
mr. speaker , in america , the road to opportunity is a fast-moving highway . 
simply put , the cost of doing business in america is quickly rising . 
we must and will make america more competitive in the global marketplace . 
and i must say that never have i seen a resolution that demonstrates so completely the lack of understanding by the other side of what is necessary to maintain and improve america 's competitiveness in the world economy . 
they ignore what those people who are on the cutting edge of trying to improve america 's competitiveness , those companies that are on the cutting edge of competing in a world economy , their recommendations , one of the first of which is to fully fund no child left behind . 
but that is what the american electronics association says should be done first and foremost in education . 
the fact of the matter is that this provides nothing , provides nothing that the industries that are on the cutting edge identify as their most important objectives , their most important priorities , and that is to provide for a dramatic and sustained improved investment in education ; a dramatic and sustained improvement in the r & amp ; d of this country , nondefense related , basic r & amp ; d on a permanent basis , something you have not done in 6 years . 
what we are talking about and what the companies have constantly recommended to us is a sustained effort and investment in education , in innovation , in health care . 
universal access to health care , universal access to affordable health care , something not discussed in this resolution , something not done in the 6 years . 
more people are without health care now than in the 5 years that this administration has been in office . 
that is the report on what has happened over the last 4 or 5 years in this country . 
it is very interesting that the thrust of this resolution is that regulations in the united states are barriers to competitiveness , and yet our economy is linked to a nation which has the maximum number of barriers in terms of regulatory procedures , the economy of china . 
obviously , regulation is not ruining the situation in the chinese economy , and our propensity for dealing with this communist/capitalist country , this mongrel , whatever economy we want to call it , our greedy manufacturing industry has gone there . 
i want to run through a few of the whereases in this very interesting resolution which covers a lot of territory . 
whereas more than 1 million american jobs are dependent upon research and development ; whereas the cost of medical care in the united states regularly outpaces general inflation . 
i would be in favor of that , certainly . 
whereas 85 percent of the jobs are classified as skilled jobs , and in 1950 , only 20 percent were so classified . 
is that fact going to lead to a recommendation that we expend more money to improve our education system , that we catch up with some of the nations in the world ? 
do members know that the richest nation in europe now is ireland ? 
ireland is the richest nation in europe . 
in terms of per capita income , ireland has the highest per capita income . 
so an irish youngster can develop in the free system right up to the end of his higher education . 
whereas , in 2002 , trial lawyers received approximately $ 40 billion from litigation , more than the annual revenues of microsoft and intel , and twice the revenue of coca-cola . 
why did they take a swipe at the trial lawyers in the midst of the whereases ? 
you do not have a whereas about the corporate lawyers , or a whereas about the tremendous amount of corruption in corporate america that the republican party refuses to even hold hearings about . 
i hope that you will address some of these whereases that i have just mentioned in terms of some answers as to why we do not pursue the obvious , commonsense solutions . 
mr. speaker , in closing , i would like to just cite a few examples of how republican policies have shortchanged the initiatives which they talked about today . 
instead of having an aggressive policy on math and science education , the bush administration has underinvested in proven math and science instruction . 
instead of investing in research and development to keep the u.s. on the cutting edge of technological advancement , republicans have cut $ 877 million in federal science and technology funding . 
instead of passing the 21st century bill to increase energy independence through advances in cutting-edge technology , the republicans have failed to enact any energy bill at all . 
talking about a need to invest in greater innovation , research and education , certainly makes sense . 
well , let us look at the decisions that left us in the position where `` this is what we have. '' one of the consequences of those decisions is we do not have enough money to fund the research , education and innovation that is necessary . 
we know how important in the global economy innovation , research , education and skills training is . 
we can look at the spending decisions of the last 6 years that have seen massive increases in overall federal spending while , at the same time , underfunding these critical items . 
mr. speaker , the united states has the number one economy in the world . 
in short , our government has made it difficult and undesirable to do business in the united states . 
we have put roadblocks to keeping and creating jobs in america , and we have done this to ourselves . 
if these current trends continue , our economy will continue to lag and we will no longer remain the most dynamic economy in the world . 
they are educating their students in math , science and technology , and pumping out record numbers of engineers . 
they are reducing tax rates and other economic barriers to entice investments in their nations . 
they are pursuing aggressive trade policies to reduce america 's dominance in world trade . 
last year , we began the competitiveness legislative agenda on the floor , and over a period of 8 weeks , we discussed and voted on issues related to keeping and creating keeping jobs in america . 
i encourage my colleagues to join me in finding ways to guarantee a vibrant , internationally competitive american economy now , 5 , 10 , 15 and 20 years down the road . 
our goal is to ensure high-quality and high-paying jobs for all americans today and in the future . 
the gentleman from new york ( mr. owens ) xz4003060 also mentioned a couple of things that i think are important to be addressed in this debate . 
but let me tell the members what is happening in china . 
in kansas they have targeted several industries : the hand truck industry , the auto lift industry . 
in china they are trying to create a silicon valley . 
just think , if we apply some commonsense reforms , we can make jobs in america . 
one example is in 1995 when the statute of repose was passed , which put commonsense limits on the manufacture of airplanes , and the following year 4 , 000 jobs were created in kansas alone , plus additional jobs all across the united states . 
all we are saying in this resolution is let us step back from what we are doing today and say if we were going to start this system tomorrow , would we do the same thing ? 
can we work together to create and keep jobs in america instead of seeing them slide off to other countries ? 
if we look at education spending over the last 5 years , we have had dramatic increases in education , as far as the spending is concerned . 
over $ 5.6 billion will go into nsf this fiscal year and we have plans to increase that funding in the future , too . 
we have more people working today than ever before in the history of our nation . 
the average wage is higher than it has ever been in the history of this nation . 
we have more people owning their own homes today than ever before in the history of this nation , and we have done it because we cut taxes . 
we have barriers that need to be removed so that we can increase the number of jobs and the number of opportunities in america in the future . 
and now there are white collar criminals in jail today . 
corporate corruption was addressed and needs to be addressed in the future . 
mr. speaker , i thank the gentleman from louisiana ( mr. boustany ) xz4006360 for his leadership on the floor today and his help in these very important issues of making america more competitive tomorrow . 
and there are ways that we can work together to make a more solid economy in the future so that we can retain our number one status in the future instead of falling into a second or third-rate economy . 
yet we have more jobs than ever before in the history of our nation . 
we need your help in making them permanent . 
there are eight issues that we have confined the problems that we are facing tomorrow in , and these eight issues are health care , security , bureaucratic red tape termination , lifelong learning , energy self-sufficiency and security , spurring innovation , trade fairness and opportunity , tax relief and simplification , and ending lawsuit abuse . 
today we are going to take a giant step forward in dealing with regulation . 
in the past we have had this adversarial relationship between the government and the private sector . 
in fact this happened in wichita , kansas , where osha targeted sedgwick county , and said we are going to go to the homebuilders and we are going to make it a safe place . 
why do you not come in on an announced basis , make a list of the violations , let the company have time to make the safe environment at the work area , and then come back and see how they are doing ? 
and they created a safe work environment by working together , working together instead of against each other in an adversarial relationship . 
that is what we are talking about in changing the environment in america so that we can create and keep jobs in the future , working together and not against each other . 
that is what we are advocating here , the government working with private sector to make more jobs in the future . 
the resolution says that trade restrictions and inequality are barriers to keeping and creating jobs in the united states -- but it does nothing about them , just as it does nothing to make it easier for americans looking for work to find good jobs . 
the resolution says that bureaucratic red tape is a barrier to economic progress , but it does nothing to reduce that barrier or to require the bush administration to exercise leadership in reducing red tape . 
the resolution complains about `` lawsuit abuse '' and seems to support `` litigation management , '' but says nothing about the extent to which the courts can protect individual rights and the essential role of law in our society . 
in short , this resolution is not serious . 
it deserves neither the time consumed in debating it nor approval by the house . 
i think those two areas are largely responsible for their growing economy and the increased opportunity in ireland . 
there is a lot of talk about a nonbinding resolution , but this house today is going to take up four bills to reform osha that will help small businesses and their enterprises be more competitive and their employees be more competitive in the global economy . 
we need to continue to address this problem and support solutions like association health plans , something that we have already taken up in committee and will be coming to the floor soon . 
so to say this is a nonbinding resolution , surely it makes a statement about some of the needs that we need to work on , but at the same time this congress is addressing all of those issues ; and we ask our colleagues across the aisle to join us to pass these bills so that we can help those americans in need and we can increase our competitiveness on the global market . 
i support this resolution , and i want to thank the gentleman from texas ( mr. delay ) xz4001040 and the gentleman from kansas ( mr. tiahrt ) xz4004050 for their tireless work to remove barriers on u.s. companies , to ensure that america can be competitive in the global economy . 
american businessmen and -women are second to none in resourcefulness , entrepreneurial spirit , business ingenuity ; and the government should foster , not stifle , these qualities . 
frivolous lawsuits , costly health insurance , an overly complicated tax code , skyrocketing energy costs , compliance with innumerable federal and state regulations result in small businesses spending more time just trying to comply with government and government laws and regulations than growing their businesses , creating jobs , and generating revenue . 
let me talk about my district in southwest louisiana for a moment , which has been known for its entrepreneurial spirit . 
we have a port , the 11th largest port in the country , the port of lake charles . 
and as it continues to increase in size , it is moving larger numbers of products into the united states and out into the world . 
our economic developers are finding ways to attract businesses that have never before known the advantages of doing business in louisiana . 
gregg gothreaux heads up this organization and has strived to capitalize on an outstanding workforce to make lafayette a competitive force in the business world . 
in fact , in the year 2004 , inc . 
and 3 months ago , entrepreneur magazine named lafayette one of the top technology centers in the south , based on its appeal and ability to attract high-tech companies . 
and he is hoping to build his business , employing hopefully in the near future 100 employees , so that he can improve his competitiveness and raise his revenue and contribute to the competitiveness of our country and our defense initiatives . 
there are many examples in louisiana and around this country that are competing , despite the regulatory burden , the tax burden and other added costs of doing business . 
mr. speaker , it is our job , it is our job as elected officials to ensure that our businesses have the necessary tools to compete in this global economy , and this congress will address these issues . 
and in the weeks that followed , i joined my colleagues in committee to carefully craft a bill to give law enforcement personnel additional and powerful tools to fight terror . 
but as many of you recall , the work product of our committee was rejected at the eleventh hour in favor of a far more expansive act which has continued to raise concerns among those who cherish our constitutional liberties . 
mr. chairman , reauthorization of this act is an opportunity ; it is an opportunity to restore the checks and balances that must exist in a free society . 
mr. chairman , i voted for the patriot act in 2001 . 
i abstained in the committee on the judiciary this year because i was hoping that some of my concerns could be addressed through a rule that would allow some of these issues to be brought to the floor . 
the chairman bemoans the fact that out in the nation so many people have such a misunderstanding of what the patriot act does or does not do . 
the failure of the rule to make the sunsets in order is a tremendous failure , not that all of them need to be reenacted , but on key sections at a time that is relevant for what the american people want , which is within the next 4 or 5 years there should be a chance to have those provisions sunsetted . 
you are allowing orders that are not based on criminal information to be issued by fisa courts , required to be issued by fisa courts , allowing any kind of tangible records to be seized , whether or not they are pertaining to a specific person , if it is connected with , or , in the case of the base bill here , relevant to a terrorist investigation . 
the standard says , if the target of the fisa order or the national security letter is an agent of a foreign power or is in contact with or known to an agent of a foreign power , a definition which deals with all the hypotheticals provided by my friend , the gentleman from california ( mr. daniel e. lungren ) xz4006170 , in criticizing the safe act and pre-patriot act standard , it provides every hypothetical created that i have heard about with the ability to be pursued under fisa orders . 
why would the senate committee on the judiciary unanimously pass that sensible correction in the patriot act and this body not be even allowed to debate and vote on it ? 
for these reasons , i am going to be forced to vote `` no '' on this bill for the lack of opportunity to sunset key provisions like the lone-wolf provision , like the issue of national security letters to provide a forcing mechanism for oversight and for our failure to deal with the overly broad standard in the existing law and in the base bill . 
i think underlying the gentleman from michigan 's question , is this not about the difference between the fbi and law enforcement using a national security letter to ask a bank to give it the financial records of all of its customers versus asking the bank to give it the financial records of the specific individuals it suspects might be involved or that it is interested in ? 
basically , this is an amendment supported , i am happy to say , by the chairman of the committee on the judiciary , that simply does one thing : it requires the attorney general to report to congress once a year on a survey that it seeks from other agencies of the federal government surveying data-mining technologies in use or in development at federal departments and agencies . 
the modification that i seek simply makes clear that , first of all , any classified information will be submitted in a classified annex and , secondly , that any information regarding data-mining technologies that deals with the sources , intelligence sources and methods , will be available only in the annex to the house permanent select committee on intelligence and the senate select committee on intelligence ; in other words , that to the extent this survey produces anything which should either be classified or deals with sources and methods , the traditional procedures for where that material goes will be maintained . 
the gentleman was wrong in his characterization . 
it does not encumber any sources or funds they do not want to spend , and it simply asks the attorney general to then compile whatever information those agencies have chosen to provide to the attorney general into a report which will be sent public in the case of information which is not sensitive and classified in an annex classified where it does involve such information . 
there is not one word in this bill that imposes a single mandate on any other federal agency . 
we do not want to tie the hands of our security agencies in gathering this information . 
mr. chairman , in the course of yielding to my next speaker , i just want to remind the body it is one report , once a year , with anything that would tip off anybody about anything that we would not want to happen to be in a classified form , even in the amendment form without modification . 
mr. chairman , the patriot act was enacted in the wake of the 9/11 terrorist attacks , rushed through the house as a suspension bill the day after it was introduced . 
the original bill was rewritten in the rules committee instead of the bipartisan bill that was unanimously passed out of the judiciary committee . 
we have now been fighting the war on terror longer than world war ii with no end in sight . 
thirteen municipalities in oregon , including portland , have already passed resolutions expressing their opposition to the patriot act . 
mr. chairman , i appreciate the gentlewoman 's courtesy in permitting me to speak on this amendment . 
we have been fighting the war on terror longer than we fought world war ii , and it appears to be that this is going to be in the american landscape for as far into the future as we can see . 
it may be used in connection with any federal crime , including misdemeanors . 
we saw one of these searches in oregon go sideways and devastate the life of a local attorney . 
in 2001 , just days after 9/11 , we rushed through a bill that simply cast aside the important by-products that were developed by the committee on the judiciary on a bipartisan basis . 
madam speaker , with the patriot act set to expire at the end of the year , congress has once again missed an opportunity to narrow and tighten the legislation.i opposed the original patriot act , as it was rushed into law in the wake of 9/11 , and i strongly oppose the current conference report . 
in terms of the review process , i think the attorney general today in some information he put out suggested that there were at least 23 separate hearings last year of oversight , this is last year alone , of oversight on this act ; witness after witness after witness called to testify about what was happening with the act . 
this oversight work that the chairman has been largely responsible for has made a difference in the way the law was implemented , has made a difference in the way we offer it to be extended today and has made a difference , frankly , in the safety and security of america . 
there is nothing in this law , nothing in the law the last 4 years , nothing in the law as we look to the future that was not available to law enforcement for organized crime . 
there is no evidence that there are problems , and we all could easily be aware of a number of instances , where there is no concern about the fact that the patriot act made a difference in the safety and security of america . 
another thing that the chairman worked hard to put in this act is some legislation that i originally introduced that deals with the problem of methamphetamine , and methamphetamine does become a security issue . 
but the patriot act with two provisions that need to be reviewed in 4 years , the patriot act with a judiciary committee and an oversight responsibility that will continue to be , as it has been , extensive in ensuring that the executive branch does what the patriot act intends it to do with the maximum protection for individual freedom and the maximum protection for the security of our nation . 
the so-called john doe roving wiretaps are a critical tool in our efforts to fight terrorism because they allow surveillance when neither the target 's identity nor location of the interception is known . 
my amendment , i am pleased to say , was unanimously accepted by the entire committee and is included in the base bill before the house today . 
it assures the foreign intelligence surveillance court , we often call it the fisa court , will receive information related to john doe roving wiretaps in a timely manner by removing any ambiguity associated with the term `` reasonable. '' it makes it clear to every fbi agent , doj lawyer and judge from the start , this is a 15-day limit on providing the court with information related to john doe roving wiretaps . 
i rise this afternoon in opposition to this measure which would perpetuate the invasions of civil liberties that are embedded within the 4-year-old patriot act . 
the secret search can be in almost any kind of investigation , and the notification to the & lt ; center & gt ; & lt ; pre & gt ; [ page : h6223 ] & lt ; /pre & gt ; & lt ; /center & gt ; but i am going to focus my remarks this afternoon on the two provisions of the original law which i think cause the deepest civil liberties invasion and which the measure before us does not , in my opinion , appropriately reform . 
in my view , the single most troubling provision confers on law enforcement the ability to use so-called national security letters . 
the bill before us does nothing to address this egregious provision or limit its use in any way . 
you could be sitting in a concert near someone who is a suspected foreign agent , and potentially your records could be seized . 
while the custodian of the records could challenge the seizure , the library , the hospital , the bookstore , or the bank in possession of those records has a lot less incentive to spend resources hiring a lawyer in order to resist the seizure than would the person whose records are about to be seized ; but that person , the real party of interest , never knows that the seizure is about to occur . 
the house recently voted by a margin of 238-187 to bar enforcement of this overly broad provision , but the bill before us with minor changes perpetuates it and , i think , in an inappropriate way . 
law enforcement could go before a court and present evidence of probable cause that a crime has been committed , and by that showing obtain the records that it needs in both of these situations . 
in the past year , we have asked the department of justice how it is using the authority granted to it under the patriot act . 
however , all of that changed in april of this year when the justice department realized that a straight reauthorization of the patriot act would not happen without serious answers to our reasonable questions . 
members of the majority have stressed today that the committee on the judiciary has held 12 patriot act hearings in recent months . 
that extensive inquiry would not have occurred had the sunsets in the law not been in place . 
all 16 of the sunsets that were contained in the original law would be reinserted through this motion to recommit . 
i urge approval for this motion , which will simply assure that we remain in that strong position . 
madam speaker , i rise today in support of the boucher-rohrabacher-mack motion to instruct the conferees to recede to the senate with respect to sunsetting in 4 years the libraries and book stores , roving wire taps and loan wolf provisions of the usa patriot act . 
in past years , well before the december 2005 sunsets contained in the original patriot act , we asked the department of justice how it was using the authorities that had been granted to the department by the original act . 
all of that changed in april of this year when the department of justice realized that straight reauthorization of the patriot act would not happen without serious answers to our reasonable questions . 
remember , sunsets do not in any way hinder law enforcement 's use of the powers the patriot act confers . 
section 215 of the law puts personal records , including library , bookstore and medical records , up for grabs by law enforcement with no requirement that the person whose records are sought be suspected of involvement in a crime . 
the senate bill sunsets this provision in 4 years . 
the combination of allowing blanket tapping of , for example , all of the pay phones in a target 's neighborhood or the phones of all of his friends and relatives , combined with the ability to wiretap a vaguely described john doe , means that roving john doe wiretaps require so little specificity that they can easily be abused . 
sunsetting this provision in 4 years will allow congress to revisit how this authority is being used and whether it continues to be necessary . 
the house sunsets those in 10 years , and we would instruct conferees to adopt the senate 4-year sunset . 
madam speaker , i rise in support of the motion to instruct . 
they compelled congress to take a second look at key provisions in the patriot act and improve them . 
after all , national security has to be our number one priority , but accepting the senate sunsets would also force us to reevaluate again 4 years from now whether they are truly effective in fighting terrorism . 
the issue is setting a system that we need to have in effect . 
it assures that we remain in a strong position in our oversight function . 
recent history clearly shows that in the absence of a near-term sunset we will not get answers to our questions about how controversial law enforcement powers are being used . 
in the absence of a near-term sunset , we can not ensure that civil liberties are being protected . 
this is not a matter about what the department of justice has done in the past , and i differ with the gentleman from wisconsin on this matter . 
this is all about what the department of justice may do in the future . 
adopt this motion , let us adopt the senate 's 4-year sunsets and , in doing so , further the cause of protecting americans ' civil liberties . 
in response , the congress , i was not here at the time , passed the patriot act to give law enforcement agents appropriate tools to fight the new war on terror . 
i would just like to reiterate and rise in support of this amendment . 
as the gentleman from north carolina ( mr. coble ) xz4000760 indicated , there are real cases that have been uncovered and have been tried in court in which known terrorist organizations such as hezbollah have been engaged in the illegal trafficking of cigarettes from low tax states into high tax states using that money to fund their terrorist activities . 
i rise today in support of the rule and the underlying legislation . 
i would like to say in discussion on what occurred in the rules committee , the minority asked that we extend the debate on the patriot act to 2 hours , and we are going to be seeing that later this afternoon . 
i think the patriot act is debated every day in the halls not only of congress but workplaces , certainly law enforcement officers ; and i think all of us are trying to strike that balance between protecting personal liberties and protecting the homeland . 
in this bill that we are about to consider , we will be considering an amendment that i am putting forth . 
the amendment that i wish to address is extremely timely today , unfortunately , for those living in great britain in that it will reform the wrecking trains statute of 1940 to impose greater penalties for those who seek to terrorize individuals on mass transportation , particularly trains . 
but it sends shivers down the spine , i think , of every american knowing the pain and suffering that is going on in london as we speak . 
it is important in this amendment that i am going to be offering to realize that current legal practices are not punitive enough to be any kind of a deterrent to anybody who is considering a massive or a large attack on trains or mass transportation . 
so i think we can agree that more stringent penalties would be in order . 
the penalty is increased with life imprisonment with death-penalty eligibility if an attack results in the death of a person . 
i first offered this amendment last october in the wake of the terrorist attack against the rail system in madrid . 
the house passed this amendment on the 9/11 commission implementation act , but it was removed in conference with the senate . 
the tragic attacks on london on july 7 and another attack there earlier today have demonstrated again the dangers facing rail and transit systems in the u.s. and throughout the world . 
the mandatory minimums in this amendment do not apply to threats or conspiracies . 
we considered it last year and the gentleman from virginia ( mr. scott ) xz4003641 asked that we consider it in the patriot act and that is what we are dealing with today . 
this is the identical amendment that was considered last year in october , and it was also passed in the house intelligence reauthorization act that we passed . 
so this amendment has been considered several times in this house . 
mr. chairman , i would say in closing this has been considered in the past . 
i think in view of what is happening to the mass transit systems around the world , we have heard a lot of hue and cry about helping to protect our mass transit systems in this country . 
and i think by making standard criminal penalties , we are going a step in the right direction to use these penalties as a deterrence to terrorism on our mass transit and rail systems . 
mr. speaker , i rise today in support of the rule and the underlying patriot act reauthorization . 
the attacks on the rail systems in madrid and in the london underground have demonstrated the real threat that rail and mass transportation systems face . 
also i want to commend the conferees for including anti-meth legislation in the conference report . 
methamphetamine is a large and growing problem in rural america . 
in west virginia , meth labs have been found in neighborhoods , endangering children and innocent members of the community . 
provisions of this bill enhance penalties for those who run meth labs in the presence of children . 
provisions in this bill require that meth precursors be sold from behind the counter or from a locked cabinet and place better controls on mail order and internet sales . 
authorization in this legislation will ensure that the meth hot spots grant program will continue . 
this program has already provided assistance to local law enforcement in many districts , including the metro drug task force in my hometown of charleston , west virginia . 
mr. chairman , i rise in support of h.r. 3199 , the usa patriot and terrorism prevention reauthorization act of 2005 . 
congress passed the patriot act in october 2001 -- which i supported -- recognizing that it needed to give law enforcement the proper tools to effectively combat new terrorist threats . 
the law took account of new changes in technology that are used by terrorists , such as cell phones , the internet , and encryption technologies . 
congress did not grant all of the authority the president sought in the first patriot act , and sunsetted much of the act 's authority in 2005 . 
the sunset provisions require congressional oversight because congress must take an affirmative action to keep these provisions in effect . 
i support additional sunsets for other provisions in this legislation such as the `` sneak and peek '' provision which allows delayed notification for search warrants -- and i am hopeful that the house will ultimately adopt the additional sunsets approved by the senate judiciary committee when this bill returns from conference committee . 
i am disappointed that the house leadership did not make in order amendments that would have : exempted library and bookstore records from foreign intelligence surveillance act ( fisa ) searches ; reformed the roving wiretap authority in fisa cases to contain the same privacy safeguards as roving wiretaps in criminal cases ; established the traditional fisa standards for search warrants ; required individual suspicion for records orders ; allowed citizens to challenge secrecy orders in records requests ; and extended the sunset clauses for numerous other provisions of the patriot act . 
i voted in favor of a number of bipartisan amendments to limit the justice department 's power and increase congressional and judicial oversight of the executive branch , including : requiring the fbi director to personally approve searches of library or bookstore records ; additional reporting to courts by law enforcement when they change surveillance locations under a `` roving wiretap '' ; allowing recipients of national security letters to consult with an attorney and challenge the letters in court ; and increasing reporting requirements and making it more difficult to obtain `` sneak and peak '' search warrants , which entail secret searches of homes and offices with delayed notice . 
we must not repeat the mistakes of the past , when the united states sacrificed the civil rights of particular individuals or groups in the name of security . 
whether in times of war or peace , finding the proper balance between government power and the rights of the american people is a delicate and extremely important process . 
it is a task that rightly calls into play the checks and balances that the founders created in our system of government . 
all three branches of government have their proper roles to play in making sure the line is drawn appropriately , as we upheld our oaths to support the constitution . 
madam speaker , i rise in support of the conference report for h.r. 3199 , the usa patriot and terrorism prevention reauthorization act of 2005 . 
through the patriot act congress has attempted the essential task of modernizing law enforcement tools to effectively combat the 21st century terrorist , who can now use cell phones , the internet , and e-mails to plan and coordinate attacks in the united states . 
as originally enacted in october 2001 , many patriot act provisions are set to expire at the end of this month if congress takes no action . 
it is a substantial improvement to the bill that was passed by the house in july 2005 . 
given the complexity and importance of this measure , let me review these provisions in some detail . 
congress must revisit these provisions in 4 years , which will expire unless approved again . 
under the business records provision , section 215 of the patriot act , the bill provides that the government may seek a court order for `` any tangible item '' if law enforcement officials assert that the records are sought in an effort to obtain foreign intelligence or in a terrorism investigation . 
the conference report also explicitly provides -- unlike current law -- that anyone who receives a request for records under this provision may consult with an attorney in order to challenge the request in court . 
the bill has several new requirements for the justice department , including : issuing `` minimization procedures '' which limits the retention of , and prohibits dissemination of , information concerning u.s. persons ; conducting two separate audits of the fbi 's use of section 215 orders , which will examine any improper or illegal use of this authority , and the manner in which such information is collected , retained , analyzed , and disseminated by the fbi ; and requiring the public reporting of the aggregate use of section 215 orders , and a breakdown of its use to congress -- comparisons of library , medical , educational records , for example . 
the bill requires court orders for roving wiretaps to describe in detail the specific target in cases in which the target 's identity is unknown , higher burden than current law , and requires more detailed and timely reporting by the fbi to the courts and congress on the use of this authority . 
the conference report also makes substantial improvements to the national security letter , nsl , process , which existed before congress enacted the patriot act in 2001 . 
the bill explicitly provides a new right to nsl recipients to consult with an attorney to challenge the letter in court . 
the bill provides that courts may block an nsl if it is `` unreasonable , oppressive , or otherwise unlawful '' ( same standard as used to modify or quash a subpoena in a criminal case ) . 
recipients are also given a new right to challenge the nondisclosure requirement in court . 
madam speaker , we must not repeat the mistakes of the past , when the united states sacrificed the civil rights of particular individuals or groups in the name of security . 
whether in times of war or peace , finding the proper balance between government power and the rights of the american people is a delicate and extremely important process . 
it is a task that rightly calls into play the checks and balances that the founders created in our system of government . 
all three branches of government have their proper roles to play in making sure the line is drawn appropriately , as we uphold our oaths to support the constitution . 
i will continue to work in congress to exercise our critical oversight responsibilities to protect our civil liberties . 
mr. chairman , i rise in support of my amendment , the terrorist death penalty enhancement act . 
this measure is a much needed reform for our federal criminal statutes to ensure that the death penalty is available to deter and punish the most heinous crime in our country . 
we must remain vigilant and united in sending out one clear message to the terrorists ; if you attack our country or threaten our national security and we apprehend you , we will seek the ultimate penalty , the death penalty , against you . 
as a former state district judge for over 20 years i have presided over five capital murder cases , three of which resulted in the death penalty . 
we must protect our neighborhoods from the threat of violent crimes which , unfortunately , in today 's world , includes the threat of terrorist attacks . 
in my experience as a judge , i have witnessed the death penalty used as an important tool in deterring crime and saving lives . 
i believe it is also an instrument that can deter acts of terrorism and serves as a tool for prosecutors in negotiating sentences . 
first , my amendment adds a new criminal provision to impose the death penalty to any terrorist who , while committing a terrorist offense , engages in conduct that results in the death of an individual . 
third , my amendment treats terrorist offenses similar to treason and espionage cases so that the government need only prove that such offense created a grave risk of death and did not actually result in the death of a person . 
for example , consider a terrorist attack as we saw today in london , where a terrorist is carrying a deadly weapon , could be a radiological weapon or device , and prior to the total detonation of that bomb killing innocent civilians , he is caught by the authorities and they prevent that attack . 
in addition to these commonsense reforms , my amendment also authorizes the death penalty for killing that results from participation in nuclear weapons and weapons of mass destruction threats against the united states , missile systems to destroy aircraft , atomic weapons under the atomic energy act . 
first , my amendment adds a new statutory aggravating factor for obstruction of justice and in particular the killing of any person which is aimed at obstructing any investigation or prosecution . 
mr. chairman , i would remind my colleague from virginia that a legislative hearing was held before the subcommittee on june 30 , 2005 on which the justice department testified in favor of this bill . 
when i decided to run for congress , it was in response to the 9/11 attack after serving for a long time on the judiciary . 
i am sponsoring this legislation today because in my experience the death penalty does deter crimes , and it is my hope and my prayer that this tool given to our prosecutors and given to our courts and to our engineers will enable us to better protect freedom and protect our citizens from this disaster that lurks in the shadows along with these terrorists that attack our nation . 
madam speaker , as an original cosponsor of h.r. 3899 , the combat methamphetamine epidemic act , and as a committed member of the congressional caucus to fight and control methamphetamine , i rise in support of its passage , as title vii in h.r. 3199 , the usa patriot improvement and reauthorization act of 2005 . 
i would like to thank congressman mark souder , the chief sponsor of h.r. 3889 , for his leadership in addressing our methamphetamine epidemic . 
last year , congressman souder visited my district in order to fully understand first-hand the unique challenges we in hawaii face , to hear of our efforts to keep drugs out of our homes and communities , and to see our successes in our fight against the scourge of crystal methamphetamine , ice . 
we in hawaii share many of the same concerns as others in our nation in regard to the need to support drug control , education , prevention , and treatment efforts . 
to target what is needed to prevent this abuse now and in the future , we must first understand what causes it and then focus our efforts on overcoming those causes . 
title vii of h.r. 3199 is essential in our efforts to address methamphetamine trafficking , both in the united states and abroad . 
i look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle on initiatives to provide the federal resources and support we need in our fight against methamphetamine . 
madam speaker , today i rise in support of this conference report . 
and as a conferee , i want to specially thank chairman sensenbrenner for his leadership in negotiating the final details of this very important legislation . 
over the past 4 years , the patriot act has proven to be an effective tool in helping to accomplish this goal . 
with this in mind , it is imperative that detecting and disrupting terrorist activity before it occurs remain a top priority . 
as chairman of the subcommittee on the constitution , we have held patriot act oversight hearings in my subcommittee , and we remain committed to monitoring the implementation of this legislation through aggressive oversight . 
i am pleased that another 4-year sunset of the more controversial provisions and several additional safeguards to further protect civil liberties were included in the conference report , and i thank chairman sensenbrenner for that . 
we must remain steadfast in our resolve to eradicate the plague of terrorism . 
over the past 3 years , the patriot act has played a key role in the prevention of terrorist attacks right here in the united states . 
the u.s. attorney for the northern district of indiana , joseph van bokkelen , explained , `` if an assistant u.s. attorney learned through the use of a grand jury that there was a planned terrorist attack in northern indiana , he or she could not share that information with the cia. '' the patriot act brought down the wall separating intelligence agencies from law enforcement and other entities charged with protecting the nation from terrorism . 
mr. chairman , i urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the reauthorization of the patriot act and to give our government the tools it needs to succeed in the war on terrorism . 
now , this is one dozen public hearings , mr. speaker , where the patriot act was the beneficiary or the target of an exhaustive , deliberate examination , in detail . 
one of those reasons , mr. speaker , in my opinion , is the presence of the patriot act . 
we , in fact , hosted 12 public hearings ; three before the full committee , nine before our subcommittee . 
he said he had heard it was bad , but he could give me no specifics where in any way civil liberties had been compromised or abused . 
there has been some talk about sunsetting provisions of the act ; 216 and 206 will , in fact , be sunsetted . 
but in these two instances , mr. chairman , there was no evidence of abuse or any violation at all , but these two were sunsetted because , among the other sections in the act , these two seemed to attract most of the controversy . 
i think we in the committee on the judiciary have done a thorough job of exhausting and deliberating a very , very important act , and i believe that one reason why we have not been attacked subsequently from 9/11 is because of the presence of the patriot act . 
mr. chairman , i rise in support of the amendment to reduce crime and terrorism at america 's seaports . 
oppose the coble amendment. '' well , oftentimes in this body , mr. chairman , we engage in semantical wars , and i disagree with the choice of these words ; but in any event , we have resolved the differences . 
why should this provision be included in the patriot act , one may ask ? 
the criminals purchase cigarettes in a state with a low excise tax and then transport them to a high-tax state to sell . 
in 2003 , a group of hezbollah operatives were convicted of buying cigarettes in my home state of north carolina and selling them in michigan . 
it would apply the ccta to smokeless tobacco as well , and impose reporting requirements on those engaging in delivery sales of more than 10 , 000 cigarettes , or 500 cans of packages of smokeless tobacco within a period of 1 month . 
we must do everything we can to choke off this source of funding for criminal organizations which , in turn , subsidize terrorist organizations ; and i urge adoption of the amendment . 
mr. chairman , i will just say that i look forward to working with the chairman of the full committee and the ranking member , as well as the ranking member of the subcommittee to resolve any other issues that may remain in conference . 
finally , mr. speaker , i am going to touch on a point that i think many americans have inadvertently ignored , and that is the fact that there are in excess of 360 ports in the united states and this bill provides basic and much-needed protection thereto . 
mr. speaker , today , i rise in protest of rules committee 's refusal to make the sanders library amendment in order . 
clearly , in the wake of the september 11 attacks , many innocent people are checking out books on osama bin laden . 
in light of today 's bombing incident in london , it is all the more objectionable that the majority would foreclose critical amendments for the patriot act reauthorization on the floor . 
i also know that all of us want to make sure that we protect our civil liberties and freedoms as we fight terrorists anywhere in the world and in this country as well . 
in fact , in the first original patriot act , i helped write many of them in a version of the bill that passed the committee on the judiciary 36-0 , but a bill we never saw after it left the committee on the judiciary . 
it was replaced in the middle of the night in the committee on rules . 
in some sense this is not really about the patriot act , the debate that is going on here , or even most of the 16 provisions scheduled to sunset this year . 
it was not in the bill originally reported by the committee on the judiciary and was slipped in by the department of justice or the administration when the bill was first written a few years back . 
finally , it is clear to me that we need to have additional sunsets in this legislation . 
that is why we are here , because the bill is being sunsetted in more than a dozen ways . 
the lessons of september 11 and london , and even today in london , are that if we allow law enforcement to do their work free of political interference , give them adequate resources and modern technologies , we can protect our citizens without intruding on our liberties . 
we all fight terrorism , but we need to fight it the right way consistent with our constitution and in a manner that serves as a model for the rest of the world . 
abuse in the brandon mayfield case : the fbi used section 218 to secretly break into his house , download the contents of four computer drives , take dna evidence and take 355 digital photographs . 
though the fbi admits mr. mayfield is innocent , they still will not divulge the secret court order to him , or allow him to defend himself in court . 
in each instance , the courts found completely legal activities would violate section 805 . 
abuse in lynne stewart case : a district court threw out charges of materials support against lynne stewart , holding that the law makes any action by a lawyer in support of an alleged foreign terrorist client illegal , including providing legal advice . 
abuse in sami al-hussayen case : a federal jury in idaho acquitted university of idaho graduate student al-hussayen on all charges of providing material support for a terrorist organization by running a website for the islamic assembly of north america . 
section 213 , `` sneak and peek '' searches in a july 5 , 2005 letter to rep . 
thus , almost 90 % of `` sneak and peek '' warrants were used in ordinary criminal investigations : 97 warrants were used in drug investigations and 38 were used in other criminal investigations . 
abuse of delays : in april 2005 , doj said 90-day delays are common , and that delays in notification have lasted for as long as 180 days . 
in may 2003 , doj said its longest delay was 90 days . 
in one such case , the delay lasted 406 days . 
abuse of delay extensions : in may 2003 , doj reported it had asked for 248 delay notification extensions , including multiple extension requests for a single warrant , and that the courts had granted every single request . 
abuse of `` catch-all provision '' : in an april 4 , 2005 letter to chairman sensenbrenner , doj reports 92 out of 108 ( 85 % ) sneak and peek warrants were justified because notification would `` seriously jeopardize the investigation '' and in 28 instances that was the sole ground for delaying notice . 
abuse in tariq ramadan case : professor ramadan 's visa to teach at notre dame was revoked upon charges that he supported terrorism ; notre dame , scotland yard , and swiss intelligence all agree the charges were groundless . 
abuse in dora maria tellez case : nicaraguan professor tellez was denied her visa to teach at harvard due to her association with the sandinistas in the 1980s , where she helped to overthrow a brutal dictator whom the u.s. supported . 
i was wondering if this was sent over to the chairman of the committee at some earlier point in time . 
normally i thought it was the jurisdiction of the subcommittee on criminal justice in the committee on the judiciary of the house that would be considering this matter . 
the amendment allows the recipient to challenge the letter in court , but it can be quashed only if compliance would be unreasonable or oppressive to the recipient ? 
but does the gentleman know there are new criminal penalties in this part of 505 now added as a result of this amendment ? 
what we found out in our examination , the staff examination , is that 90 percent of the uses of the sneak-and-peak authority have been for nonterrorism cases . 
it seems to me that this amendment goes along in that same direction . 
as initially drafted , the amendment by mr. coble could have had the unintended effect of targeting tribal governments who are legitimately involved in the retailing of tobacco products . 
specifically , a provision stipulating that enforcement against tribes or in indian country , as defined in title 18 section 1151 , will not be authorized by the pending bill has been incorporated . 
i realize that there are other sections that may need to be fixed as well because there has not been much time to refine the entirety of the coble provision and that further refinements may be in order once we get to conference with the senate on this provision . 
i understand that the rule of law of enforcement in indian country will fall to tribal governments and the federal government will be protected through further amendment and i pledge to work in conference to ensure the rights of tribal governments are fully protected . 
madam speaker , if only what my good friend , the chairman , said was accurate , we would not be here to ask that this measure be turned down and that we pass a 3-month extension , as i have proposed and is in legislative form , so that the patriot act and intelligence reform would not be stymied . 
so , madam speaker , there are two pictures of what happened in the committee on the judiciary . 
one is that the bill was made clearly worse , and we have some 92 pages of dissent about the bill itself , and much of it is still of course valid in terms of the conference report that we are examining today . 
may i bring to the attention of the chairman of the judiciary committee that section 505 of the patriot act expanded the use of national security letters , so to say they are not in the bill would not be accurate . 
that was an abuse that we heard in the committee . 
congress must engage in vigilant oversight of the patriot act , national security letters , and other authorities granted to law enforcement and intelligence agencies . 
`` the report also leaves in place the usa patriot act standards for national security letters '' and would `` allow the fbi to continue its unfettered reach into the personal electronic records of the public , including records of their use of the internet through computers in libraries . 
with the death penalties arbitrarily added , it is a definite reversal , a downward , backward movement in which the patriot act becomes meaner and less democratic and is far more dangerous for people who get caught up in these things who are innocent americans . 
please join us in sending this bill back to committee and supporting my measure that would allow for a 3-month period of time for us to improve the bill . 
what happens in the report is it makes it easier to get library and other records under section 215 by creating a presumption that records of anyone to come into contact with a suspected terrorist even accidentally , innocently , is relevant to an investigation . 
at the close of this debate , i will offer a motion to recommit the conference report with instructions to recede to the senate bill in its entirety . 
it does not have a lot of christmas tree in it . 
the chairman repeatedly admonished committee democrats that we were not permitted to consider matters falling outside of the 16 expiring provisions of the patriot act , but on the floor and in conference , this bill became a christmas tree for random drug laws , presidential succession amendments and federal employee benefit changes . 
the patriot act does not need to expire if this bill fails in the house or the senate , which it should . 
sunsets were a small step in the right direction but do not address the underlying problems . 
sunsets will be of no relief to those who will have their constitutional rights violated in the next 4 years and should prevent no one from voting against this bill and in favor of the motion . 
in fact , not a single democrat in the house or in the other body would sign it . 
we should not let in the government sneak-and-peek provision for at least 30 days . 
the senate sticks to the real issues , so join me in a motion to recommit the conference report with instructions to recede to the senate bill in its entirety . 
yes , i am , in its present form . 
mr. chairman , i rise in opposition to this bill , the usa patriot and intelligence reform reauthorization act of 2005 , h.r. 3199 . 
mr. chairman , after the tragic events of september 11 , every american knows , in every nuance of the truism , that freedom is not free . 
i firmly believe that in order to have security in our homeland we must have a reasonable expectation of infringement of some of our civil liberties . 
however , this bill crosses the reasonableness threshold by abrogating rights guaranteed under the constitution without a corresponding increase in the real tools law enforcement needs to fight the war on terrorism . 
i believe that we should focus on securing our homeland , not by infringing on civil liberties as outlined in the patriot act -- but , by securing our rail and transit systems , by securing our ports and waterways systems , by securing our airspace , and by refining our intelligence organizations for maximum outcomes , just to name a few . 
later , the engineer ( whom i 'll call `` mr. l '' ) was told that a former police officer had seen a group of people who `` looked middle eastern '' driving around an airport and `` acting suspicious. '' fortunately , mr. l had proof that he was nowhere near the airport during the time in question . 
yet , mr. l. remains convinced that his professional reputation has been seriously damaged , and in all likelihood , he is correct . 
as the dissenting views to accompany h.r. 1399 reports , and i paraphrase , `` there are numerous provisions in both the expiring and other sections of the usa patriot act that have little to do with combating terrorism , that intrude on our privacy and civil liberties and that have been repeatedly abused and misused by both the justice department and the administration. '' these include , but are not limited to , the inadequate judicial oversight permitted by this bill and the roving wiretaps targeting innocent americans -- americans not involved in terrorism in any way . 
instead of thoughtfully considering the tough questions like : how much governmental power is truly required to protect us and what constitutional freedoms are we going to leave in place for our children and generations yet to be born , we consider a partisan bill of which the minority members inform they never received the facts necessary to fully evaluate . 
in addition , h.r. 1526 would re-define the new crime of `` domestic terrorism '' in far more narrow terms , making it clear that our traditional freedom to assemble and challenge governmental action must not be chilled . 
i do not think there is anybody in this body on either side of this issue that does not have concerns . 
i would like to see , in particular , a sunset provision , although i do not know what the timing should be . 
it also tells us the united states is behind in its security for our mass rail and bus transportation systems , not just aviation but those as well . 
let me cite an example of what happened before 9/11 and how the patriot act , in my opinion , would have stopped an event , not just may have . 
they were outspoken in support of osama bin laden before 9/11 , and they were outspoken about their ethnic intolerance and raising money for al qaeda . 
their primary issue at the time was getting out two agents in a foreign country that were under extreme conditions . 
the fbi and the cia were limited in their ability to check out this group . 
mr. chairman , this particular group was the group that was training in arizona , the pilots and the crews that flew into new york city , that flew into the pentagon , and that crashed in pennsylvania . 
mr. chairman , as we learned here on 9/11 and in london today and on 7/7 , we must crack down on terrorism , and we must ensure that law enforcement officials have the tools they need to assess , detect and prevent future terrorist attacks . 
however , i do n't believe we have to shred the constitution and bill of rights in order to fight terrorism . 
we must be vigilant that the rights and liberties we are fighting to protect are not jeopardized in the name of the war against terrorism . 
regrettably , h.r. 3199 , the usa patriot act and terrorism prevention reauthorization act , does not provide adequate protections for the civil liberties of law abiding citizens and i must rise in opposition to the bill . 
when the house considered the original usa patriot act in 2001 , i expressed concerns with the bill both for substantive and procedural reasons . 
with that said , i support a number of provisions in h.r. 3199 . 
however , as i mentioned earlier , i also have very serious concerns with a number of other provisions in the bill . 
many of the provisions in the bill that expand law enforcement authority to conduct domestic intelligence gathering , either do not require judicial review , or require that law enforcement only assert relevance to an investigation , rather than show probable cause that the information is relevant to a terrorist investigation . 
these expanded powers go a long way toward tearing down protections that were put in place in the post-watergate era when we learned of presidential abuses of domestic intelligence-gathering against individuals because of political affiliation or citizen activism . 
according to the department of justice , this new power has been used hundreds of times since the usa patriot act was signed into law i am also concerned that the bill extends the government 's so-called `` sneak and peek '' authority which allows the government to conduct secret searches and seizure of property without notice , in violation of the 4th amendment . 
this authority has also been used hundreds of times since enactment of the usa patriot act , including against brandon mayfield in portland who was suspected of being involved in the madrid bombings . 
i would like to be able to support this bill , and as i said earlier , i support a number of provisions in the bill . 
listeners should realize that truth is not required in debate on the floor of the house . 
we heard that when we passed the first patriot act , which no member of the house of representatives had read , at 10 o'clock in the morning with one copy available on each side of the aisle . 
in the past , that would have to be discarded . 
i guess there is one person in america who might not be able to tap into this databank . 
this is going to create such a huge haystack of irrelevant information about the lives of innocent americans that the fbi , who had one terrorist in hand , musawi , and had an agent in arizona pointing at the plot , could not even see their hand in front of their face . 
now we are going to create a huge mountain of irrelevant data about innocent people and this is somehow going to improve how they perform in finding terrorists in america ? 
then the most cynical thing about this bill is to take a meritorious bill that deals with methamphetamine precursors and trafficking , that passed separately in this house of representatives , which i supported , and they are going to include it as part of this legislation in a cynical ploy to somehow basically force , bully , or trick people into supporting the underlying legislation with its unwarranted attack on the bill of rights , the constitution of america , the foundation of our government , the gathering secretly of information about innocent americans , and the permanent retention of that information for no good purpose . 
had i been present and voting , i would have voted `` no '' on this bill as i have steadfastly opposed similar versions of the patriot act when they have come up in the past . 
i voted against the original patriot act when it passed congress in 2001 because it went too far in creating the potential for government abuses and violations of civil liberties . 
the bill today makes permanent almost all of the provisions enacted in 2001 . 
the bill today maintains the weak threshold adopted in the original patriot act by again failing to require the materials requested be tied or connected to a specific terrorist or terrorist organization . 
the broad standard in current law makes it dangerously easy for the records of innocent americans to be viewed by government . 
additionally , recipients of requests for information under section 215 are prevented from telling virtually anyone about the request and they can not challenge this `` gag order '' in court . 
while the bill today does change the delay in notice allowed from a `` reasonable time '' to no more than 30 days , the bill allows for unlimited extensions . 
limitations on instances in which delayed notice searches are allowed to remain broad . 
it is my understanding that this morning in the senate committee on the judiciary , there were a number of sunsets on various provisions that were approved , and they were full-year sunsets . 
i dare say , if various amendments relative to sunsets had been allowed and made in order , this debate could have been cut in half in terms of the time . 
i would further suggest that in terms of if there is no concern about libraries , if it is a red herring , why does the first amendment that we will consider that was made in order have to do with the issue ? 
mr. chairman , i just want to make the simple point that the amendment that was offered that was not made in order by myself , the gentlewoman from california ( ms. harman ) xz4001660 , and the gentleman from california ( mr. berman ) xz4000250 would not have allowed , under any circumstances , a safe haven anywhere for terrorists . 
the chairman has been most aggressive when it comes to oversight , and i want to publicly commend him , not just in terms of the patriot act , but many other issues that are within the jurisdiction of the judiciary committee . 
i have served on an invitation basis under chairman dan burton investigating the misconduct of the fbi in the boston office , and again , it required the threat of a contempt petition to gain information from the department of justice . 
so that is why all of the discussions today about oversight are framed in that context . 
as it was indicated , under the patriot act the fbi can merely assert at this point in time that records are relevant to an intelligence investigation . 
in addition , it added a permanent nondisclosure requirement which , if violated , imposed severe sanctions on the recipient of the so-called national security letter . 
this was truly a profound expansion of government power where the subject of the order need not be suspected of any involvement in terrorism whatsoever , where there was no judicial review , where there was no statutory right to challenge , and where the order gags the recipient from telling anyone about it . 
a federal district court in new york has already ruled that the national security letters for communication records , as amended by the patriot act , are unconstitutional because they are coercive and violate the fourth amendment prohibition against unreasonable searches and the first amendment as a result of the gag order . 
this amendment , i would submit , attempts to salvage the use of national security letters in intelligence investigations so as to comply with constitutional standards . 
it gives the recipient of a national security letter his day in court . 
since such actions are usually undertaken to influence government policy , another of the elements that go into the definition of domestic terrorism , such activities could be treated in such a way as to have severe unintended consequences , particularly with regard to the government seizure of property and/or assets . 
i would conclude by reminding my colleagues on the committee on the judiciary that this amendment is drawn from the version of the patriot act that was unanimously approved by the committee on the judiciary in october of 2001 , and i urge its passage . 
i thank the chairman for his support , and i thank the gentleman from arizona in helping draft this particular amendment , and i particularly appreciate the example that he enumerated . 
it is trying to find out what is happening in the federal government today , and we do not know . 
and like any bill quickly passed into law , particularly one this expansive , the patriot act has worked well in some respects , but less so in others , and in some cases , with unintended consequences . 
and , in the case of the so-called `` sneak and peek '' provision , we are actually making matters worse . 
and while this provision will be revisited again in 10 years , almost all the others are made permanent -- access to e-mail and internet records , wiretap authority , the disclosure of internet records in emergencies , the use of search warrants to seize voice mail . 
by insisting 14 of the 16 expiring provisions in this bill be made permanent , we are essentially abdicating our responsibility as members of congress to make sure we strike the right balance of giving law enforcement the tools they need to catch terrorists while still upholding the basic rights to which every american is entitled . 
mr. chairman , i rise in strong support of the reauthorization and extension of the usa patriot act , the provisions of which have protected the american people and our soil from terrorism since their enactment 4 years ago . 
five terrorist cells in buffalo , detroit , seattle , portland , and northern virginia have been disbanded . 
loopholes have been closed , safe-havens have been shut , and the war in being won . 
that 's why we 've subjected it to such vigorous scrutiny : six inspector general reports ; 12 committee hearings , just since this april ; 41 witnesses , 15 of whom were called by the democrats ; 43 proposed amendments in committee , 8 of which were approved . 
the american people have had ample opportunity to witness the patriot act in action , and in the 4 years since its passage , our nation has been safer , our civil liberties more secure than ever , and our enemies have been hunted , caught , and prosecuted . 
mr. chairman , i rise in strong opposition to h.r. 3199 . 
substituted in the dark of night , the administration 's bill was inserted as the final bill and became law with very little congressional deliberation or consideration . 
we are considering making 14 of the 16 provisions in the patriot act permanent , and making the other 2 provisions semi-permanent . 
we must remain vigilant against terrorism , but we must also remain vigilant against abuses of power that curtail americans ' civil liberties in a time of war . 
what will generations to come think when they have seen we have permanently lowered the bar in protecting their civil liberties ? 
madam speaker , i rise in strong opposition to the conference report to h.r. 3199 . 
madam speaker , many objectionable provisions remain in this conference report , but two issues in particular were ignored by the majority . 
yet , this conference report provides little to no mechanism to allow for a citizen to challenge these letters in court , and sets no deadline for destroying the private information that has been collected . 
as i , along with several of my colleagues , said in a letter to chairman sensenbrenner and chairman specter , there is nothing in this standard to stop the fbi from asking a library to turn over its circulation list of everyone who had checked out a book on islam since the september 11th attacks . 
shame on us for allowing this to remain in the final conference report . 
as i asked in june of this year , and as i ask again now , `` what will generations to come think when they have seen we have permanently lowered the bar in protecting their civil liberties ? 
mr. chairman , i rise in support of the amendment , but i do not believe it is a good enough cure to make this sick legislation well . 
i believe that most of what america needs to know about the patriot act is reflected in its deceptive title . 
the american patriots who declared our independence in 1776 were true patriots who risked their lives in order to secure our liberties . 
we must not sacrifice our democracy in a misguided attempt to save it . 
this bill , i believe , is a step in the wrong direction , a step in the direction of suppressing our freedoms . 
i believe that it is very important that we patriotically preserve our liberties and freedoms as americans by rejecting the measure in its current form . 
from its origin , this grossly misnamed patriot act has cloaked its weaknesses by implying that its opponents are `` un-patriots '' as in `` unpatriotic. '' this is all part of a troubling pattern : secret prisons , sneak and peek searches , gag orders , redefining torture to exclude cruel and degrading punishment , extraordinary rendition , combing through library records , and even attempting to misuse our military to spy on religious groups . 
yes , vice president cheney has suddenly emerged from his secure , undisclosed location and taken pause from his campaign to preserve torture in order to enthusiastically embrace today 's bill . 
but intrusive , invasive powers in the hands of a few with little oversight and no accountability is a formula for wrongdoing . 
we should not add even more powers to an administration that has so often been willing to abuse its existing power , nor should we add more authority to an administration that has acted in authoritarian ways . 
it is conceived in small injustices , which tolerated over time become irreversible . 
mr. speaker , i rise in strong support of this rule and the underlying legislation , the usa patriot act . 
we obviously are at a critical juncture in our nation 's history . 
obviously , what happened 2 weeks ago today in london made a big change for them and what is going on at this moment in london brought about a big change for them . 
we have made a commitment that , because of the fact that we are in the midst of a global war on terror , we need to do everything within our power to redouble our efforts to ensure that we win that global war on terror . 
in fact , i remember going at it with our former colleague , now the director of central intelligence , porter goss . 
but we have to realize that if we are going to deal with this challenge , uncertainty is something that people in law enforcement can not live with . 
we had 47 amendments that were submitted to us in the committee on rules , and i am very proud of the fact that we were able to work with our colleagues addressing concerns that they raised . 
i know there was concern that was raised last night in the committee on rules on the so-called `` lone wolf amendment '' that was addressed , a desire to have it sunsetted by the gentleman from florida ( mr. hastings ) xz4001702 . 
but now having looked at this rule with 47 amendments , nearly half of the amendments that were submitted to us , 11 of the amendments that are made in order under this rule are either amendments offered by democrats or offered by democrats and republicans , bipartisan amendments , and 10 of the amendments that are made in order are offered by republicans . 
when this issue came to the forefront just a few weeks after september 11 , 2001 , the now director of the central intelligence agency , former chairman of the house intelligence committee and vice chairman of the rules committee , our very good friend , mr. goss , argued that he believed we should begin with permanence at that point , and i argued then that i thought it important that we focus on sunsetting provisions in the usa patriot act . 
and there has not been one instance , not one complaint has been leveled , against the provisions in the usa patriot act as evidence of violating civil liberties . 
i want to do everything in my power to ensure that we recognize the rights of our individuals . 
these measures that are in there are designed to force us to look at them again . 
every single american who travels today has made a sacrifice , because of the fact that we are in the midst of a global war on terror , by virtue of going through the security to get on an airplane . 
professor harvey mansfield of harvard wrote about the need to make those sacrifices when we are in the midst of war . 
mr. chairman , i voted for the first patriot act , and i strongly supported the creation of the homeland security department and have voted for every large increase in intelligence , homeland security funding , and defense funding . 
one of the most prudent things , in my view , that congress did in passing the original patriot act was to sunset certain provisions , thus ensuring that a future congress would review and revise them and have a very healthy and sobering debate . 
and so this debate , not allowing the sunsets in the future , i think is very , very important to bring up today . 
the bill does not sufficiently address the issues in section 206 which deal with the roving john doe wiretaps . 
under the patriot act , the fbi can obtain a warrant and intelligence investigations without identifying the person or the phone in question . 
i offered an amendment in the intelligence committee to modify section 215 of the patriot act to prohibit the fbi from using this section to obtain library circulation records , library patron lists , book sales records , or book customer lists , but the amendment was not allowed by the rules committee . 
in conclusion , the american people love and cherish their liberties , and they want and deserve to be safe . 
madam speaker , i rise in opposition to this conference report . 
these requests commonly referred to as national security letters or nsls are issued directly by the government agencies in national security investigations without the approval of a judge . 
the lowering of this standard has resulted in an all time high in the number of nsls issued . 
mr. chairman , i rise in strong opposition to the patriot and terrorism prevention reauthorization bill . 
this bill tramples on the bill of rights in the name of patriotism . 
as thomas paine once said , `` it is the duty of the patriot to protect his country from his government. '' we are all patriots today in the finest sense of the word , but just because some of us want to ensure that congress retains its legislative oversight over these draconian provisions , some will call us unpatriotic . 
while not one of us in the chamber takes lightly our oath to protect and defend the united states , the permanent extension of the patriot act , as the expense of our civil liberties , will not in and of itself make our country safer . 
i voted against the original patriot act that was hastily passed in october 2001 . 
in this case , they are trying to convince the american people that giving up their civil liberties is necessary to combat terrorism . 
in my district , the local governments of pacific grove , salinas , santa cruz , and watsonville , california have all passed resolutions expressing their concerns with the anti-privacy and anti-liberty portions of the patriot act . 
madam speaker , i rise in strong opposition to the patriot act conference report . 
due to concerns about civil liberties infringement , i voted against the original patriot act in 2001 and the house patriot act reauthorization bill earlier this summer . 
in 1775 , one of our nation 's true patriots , benjamin franklin , said `` they that can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety. '' this legislation tramples on the essential liberties that our founding fathers wanted to ensure . 
i believe that the founders of this country would be rolling in their graves to hear the claims this administration and republican leadership make in the name of safety from terrorists . 
do you really feel safer that your library records can be considered intelligence in an investigative report ? 
madam speaker , i urge a `` no '' vote on this piece of legislation that flies in the face of our forefathers . 
i will tell my colleagues that over the last 8 months , we have had between 12 and 13 hearings in the committee on the judiciary and some 35 witnesses over an extended period of time ; and 50 members of the committee on the judiciary have had a chance to not just question those witnesses , but to go back in the secure intelligence records , which i have done , and review all the fisa reports and the other information that is very sensitive and an important part of our oversight . 
we watch and pray for our friends in britain as we do this , but we do it only after serious and thoughtful consideration . 
mr. chairman , i note that since the 9/11 attacks , in part we all know due to the patriot act , there have been no new attacks on america . 
i also think americans ought to know there is a bookstore in london , in the leeds section , called the iqra bookstore ; and among the books that iqra learning center sells are extremist muslim materials . 
this can only affect non-americans in the first place , or americans would only be affected if there is an ongoing terrorism or intelligence investigation . 
to the extent that we want to create safe harbors , either in bookstores or libraries or anywhere else by eliminating 215 , we ought to be candid with americans . 
we have had a series of 12 hearings over the past year , and we had a markup that went over 12 hours in which we considered more than 50 amendments , i believe , there . 
i was successful , with a few of my democrat colleagues , in attaching a few amendments at that time . 
i in fact voted for his amendment on the floor the other day with regard to 215 and library and bookstore searches and sales . 
i believe that we have addressed it sufficiently in this bill in the amendments that will be offered . 
we also have another amendment to 215 we did in committee that clarifies it to make sure you can consult your lawyer , not just to respond to the order , but to challenge it as well . 
this amendment compliments other amendments i have offered in the committee on the judiciary , two of which were accepted by the chairman and the committee . 
the other had to do with another section in committee . 
libraries are not even mentioned in it . 
i just wanted to say that the gentleman from indiana ( mr. pence ) xz4003150 brought up the point that the buck stops here , and that is what we are really trying to do with the fbi director , to ensure that that person is in charge and there is less likely to be a fishing expedition by a lower-ranking official . 
when you combine that with what we already have in law , which is a requirement that the fbi director report to congress every 6 months about the use of this statute , you really have a strong provision and strong protections . 
on each of these sections that we are dealing with , we heard excellent testimony from the administration , from other witnesses , from experts in the field ; and that is why these amendments have been crafted . 
i am persuaded that we have done well with this section , with section 215 , that we have put the protections that we need in place ; and i would urge my colleagues to support this amendment . 
first , this amendment specifies that the recipient of a national security letter may consult with an attorney and may also challenge national security letters in court . 
a judge may throw out the national security letter by request of the government `` if compliance would be unreasonable or oppressive to the recipient of the national security letter. '' the amendment also allows the recipient to challenge the nondisclosure requirement in the national security letter request . 
a judge could modify or remove the nondisclosure requirement of the national security letter `` if it finds that there is no reason to believe that disclosure may endanger the national security of the united states , interfere with criminal counterterrorism or counterintelligence investigation , interfere with diplomatic relations , or endanger the life or physical safety of any person. '' another important reform to this amendment is that it modifies the nondisclosure requirements so that recipients may tell individuals whom they work with about the national security letter request in order to comply with the national security request . 
mr. chairman , i would like to thank again the gentleman from wisconsin ( mr. sensenbrenner ) xz4003650 and his staff in helping to write and to work with me on this amendment . 
if it is relevant to an investigation , then it is in my view proper they should be able to compel records . 
mr. chairman , if the gentleman would continue to yield , we are offering in this amendment additional protections . 
we are ensuring that those who receive these letters , and we have in other amendments as well , have access to counsel , not only to respond to the inquiry , but also to challenge in court . 
mr. chairman , part of what we have done in this amendment is offer individuals the opportunity to challenge the scope of the request . 
i share many of his concerns about the overall patriot act , and we have worked to put many of the amendments in place to put ourselves at rest . 
i feel good about this amendment , about the protection we have offered here , and also to ensure that in cases where it is needed , we offer additional tools for compliance with these requests as well . 
mr. chairman , reclaiming my time , i just want to say in closing , this has been a collaborative process . 
in the committee , with regard to other bills that we have considered , one having to do with providing a death penalty for terrorist criminals , this issue came up as well . 
and nobody really believes that the death penalty would be imposed in that case ; however , the threat of something like that is out there , acts as a form of intimidation to people from engaging in lawful protest . 
so the overly broad definition does come up as a problem sometimes , and in this case it comes up as a problem when it has to do with seizure of assets . 
the aoc would also be required to indicate the cause of delay in each instance . 
this important information will help improve congress ' oversight role on delayed notification for so-called sneak-and-peak searches in the future by providing members with this information on an annual basis . 
but i should point out that in committee we considered another half-a-loaf amendment , if you will , to section 213 ; and that amendment by myself and the gentleman from new york ( mr. nadler ) xz4002890 clarified or , not clarified , but actually put in some false stops with regard to delayed notification searches where you have to appear before a judge after 80 days to justify delayed notifications . 
we have also had many other amendments in committee , and here on the floor , that could be considered half a loaf . 
with that , i think we got a pretty good product in the end , and that is what we are seeking to have here . 
mr. speaker , i am probably the last person expected to speak on behalf of the committee or the leadership in general . 
but let me tell you , i have watched the process here in the committee on the judiciary over the past couple of years on this issue . 
i have watched us hold hearing after hearing , 12 just in the last several months , 2 in the last congress , and i have watched us adopt amendment after amendment in committee . 
i was very supportive of the sunsets we had in the bill initially . 
sometimes , as my hero in politics said once , in one book , barry goldwater said , `` politics is nothing more than public business . 
this reform increases accountability in using nsls , and it clarifies that judicial review exists and challenges to both the nsl and the prohibition on disclosure are now allowed . 
in addition to these safeguards on nsl authorities , the reauthorization also will add significant safeguards in a number of other areas , as the chairman mentioned . 
madam speaker , these are reforms that are important , and i am happy to support it , and i hope that we will codify these in the bill . 
mr. chairman , i rise in strong support of the schiff-coble-forbes amendment to h.r. 3199 . 
the interagency commission on crime and security in u.s. seaports concluded in their report that significant criminal activity is taking place at most of the 12 seaports surveyed by the commission . 
this amendment says that there is no loophole or shortcoming in the law that you can hide behind that will allow you to harm our nation . 
further , it provides that in lieu of the amendments recommended by the committee on the judiciary and the permanent select committee on intelligence now printed in the bill , the amendment in the nature of a substitute printed in part a of the committee on rules report shall be considered as the original bill for the purpose of amendment and shall be considered as read . 
it waives all points of order against the amendment in the nature of a substitute printed in part a of the committee on rules report . 
it makes in order only those amendments printed in part b of the committee on rules report which may be offered only in the order printed in the report , may be offered only by a member designated in the report , shall be considered as read , shall be debatable for the time specified in the report equally divided and controlled by the proponent and an opponent , shall not be subject to amendment , and shall not be subject to a demand for division of the question in the house or in the committee of the whole . 
it waives all points of order against the amendments printed in part b of the committee on rules report , and it provides one motion to recommit with or without instructions . 
mr. speaker , i rise this somber day in support of both house resolution 369 and the underlying bill , h.r. 3199 , the usa patriot and terrorism prevention reauthorization act of 2005 . 
i remain confident in not only the resolve of the british government led by tony blair , but also the resolve of the british people to stand firm against these cowards . 
mr. speaker , like most legislation considered before this house , h.r. 3199 is not perfect ; and in an ideal world , it would not be necessary . 
however , today 's world is sadly far from ideal and america faces a grave threat from a cowardly enemy that operates under the cover of shadows biding its time with the intent to kill innocent people in the name of an ideology of hate . 
when congress first enacted the usa patriot act in 2001 , it did so of course in response to the attacks of 9/11 . 
congress included in this legislation many sunset provisions to ensure an opportunity to review and address the effectiveness of these additional law enforcement capabilities after their enactment . 
mr. speaker , i must also say that i have heard from many people back home in the 11th district of georgia who express some concerns about this legislation . 
with respect to the usa patriot act he wrote : `` from my perspective as a prosecutor on the front lines of the fight against terrorism , it is difficult to overstate how important the usa patriot act has been to the government 's ability to preserve and protect our nation 's liberty in the face of continuing terrorist threats. '' his deputy u.s. attorney is my good friend , jim martin . 
with over 25 years ' experience as a federal prosecutor , he also assured me in a private conversation of the success of and the need to preserve the patriot act . 
mr. nahmias goes on to write how the provisions from this act aided in recovering a 13-year-old girl who had been lured and held captive by a man she met online . 
mr. speaker , like many of my colleagues , including the distinguished chairman of the committee on the judiciary , i am also concerned and in all honesty extremely hesitant to grant additional powers to the government . 
however , i believe that we in this congress will continue to remain vigilant , continue to execute necessary and thorough oversight so that our constitutionally protected civil liberties will never be jeopardized or diminished in the fight to stop terrorism and to protect the american people . 
in reference to a comment made a little bit earlier , not by the previous speaker but by the distinguished minority whip concerning his concern over the fact that the sanders amendment was not made in order , i want to point out the bipartisan amendment by the gentleman from california ( mr. schiff ) xz4003610 and the gentleman from arizona ( mr. flake ) xz4001340 , that is amendment no . 
59 that was made in order and that will be debated later on this afternoon , stating that the director of the fbi must personally approve any library or bookstore request for records by the fbi under section 215 . 
mr. speaker , i am proud to yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from arizona ( mr. flake ) xz4001340 , who will speak about one of the bipartisan amendments made in order under this rule . 
i rise again in support of this rule and in recognition of the importance of the underlying bill . 
in 2001 , the house joined together in a bipartisan way to pass the usa patriot act with 357 for , 66 against . 
i rise today in support of house resolution 595 and the underlying conference report for h.r. 3199 , the usa patriot and terrorism prevention reauthorization act of 2005 . 
mr. speaker , i would first like to take this opportunity to thank chairmen sensenbrenner and king for all of their work in shepherding h.r. 3199 initially in the committee and then on the floor and now through the conference . 
this conference report demonstrates this congress 's commitment to find common ground in order to move solid and important legislation for the good and safety of the american people . 
and this congress has demonstrated and will continue to demonstrate a clear commitment to oversight in order to better achieve the essential and proper balance between necessary protective measures and our sacred civil liberties granted to us by the united states constitution . 
as i mentioned , when the house first considered this legislation back in july , mr. speaker , h.r. 3199 , like most legislation considered before this house , is not perfect . 
in an ideal world , it would not be necessary , but today 's world is sadly far from ideal . 
today , america faces a grave threat from enemies who cowardly operate in the darkness of shadows , waiting with the intent to kill innocent people in the name of their hateful ideology . 
in regard to section 215 , i want to remind the gentleman that section 215 , relating to investigators ' access to business records , this reauthorization requires a statement of fact showing reasonable grounds to believe that the records or other things sought are relevant to an authorized investigation to protect against international terrorism or espionage . 
mr. speaker , i would like to remind the gentleman that in the original bill that we considered , h.r. 3199 , which 43 of his colleagues supported , there were sunset provisions not in two , but in three , sections that were of 10 years ' duration . 
in their motion to instruct the conferees , the request was to abide by the senate bill , which would lower those to 4 years each . 
so that is exactly what we are bringing back in the conference report , exactly what they asked for . 
mr. speaker , i just want to remind my colleagues that prior to 9/11 and before the usa patriot act in 2001 , we had this culture and legal problem where law enforcement could not communicate whatsoever with intelligence . 
i think this is very important for all of us to keep in mind . 
madam speaker , i yield to myself 15 seconds and want to remind the gentlewoman from california that under this reauthorization , the usa patriot act , we are not utilizing powers that were not already granted to the federal government in regard to crime prevention and drug lords and organized crime . 
mr. chairman , i rise in support of the gentleman 's amendment . 
i do not believe it is controversial in the least , and i think we will see that when the votes are taken . 
we must not waver in our message to those who wish to threaten the values we hold dear . 
the gentleman from texas ( mr. carter ) xz4000680 described this amendment very well so i will not run through it in detail . 
anyone who is thwarted in their attempt to carry out an attack should not be spared the heaviest penalty just because they were caught before they could carry out their heinous intentions . 
mr. speaker , as many have said , we are all watching events unfold in london this morning , hoping that this is not another gruesome act of terrorism . 
if they can strike twice in the heart of london , a city on high alert , then just think what they might try to do in any city in america . 
most of the act is not objectionable , but it is far from perfect , and there are several key provisions that allow the government to engage in unnecessarily broad searches and surveillance of innocent americans . 
the permanent select committee on intelligence tried to mend it , but the committee on rules did not make any of our amendments in order . 
nine of us offered responsible , common-sense amendments : to establish the traditional fisa standard for search warrants and trap and trace/pen register authorities , to ensure that the government can not seize your personal records unless they are related to a foreign power ; to tighten the ability of the fbi to conduct roving wiretaps , to ensure that only terror suspects and their enablers , not innocent americans , are wiretapped ; to re-sunset the key provisions in the act in another 4 years to assure accountability and effective congressional oversight , and specifically to sunset the lone wolf provision , enacted only 8 months ago , in 2010 ; finally , to prohibit the fbi from using the broad fisa powers to get bookstore or library documentary records , a provision which passed this house last month on a strong bipartisan vote . 
the gentleman from florida ( mr. hastings ) xz4001702 is a valued member of the committee on rules , but his own committee stripped out his amendment in the base bill and did not even allow him to offer it on the floor . 
mr. speaker , this rule undermines the will of the house and blocks us from mending and improving critical tools in this era of terror . 
the terrorist threat is real , and if we are going to demand that the fbi uncover terror cells in the u.s. , we need to give them the tools to do that . 
we should reauthorize the patriot act , which modernized law enforcement tools , but we should clarify and tailor the authorities so that the government does not have a license to engage in fishing expeditions for your personal information or conduct fbi surveillance on innocent americans . 
but my colleagues on the permanent select committee on intelligence will describe in a moment amendments which we offered in committee and before the committee on rules . 
that bill , i hope , will serve as the model in conference committee . 
in conclusion , protecting america from terrorism is not a democrat or republican issue , it is an american issue . 
mr. chairman , i yield 1 1/2 minutes to the gentleman from iowa ( mr. boswell ) xz4000420 , a valued member of the permanent select committee on intelligence and the only one of us successful enough to get his language adopted in the bill before us today . 
mr. chairman , i rise in support of this amendment on two grounds . 
first , i think it moves us in the right direction . 
this does tighten section 215 , which has probably been , more than any other section in the patriot act , the subject of intense worry for outside groups and especially those who use libraries . 
this is what we should see more of , and i wish we were seeing more of it in connection with this bill . 
mr. chairman , i thank the gentleman for yielding me this time , and i rise in support of his amendment . 
we agreed among us , but , sadly , others in this body did not agree . 
this is a modest amendment that will yield good information so that we will proceed to do data mining in an efficient way consistent with protecting the civil liberties of law-abiding americans . 
it requires only the justice department to prepare a report , not the defense department and not other departments in the government . 
and i am pleased to see that , so far , this debate has all been in favor of support of this motion to instruct , which i think is a very important statement for this house to make . 
earlier today , hotels in amman , jordan , were bombed . 
prevention and disruption is much better than response , and i think everyone in this chamber is dedicated to making sure we have the right tools . 
however , consistent with statements that mr. rohrabacher has just made , as we give these expanded authorities , we also need to assure the law-abiding public of america that we will be vigilant in supervising these authorities . 
not just today , not just in the oversight hearings we held during this last year and , yes , we held a lot of them , but tomorrow and next year and the year after . 
that is why in the intelligence committee mr. ruppersberger and mr. hastings offered amendments to impose sunsets . 
some amendments passed , but they did not survive in the final house bill . 
sunsets are a good idea , and i think with very strong bipartisan support in this chamber , that these new authorities need to carry with them the promise that congress will be vigilant and , that 4 years from now , we will reconsider whether they are necessary . 
let me also add a word about national security letters , which were a remedy designed in the 1970s . 
i think national security letters , a tool not in the patriot act , need to be reviewed as well by this house , and i think we need to consider whether the authority is too broad or whether , using a magistrate system or some other system , they should be reviewed before they are issued . 
so , in conclusion , madam speaker , it is a dangerous world . 
imagine a world in which terrorists make deals and connect with recruits on-line , in cabs , hotel lobbies or cafes all over the world . 
the horrific events of september 11 , and the more recent bombings in bali , britain , jordan , madrid , morocco , saudi arabia and turkey remind us that the terrorists are prepared to strike anywhere , at any time -- and with maximum destructive force . 
with this as a backdrop , it has been and remains my view that the patriot act tools are needed : to track communications by email and internet , including the use of internet sites in libraries ; and to prevent and disrupt plots against us . 
in reauthorizing the patriot act , congress had an opportunity to refine the law , but this conference report reflects only modest improvements . 
many of us in both bodies worked hard to make this conference report better . 
in the end , we asked for three things of critical importance . 
second , dropping the 1-year criminal penalty on divulging that a national security letter has been received , even in a case where there is no intent to obstruct justice . 
the legislation properly establishes that recipients of nsls have the ability to consult an attorney and challenge an nsl in a federal court . 
this is an important flaw in the bill and , sadly , our requested change was not accepted . 
another flaw in the report is section 215 , commonly called the library provision , which allows the government to gather a wide range of business materials , including library , medical and tax records . 
mr. chairman , i rise in support of the amendment . 
in order to thwart terrorists financing , president bush in september of 2001 signed an executive order freezing the assets of terrorist organizations and their supporters and authorizing the secretaries of treasury and state to identify , designate , and freeze the u.s.-based assets that financially facilitate terrorism . 
these hawalas are an informal exchange in which payments are delivered without money actually being moved . 
in addition , terrorists engage in criminal activities such as extortion , smuggling and trafficking , credit card and identity fraud , and the narcotics trade to fund their murderous activities . 
this amendment builds on our current laws to address some of the shortfalls in our laws that we have learned about from our law enforcement since 9/11 . 
just to answer a couple of points : what we do in the amendment is to help to provide opportunities for a series of predicate offenses . 
it is very clear that there would have to be a series of transactions that are suspect in order for this law to be triggered ; and , obviously , there has to be some suspicion of financing terrorism before law enforcement would move forward with that kind of prosecution . 
madam speaker , i rise in support of h.r. 3199 , the patriot act reauthorization conference report . 
the tough terrorism financing language in the conference report will increase penalties for terrorism financing . 
in addition , the bill will add new predicate money laundering offenses to allow law enforcement to investigate and dismantle terrorist financing organizations . 
the language in the conference report adds a parallel provision for individuals planning or perpetrating an act of terrorism against a foreign state or international organizations acting within the jurisdiction of the united states . 
the language in the conference report builds on our current laws , to address some of the shortfalls that we have learned about since september 11 . 
terrorists work to find the holes in our laws and we must make sure that we continue to be diligent to update them so that we can cut off terrorist funds and stop future attacks against us and our allies in the war on terror . 
the continued acts of alleged terrorism in london today should continue to highlight the urgency of these efforts and the critical nature of the patriot act authorities . 
the patriot act would be essential to do the same in the united states to investigate or prevent an attack . 
by now , you have all seen the chilling photograph of the very first group of london bombers to gather in a rail station . 
in the united states the authorities of the patriot act likely would have been used to obtain that photograph . 
in the london investigation , there has been extensive cooperation between the london metropolitan police and the british intelligence agencies . 
in the united states , that cooperation would not be possible without the patriot act . 
in the united states , the authorities of the patriot act likely would have been used to obtain those records . 
mr. chairman , our counterterrorism investigators in the intelligence community can do truly remarkable work to find terrorists and to piece together the puzzle of their networks , but to do that they need modern legal authorities to deal with modern threats . 
i urge all members to support the intelligence community in its effort to fight terrorism . 
mr. chairman , i rise , reluctantly , to claim the time in opposition to the amendment . 
mr. chairman , as i indicated earlier , the berman amendment would potentially undermine the intelligence community 's ability in the current form to collect information on terrorists by tipping the terrorists off to our sources and methods . 
join me , the gentleman from california ( mr. hunter ) xz4001910 , the gentleman from ( mr. oxley ) xz4003070 , the gentleman from virginia ( mr. tom davis ) , and the gentleman from illinois ( mr. hyde ) xz4001920 in opposing this amendment ; not the direction the amendment wants to go , but in the way this amendment is crafted at this time and in this bill . 
madam speaker , i rise in strong support of the conference report . 
i want to thank chairman sensenbrenner for his leadership in this conference and on this important legislation . 
the conference report under consideration today will make 14 of 16 provisions of the patriot act permanent while also including sensible clarifications and improvements in many areas where there should be broad , bipartisan agreement . 
in addition , the congress will continue its close and continued oversight with the intelligence committee paying particular attention to the specific manner in which these authorities are used . 
mr. chairman , i rise in opposition to the patriot act . 
we worked on this in the permanent select committee on intelligence . 
but to make matters worse , even those improvements made in the permanent select committee on intelligence did not find their way through the committee on rules to the floor . 
section 213 , the so-called sneak-and-peek searches , it would allow investigators to come into your home , my home , take pictures , seize personal items , and when they discover they have made a mistake , there is no time in which they have to notify you that they have been there . 
one does not have to be a paranoid to be concerned that somebody has been in your house . 
now , the fbi in that case apologized , but this is something that hits home , and we have a responsibility to preserve the freedoms of people at home . 
mr. chairman , i rise today in opposition to the reauthorization of the patriot act . 
as you know , the patriot act was passed in the aftermath of the attacks of september 11 , 2001 . 
the act was an immediate reaction to the state of shock the country was in -- being drafted , briefly debated , approved , and signed into law by october 26 , 2001 , just weeks after the attacks . 
for generations , thousands upon thousands of people have come to america 's shores to be free of the oppressive hand of authorities in other countries , to be free of the fear of the knock on the door in the middle of the night , to be free of the humiliation and costs and stigma of inappropriate investigations . 
i remain deeply concerned about many of the provisions in the patriot act as reported to the house , but i would like to specifically discuss two of them . 
the so called `` sneak and peek '' searches allow federal agents to literally go in to your home , my home , anyone 's home and conduct a secret search . 
when they discover they made a mistake or they discover you are not engaged in terrorist actions , they are under no obligation to ever let you know promptly . 
in other words , most of the records searched are of innocent people , but because there is a terrorist investigation underway or a terrorists records might be somewhere in the batch , they get swept up in the search . 
they alleged that his finger prints were found on a bag linked to the terrorist bombings in madrid , spain last year . 
how can we allow this to happen in america ? 
in 2001 , i voted in favor of the patriot act with reservations , and my reservations have only increased over time . 
at the time , i said that in the anxious aftermath of the attacks of september 11 , 2001 , we were likely to get wrong the balance between freedom and security . 
and they would have provided the important sunsets that would force review of the bill in four years . 
james madison , speaking in 1788 before the virginia convention ( not all that far from where we are today ) explained what i believe is the unanswered problem with the patriot act . 
he said , `` i believe there are more instances of the abridgement of the freedom of the people by gradual and silent encroachments of those in power than by violent and sudden usurpations. '' as madison said over 200 years ago , the liberty and freedoms we as americans cherish are being eroded today not at the barricade , but in the library , and at our local doctor 's office . 
i rise in opposition to the patriot act conference report . 
they alleged that his fingerprints were found on a bag linked to the terrorist bombings in madrid , spain . 
mr. speaker , i rise today in strong opposition to this conference report on the patriot act . 
for example , i support the provisions of the patriot act that permit surveillance or physical searches in foreign intelligence investigations where the `` significant '' purpose of the action is to collect intelligence . 
however , the conference report before us today contains too many provisions and excludes too many others , making it impossible for me to support it in its current form . 
when this bill was on the house floor in july , i expressed grave concern about several provisions , including section 213 , which allows the so called `` sneak and peek '' searches in anyone 's home , as well as section 215 , which allows investigators broad access to any record without probable cause of a crime . 
how can any american feel `` secure in their persons , houses , papers , and effects , against unreasonable searches '' if the department of justice can send agents into one 's home without notice , either before or after the fact ? 
true , this new version of the act provides for a 90-day maximum for notification of a subject that her or his dwelling or business has been searched , but it is weak protection that in effect allows the fact of a search to be concealed from the subject indefinitely . 
how can any american feel `` secure in their persons , houses , papers , and effects , against unreasonable searches '' if the government can demand access to privileged information , potentially including conversations between a citizen and his or her lawyer ? 
how can any american feel `` secure in their persons , houses , papers , and effects , against unreasonable searches '' if the government is allowed to eavesdrop on a telephone conversation or secretly search a home or business and , in effect , fill in the names and locations on the search order later ? 
the search powers that would be reauthorized for federal law enforcement are too sweeping and will receive too little oversight if this bill passes in its current form , and that is unacceptable , mr. speaker . 
further , the members of the 9/11 commission recently reiterated their support for a change in the formula and said , `` it should be obvious that our defenses should be strongest were the enemy intends to strike -- and where we are most vulnerable. '' failing to distribute these vital homeland security grants according to risk is like sending hurricane preparedness funds to north dakota . 
the fbi and department of homeland security have repeatedly warned of the threat to transportation and economic infrastructure targets in new jersey , and we know from published press reports that al qaeda operatives have conducted surveillance activities against economic and other targets in new jersey . 
mr. chairman , i rise today in opposition to h.r. 3199 , the usa patriot and terrorism prevention reauthorization act of 2005 . 
it has been used to charge , detain and prosecute a muslim student in idaho for posting internet website links to objectionable materials , even though the same links were available on the u.s. government 's web site . 
these are just a few of the incidents we know of , yet they are enough to raise plenty of concerns in my mind . 
rather than making the provisions in question permanent , we should be reviewing and amending the most intrusive of these provisions that are subject to the sunset clause such as : sec . 
206 : `` roving '' wiretaps in national security cases without naming a suspect or telephone . 
the patriot act originally had sunsets on some provisions so we could reexamine the extraordinary powers that were given to the executive branch , in a calmer atmosphere . 
by passing a bill that largely ignores the most serious abuses of the patriot act , that ignores the abuse of power by the bush administration , and which fails to give adequate resources and money to those on the `` front line '' in the fight against terrorism . 
madam speaker , i rise today in opposition to the conference report on h.r. 3199 , the usa patriot and terrorism prevention reauthorization act of 2005 . 
the resulting conference report falls short of what the american people have every reason to expect congress to achieve in defending their rights while advancing their security . 
the conference report drops key protections in the senate-passed bill regarding `` national security letters. '' national security letters , nsls , are , in effect , a form of secret administrative subpoena . 
under the conference report , such records may be kept forever in government databases , shared with the intelligence community , and used for data-mining . 
i opposed the patriot act when it first came to us in 2001 and i vote against it today . 
mr. speaker , i rise in opposition to this rule , but before i speak on the rule itself , let me say to our friends in great britain , one of our strongest allies in the fight against terrorism , we are with you . 
we are in this fight against terrorists together . 
i know that the members of this house on both sides of the aisle are united in that commitment . 
today , on this house floor the american people will see no division in our willingness to do what is necessary to fight terrorism . 
now , let me make it clear to the public that the overwhelming majority of the patriot act is in law right now and will not be affected by this legislation . 
are you afraid of the democratic process in this , the people 's house ? 
my friends , this rule is not consistent with the open democratic process in adopting one of the most important bills that we will consider . 
that is why i voted for the patriot act , to give law enforcement the capability and assurance we could confront and catch terrorists and protect americans in our country , but we should have come with a better rule . 
in fact , when we reauthorized the patriot act in july , the republican bill permanently authorized 14 of the 16 provisions . 
just last sunday the washington post documented , and it has been referenced here , the hundredfold increase in the issuance of national security letters seeking information about u.s. citizens and visitors who are not even alleged to be terrorist or spies . 
terrorism is a serious threat , and we need to be serious in our response . 
in fact , it was not until several sections of the patriot act were set to expire that the justice department began to respond to congressional inquiries and we had the opportunity to assess , examine , and recalibrate our policies . 
no matter how good the leadership is in the justice department , it is not a policy that we ought to pursue and would be an abdication of our congressional oversight responsibility and contrary to the interests of the american people . 
madam speaker , this motion would recede to the senate and create a 4-year sunset on the most controversial provisions in the patriot act , orders by the secret foreign intelligence court , blank wiretap orders and the surveillance of agents of a foreign power who act alone . 
this motion , in my opinion , is a step in the right direction , and i hope the members support it . 
but in the process , we must also protect the basic rights that our founding fathers knew were the bedrock of the united states democracy . 
i want to join with the chairman of the permanent select committee on intelligence in opposing this amendment and just making the point that sources and methods are important . 
the committee on international relations recently held a hearing on afghanistan in which our well-informed drug enforcement administration conservatively estimated that nearly half of the formerly designated foreign terrorist organizations have links to illicit narcotics . 
in colombia , the revolutionary armed forces of colombia and the auc , which are two of these ftos , thrive on the drug trade , supporting and sustaining themselves with illicit proceeds . 
my amendment , recognizing this new and deadly reality , makes it a federal crime under the controlled substance import and export act to engage in drug trafficking that directly or indirectly aids or provides support , resources , or any pecuniary value to a foreign terrorist organization or any person or group planning , preparing for , or carrying out a terrorist offense . 
as provided in my amendment , it will no longer be necessary for our overworked dea and other law enforcement agencies abroad to be looking for a u.s. nexus to illicit drug shipments and drug traffickers who are engaging in this deadly trade which supports global terrorism . 
mr. chairman , i urge adoption of my amendment which will give the tools to our law enforcement personnel in their ongoing global fight against terrorism . 
provisions of the patriot act have already been instrumental in warding off further terrorist attacks since 9/11 , and they are responsible for helping to keep us safe here at home . 
in addition , the bill includes an added provision , which i authored , offering a new tool to attack the growing phenomenon of narco-terrorism , with the proceeds of illicit drug funding and financing feeding the foreign terrorist organizations , ftos , and supporting acts of terrorism . 
in this measure , my provision makes narco-terrorism , which involves both the illicit drug trade and support for terrorism , a federal crime , and provides tough penalties that match the nature of such deadly and dual criminal activity . 
in afghanistan , most of the heroin from illicit drug production goes to europe , rather than here , and much of the profit then finances and supports anticoalition terrorists and attacks on our forces there . 
my provision will give us the tools to attack that drug-related support for terrorism and further protect america , our troops , and coalition forces on the ground in places like afghanistan . 
the one thing i know about what we are dealing with in terrorism is that if you leave an open window on an automobile , no amount of security will protect you . 
the recent bombings in london could have happened on american soil , and it is only through the vigilance of our many law enforcement entities that we can combat this occurrence . 
the patriot act , as it was originally adopted , contains many needed tools to fight those who would harm us here in america . 
however , this is such a serious , serious potential that we must take all measures necessary to ensure that it will not be in the future . 
for that reason , i seek to amend h.r. 3199 to add a level of judicial oversight not in the current bill . 
these are simple steps that will help guard against possible abuses in the future , while doing nothing to hamper the value of the roving wiretap . 
i want to assure the gentlewoman from california that her concerns on electronic data and the fact that in an era of voip that we do have to look at that . 
i serve with the gentlewoman in california on many of the caucuses that deal with that . 
i look forward to both in judiciary and , quite candidly , in other committees of jurisdiction here in the congress to continue to work on properly identifying and modernizing how that is going to be interpreted . 
i will just close quickly in thanking the chairman , the ranking member , the staffs for the hard work that led to the underlying bill , but also to this particular amendment . 
over on the senate side there is a companion that is somewhat similar that has , i believe , a 7-day timeline , and undoubtedly we will work together in conference to reconcile those two . 
but the good work done on a bipartisan basis in the house has led to what i believe is the right compromise , although i certainly will work with the other body . 
mr. speaker , i rise to join many of my colleagues in strongly opposing the restrictive rule set forth on h.r. 3199 , the `` usa patriot and terrorism prevention reauthorization act of 2005. '' as you know , in light of the world we live in now , this is a very important piece of legislation . 
there were many important and relevant amendments that were not ruled in order and i believe this could prove to be detrimental in the end . 
i must also express my dismay with the fact an amendment by my good friend , mr. conyers , was not ruled in order . 
this amendment , which centers on rail and port security , should have been allowed in . 
both rail and port security are areas we as a country need to focus more attention on particularly after what took place in london 2 weeks ago and apparently another incident has taken place this morning . 
let me take a moment to discuss an important amendment of mine that was not ruled in order . 
before closing , i am pleased to see that my `` safe haven '' amendment was ruled in order . 
this amendment seeks to allow the attachment of property and the enforcement of a judgment against a judgment debtor that has engaged in planning or perpetrating any act of domestic or international terrorism under the `` forfeiture clause '' of 18 u.s.c . 
in 2000 , the party filed a suit against iran under the terrorist state exception to the foreign sovereign immunity act . 
2. notwithstanding any other provision of this resolution the amendment specified in section 3 shall be in order as though printed after the amendment numbered 20 in the report of the committee on rules if offered by representative sanders of vermont or a designee . 
3. the amendment referred to in section 2 is as follows : at the end of section 8 add the following new subsection : & lt ; p & gt ; ( e ) library and bookseller records. -- section 501 of the foreign intelligence surveillance act of 1978 ( 50 u.s.c . 
1861 ) is amended by adding at the end the following new subsection : & lt ; p & gt ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; `` ( g ) ( 1 ) no application may be made under this section with either the purpose or effect of searching for , or seizing from , a bookseller or library documentary materials ( except for records of internet use ) that contain personally identifiable information concerning a patron of a bookseller or library. & lt ; p & gt ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; `` ( 2 ) nothing in this subsection shall be construed as precluding a physical search for documentary materials referred to in paragraph ( 1 ) under other provisions of law , including under section 303. & lt ; p & gt ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; `` ( 3 ) in this subsection : & lt ; p & gt ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; `` ( a ) the term `bookseller ' means any person or entity engaged in the sale , rental or delivery of books , journals , magazines or other similar forms of communication in print or digitally. & lt ; p & gt ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; `` ( b ) the term `library ' has the meaning given that term under section 213 ( 2 ) of the library services and technology act ( 20 u.s.c . 
9122 ( 2 ) ) whose services include access to the internet , books , journals , magazines , newspapers , or other similar forms of communication in print or digitally to patrons for their use , review , examination or circulation. & lt ; p & gt ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; `` ( c ) the term `patron ' means any purchaser , renter , borrower , user or subscriber of goods or services from a library or bookseller. & lt ; p & gt ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; `` ( d ) the term `documentary materials ' means any document , tape , or other communication created by a bookseller or library in connection with print or digital dissemination of a book , journal , magazine , newspaper , or other similar form of communication . 
mr. chairman , i hope we can characterize this debate in the manner that it should be , particularly as we rise in the backdrop of the tragedy of london , england . 
might i say that even though we would have preferred , many of us as democrats , a lengthier time for debate in committee , i want to thank the gentleman from michigan ( mr. conyers ) xz4000800 and the gentleman from wisconsin ( mr. sensenbrenner ) xz4003650 for the ongoing debate and allowing for amendments over a period of time to discuss the patriot act . 
mr. chairman , even though it is a different story , the voter rights act in 1965 , which goes to the core of our democracy , was sunsetted ; and it has to be reauthorized . 
i have signed probable cause warrants as a judge , and you have to ask hard questions when a policeman comes in late at night to go into your home . 
or what about the sneak-and-peek provision that allows someone to come into your home and take anything , of course , called search and seizure , without notice , suggesting that it is involved in an investigation , and most of you would not know , most of america would not know that this is not limited to terrorism . 
so the question on debate today , i hope that we can center it around the question of restraint , but yet be vigorous in our fight for the war on terror . 
i hope that we will have that opportunity , and i hope as well that in the amendment that i offer that we will be able to say that if you are impacted by a terrorist act , that you can sue and enforce your civil judgement , and i hope to have mutual support on that . 
3 mr. chairman , i join my many colleagues , many victims of terrorism , and many victims of racial and religious profiling in opposing this legislation , h.r. 3199 , for several reasons . 
second , there are numerous provisions in both the expiring and other sections of the patriot act that have little to do with combating terrorism , intrude on our privacy and civil liberties , and have been subject to repeated abuse and misuse by the justice department . 
finally , the bill does not provide law enforcement with any additional real and meaningful tools necessary to help our nation prevail in the war against terrorism . 
additionally , numerous groups ranging the political spectrum have come forward to oppose certain sections of the patriot act and to demand that congress conduct more oversight on its use , including the american civil liberties union , american conservative union , american immigration lawyers association , among these troubling provisions are those that : authorize the attorney general ( ag ) to arrest and detain non-citizens based on mere suspicion , and require that they remain in detention `` irrespective of any relief they may be eligible for or granted. '' ( in order to grant someone relief from deportation , an immigration judge must find that the person is not a terrorist , a criminal , or someone who has engaged in fraud or misrepresentation. ) when relief from deportation is granted , no person should be subject to continued detention based merely on the attorney general 's unproven suspicions . 
as a result , an alien can be treated as a terrorist suspect despite being charged with only a minor immigration violation , and may never have his or her day in court to prove otherwise . 
in addition , the current administration has taken some deeply troubling steps since september 11 . 
along with supporting the usa patriot act , it has initiated new policies and practices that negate fundamental due process protections and jeopardize basic civil liberties for non-citizens in the united states . 
the clra would secure due process protections and civil liberties for non-citizens in the u.s. , enhance the effectiveness of our nation 's enforcement activities , restore the confidence of immigrant communities in the fairness of our government , and facilitate our efforts at promoting human rights and democracy around the world . 
while every step must be taken to protect the american public from further terrorist acts , our government must not trample on the constitution in the process and on those basic rights and protections that make american democracy so unique . 
my `` safe havens '' amendment that was made in order by the committee on rules relates to the civil forfeiture provision of 18 u.s.c . 
it seeks to allow victims of terrorism who obtain civil judgment for damages caused in connection with the acts to attach foreign or domestic assets held by the united states government under 18 u.s.c . 
section 981 ( g ) calls for the forfeiture of all assets , foreign or domestic , of any individual , entity , or organization that has engaged in planning or perpetrating any act of domestic or international terrorism against the united states , citizens or residents of the united states . 
in the sobero case , a u.s. national was beheaded by abu sayyaf , an al-qaeda affiliate , leaving his children fatherless . 
in 2000 , the party filed a suit against iran under the terrorist state exception to the foreign sovereign immunity act . 
similarly , american servicemen who were harmed in a libyan sponsored bombing of the la belle disco in germany were obstructed from obtaining justice for the terrorist acts they suffered . 
in addition , a group of american prisoners who were tortured in iraq during the persian gulf war were barred from collecting their judgment from the iraqi government . 
although the 17 veterans won their case in the district court of the district of columbia , the administration argued that the iraqi assets should remain frozen in a u.s. bank account to aid in the reconstruction of iraq . 
in their claim against the iraqi government , the victims were awarded $ 64 million against iraq in connection with the september 2001 attacks . 
however , they were rebuffed in their efforts to attach the vested iraqi assets . 
it 's been used to charge , detain and prosecute a muslim student in idaho for posting internet website links to objectionable materials , even though the same links were available on the u.s. government 's web site . 
all this serves to accomplish is to alienate muslim and arab americans -- the key groups to fighting terrorism in our country -- who see a justice department that has institutionalized racial and ethnic profiling , without the benefit of a single terrorism conviction . 
right now , h.r. 3199 is the most appropriate and timely vehicle in which to address this issue and allow u.s. victims of terrorism to obtain justice from terrorist-supporting or terrorist-housing nations . 
mr. chairman , i ask unanimous consent to claim the time in opposition , although i am not opposed to the amendment . 
i thank the distinguished gentleman from wisconsin for his cooperation in working to have this amendment be included in the final legislation as it is a sense of congress amendment that i think makes a very important statement . 
this is distinctive , mr. chairman , because this pertains to circumstances of terrorism but not necessarily in circumstances when we are at war . 
my amendment seeks to allow victims of terrorism who obtain civil judgments for damages caused in connection with the acts to attach foreign or domestic assets held by the united states government under 18 u.s.c . 
section 981 ( g ) calls for the forfeiture of all assets , foreign or domestic , of any individual entity or organization that is engaged in planning or perpetrating any act of domestic or international terrorism . 
as we look at h.r. 3199 , the patriot act , it misses the opportunity to in fact allow victims to satisfy judgments . 
the same thing occurred with the iran hostages , which many of us are familiar with , but are my colleagues aware of the situation with our american servicemen who were harmed in the libyan-sponsored bombing of the la belle disco in germany ? 
in addition , a group of american prisoners tortured in iraq during the persian gulf war were barred from collecting their judgment from the iraqi government . 
i do believe in conference we will have the opportunity to vet this and to work with all the parties concerned to finally bring some relief on this issue . 
many members have attempted to bring about relief in special claims for their particular individual constituents in their particular jurisdictions . 
fortunately , in the opportunity we have today , by including this sense of congress in the patriot act we will finally get both our debate and we will get action . 
in their claim against the iraqi government , the victims were awarded $ 64 million against iraq in connection with the september 20 , 2001 , attack . 
however , they were rebuffed in their efforts to attach the vested iraqi assets . 
i would hope my colleagues would support this amendment so we can carry this forward into conference and be able to provide the kind of leadership necessary for the throngs of victims , those who have already suffered , and we hope not , but for those who may suffer in the future . 
so i think that we will have an opportunity to address these concerns , balance the needs of the government in its need to protect certain information , and give relief to many americans . 
mr. chairman , i have an amendment at the desk that has been made in order by the committee on rules , jackson-lee no . 
my amendment seeks to allow victims of terrorism who obtain civil judgment for damages caused in connection with the acts to attach foreign or domestic assets held by the united states government under 18 u.s.c . 
section 981 ( g ) calls for the forfeiture of all assets , foreign or domestic , of any individual , entity , or organization that has engaged in planning or perpetrating any act of domestic or international terrorism against the united states , citizens or residents of the united states . 
in the sobero case , a u.s. national , guillermo sobero of riverside county , ca , was beheaded by abu sayyaf , an al-qaeda affiliate , leaving his children fatherless . 
in 2000 , the party filed a suit against iran under the terrorist state exception to the foreign sovereign immunity act . 
similarly , american servicemen who were harmed in a libyan sponsored bombing of the la belle disco in germany were obstructed from obtaining justice for the terrorist acts they suffered . 
in addition , a group of american prisoners who were tortured in iraq during the persian gulf war were barred from collecting their judgment from the iraqi government . 
although the 17 veterans won their case in the district court of the district of columbia , the administration argued that the iraqi assets should remain frozen in a u.s. bank account to aid in the reconstruction of iraq . 
in their claim against the iraqi government , the victims were awarded $ 64 million against iraq in connection with the september 2001 attacks . 
however , they were rebuffed in their efforts to attach the vested iraqi assets . 
right now , h.r. 3199 is the most appropriate and timely vehicle in which to address this issue and allow u.s. victims of terrorism to obtain justice from terrorist-supporting or terrorist-housing nations . 
in closing , mr. chairman , let me thank the chairman of the full committee and the ranking member and the ranking member of the subcommittee for their leadership on this whole entire issue of protecting americans against terrorism and including in that protection of their civil liberties . 
this amendment will not only protect americans against the dangers of life and limb and the loss of life , but give them relief in our courts . 
mr. speaker , i thank the gentleman from the judiciary committee for the wisdom of this motion , and i applaud the joining by the chairman of the full committee and offer an explanation for the reason our colleagues should join us in supporting this motion to instruct , and frame it in the context of the crisis of the recent weeks , asking congress to accept its responsibility to investigate the cia leaks and now to investigate further the leaking of the cia sites , some call it sites of torture , incarceration , of individuals around the world who have been charged or are alleged to have committed acts of terrorism . 
yes , the patriot act in some minds has offered to provide us more protection . 
the 4-year sunset gives us that opportunity so that we can begin in 4 years to assess whether authorizing secret intelligence , going into libraries and getting a list of your library books helps or hurts the american people ; whether the authorizing of a blank wiretap helps or hurts the american people ; whether or not the lone wolf , where you can be one individual , not part of a terrorist organization or an association or to be part of a large massive group , but one individual who may be part of , words may have suggested that they are giving some comfort to those whose views we disagree with can be hauled in as a terrorist . 
i ask my colleagues to support this motion to instruct and sunset in 4 years so congress can have the ability to protect the rights of the american people . 
madam speaker , i join my many colleagues , many victims of terrorism , and many victims of racial and religious profiling in opposing this legislation , h.r. 3199 , for several reasons . 
second , there are numerous provisions in both the expiring and other sections of the patriot act that have little to do with combating terrorism , intrude on our privacy and civil liberties , and have been subject to repeated abuse and misuse by the justice department . 
finally , the bill does not provide law enforcement with any additional real and meaningful tools necessary to help our nation prevail in the war against terrorism . 
of particular concern to me are a number of immigration-related provisions that cast such a broad net to allow for the detention and deportation of people engaging in innocent associational activity and constitutionally protected speech and that permit the indefinite detention of immigrants and noncitizens who are not terrorists . 
among these troubling provisions are those that : authorize the attorney general , ag , to arrest and detain noncitizens based on mere suspicion , and require that they remain in detention `` irrespective of any relief they may be eligible for or granted. '' ( in order to grant someone relief from deportation , an immigration judge must find that the person is not a terrorist , a criminal , or someone who has engaged in fraud or misrepresentation . 
as a result , an alien can be treated as a terrorist suspect despite being charged with only a minor immigration violation , and may never have his or her day in court to prove otherwise . 
in addition , the current administration has taken some deeply troubling steps since september 11 . 
along with supporting the usa patriot act , it has initiated new policies and practices that negate fundamental due process protections and jeopardize basic civil liberties for noncitizens in the united states . 
the clra would secure due process protections and civil liberties for noncitizens in the u.s. , enhance the effectiveness of our nation 's enforcement activities , restore the confidence of immigrant communities in the fairness of our government , and facilitate our efforts at promoting human rights and democracy around the world . 
while every step must be taken to protect the american public from further terrorist acts , our government must not trample on the constitution in the process and on those basic rights and protections that make american democracy so unique . 
981 and would add a section that would allow civil plaintiffs to attach judgments to collect compensory damages for which a terrorist organization has been adjudged liable , fortunately , was included in the text of the conference report as section 127 : it is the sense of congress that under section 981 of title 18 , united states code , victims of terrorists attacks should have access to the assets forfeited . 
this language seeks to allow victims of terrorism who obtain civil judgment for damages caused in connection with the acts to attach foreign or domestic assets held by the united states government under 18 u.s.c . 
section 981 ( g ) calls for the forfeiture of all assets , foreign or domestic , of any individual , entity , or organization that has engaged in planning or perpetrating any act of domestic or international terrorism against the united states , citizens or residents of the united states . 
in the sobero case , a u.s. national was beheaded by abu sayyaf , an ai-qaeda affiliate , leaving his children fatherless . 
in 2000 , the party filed a suit against iran under the terrorist state exception to the foreign sovereign immunity act . 
similarly , american servicemen who were harmed in a libyan sponsored bombing of the la belle disco in germany were obstructed from obtaining justice for the terrorist acts they suffered .

however , they were rebuffed in their efforts to attach the vested iraqi assets . 
it 's been used to charge , detain and prosecute a muslim student in idaho for posting internet website links to objectionable materials , even though the same links were available on the u.s. government 's website . 
all this serves to accomplish is to alienate muslim and arab-americans -- the key groups to fighting terrorism in our own county -- who see a justice department that has institutionalized racial and ethnic profiling , without the benefit of a single terrorism conviction . 
right now , h.r. 3199 is the most appropriate and timely vehicle in which to address this issue and allow u.s. victims of terrorism to obtain justice from terrorist-supporting or terrorist-housing nations . 
mr. speaker , i rise in support of this motion to instruct . 
i ask that we restore the senate 's sunsets in the conference report . 
since we passed the patriot act in 2001 , we have convicted 212 terrorists , and we have frozen $ 136 million in terrorist assets . 
in reality , a prosecutor seeking this information must go before a federal judge , get a court order and prove that it is a matter of international terrorism . 
now , how many times has that happened since we first passed the patriot act in 2001 ? 
mr. chairman , i rise in support of this amendment . 
but strength in this area is critical to our overall success in detecting , tracking and stopping terrorist activity . 
we 've made remarkable progress in this area in the last 4 years in developing and sharpening our tools for combating terror finance . 
i am pleased that this conference report contains many significant provisions that i have authored , including 4 enhanced criminal penalties originally introduced in the kennedy-hooley slam act . 
we must send a signal to the pushers of this poison that they are not welcome in our communities . 
madam speaker , this bipartisan legislation deserves the support of both bodies because it is a comprehensive response to the methamphetamine problem in america . 
while the criminal penalties in this bill would be more effective if they were as tough as what were originally introduced , chairmen sensenbrenner and souder showed tremendous leadership in moving this bill to the floor , and i urge the swift passage of this important legislation . 
most importantly , our actions today will send a signal to the law enforcement officers who wake up every morning to protect our families that we stand with them in the fight against drugs and will work to give them every tool they need to be successful . 
madam speaker , i urge all of my colleagues in both bodies to support this reauthorization of the patriot act , which contains important provisions in this nation 's fight against meth . 
however , indian tribal governments that are legally involved in the retailing of tobacco products are clearly not the types of entities we are targeting with this provision . 
as initially drafted , the coble amendment would have had the unintended effect of targeting tribal governments who are legitimately involved in the retailing of tobacco products . 
it is my understanding that the gentlemen from north carolina has agreed to take up these outstanding issues in conference . 
i am alarmed about the scope of a number of provisions in the bill that are likely to lead to the abuse of personal freedoms enjoyed by americans . 
my concern is that law enforcement agencies can engage in such activity without meeting the standard legal threshold of `` probable cause '' , thereby leading to potential cases of abuse . 
under this scenario , criminal investigators can obtain wire tap authority to employ devices that roam with someone who has been designated as involved in terrorist activity ; that device can be attached to an instrument that can be transported through multiple jurisdictions . 
two of the provisions in this bill are now being scheduled to extend for 10 years as opposed to the 4 years in the expiring legislation . 
in this scenario , a flawed provision could extend 6 years beyond the normal time frame . 
mr. chairman , i content that it is essential to protect the constitutional rights of american citizens as we engaged in the ongoing war on terrorism . 
i urge my colleagues to stand up for the bill of rights and resist the temptation to curtail those rights in our collective pursuits to develop legislation to counter the threats posed by terrorists . 
i stand as a patriot for america and our constitution , and in opposition to h.r. 3199 . 
i urge my colleagues to join my in defeating this measure . 
mr. chairman , i sit here and listen to this debate , and i have been through a number of the 12-or-so hearings that we have had in the committee on the judiciary on the patriot act ; and i want to compliment this congress , this bipartisan congress , that met almost with a sense of urgency and almost a sense of emergency to write this patriot act just 3-plus years ago . 
and throughout all of those hearings , we needed to put security in place , we needed to be able to access information . 
one of the standards was , why can we not access information in an international terrorist investigation as we can in a criminal investigation ? 
we set higher standards here in this congress rather than lower standards and , still , the debate comes back . 
but i am astonished and amazed and pleased and in admiration by the work done by this congress to put this language in this patriot act that has withstood all legitimate criticism . 
mr. speaker , in response to my good friend from california who said there must be sacrifices and sacrifices have been made , i would remind members of the words of benjamin franklin who once said that those who would give up their essential liberties to achieve a measure of security deserve neither . 
we are here today trying to appeal to people to let go of their fear and suspicion because an open , honest review of the fbi 's use of the patriot act would surely find many areas in need of reform . 
the bill retains 4-year sunsets for only two of the 16 patriot act provisions and only one of two expiring provisions in the 2004 intelligence reform act . 
criminal wiretaps require one or the other , and the 10-day after-the-fact notice requirement is no substitute for privacy safeguards in the criminal wiretaps . 
i rise in support of the flake-otter sneak-and-peek amendment to drop this provision . 
i hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this responsible amendment . 
madam speaker , today i rise in opposition to the conference report on h.r. 3199 , the usa patriot act reauthorization . 
in my state , seven cities and towns have passed resolutions opposing parts of the usa patriot act , and my constituents understand what this bill means to them and their freedom . 
by making 14 of the 16 expiring provisions of the usa patriot act permanent , i worry that congress will be less likely to engage in vigorous oversight to protect the civil liberties of law abiding americans . 
in addition , the senate required new , strong protections for `` sneak and peak '' searches and roving wiretaps . 
i urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the motion to recommit , which asks conferees to adopt the bipartisan senate language . 
i urge my colleagues to join me in opposing h.r. 3199 and instead working to reauthorize the usa patriot act in a way that protects both our liberties and our country . 
there are large gaps that still remain in critical areas that leave americans vulnerable to the threat of terrorism . 
but funding for cooperative threat reduction programs to secure unaccounted for nuclear material in the former soviet union have remained stagnant since 9/11 , taking a backseat to other priorities like expanding tax cuts and privatizing social security . 
there are almost 2 , 000 fewer border inspectors and agents than were called for in the 2001 patriot act . 
of the 2 , 000 border patrol agents called for in the intelligence reform act , the republican majority has funded only 500 this year . 
funding for first responder programs , our front line defense against terrorists at home , has dropped 27 percent in the past three years , from a high of $ 3.3 billion in 2003 to $ 2.4 billion in 2006 -- funds which help our towns and cities hire , train and equip our police , firefighters and medical responders . 
this leaves our buses , trains , subways , highways and bridges dangerously vulnerable to the kind of attacks we saw in london . 
despite the threat , the president requested no money for port security in fy 2006 . 
this sunset was critical to earn support for such sweeping legislation , when in the shadow of the september 11th terrorist attack , the administration pushed congress to quickly pass legislation that would provide vast new powers to law enforcement . 
in fact , most of the amendments they have allowed to be considered have very little to do with the provisions that are up for reauthorization . 
in wartime , government calls for greater powers , and then the need for those powers recedes after the war ends . 
protecting america from terrorism means inspecting cargo on passenger planes , inspecting cargo in our ports , securing 
mr. chairman , i rise in strong support of the waters ' amendment and in strong opposition to h.r. 3199 , the usa patriot and intelligence reform act of 2005 . 
`` national security letters '' subpoena personal records including telephone , internet , financial and consumer documents , but almost all records are included in this category . 
this bill damages fundamental freedoms : by invading medical privacy by allowing the fbi to search in any location showing minimal justification by allowing for sneak and peak , national security letters , and roving `` john doe '' wire tap provisions by forcing libraries to police their patrons ( an act that this body just voted to overturn i might add ) and by stripping congress of the right to review and amend these provisions . 
the waters amendment protects the rights of those who are the overlooked victims of national security letters -- upholding the constitution is patriotic , even in times of national security crises . 
in so doing , this bill throws assured oversight and accountability out the window . 
it has only been in the last few months , as the sunset dates approached , that congress has asked questions , and held the administration 's feet to the fire to provide basic information about how the patriot act is being implemented . 
i had hoped that the serious shortcomings in this bill could be corrected on the floor today , but the majority has blocked a number of important amendments democrats sought to offer . 
i will vote for the motion to recommit the bill , which would correct the most serious shortfalls in the legislation ; in particular , the lack of sunsets of key provisions -- sunsets that were contained in the original patriot act . 
i will therefore oppose passage of this legislation today in the hope that the bipartisan senate judiciary committee 's version will prevail in the senate . 
in particular , i am disappointed that the bill before us does not include language to change how first-responder grants are allocated . 
in a number of other areas , the senate-passed version of the bill included key safeguards that were removed from the conference report . 
in particular , the senate bill contained important protections relating to the business and library records provisions of the act that have been so controversial with our constituents . 
the standard contained in the conference report is much weaker . 
in addition , unlike the senate-passed bill , the conference report fails to protect the records of innocent americans collected by means of national security letters . 
we need better privacy safeguards in this area . 
mr. chairman , after 9/11 , i worked on the drafting of the patriot act in the committee and in the weekend drafting session , and i voted for the act on the floor . 
i think it is important to know that most of what is in the patriot act is not actually before us today . 
first and foremost , as the justice department said in their letter to me today , the most important thing in the patriot act is to help remove the legal barriers that prevented law enforcement and intelligence officers from sharing information so they could , so-called , `` connect the dots. '' that is important . 
there are other important things in the act . 
i think it is worth noting that there are some things that disturb americans that are happening in the united states relative to the arrest of american citizens and the holding of american citizens without charge , without access to counsel ; but they have nothing whatsoever to do with the patriot act . 
they are not in the patriot act , no matter how concerned we might be about them . 
i believe , however , that even though there are important components to the patriot act , there are some things that deserve more attention and more fine-tuning than they have received in this bill . 
in addition , we enhanced this section in subsequent legislation to ensure that even more records could be subpoenaed from travel agencies , pawn brokers , casinos , car dealers and more ; but all of this is without oversight of a court . 
we have not had meaningful oversight , in my opinion , on this provision of the act . 
assuming that law enforcement does need the ability to get some of these records , and i do not dispute that , we do need to have some standards in place . 
the fact is that americans are aware of this issue , and i believe this is having a chilling effect on first amendment rights in terms of reading and speaking . 
mr. chairman , i support this amendment although it does not make some of the changes recommended by mr. scott xz4003641 in committee about ascertainment and minimization that we believe are important . 
mr. chairman , i would just note that we have spent since 9/11 only a couple hundred million dollars in homeland security to secure our rail systems . 
i think we need to look at not deterrents but at actually preventing the terrorists from harming americans by protecting the systems and putting our money where our mouth is and in securing these rail systems which we have failed to do . 
we are well aware of how deficient our efforts have been in this regard . 
mr. chairman , i would like to concur with the comments made by the ranking member , the gentleman from virginia ( mr. scott ) xz4003641 , and to thank my colleague from california for the amendment , and just note that as i read through it and agreed with this , and i thank the gentleman for offering the amendment , it occurs to me that there are a few other items that perhaps should have been included , and i am hopeful that the committee might , we do not have a sunset , but we might actually spend some time scrubbing the code and making sure that we have scooped them all up in an appropriate way . 
on the other hand , i am aware that there are people in our country and in our congress who for religious reasons do not believe in the death penalty . 
the pope did not believe in the death penalty and , obviously , he was not for terrorism any more than our religious colleagues who have that objection are for terrorism . 
if there was a hearing in the subcommittee that i am not a member of all well and good , but i think this amendment poses some new things that the full committee would benefit from going through . 
and i think we would be better served to sort through that in a thorough way than to expose these elements of the patriot act to court challenge . 
really , what we need to do is to spend the time and the money to take steps to protect ourselves in a more thorough way than we have done since 9/11 . 
as a member of the committee on homeland security , i am acutely aware , and we are on both sides of the aisle , i can tell you of the shortfallings that we have in our protection against terrorism . 
i understand what the intent is , and perhaps if this passes we can clarify this in a conference committee ; but i wonder about the liabilities of the banking industry that acts innocently to help immigrants transmit funds home . 
the banks in california have been encouraged to regularize the remittance program . 
mr. chairman , i ask unanimous consent to claim the time in opposition , although i do not oppose the amendment . 
mr. chairman , i ask unanimous consent to claim the time in opposition , although i do not oppose the amendment . 
we need to have more vigorous action in addition to the sense of the congress activity . 
many of us are concerned that we have failed to do the balance of privacy and the constitution in some parts of the 16 provisions that are before us this evening . 
we are hopeful that , as this process moves forward , that the senate that has taken these issues of civil liberties more to heart on a bipartisan and i would add unanimous basis may in the end prevail so that those who are troubled by the failure to really deal with some of the constitutional issues will in the end be able to support a bill at least at the end of a conference process . 
mr. speaker , i would just note the most important thing in the patriot act is the sharing of information between law enforcement and intelligence . 
we have failed to cure the problems in the bill , and we have missed an opportunity . 
mr. speaker , i think it 's clear that the primary benefit of the usa patriot act we passed in 2001 has been the sharing of information between criminal investigators and intelligence officials it enabled . 
i support authorizing that information sharing capability in the original patriot act , and i support its reauthorization today . 
but this conference report on reauthorization of the usa patriot act fails in important ways . 
congress has not done its job in providing the thorough review we need of the patriot act . 
nor has the bush administration done its job in providing us the information we need to properly evaluate the patriot act . 
in fact , through the cracks in doj 's veil of secrecy , we 've begun to find some information about the patriot act . 
we do n't know how many private lives are being swept up in these nsls , because doj wo n't tell us . 
this bill also adopts too weak a standard for law enforcement to engage in business records searches under section 215 of the patriot act . 
the senate passed unanimously what i thought was a very reasonable standard for law enforcement to meet in order to conduct these searches . 
mr. speaker , i 'm very disappointed that this legislation has removed the provisions we passed in the house providing for additional funding for first responders . 
this is vitally needed funding that local first responders need in the event of another terrorist attack or other disaster . 
for these reasons , mr. speaker , i urge my colleagues to join me in voting against this conference report . 
i , along with some of my colleagues , have introduced legislation that would allow us to reauthorize the existing patriot act authorities for another 3 months , to take the time we need to correct the many deficiencies still remaining in this conference report . 
i urge that , instead of voting for a bad bill in order to meet an arbitrary deadline , my colleagues join me in voting for more time to turn this into a better bill . 
mr. speaker , i am deeply disappointed that the conference report , among other things , today does not include an amendment that i offered with mr. sweeney xz4003930 to alter the first responder funding formula in the original patriot act . 
this long overdue change has been approved by the house on three separate occasions , including in a stand-alone bill that passed by a vote of 409 to 10 in may . 
in a recent the senate failed to exercise leadership . 
we can not back down from this fight , and we must demand that the senate accept our proposal in any future homeland security legislation . 
madam speaker , i rise in opposition to the conference report on h.r. 3199 , the so-called usa patriot act , because we have not taken meaningful steps to eliminate or correct the most egregious sections of this act . 
in particular , it is disappointing that the conference agreement does not include a meaningful judicial review mechanism for fisa wiretaps , under the foreign intelligence surveillance act , as applied against u.s. citizens . 
given that the power that today 's surveillance technology gives to government and given the broad powers that we have given to intelligence agencies under this act , the absence of post-execution judicial review in today 's conference report constitutes one of its most critical shortcomings . 
madam speaker , in order to ensure that the powers granted by the patriot act are not susceptible to abuse , our government must always operate with meaningful oversight , checks and balances . 
after all , it is the maximum transparency and active judicial review which is our ultimate weapon in combating both governmental abuse and overreaching by governments to restrict the individual freedoms of our citizens . 
mr. speaker , i rise in opposition to this restrictive rule . 
it was the third such time that i , in a bipartisan way with congressmen shays and tom udall , that we have sought the opportunity to debate this issue , but each time the committee has not made it in order . 
if our amendment was made in order , it would : 1 . 
create the board as an independent agency in the executive branch . 
currently the board is in the executive office of the president . 
restore the qualifications of board members that were originally included in the senate bill . 
in fact , the board that we have right now has never even met and we are still waiting on confirmation of the chair and the vice chair . 
this amendment was also offered in a bipartisan manner with my colleague from new york , peter king . 
temporary relief for non-citizens , who were here legally or not , was included in the original patriot act . 
the maloney/peter king amendment , provides adjustment in immigration status to `` an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence '' and a stay of removal to the surviving spouses and children of individuals who died in the terrorist attacks of september 11 , 2001 . 
these families have already suffered once , suffering the loss of a loved-one in the attacks of 9/11 , we should not prolong their suffering . 
this body should have made this amendment in order . 
madam speaker , i rise in opposition to the conference report to h.r. 3199 , the usa patriot and terrorism prevention reauthorization act of 2005 . 
like the version of this legislation i voted against in july , this conference report would make permanent 14 of 16 provisions included in the original patriot act passed in 2001 . 
i continue to have serious concerns about how this administration and future administrations could apply the provisions included in this bill . 
to make matters even worse , there are entirely new provisions in the conference report to expand the secret service 's ability to restrict free speech by creating `` exclusion zones. '' these provisions were included in neither the house nor the senate version of this bill . 
i would think that this expansion of the secret service 's authority at the very least deserves serious consideration by this body , and should not be slipped in at the last minute without any hearings or markups . 
my constituents have legitimate concerns about the lack of independent , judicial oversight over the provisions included in the patriot act . 
when the house debated this bill in july , the rules committee denied a bipartisan effort to debate an amendment offered by representatives christopher shays , tom udall and myself that would have made the privacy and civil liberties board , created by the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act , more robust . 
this board would have been in line with what the 9/11 commission envisioned when they issued their report . 
madam speaker , i rise in strong opposition to the conference report on the usa patriot reauthorization act . 
as co-chairman of the congressional privacy caucus , i remain concerned about government encroachments into the private lives of innocent americans , which can undermine the principles of liberty , freedom of association and protection from unjust searches and seizures that have been embedded in our constitution and culture . 
the conference report fails to include essential privacy protections that had been included in the senate version of this legislation . 
specifically , the senate-passed bill contained key safeguards not included in the conference report regarding the patriot act 's use of so-called `` national security letters '' and `` business and library records '' . 
madam speaker , as you know , national security letters are , in effect , a form of secret administrative subpoena . 
the conference report requires a court to accept as conclusive the government 's assertion that a gag order should not be lifted , unless the court determines the government is acting in bad faith . 
despite strong opposition to this the conference report eliminated key protections in the senate-passed bill regarding the `` business and library records '' provisions . 
regrettably , this opportunity was lost and the conference report we are considering today does not contain key privacy protections that had been included in the senate-passed bill . 
mr. speaker , i rise today in opposition to this restrictive rule , and i rise in opposition to the underlying bill . 
i know there is a lot of anguish in the house today about this bill . 
it takes the courage to say to the terrorists , you will not succeed in changing our way of life . 
safeguards are key , and congress in its vital function of oversight is one of government 's most important safeguards . 
many of the provisions in the patriot act were sunsetted back in 2001 so that congress could evaluate and fix them if necessary . 
we must remember the wiretaps and secret surveillance on leaders in the civil rights and antiwar movements , and we must vow to never let those abuses happen again . 
some of the powers granted to the executive branch in this bill are simply too broad : secret surveillance of library and bookstore records ; roving wiretaps ; sneak-and-peek searches ; and overly broad subpoena power . 
we need a bill that achieves the appropriate balance between liberty and security , a bill that combats terrorism vigilantly , but that is also consistent with the rights and liberties provided in the constitution of the united states . 
in my opinion , this bill is not it . 
mr. speaker , i rise today in strong opposition to h.r. 3199 . 
while this conference report makes some improvement to the current patriot act , it fails to address some major deficiencies , and in many ways , it makes the current situation worse . 
mr. speaker , back in 2001 , when the patriot act was enacted , 16 provisions were sunsetted or authorized for a certain period of time because of their controversial nature and also due to the hurried manner in which they were drafted ; 14 of these 16 provisions are made permanent by this conference report . 
section 206 , dubbed the roving wiretaps provision , grants the government the power to perform so-called john doe wiretaps in which they do not have to disclose the phones that will be tapped or even the names of the suspected person . 
what is most concerning about nsls are the rate in which they are being issued and the eventual relevancy of the retrieved records . 
extending the patriot act in its current form for 3 months would give lawmakers the opportunity to reevaluate these contentious provisions , fix them , and then issue a conference report that actually protects the civil liberties of the people of this country and not hinders them . 
i would like to share a quote from an article entitled `` going down in history with usa patriot act , '' which appeared in the november 27 edition of the massachusetts republican : `` unless lawmakers are prepared to revise the usa patriot act to include modest protections to safeguard civil liberties , they will go down in history as the authors of remarkably bad legislation. '' mr. speaker , when we in congress authorize federal agencies , it is our responsibility to grant them with an appropriate level of power so that abuse will not occur . 
in our recent history , we have seen abuse of power . 
we have seen civil rights leaders in this country , people who have advocated equal treatment under the law for all of our citizens , we have seen these people put under surveillance . 
we have seen others who have raised their voices in dissent or who have advocated issues that are now viewed as the mainstream , we have seen that they have been spied upon by our own government . 
there are over 150 provisions in this bill that are noncontroversial , that everybody agrees on , that will help track down terrorists and criminals ; but there are a few provisions that so cross the line that they threaten our privacy and our civil liberties and do not make us safer . 
it was with that possibility in mind that the congress included in the patriot act a provision requiring a review after a few years to determine which parts should be retained , which parts should be modified , and which should be repealed . 
it is evident to me and to many americans that the patriot act is inadequate in its protection of civil liberties . 
last week , the committee on the judiciary met to address these and other issues in an attempt to bring back some balance to the law enforcement power and civil liberties . 
democrats on the committee offered dozens of amendments in an attempt to control this bill and bring balance to it . 
most troubling was the extension of sunsetted provisions that should have been allowed to expire or at least require reauthorization in the next 4 years . 
mr. chairman , i rise today in very strong support of the renewal of the usa patriot act . 
these changes that were enacted in response to the horrific terrorist attacks on our nation of september 11 , 2001 provided critical tools to our law enforcement in bringing the terrorists to justice and to stopping future attacks , and the result of this law can not be disputed . 
we have broken up terrorist cells in buffalo , in seattle , in portland , northern virginia and in detroit , my home state of michigan . 
these tools have been critical in gathering knowledge on the activities and the targets of the terrorists . 
these tools have assisted in dismantling the terrorist financial network . 
and as i meet with constituents in my district they are continually saying what are we doing to help fight the terrorists ? 
however , i have never heard from one man or woman in my district who has said that their constitutional rights have been violated by any aspect of the patriot act . 
mr. chairman , today we face a new type of enemy , an enemy who preys on the innocent , an enemy who lives in the shadows , an enemy whose tactics are the tactics of cowards . 
and as we saw in london on july 11 and as we are seeing again today , the terrorists are still out there targeting the murder of the innocent . 
and in fact i will predict that other countries will follow the lead of america and what we are doing on the floor of this house today as they enact similar protections for their citizens against these murderers . 
with each fundamental mistreatment of our own citizenry , we broadcast an image around the world that will , in fact , come back to haunt us . 
the patriot act was an attempt in some respects to do this . 
but before commenting on the specifics of the patriot act , i would be derelict if i did not mention that the majority party in this house and the bush administration have really been derelict by not dealing more directly with the threats that we face . 
the biggest threats we face are sabotage , bombings in our mass transit systems , sabotage of our chemical farms , our nuclear plants that could kill thousands of people , yet we do not see funds to deal with this . 
i wish we had real measures to protect our mass transit systems , to protect our vulnerable infrastructure , to protect us against what happened in london again this morning . 
breaking down the wall between intelligence and police information was very necessary and was in the patriot act and is not before us today because most of the patriot act is not before us today . 
we did not do any oversight in this house until 6 months ago . 
the powers granted in section 215 of the patriot act , which is hardly modified by this bill , to look into anybody 's library and medical records in secret and not tell anybody that they have done so , not tell the person whose records are pried into is a very disturbing invasion of liberty , and amendments to limit it were not made in order . 
the amendments to make this constitutional , to say that they have to at least allow for judicial review and to sunset the gag order were not made in order . 
mr. chairman , i ask unanimous consent to claim the time in opposition to the amendment , though i am in support of the amendment . 
the federal court in new york has ruled it unconstitutional for two reasons . 
it does not make section 505 acceptable or even , in my opinion , constitutional , but it goes a good distance towards doing that . 
it fails , in my opinion , in that second provision to reach constitutional status by saying that the showing the government has to make to get an extension of the gag order , the affidavit by the government officer asking for the extension , shall be treated as conclusive unless the court finds that certification was made in bad faith . 
so this amendment goes a considerable distance in the right direction . 
it does not go far enough , in my opinion , to solve the problems with section 505 , but it does go several steps in the right direction , and i commend the sponsor for introducing it , the main sponsor for drafting it , and i support the amendment . 
madam speaker , i rise in support of the motion to instruct . 
these tens of thousands of invasive government demands for sensitive and private information which never even go before a judge have resulted in the collection of probably hundreds of millions of personal facts regarding innocent americans , innocent american residents , citizens , and businesses . 
and the bush administration has decided to file all this personal information in government databases even if no basis is found for a real investigation and they will not even rule out selling this information to private conditions . 
we should have to look into these burdens on our civil liberties at least one in four years and ask are these powers being abused , should they be fine tuned ? 
madam speaker , we are engaged in a serious war with terrorism . 
and now in this war , this administration has resorted to torture , to indefinite detention without trial , to evasions of the great writ of habeas corpus , to going back in some respects to before magna carta . 
this bill continues in that tradition . 
but it also invades our liberties in ways that are very unnecessary . 
moreover , it says that the government 's statements that the information sought is necessary to protect against international terrorism or clandestine intelligence activities are presumptively relevant if the person they pertain to may be an individual in contact with a subject or agent of a foreign power . 
you can not move in court to quash it . 
this is like the writ of assistance the british granted in 1761 which this is very similar to . 
there are good things in this bill , things we need , which is true , but you have got to take it or leave it , because your 3-month extension i will not allow to go through . 
madam speaker , the crippling reach of methamphetamine abuse has become the nation 's leading drug problem today , and this is according to a survey by 500 sheriffs departments in 45 states . 
so it is currently replacing cocaine and heroin in many parts of the country . 
it leads to increased crime , child abuse , increases in the jail population . 
in many parts of the country , almost 40 to 50 percent of the jail population is due to methamphetamine abuse . 
however , the main problem anymore is not the mom-and-pop meth lab out in the countryside . 
right now 60 to 85 percent of the meth in the united states is coming from superlabs in mexico , and this is really hard to trace . 
the one thing that is needed to make methamphetamine is pseudoephedrine or ephedrine , and this is manufactured in only six or seven locations around the world : czechoslovakia , germany , china , southeast asia and so on . 
this bill would make it more difficult for meth manufacturers to obtain the pseudoephedrine necessary for producing the drug in these superlabs . 
this is one thing that gets people 's attention , when you take their foreign aid away , because they are producing meth that is being used in these superlabs . 
the interesting thing that was brought up earlier in the debate , as i watched it from my office on this rule , was that the very thing that the patriot act is supposed to give to this country , that the proponents of it say gives to this country , is being denied on this floor today , and it is being denied because i think people are afraid to be exposed to the truth . 
john stuart mill one time said , in certain occasions , there are people that are unfit for liberty . 
let us not prove to ourselves because of temporary panic or momentary discouragement or in a fit of enthusiasm for an individual , we are suddenly unworthy of our founding fathers ' efforts in order to provide liberty to the folks first , not from the government , but from our birthright . 
mr. chairman , in my rush to get over here , i had not realized that the chairman had already accepted this amendment , and i thank the chairman for that . 
i know the gentleman from arizona ( mr. flake ) xz4001340 and the chairman worked very hard in committee to make sure that they came out with a product that would at least not be as bad as it was when we first passed it in 2001 . 
mr. chairman , i rise in support of this amendment , and i appreciate the opportunity to discuss this issue today as we engage in one of the most important debates that we will have during the 109th congress -- that is , how to ensure that neither our national security nor the individual liberties guaranteed by our constitution are sacrificed to the threat of terrorism . 
the amendment we are offering today narrows the scope of so-called `` sneak-and-peek '' delayed notification search warrants and reins in the far-reaching power that we hastily gave the federal government in the frightening and chaotic days following the 9/11 attacks . 
we have often heard that `` sneak and peek '' warrants were used before the passage of the usa patriot act , and i recognize that the courts have upheld their use in limited and extraordinary circumstances . 
however , it deeply disturbs me that in codifying this practice we did not employ the notification procedure upheld by most courts before the patriot act or practice due caution in an effort to protect our fourth amendment rights . 
our amendment today is an important step toward reinstituting those precious checks and balances that make this a valuable tool for protecting security instead of a threat to the liberties that are given by our creator , recognized by the framers and embodied in our constitution . 
one of my basic concerns with the way that sneak-and-peek was crafted under the patriot act is the extraordinarily broad list of situations in which the power can be used . 
section 213 of this act lists circumstances , including threat to life and destruction of evidence , in which notification of the execution of a search warrant may be delayed . 
however , the last provision of this list is so vague , so broad , and so all-encompassing that it essentially expands the use of this tool to any investigation in which it would be easier for law enforcement to deny suspects the constitutional right of notification . 
our amendment today takes one of the first steps toward rectifying this serious flaw in the original patriot act language by eliminating part of this `` catch-all '' provision . 
in addition , it includes reporting language so that we in congress know when delayed notification is requested and in what circumstances it is used . 
in the fourth amendment , the framers endorsed the principle that it is the government 's role to protect our right to individual privacy , not to encroach upon it . 
madam speaker , i rise in support of the motion to instruct . 
we have heard much from many sides about the usa patrlot act -- concerns about what the bill does , statements about what it does not do , and fears about what it could do in the future . 
but earlier this year we had an important opportunity to move those conversations back to congress to examine -- in a light much more clear and objective than that in which we passed the original bill -- how the patrlot act has protected us from further terrorist attack , and also how balance between national security and personal security needs to be restored . 
as a result of the opportunity to debate , deliberate , and discuss , we made important changes to the original usa patrlot act in h.r. 3199 , changes that enable law enforcement to continue to investigate and prosecute crime while protecting civil liberties . 
this sunset served us well , and so i am perplexed that in the same bill where we made vital revisions to the usa patrlot act we also eliminated many of the sunsets and extended others for a decade or more . 
in doing so , h.r. 3199 takes away from congress the opportunity to periodically review these provisions and ensure that the tools they provide law enforcement are necessary and that they are not being abused . 
i am glad that , in respect to sections 206 and 215 of the usa patrlot act , the senate did not act as rashly as we did . 
i strongly urge conferees to see the wisdom of four-year sunsets for these sections , as passed by the senate , and i ask my colleagues to join me in supporting this motion to instruct . 
mr. chairman , anyone who was serving in congress on september 11 , 2001 , will never forget the day . 
we watched television in horror as the world trade center collapsed , and then were rushed out of the u.s. capitol when flight 77 crashed into the pentagon . 
as chairman of the house financial services committee , i was proud to help author the antiterrorist financing provisions in the act . 
more than $ 147 million in assets have been frozen and roughly $ 65 million seized since 9/11 . 
the u.s. has broken up suspected terrorist financing networks , including one in my home state of ohio . 
our terrorist financing tools were further augmented by the intelligence reform act approved in the wake of the 9/11 commission report . 
as a former fbi agent , i have found other parts of the patriot act just as vital in the defense of our freedoms . 
as we have been reminded by the two rounds of bombings in london , the reality of terrorism remains very much with us . 
the toll that these attacks take is so terrible that the only acceptable approach is to prevent them in the first place . 
tying intercept authority to an individual rather than a particular communication device is simply common sense in this era of throwaway cell phones and e-mail . 
sunsetting this authority sends the wrong message to our law enforcement agencies : it indicates that our trust in them is incomplete at a time when their services have never proven more important . 
the law has come under misguided criticism from some quarters , and i am constantly answering questions from my congressional district in response to myths surrounding the act . 
i feel confident in saying that terrorists make no such distinction . 
mr. chairman , i rise in opposition to the amendment . 
under this amendment , both the office of foreign assets control ( ofac ) and the financial crimes enforcement network ( fincen ) , which are components of the treasury department that are on the front lines of our country 's efforts to detect and combat terrorist financing , would be required to divert already scarce resources away from law enforcement in order to comply with the amendment 's overly broad and unrealistic reporting requirements . 
instead of monitoring suspicious financial activity and following money trails that can lead investigators to terrorist plots the committee i chair has extensive experience in the financial services area with regimes that permit individuals to `` opt out '' of information sharing arrangements . 
this amendment , in my judgment , falls far short of the mark . 
millions of dollars in terrorist assets have been frozen or seized since 9/11 . 
we have broken up suspected terrorist financing networks , including one in my home state of ohio . 
the terrorist financing tools included in the act were further supplemented by the intelligence reform legislation approved in the wake of the 9/11 commission 's report . 
as a former special agent of the fbi , i know that other sections of the patriot act have proven just as vital in assisting law enforcement combat the new threat of international terrorism . 
including any sunset sends the wrong signal to our law enforcement agencies , indicating that our trust in them is incomplete at a time when their services have helped prevent further terrorist attacks . 
as one of the few members of congress who has conducted undercover surveillance , i can tell you now that the need for roving wiretap authority will not expire in 7 years . 
tying intercept authority to an individual suspect rather than a particular communication device is simply common sense in this era of throwaway cell phones and e-mail . 
`` it is the sense of congress that the federal government should not investigate any american citizen for alleged criminal conduct solely on the basis of citizen 's membership in a nonviolent political organization or the fact that the citizen was engaging in other lawful political activity. '' it seems like this should go without saying . 
but our history shows that there has been abuse in this area . 
in the 1960s we remember that there was wiretapping of martin luther king and other political organizations . 
in the 1970s we know about the illegal wiretapping and other activities associated with watergate , and also in the 1990s we are aware of irs audits of a political and religious organization based only on the fact that they were religious and political . 
so this is a restatement of a fundamental principle that should be in our minds and in our law , but i think it is worthwhile to restate . 
and i do recognize that in the patriot act they recognize that the first amendment should be protected , and in this case i think it is an additional statement that we should be respectful of people 's rights to speak out and not be singled out for political or religious viewpoints . 
there have been reports in the paper of different times when the fbi has actually intimidated some people at national conventions . 
but very briefly , i would like to say that the full thrust of this bill bothers me in the fact that i think we are treating a symptom and we are really not doing dealing with the core problem of why there are suicide terrorists willing to attack us , and i think as long as that is ignored we could pass 10 patriot acts stronger than ever and it will not solve the problem unless we eventually get to the bottom of what is the cause . 
and , ironically , in many ways we are making ourselves less free with some of the provisions in this bill . 
mr. chairman , the usa patriot act and terrorism prevention act ( h.r. 3199 ) in no way brings the patriot act into compliance with the constitution or allays concerns that the powers granted to the government in the act will be used to abuse the rights of the people . 
the sunset clauses do perform one useful service in that they force congress to regularly re-examine the patriot act . 
requiring a showing of probable cause before a warrant may be issued will in no way hamper terrorist investigations . 
second , restoring the fourth amendment protections would in no way interfere with the provisions of the patriot act that removed the firewalls that prevented the government 's law enforcement and intelligence agencies from sharing information . 
preparations can be made for the issuance of a warrant in the event of an emergency and allowances can be made for cases where law enforcement does not have time to obtain a warrant . 
in fact , a requirement that law enforcement demonstrate probable cause may help law enforcement focus their efforts on true threats , thus avoiding the problem of information overload that is handicapping the government 's efforts to identify sources of terrorists ' financing . 
the founders recognized that one of the chief dangers to liberty was the concentration of power in a few hands , which is why they carefully divided power among the three branches . 
my colleagues should also keep in mind that patriot act powers have already been used in non-terrorism related cases , most notably in a bribery investigation in nevada . 
however , it still leaves in place large chunks of legislation that threaten individual liberty by giving law enforcement power to snoop into american citizens ' lives without adequate oversight . 
i join them and each and every one of our colleagues in expressing our admiration for the people of great britain for their strength and their courage . 
in doing so , we must also protect and defend the constitution , as i mentioned . 
and we can not , because of any negligence in terms of protecting the american people in terms of homeland security , take it out on their civil liberties . 
our founding fathers in their great wisdom understood the balance between security and liberty . 
and so they knew that in order to have a democracy and to have freedom and to have liberty and to ensure it and to protect the people , they had to create that balance . 
ninety percent of it is in the law . 
and because they were controversial , in a bipartisan way , these provisions were sunsetted . 
there was a limit to how long they would be in effect . 
it simply has not happened in an effective way . 
i again listened intently to the gentleman from virginia ( mr. boucher ) xz4000430 when he described in detail the serious constitutional issues concerning section 505 , national security letter orders , by which government possesses power to seize citizens ' medical and other personal records without notice , without the ability to challenge these orders , and without meaningful time limitations . 
and for this reason , i will join the gentleman from virginia ( mr. boucher ) xz4000430 in opposing this legislation but with the hope that it will be improved in conference and then , when it comes back to this body , that we will be able to all support a patriot act extension that protects the american people , gives law enforcement the tools they need without seriously curtailing the privacy and civil liberties of the american people . 
in fact , the attorney general has admitted that the information on its use of the patriot act has not been forthcoming to congress in a timely manner . 
usa today said in an editorial : `` congress has an opportunity to ... .. 
we must honor their legacy in however we vote today . 
i would hope that even those who support the bill do so in the hope that it will come back a better bill from conference . 
i thank all who have participated in this very important debate and hope that at the end of the day , and i hope it is not a day with a very long sunset , but at the end of the day that we can all get behind a patriot act extension that does respect the civil liberties of the american people . 
madam speaker , i thank the gentleman for yielding , and thank you , mr. conyers , our ranking member on the judiciary committee , for being such an outstanding leader in protecting our civil liberties and also the national security of our country . 
we are not voting for the reauthorization of the patriot act in general . 
in doing so , we must also preserve the balance between security and civil liberties and to recognize that not all of the tools law enforcement officers want are tools that they legitimately need . 
they knew that you can not have security without liberty and liberty without security in a democracy . 
this is the same for every american , and any information , including your most sensitive personal data , along with that of thousands of american citizens gathered by these national security letter requests , will be held in perpetuity by law enforcement . 
just think of it : you do not know , the recipient of the letter who is in possession of your information can not tell you . 
unfortunately , the bush administration and the republican congress have been delinquent in the oversight of the patriot act . 
we must always remember as we protect and defend the american people , we must honor the oath of office we take here when we are sworn in to protect and defend the constitution and the civil liberties that it contains . 
mr. chairman , i thank the distinguished chairman for yielding me time , and especially i rise to thank the gentleman from wisconsin ( chairman sensenbrenner ) for his tireless efforts on behalf of the security and the liberty of the american people in developing this reauthorizing legislation . 
today in london we have seen yet again the work of terrorists on the soil of a freedom-loving people . 
the explosions in that city today , while less lethal than a few weeks ago , follow the deadly attacks that took place on july 7 , and the anguish in london is a vivid reminder of why we can not relent in taking the steps necessary to defend our homeland from a present terrorist threat . 
i saw the evil of our enemies written in the smoke rising above the pentagon . 
and we are reminded yet today that their desire to do such violence in our homeland and in the homeland of our allies is real . 
the patriot act is essential to our continued success in the war on terror here at home . 
in the last 4 years under the patriot act , we have seen a great increase in the ability of law enforcement officials to investigate and track terrorists . 
for example , aided by provisions of the patriot act , law enforcement officials in ohio were able to arrest iyman faris , an ohio truck driver who authorities said plotted attacks on the brooklyn bridge and a central ohio shopping mall . 
in 2003 , he pleaded guilty to charges of aiding and abetting terrorism and conspiracy , acknowledging that he had met with osama bin laden in the year 2000 at an al qaeda training camp and then was provided assistance by al qaeda . 
therefore , the usa patriot and terrorism prevention reauthorization act of 2005 is as necessary today as the patriot act was when it was originally signed into law in october of 2001 . 
but under the bill , those sections of the act that have caused the greatest concern in the hearts of many millions of americans are set to sunset , sections 206 and 215 , within 10 years , thanks to the leadership of this committee and of this congress . 
i am absolutely convinced that what we have done in this country in a bipartisan way has contributed mightily to the fact that there has not been another major terrorist event in our nation since that awful day . 
the patriot act and the elements which we will reauthorize today are central to the ongoing victory in the war on terror , and i urge its adoption . 
i thank the gentleman from arizona ( mr. flake ) xz4001340 and the gentleman from california ( mr. schiff ) xz4003610 for their tireless advocacy of the liberties of the american people , and i rise in strong support of the bipartisan flake-schiff amendment . 
president harry truman , i am told , had a plaque on his desk that simply read `` the buck stops here. '' it seems to me that the flake-schiff amendment is all about saying that when it comes to that sacred relationship that the american people feel between their local library and their local bookstore , that the fbi director himself or herself must be directly involved if that relationship is to be intruded upon in the name of an investigation into the war on terror . 
currently the law permits a designee of the director whose rank can not be lower than an assistant special agent in charge to approve section 215 orders , and that will change . 
this amendment , as the gentleman from arizona ( mr. flake ) xz4001340 said earlier , will prevent section 215 from being abused or used in a fishing expedition intruding upon the privacy of ordinary americans in the name of the war on terror . 
again i quote president harry truman 's famous plaque or missive , `` the buck stops here. '' the flake-schiff amendment is simply about saying if the war on terror demands it , when it comes to intruding upon that sacred relationship between the american people and a bookstore or a library , we have to have those who are of the highest accountability in our political system to answer to that . 
since its passage following the september 11 attacks , the patriot act has played a key role in a number of successful operations to protect innocent americans from terrorists . 
now fbi agents , federal prosecutors , and intelligence officials can protect our communities by mr. chairman , the simple truth is that while key provisions of the patriot act are set to expire , as we have learned twice in the past two weeks from events in great britain the terrorist threat that faces the world will not expire . 
unfortunately we have learned that mixed in with these friendly tourists are some who wish to inflict harm on our nation . 
this sentiment is supported by the fact that we now know that planning meetings of the 9/11 hijackers took place in las vegas . 
while this may not be a perfect bill , i do believe that the legislation before us today reflects a compromise that includes the proper balance between security and privacy to face the challenges of the current world we live in as well as the necessary safeguards to protect our fellow citizens against an over-encroaching government . 
i also rise , like my colleagues , understanding that we face a situation that is potentially very dangerous , especially given the events of this morning again in london . 
it has only been in effect for 7 months , which is , in my opinion , an inadequate amount of time for the government and the public to assess the impact this significant expansion of government authorities has . 
we are having this debate today , mr. chairman , because 4 years ago congress had the wisdom to include sunset provisions in the patriot act . 
however , i hope that my colleagues understand that if we are to continue much further down this road we may be doing irreparable damage to civil liberties in this country without sunset provisions . 
mr. chairman , as a former fbi agent , i had occasion to work some pretty bad folks in the city of chicago in working organized crime and public corruption . 
you have to follow the constitution even to go after these child molesters and people who are promoting child pornography , people who are involved in murder and racketeering . 
and we did , and we used the law as we knew it to put somebody in jail . 
we said if a child molester goes into the library and sits down next to your child , there is going to be no safe haven in america . 
all we do in the patriot act is say , look , if we can go after child molesters sitting in the library and bombers who we need to sneak and peak on a warrant , we ought to be able to go after terrorists . 
mr. chairman , it is maddening to me that somebody in america and in england and around the world is getting up in the morning thinking , i am going to kill somebody in an act of terror , and that we somehow fiddle while rome is burning and argue should it be 10 years or 5 years on a renewal or a sunset . 
for those who argue there are some emergency powers in here , you are wrong . 
you should get up and argue against the criminal code every day on this floor , and you should put in bills to remove our ability as agents of the fbi to do that . 
mr. chairman , i rise in reluctant opposition to this bill . 
in 2001 after an attack on the united states and the slaughter of innocent civilians , this congress passed the patriot act , which i supported at that time . 
now we have the patriot act being handed to us again , but instead it is being handed to us in a permanent form . 
you do not make policy for the united states government protecting the rights and freedoms of our people in an extraordinary time as this , a time of war , and then mandate it so it is going to be the rule of our country once we live in peacetime . 
i gladly supported patriot i. now they have taken all but two of the sunset provisions which would make those extraordinary new powers that we gave the government lapse once we have peace in this country . 
and if we are going to in some way expand the power of government over our people in time of war because it is necessary , that should be sunsetted once the war is over . 
by permanently changing america , we are not furthering the cause of freedom in this country . 
mr. speaker , i rise in support of this motion . 
after 9/11 , the united states congress gave our investigative agencies a wide variety of special powers to fight a war on terrorism , an expansion of powers that we would have never approved in peacetime . 
we gave our agencies , among those other things , the right to wiretap and intercept phone and computer communications without prior cause , and in general we lowered the requirement for lawful searches . 
in times of emergency , it is responsible to increase the power of our government , yet we recognize that these powers should contain sunset provisions . 
we should not be required to live in peacetime under the extraordinary laws that were passed during times of war and crisis . 
what we are doing here in this motion to recommit is establishing the sunsets so that 4 years from now , hopefully when we have beaten the terrorists , we can return to normal constitutional protections , and if not , we can reestablish another situation . 
madam speaker , first and foremost , i yield myself a moment here to thank the gentleman from virginia ( mr. boucher ) xz4000430 for the time that he has yielded us and shown good faith with us in having an honest discussion of this very significant issue . 
madam speaker , i rise in strong support of this motion to instruct conferees on the patriot act . 
let me note that i am one of several , if not many , members of congress who feel that it was an act of bad faith on the part of those in this body who turned the temporary sunsetted provisions of the patriot act into permanent law for the united states of america . 
i supported the patriot act and would have again voted for the patriot act as it was when we first voted for it , except now we end up with a patriot act that permanently changes the balance of power in the united states between the police power and the limitations of power of the policing authorities of the federal government . 
second of all , let me note that any , any investigation or hearings that we have had so far into the patriot act are irrelevant to the issue at hand , the issue at hand as to whether or not we have permanently changed this law and whether in the future there could be abuse . 
i would say , along with many others , that by permanently granting these excessive powers , or extended powers , to the federal government in a time of war and then permanently extending it so that now it is the norm for a time of peace is asking for abuse . 
so whatever hearings have been held so far in this conflict are irrelevant . 
i voted for the patriot act , as i just said , and i continue to support its provisions as a necessary expansion of police powers in order to prosecute this war on islamofacism . 
however , as i said in the original bill , sunset provisions were placed in all of these expanded police powers that were going to enable us to protect our people in this time of war . 
the expanded authority we are talking about in terms of eliminating these sunsets in the current bill , this has nothing to do with fighting the war or winning the war on terror . 
it has everything to do with using that war as an excuse to permanently change the way we do business in the united states . 
the special grants of police power that we have approved we believe should only last for the duration of the war , and we must demand at least a forced reexamination of these provisions to ensure that winning the war on terror does not result in a permanent change of our way of life . 
today , we are limited to instructing conferees to adopt the senate 's version of the bill , which would sunset in 4 years the same two provisions that the house bill would sunset in 10 years . 
the rest of the expansion of the police powers , such as the sneak-and-peak searches , internet and credit card seizures , the lowering of standards for logging all calls dialed from one particular phone , and the rules against discussing property seizure , all without the traditional warrants that would be required for those activities , have been made permanent in u.s. law . 
this should be reexamined before 10 years has lapsed if for no other reason than to just understand whether or not this tool is working for us in the war on terror . 
is it achieving the goals that it set out to achieve in this war ? 
the senate version sunsets the clause in 4 years ; that is much more responsible . 
section 215 will also be sunsetted in 2015 in the house version rather than in the 5 years in the senate bill . 
this section allows for law enforcement to examine library and financial records of any person in connection with a federal investigation . 
this provision is possibly the most controversial in the entire bill . 
my colleagues on one side of the aisle say that this is an unconscionable invasion of privacy , never justified , even in wartime . 
nonetheless , this section 215 may be needed in a time of war to secure our country and to make sure our people are safe . 
we do not want to have that kind of power in the hands of the federal police authorities after this war is over . 
they hate our tolerances , our belief in the equality before the law , the right of those of other faiths to worship , and the right of us to express our beliefs . 
in short , radical islam is the enemy of freedom ; thus , they are our enemy . 
if we permanently alter the traditional limitations of our government here in america , the terrorists have won . 
during no war in the past , whether world war ii or the cold war , were the police powers of the federal government permanently changed so that after the war a new standard of government would exist . 
that is not the question , because when we voted for those expansions , we put in a sunset clause that after a certain number of years , 4 years , that the issues of those expanded authorities would be re-examined . 
the only question at hand in the debate today is whether or not those expanded powers for wartime expansion in the war against radical islam should be made permanent even now in this time of crisis . 
but that still does in no way justify permanently expanding those powers so that once the gentleman from wisconsin is no longer here to conduct hearings that the federal government still has those powers perhaps for people who are less , let us say less responsible than mr. sensenbrenner xz4003650 in overseeing those expanded powers . 
mr. speaker , i rise in support of this rule but in opposition to the underlying bill , the so-called patriot act , the usa patriot act . 
but my original support was based on the inclusion of 4-year sunsets in those sections of the patriot act , those sections that drastically expanded the police and investigative powers of the federal government . 
that is what was included in the original patriot act . 
of the 16 sunset provisions , sections sunsetted in the original 2001 bill , the current conference committee report establishes 4-year sunsets on only two of those 16 . 
there is no excuse in peacetime to give our police and our investigative agencies wartime powers , and that is what we are doing here . 
there have been a few improvements in the bill but not enough improvements , as far as i am concerned , for us to support it . 
my central theme has always been based on the need for periodic review by congress of all those dramatic expansions of police power that we are giving our government now in order to win this war on terrorism . 
we should not live in peacetime under the extraordinary laws passed during times of war and crisis . 
madam speaker , i rise in opposition to this conference report which would reauthorize the patriot act by making permanent the expansions of federal police powers that were temporarily put into the original bill and sunsetted in that bill . 
i am unmoved by the argument that we can have faith that , in the future , that there will be proper oversight because there has been proper oversight so far in determining whether or not the new police powers that were put in the original patriot act were abused . 
let me note that the people in the pro-life movement should take note of what is happening here because the expanded police powers of the federal government will be used against them . 
proposition 187 , the anti-illegal immigration group in california , the fbi went after them in the last administration . 
that is not what our founding fathers had in mind . 
our founding fathers said , only temporarily increase those powers in an emergency . 
mr. chairman , i rise in opposition to h.r. 3199 , the reauthorization of 16 expiring sections of the patriot act , which weakens the safeguards currently in place to protect innocent americans from sweeping searches and surveillance by the government . 
in fact , i supported the original bill passed in 2001 because it included provisions which were legitimately needed by law enforcement in order to better pursue terrorists . 
nor does the bill provide law enforcement with any additional real and meaningful tools necessary to help our nation prevail in the war against terrorism . 
preserving a 4-year sunset for these 16 provisions in the patriot act is one of congress 's strongest mechanisms for maintaining oversight and accountability over expanded government controls that could potentially undermine civil rights and civil liberties . 
we are talking about critical issues that will set the precedence for the rights of people in our country for many years to come . 
another amendment would have included the sunset provisions originally in the patriot act to promote accountability and congressional oversight . 
even though some in our government may claim that civil liberties must be compromised in order to protect the public , we must be wary of what we are giving up in the name of fighting terrorism . 
history has taught us to carefully safeguard our civil liberties -- especially in times of fear and national outrage . 
we all want to fight terrorism , but we need to fight it the right way , consistent with the constitution , and in a manner that serves as a model for the rest of the world . 
mr. chairman , we are all watching what is happening in london ; and with that backdrop , we are discussing reauthorizing the patriot act today . 
mr. speaker , i rise in strong opposition to this rule and to the underlying legislation . 
i rise in opposition not just because an important amendment that i offered , along with the gentleman from michigan ( mr. conyers ) xz4000800 , the gentleman from texas ( mr. paul ) xz4003110 , the gentleman from new york ( mr. nadler ) xz4002890 , the gentleman from new mexico ( mr. udall ) xz4004122 , and the gentlewoman from california ( ms. eshoo ) xz4001240 was not accepted by the committee on rules , but because this very same amendment has already been passed on the floor of this house by a 51-vote margin just a few weeks ago . 
we voted on that by a 238-187 vote ; and now , a few weeks later , this provision is not included in the bill , and the republican leadership has refused to allow the members to even vote on it . 
number one , every member of this body is pledged to do everything that he or she can to protect the american people from the horrendous scourge of terrorism , but some of us have more confidence in our law enforcement agencies and the american people than others do . 
let all of us remember that in the 1940s innocent japanese americans , without any pretext , were herded into internment camps . 
in the 1960s , a president of the united states had a file on him , president kennedy , by the fbi . 
in the 1960s , martin luther king , jr. , who some of us consider to be one of the great heroes of the 20th century , was hounded and investigated by the fbi . 
the issue today is how do we effectively fight terrorism , but do it in a way which protects the constitutional rights which make us a free country . 
mr. speaker , i rise in strong opposition to this conference report . 
all of us are in agreement that the united states government must do everything it can do to effectively fight terrorism and protect the american people from another terrorist attack . 
but some of us believe that with strong , well-trained and well-funded law enforcement , we can in fact protect the american people without undermining the constitutional rights that make us a free country . 
in that regard , i am happy to say that there has been a very strong coming together of members of congress and americans from very different political perspectives , people who usually agree on nothing but who have come together to protect the constitutional rights of the american people as we fight terrorism . 
in that regard , are my republican friends really comfortable with allowing the fbi to access americans ' reading records , gun records , medical records and financial records without judicial approval ; allowing the fbi to search someone 's home without probable cause and without telling that person about the search ; allowing the fbi to serve a librarian or a bookstore owner with a section 215 order demanding records without having to provide facts that a person whose records are being sought is involved in a terrorist investigation ? 
reserving the right to object , mr. chairman , i am in strong opposition to the underlying amendment , and i also have great concerns about the unanimous consent request . 
mr. chairman , i believe the unanimous consent request is designed to make minimal changes in the underlying amendment . 
mr. chairman , although not in opposition , i ask unanimous consent to control the balance of the time in opposition to the amendment . 
mr. chairman , i rise today to urge my colleagues to support the flake-schiff amendment , which would make an important change to section 215 if it is ever used in the library or bookstore context . 
this amendment is substantially similar to one i offered in the committee on the judiciary with the gentlewoman from california ( ms. waters ) xz4004220 , but one i agreed to withdraw in order to work with the gentleman from arizona ( mr. flake ) xz4001340 in a bipartisan fashion on a proposal for consideration on the house floor . 
as of the latest public disclosure , the justice department has reported that section 215 has never been used in a library . 
the fact , however , that this provision may never have been used in a library to date does not alter the fact that it affects the behavior of all of our constituents who are concerned that their records may one day be the subject of a search . 
the bipartisan patriot act proposal in the senate makes a similar change , restricting this authority to the fbi director or deputy director . 
i think our amendment provides an even stronger safeguard and strikes a balance that will restore a measure of public confidence in this area . 
while i am appreciative that the committee on rules made the flake-schiff amendment in order , i am disappointed that the sanders amendment was not also made in order . 
we must permanently limit the statutory authorization to use section 215 in libraries and bookstores . 
i expect and encourage the gentleman from vermont ( mr. sanders ) xz4003570 to bring his amendment before the house floor each year to further limit the use of section 215 with respect to specific lists and records in libraries and bookstores . 
but , for now , since the amendment only applies for 1 year and only applies to specific items in the library , i think it is important and necessary for the house to pass this broader and permanent change to the patriot act . 
our legislation is aimed at filling a gaping hole in our defense against terrorism and making america 's ports , passengers and cargos safer . 
there are 361 seaports in the united states that serve essential national interests by facilitating the flow of trade and the movement of cruise passengers , as well as supporting the effective and safe deployment of u.s. armed forces . 
a single container has room for as much as 60 , 000 pounds of explosives , 10 to 15 times the amount in the ryder truck used to blow up the murrah federal building in oklahoma city . 
many seaports are still protected by little more than a chain link fence and in far too many instances have no adequate safeguards to ensure that only authorized personnel can access sensitive areas of the port . 
strengthening criminal penalties , as the gentleman from north carolina ( chairman coble ) and i proposed with our bill and in this amendment , is one way we can make our nation 's ports less vulnerable by filling this hole in our defense against terrorism and making america 's ports , passengers and cargo safer . 
when i offered this originally as stand-alone legislation in connection with another bill as an amendment , the chairman offered to work with me on this further down the line ; and every bit true to his word , he has been a great partner to work with on this . 
mr. chairman , we live in a democracy where we respect checks and balances . 
those are not in the patriot act , but we are considering the patriot act in that context . 
we considered a bill on the same day of the second bombing in great britain with no money for port security , no money to secure our rails or bus transportation , no money for first responders . 
mr. chairman , i oppose this bill , frankly not so much for what is in the bill but for what is not in the bill , what we are not going to do today . 
the major check on any abuse in the act has been the sunset provisions . 
some of it came in right before the hearing , but because of the sunset we got a lot of cooperation . 
because of the sunset we found no abuses in the libraries . 
they could have , because of the broad discretion in the bill , but they did not , because of the sunset . 
mr. chairman , i ask unanimous consent to control the time in opposition , although i am not in opposition . 
there are no attorneys ' fees allowed in these proceedings , and it is just more likely that they will just give up somebody 's information . 
mr. chairman , i ask unanimous consent to claim the time in opposition , although i will not oppose the amendment . 
it would be helpful if we had considered this in committee where we could have gotten the definitions straight . 
in addition to that , there are problems with the death penalties in the bill . 
it also would create new death penalties even in states that do not include a death penalty . 
that would go a long way in making us more secure . 
having four amendments like this when we have insufficient time to deliberate is not substantially as helpful as the money would have been in making us more secure . 
we could have got the definition straight , and we could have considered it in a more deliberative process rather than trying to deal with it here on the floor where we have some constitutional questions such as the death penalty for conspiracy . 
mr. chairman , i ask unanimous consent to claim the time in opposition , but i am not opposed to the amendment . 
i would like to join my colleague from virginia in his interest in the security of the port of hampton roads . 
it closes an apparent oversight in the fact that it is not a federal crime for a vessel operator to fail to stop when ordered to do so by a federal law enforcement officer , and makes it clear that that is a crime . 
i will not , however , be supporting the amendment because it has several new death penalties in it . 
mr. chairman , death penalties can not be a deterrent to suicide bombers , so that part of the bill i think would not be helpful in terms of port security . 
what we do need in port security is significant increases in funding for port security , funding for bus and rail security , funding for first responders . 
as to the other parts of the bill , i would like to thank the gentleman from california ( mr. schiff ) xz4003610 and the other cosponsors for their hard work in focusing us on port security , which is desperately needed . 
mr. chairman , i ask unanimous consent to claim the time in opposition , although i am not opposed to the amendment . 
mr. chairman , i rise in opposition to this amendment . 
we have not had the opportunity to hear critical testimony on controversial aspects of this bill such as the provision to apply the death penalty to offenses where no death results , the change in alternative jury rules and peremptory challenge rules , another change of the number of jurors needed to impose the death penalty and other changes which could constitute constitutional problems . 
because the bill makes attempts and conspiracies to commit such crimes death penalty eligible , it covers those who may have only had a minor role in the offense . 
if a death results , even if it was not the specific intended result , anyone who is involved in committing or attempting to commit or conspiring to commit the covert offense would be eligible for the death penalty . 
the provisions of this bill create a death penalty liability tantamount to a federal felony murder rule , and it presents constitutional issues as well as questions of the appropriateness of the death penalty in certain cases . 
the provisions of this bill will be duplicative of state jurisdiction laws in many instances and actually conflicting with others . 
another concern we always have to consider is expansion of the death penalty when we know that there is a frequent error rate in applying the death penalty . 
mr. chairman , there is another conflict or difficulty that will arise in the efforts to further international cooperation in pursuing suspected terrorists . 
we are already experiencing difficulties in securing the cooperation of the rest of the civilized world in bringing terrorists to justice due to our existing proliferation of death penalty offenses when other countries will not extradite criminals to the united states if they will be subject to the death penalty . 
it was not marked up in subcommittee or the committee . 
i mean , a senior citizen who has traveled to cuba on a bicycle excursion or a clergy attempting to send humanitarian services or supplies to cuba could get caught up in this . 
it talks about misuse of social security numbers so if somebody misuses a social security number to get a job , having nothing to do with terrorism , just is cheating to get a job , they could get caught up in this . 
all of this is implicated in this amendment . 
people who get caught up in this are looking at 20-year sentences . 
we also have had not an opportunity to hear from people that may be involved in this , organizations helping immigrant populations , banks or other agencies that may have an interest in this who we just have not had time to hear from to know what their reaction would be . 
mr. chairman , this provides mandatory minimums , which we have frequently said if it had come up in committee we would have a letter ready from the judicial conference reminding us that mandatory minimums violate common sense , because if the penalty makes sense , it can be imposed ; if it does not make sense , it has to be imposed anyway . 
it is already a crime punishable by 20 years in prison , or life in prison in some circumstances , to provide material support of any kind to a terrorist organization or to support a person in carrying out terrorist acts regardless of how the money came about , whether it was from drug proceeds or otherwise . 
if anyone is engaged in drug trafficking of any significance in order to support terrorism , they can already be charged with both a drug offense and the material support of terrorism . 
this might , unfortunately , bring in some small-time dealer that did not know what he was doing and all of a sudden he is subjected to 20-year mandatory minimums when he was not much of a dealer at all . 
this new crime would substantially broaden the federal death penalty in ways that might actually violate the constitution . 
drug trafficking and terrorism crimes already carry numerous penalties for the most egregious offenses , so we do not need them anew in this case . 
we did not put it into the bill in committee when we would have had an opportunity to ensure it did not conflict with various other provisions of the law or was unnecessarily duplicative . 
this may be a crime where high sentences may be appropriate ; and if they are appropriate in the individual case , they can be applied . 
that is why we get a letter from the judicial conference every time we have a bill before us with mandatory minimums in it , they remind us that the mandatory minimums violate common sense . 
madam speaker , i rise in support of the motion to instruct . 
under the roving wiretaps provision , after obtaining a roving wiretap from the secret fisa court , the fbi can follow the target around and tap any phone the target has access to , including yours if he or she happens to be a neighbor and comes to your house , without having to first determine that the phone is actually being used by the target before they start listening in . 
the 4-year sunsets worked to make the justice department responsive to congress in providing the information needed to properly perform its oversight responsibility for the extraordinary powers extended under the patriot act , but only in the last year of the sunset . 
it was only in the last year of the sunset that we were finally told that there had been no 215 orders issued to libraries , then we learned that this was misleading because most libraries cooperated with fbi requests for information without requiring a 215 order , and with all the secrecy and gag orders in effect , we still do n't know what the full story is . 
perhaps some of the pending lawsuits will finally reveal what has been going on in this area . 
the problem with a 10-year sunset is that it will have no impact on the current administration , or the next one and only have an impact in the last year of the 3rd administration from now . 
moreover , with a 20-year retirement period for most career officials , in 10 years most of today 's officials will have retired . 
so , that 's really of little oversight value if we have to wait that long to get the kind of responsive information for oversight we were finally able to get in the last year of the current sunsets . 
mr. chairman , i yield myself such time as i may consume , and i rise in strong support of h.r. 3199 , the usa patriot and terrorism prevention reauthorization act of 2005 . 
on that day , foreign terrorists maliciously and without provocation attacked the united states , murdered thousands of our citizens , and destroyed symbols of our freedom in a failed effort to break the spirit and resolve of the american people . 
in the wake of the 9/11 atrocities , broad bipartisan majorities in both houses of congress passed the patriot act that lowered the wall that prohibited our law enforcement and intelligence communities from effectively sharing information , and to enhance investigatory tools necessary to assess , detect , and prevent future terrorist attacks . 
u.s. law enforcement and intelligence authorities have utilized the expanded information sharing provisions contained in the patriot act to gain critical knowledge of the attentions of foreign-based terrorists before they occur , while preempting gathering terrorist threats at home . 
exactly 2 weeks ago , innocent citizens in london were murdered in a series of ruthlessly coordinated attacks . 
when the house committee on the judiciary reported the patriot act in october 2001 , i pledged to rigorously examine its implementation and the conduct of the war against terrorism . 
in my words and in my actions as committee chair , i have maintained this commitment and emphasized the importance of better protecting our citizenry from terrorist attack while , at the same time preserving the values and liberties that distinguish us as americans . 
the gentleman from virginia ( mr. boucher ) xz4000430 is sincere in his opposition to this bill , and i respect that . 
that was legislation that was in place prior to october 2001 when the original patriot act was passed and signed into law by the president . 
what the patriot act did in both national security letters as well as in delayed notification warrants was simply to extend to anti-terrorism investigations authorities that already existed and up until that time had been found constitutional in investigations such as mafia investigations , racketeering investigations , and drug-trafficking investigations . 
they were caused by existing legislation , and we should deal with that , not in the context of this bill but elsewhere . 
the delayed notification or so-called `` sneak-and-peek '' warrants were authorized in the late seventies for purposes of racketeering and drug-trafficking investigations and were held constitutional by the supreme court in the early eighties as not violative of the fourth amendment . 
i do not see any sunsets coming on bills coming out of the committee on international relations because i have faith in the gentleman from california 's ( mr. rohrabacher ) xz4003430 being able to do effective oversight . 
there has been more process and more hearings and more witnesses on more sides of the issue on the patriot act than practically any other piece of legislation that i have faced in my 26-plus years as a member of congress . 
i wish i had brought all of the paper that has come about as a result of the committee on the judiciary 's oversight , because it would stack this high off the table here in the house chamber . 
( part ii ) : honorable kenneth l. wainstein , u.s. attorney for the district of columbia ( majority witness ) ; james baker , office for intelligence policy and review , u.s. department of justice ( majority witness ) ; robert khuzami , former assistant united states attorney in the united states attorney 's office for the southern district of new york ( majority witness ) ; and greg nojeim , the associate director and chief legislative counsel of the american civil liberties union 's washington national office ( minority witness ) . 
mccaul , michael -- u.s. representative & amp ; former chief of counterterrorism and national security for the u.s. attorney 's office in western judicial district of texas 23 . 
wainstein , kenneth l. -- interim u.s. attorney , district of columbia witnesses testifying in their capacity as former government officials 1 . 
mccaul , michael -- u.s. representative & amp ; former chief of counterterrorism and national security for the u.s attorney 's office in western judicial district of texas non-government witnesses 1 . 
in response to our request , the department of justice gave two separate briefings to members , counsel , and staff : during the briefing held on august 7 , 2003 , department officials covered the long-standing authority for law enforcement to conduct delayed searches and collect business records , as well as the effect of the usa patriot act on those authorities . 
a u.s. district judge in washington state executed or authorized a delayed-notification warrant to look into a building on the u.s. side of the northern border . 
shortly thereafter , a u.s. district judge authorized the installation of cameras and listening devices in the home to monitor the activities in the home . 
ninety-three pounds of marijuana were found in these bags when the washington state patrol stopped the car . 
and if they can bring 93 pounds of marijuana in , they can bring terrorists in as well . 
in this bill we have had 12 hearings with 35 witnesses , people who have come from all over the spectrum ; and 13 of the 16 sections of the patriot act that are sunsetted are not controversial . 
mr. chairman , i believe this amendment is a good one because it centralizes responsibility in the hands of the director of the fbi in signing off on 215 applications for bookstore and library records . 
but in the context of the overall debate , what i think is missing from this debate is not whether there is a potential for abuse by the justice department , but whether there is an actual record of abuse . 
mr. chairman , i rise in support of his amendment . 
so the terrorists and the drug smugglers and the racketeers simply conducted their business on cell phones because you could not determine whether or not the cell phone was actually being used within the district in which the federal court that issued the roving wiretap order sat . 
right here is the result of the oversight that the judiciary committee has done in the last 3 1/2 years on this law . 
mr. chairman , i am pleased to support the gentlewoman 's amendment and believe that it is an important consolidation in the criminal law relative to attacks against mass transportation systems . 
we should have uniform penalties and uniform definitions of criminal activity so someone who attacks a railroad will get the same penalty as someone would in a similar attack against a subway system or a bus or an airplane . 
we should not have a lesser penalty if you put a bomb in the station than if you blow up a train while it is crossing a bridge over a big gorge . 
mr. chairman , i thank the gentleman for yielding to me , and , mr. chairman , i rise in support of the amendment offered by the gentleman from arizona ( mr. flake ) xz4001340 . 
one of the things that the bill did in section 215 was to provide a procedure for challenging a section 215 order . 
what this does is it codifies procedures for challenging the receipt of national security letters , and i think that this is a step in the right direction . 
a place where it would be issued would be to get records that are in the custody of someone who may have information relative to the target of the investigation . 
for example , it appears that one of the people who was involved in the london bombing 2 weeks ago studied at the university of north carolina . 
the amendment that the gentlewoman from california has introduced is going to make it very difficult to conduct any type of criminal or terrorist investigation using a national security letter because it basically eviscerates the nondisclosure rules that national security letters and literally all other tools in criminal investigations have attached to them . 
i think the last thing in the world the american public wants to see is if somebody gets a national security letter or a grand jury subpoena or testifies before the grand jury , something in the newspaper that says that john doe is being investigated . 
and if john doe is really involved in criminal or terrorist activities , that is going to be a tip-off that the feds are on the heels of john and maybe he ought to flee the country or do other things to eliminate the evidence that would be used to convict that person of the crime that he has either committed or a crime that he is in a conspiracy with others to commit . 
and if that evidence that was being collected ended up being disclosed and became a matter of discourse in the public press , i do not know how law enforcement would be able to complete its investigation to go after those that are suspected of criminal or terrorist activities . 
and if they do their investigation and issue national security letters and find out that the person that the tip was lodged against is up to absolutely no criminal or terrorist activity , if that person 's name gets in the newspaper , their reputation is destroyed even though they are innocent . 
mr. chairman , i ask unanimous consent to claim the time in opposition , even though i am not in opposition to the amendment . 
but on the canadian side of the border the entrance to the tunnel was in a building . 
so the contraband was stored in this building , was put into the tunnel , taken underneath the border and exited in the united states . 
now , the tunnel that i showed in the first picture was big enough to smuggle terrorists across the border , should it be used for that purpose . 
mr. chairman , i rise in support of the berman-delahunt amendment . 
i grant the members that the amendment probably is not properly drafted and we can fix this in conference , and i appreciate the commitment of the chairman of the permanent select committee on intelligence to do that , but i do not think we should turn it down and send a message to the agencies that they can data mine all they want and we are not going to do anything about it . 
mr. chairman , i ask unanimous consent claim the time in opposition , even though i am not opposed to the amendment . 
he also testified that since that prosecution , material support charges have been used against other cigarette smuggling plots in detroit . 
from this information , it is obvious that the terrorists are using cigarette smuggling in order to help finance their activities , and that is why the amendment offered by the gentleman from north carolina is a good amendment . 
it fits in with the antiterrorism tools that the patriot act reauthorizes , and i would urge its support . 
that has been taken care of in the modification . 
mr. chairman , i rise in support of the amendment and thank the gentlewoman from pennsylvania ( ms. hart ) xz4001680 for yielding to me and for introducing this amendment . 
let me say that this amendment makes important improvements in the financial provisions of the patriot act with regard to those who try to prevent terrorists from financing their operations . 
i am particularly pleased that there are some changes in the law to attempt to get at the informal money-changing operation called hawalas when those hawalas are used to finance terrorist organizations , and more and more money seems to be transferred through the hawalas system ; and i am awfully afraid that that is not being done for legitimate purposes , but for the fact that the regular banking operations are under increasing scrutiny when money transfers take place . 
i realize that this amendment must be further honed , and i pledge to the gentlewoman from texas my cooperation to attempt to do that in conference . 
mr. chairman , let me say that i think the gentleman from texas ( mr. sessions ) xz4003670 has spotted a loophole in our current law and the vulnerability for aircraft that are not passenger aircraft in nature . 
i think it merely restates the fact that people who are not involved in criminal or terrorist activities have nothing to fear from the patriot act . 
as long as the political association is not involved in criminal terrorist activities , we ought to encourage it even if their views are something that we disagree with . 
mr. chairman , i ask unanimous consent to claim the time in opposition , even though i am not opposed to the amendment . 
we did not know how to divide up the first responder grants properly , so we put a formula in . 
as a result , in the last congress the committee on the judiciary and the select committee on homeland security worked out an agreement where the formula would be modified , where there would be certain floors for states , a lot of the money would be threat-based and the types of grants were consolidated so that there would be a simpler application process . 
we have attempted to redo the first responder grants again in this congress , and there is no hope that the other body will take the stand-alone bill and enact it into law . 
by adopting this amendment , we are going to be in a stronger position to actually make the needed changes in the formula law of the united states of america this year without further delay . 
mr. speaker , i rise in opposition to the motion to recommit . 
first of all , there has been no provision , of the 16 sunsetted provisions , that have been found unconstitutional by any federal court in the nation . 
this motion to recommit will bring that wall back up in 2009 . 
the lone wolf provision was not passed as a part of the patriot act in october 2001 , but was included as a part of the intelligence bill which was enacted into law a little bit less than a year ago . 
so as a result , the committees and the public have not been able to have as extensive oversight and for as long a period of time as the other 16 provisions that were sunsetted in the act which the president signed in october 2001 . 
on the other hand , let me say that we are negotiating with the senate at the present time on what the length of the sunset is , and i think that the sunset on this provision will be longer than 4 years , and the sunset on the other two provisions that were contained in the house-passed bill will be shorter than the 10 years that the house of representatives placed in the bill , which was passed and sent over to the other body . 
i have been extremely vigorous , since the enactment of the patriot act , in doing oversight over what the department of justice has done relative to that law , and i am happy to say that most of the oversight letters that have been sent to the attorney general have been cosigned by the gentleman from michigan ( mr. conyers ) xz4000800 , ranking member of the judiciary committee . 
in addition to the oversight which was done , the original patriot act requires the inspector general of the department of justice to report twice a year to the relevant committees of congress the number of civil liberties violations that have been found against the department of justice as a result of its exercising the increased and new requirements and powers in the patriot act . 
further , i resisted a premature repeal or extension of the sunset prior to this congress because i felt it was important that the oversight be done for as long a time as possible so that the congress will be able to look over the shoulder of the department of justice and find out whether or not they were doing it the right way or whether or not they needed a tap on the shoulder from capitol hill for improvements in their methods of operation . 
getting rid of the 14 of the 16 sunset provisions that were contained in the original patriot act does not mean that the justice department is not going to have the committee looking over its shoulder . 
because the motion to instruct only relates to the lone wolf provision and i believe that because we have had a much shorter period of time in viewing how they have dealt with the lone wolf provision because it was passed 3 years after the original patriot act was enacted into law , i think this motion to instruct is a proper one , although i do think that the difference between 4 years and 7 years still should be negotiated with the senate . 
because if you accept the argument that he has made , then the congress should never do oversight because the results of the oversight are not going to make any difference in the policy . 
secondly , of the 16 provisions where law enforcement powers were expanded , there were no allegations of misuse by the justice department in 14 of those 16 provisions . 
and when we had the hearings before the judiciary committee subcommittee on crime , the minority had at least one and , in some cases , two witnesses that could come in and present any information that they wanted to present . 
now , the way we make sure that there is not government overreaching in our system of government is to give the courts the power to declare unconstitutional overreaching by government agencies . 
there has been not one of the 16 expanded powers in the patriot act , signed by president bush in october of 2001 , that has been declared unconstitutional . 
but what has been declared unconstitutional was a provision on national security letters that was put in the patriot act as a renumbering , but which was enacted as a result of a bill that originated in the other body in 1986 . 
madam speaker , i am the author of the sunsets that were put in the patriot act that was signed by the president in october of 2001 because i agreed with what i heard from the gentleman from maryland ( mr. hoyer ) xz4001890 , that we ought to look at what the justice department had done with these expanded powers . 
we have looked at how those expanded powers have been utilized ; and in 14 of the 16 cases , nobody had any complaint about how those expanded powers have been utilized . 
now , sunsets are very rare in congressional action . 
i am proud of the fact that i put the sunsets in almost 4 years ago . 
the authority for the national security letters was passed in 1986 when , i recall , the current minority party had a significant majority in the house of representatives . 
and where there has to be a greater scrutiny on it , such as the two provisions in the house-passed bill and the lone wolf provision that are being talked about , we can talk about future sunsets ; and i support the concept of doing that . 
that is why it is a good law and that is why some provisions should be made permanent and some provisions should be sunsetted to be looked at in the future . 
madam speaker , my staff has prepared for me an opening statement on this bill , and i am going to put the opening statement in the record and not read it , because after listening to the debate on the rule that was just concluded , the amount of misinformation and misleading information that has been placed in the & lt ; /em & gt ; & lt ; em & gt ; congressional record relating to the usa patriot act is just absolutely astounding . 
first of all , let me say that when the original patriot act was enacted in october of 2001 , there were expanded powers that were given to law enforcement in 16 sections , and i was the person that insisted upon a 4-year sunset being placed on each and every one of the powers of law enforcement that were expanded . 
i was successful in that effort , and we have had this sunset , during which time the judiciary committee has conducted vigorous oversight . 
i have heard allegations that have been made on the other side of the aisle that there has been no oversight by the judiciary committee and that we were lacking and that we were negligent in doing the oversight . 
the judiciary committee has done oversight through hearings beginning in 2003 . 
and when we came up to the reauthorization process , i would remind you , madam speaker , and the members of the house of representatives , that i strongly opposed a premature striking of the sunset or extending the sunset in the last congress . 
the two sections that were passed in 2001 that were not made permanent related to section 215 , the business records or so-called library provisions , and the so-called multipoint wiretaps or roving wiretaps in section 206 . 
in both section 215 and in section 206 , we have put in this conference report additional restrictions that protect civil liberties . 
they have been subjected to a 4-year sunset , as requested by the senate , rather than the 10-year sunset in the house-passed bill . 
and if anybody is interested in going into detail as to what those additional protections consist of , i will be happy to do that at a later time . 
the other provision that is sunsetted in this bill was not put in the original usa patriot act , it was put in the intelligence bill that was enacted about a year ago . 
that involved expanding law enforcement powers in the so-called lone wolf terrorist . 
that is also subjected to a 4-year sunset so we can see what happens in terms of how the justice department and law enforcement deals with the issues . 
but the national security letters provision of law was not passed in the patriot act . 
it was passed in 1986 , 15 years before september 11 , in a bill that was written by a member of the other body who has been very critical of this conference report . 
and this conference report , even though the national security letters provisions were not contained in the patriot act , put restrictions on national security letters so that there would be increased disclosure and a potential judicial review process . 
and in the case of the last two matters , the organized crime and racketeering and drug trafficking , the united states supreme court has upheld delayed notification warrants as constitutional and not in violation of the fourth amendment . 
this conference report provides additional civil liberties protection in the area of the business records section , in the area of the delayed notification warrants section , in the area of the roving wiretap section , and in the area of national security letters . 
the patriot act has been a vital tool in the interception and prevention of terrorist activities , and if it is allowed to expire , the first consequence will be that the wall that prevented the cia and the fbi from exchanging intelligence information prior to 9/11 will go back up . 
the consequence of letting the patriot act expire will be a boon to terrorists because they will be able to exploit all of the vulnerabilities in our legal system that allowed them to pull 9/11 off . 
the congress , and this house in particular , have three choices : one is to let the act expire , and back goes the wall , and we can not use delayed notification warrants to figure out what the terrorists are doing , but we can for drug pushers and mafia dons . 
the second thing is to extend the existing law , whether it is for 3 months , as mr. conyers xz4000800 has proposed , or for a longer period of time , which means that all of the civil liberties protections that i have just described will not be in the law , and they will all be lost . 
there has not been an abuse of discretion in the patriot act . 
yes , there is the potential for abuse , and that is what oversight and the civil liberties protections that are contained in the original law and improved in this conference report is all about . 
madam speaker , i rise in strong support of the conference report accompanying h.r. 3199 , the `` usa patriot improvement and reauthorization act of 2005. '' in the wake of the attacks of september 11 , 2001 , congressional and independent investigations showed that terrorists exploited historic divisions between the law enforcement and intelligence communities that prevented authorities from `` connecting the dots '' in time to avert the attacks . 
to address this vulnerability , broad bipartisan majorities in both houses passed the patriot act to enhance investigatory tools necessary to detect and prevent terrorist attacks . 
after exhaustive and comprehensive negotiations in which all conferees were provided an opportunity to extensively participate , the conference report sunsets these two provisions in four years . 
when the house judiciary committee unanimously reported the patriot act in october of 2001 , i pledged to rigorously examine its implementation to ensure that new law enforcement authorities did not transgress civil liberties . 
specifically , the conference report contains additional judicial and congressional oversight of the use of multipoint wiretapping authority contained in section 206 of the patriot act . 
the conference report also clarifies and refines the use of delayed notice search warrants in section 213 of the legislation . 
i also regret to note that in many ways , the bipartisanship that characterized passage of the patriot act in 2001 has yielded to the desire of some to engage in political hyperbole and partisan brinksmanship . 
i urge my house colleagues to support passage of this critical antiterrorism initiative and encourage the other body to send the conference report to the president for his signature before vital antiterrorism provisions contained in the patriot act expire at year 's end . 
madam speaker , i provide for the record the following document , which is a detailed listing of oversight hearings held on the usa patriot act : oversight of the usa patriot act from october , 2001 , to november , 2005 ( 1 ) november 9 , 2005 , department of justice classified briefing for committee on the judiciary staff on press accounts of fbi use of nsls ; ( 2 ) october 25 , 2005 , department of justice classified briefing for house & amp ; senate committees on the judiciary and committees on intelligence staff on press accounts of fbi use of nsls ; ( 3 ) october 6 , 2005 , department of justice classified briefing for committee on the judiciary members and staff on press accounts of mistakes in fbi applications to the foreign intelligence surveillance court under the usa patriot act ; ( 4 ) july 12 , 2005 , letter from assistant attorney general william moschella to the house committee on the judiciary responding to july 1 , 2005 , letter regarding use of the usa patriot act ; ( 5 ) july 12 , 2005 , letter from assistant attorney general william moschella to the house committee on the judiciary responding to may 19 , 2005 , letter regarding use of the usa patriot act ; ( 6 ) july 11 , 2005 , letter from assistant attorney general william moschella to rep .

madam speaker , the issue of national security letters was not in the patriot act that was enacted in 2001 . 
they were enacted in 1986 in a bill that was written over in the other body . 
this conference report puts procedural safeguards into national security letters even though they are not a part of the patriot act that was passed in 2001 . 
that is not in the law now . 
the 1-year misdemeanor for disclosure without intent to obstruct , that is not in the conference reports . 
they are in the earlier law . 
the delayed notification was determined it could be for a long period of time by a magistrate judge , a judicial officer , not by law enforcement , but by a judicial officer in determining when the notification would take place . 
what i just described in the conference report is new language . 
madam speaker , the gentleman from michigan talked about the conclusive presumption provisions on national security letters that are contained in the conference report as well as the requirements that have been changed relative to section 215 , which is the business records or library provisions . 
i would just point out that both the nsl provision and the section 215 provision in this respect were the language in the senate bill that passed unanimously . 
but if the senate bill was great , now they are attacking two provisions in the senate bill . 
what we did in the conference report is responsible . 
with respect to section 215 , i wish that the library association had read it , because it requires the statement of facts in an application to the court that issues the 215 order to show reasonable grounds to believe that the records are relevant to an authorized investigation . 
then it creates a presumption in favor of records that pertain to a foreign power or an agent of a foreign power , activities of a suspected foreign power who is the subject of an authorized investigation , or an individual in contact with or known to a suspected agent of a foreign power who is the subject of an authorized investigation . 
the inspector general 's audits that are contained in the conference report will not go to the president , and the minimization procedures to get rid of extraneous material that might come into the presence of the government will also not be in the bill that goes to the president . 
the brandon mayfield case which has been cited by others on the other side of the aisle was relating not to the patriot act but a mistake in fingerprint identification . 
keep the good parts in the bill . 
madam speaker , parliamentary inquiry , is it permissible to include instructions in the motion to recommit to conference ? 
i offer a thanks to the gentleman from wisconsin ( mr. sensenbrenner ) xz4003650 , chairman of the committee on the judiciary , and the gentleman from california ( mr. dreier ) xz4001150 , chairman of the committee on rules , who made in order my request for an amendment . 
however , when apprehended , this individual was charged only in connection with the airplane . 
although equally in danger , the police helicopter did not qualify for mass transportation vehicle protection . 
similar occurrences have happened in ohio , texas , colorado , and oregon . 
additionally , this amendment would ensure the protection of everyone engaged in the operation of an aircraft from those in the air to those navigating on the ground . 
a gap has been exposed in the current law , and now we have an opportunity to fill that gap . 
mr. chairman , we owe it to the pilots to offer them every extension of protection possible , and i am asking all of my colleagues to protect aviation in america by supporting this amendment . 
mr. chairman , i want to thank the gentlewoman from california for not only her words in support of this amendment but also thank this body for carefully looking at the provisions and amendments adding to this patriot act to help keep america safe . 
we need now to be able to detect in order to prevent , and our intelligence community needs the capability and the tools so they can detect and prevent . 
when people talk about libraries , why in the world would we want to make a library a free terrorist zone ? 
we allow our forces to go in for a crime in a library . 
why should they not be allowed to go in for a terrorist issue ? 
madam speaker , the patriot act has been an important law enforcement tool in the years following the dastardly terrorist attacks on our country , and taken as a whole , the bill has enhanced our national security . 
it reinforces federal anti-money laundering laws and regulations in an effort to deny terrorists the resources necessary for future attacks . 
important for missouri , the patriot act conference report also includes bipartisan language that helps fight the scourge of methamphetamine abuse in america . 
it limits the monthly amount any individual could purchase , requires individuals to present photo identification in order to purchase such medicines , and requires stores to keep personal information about these customers for at least 2 years after the purchase of these medicines . 
mr. speaker , permit me first to say this morning that our thoughts and prayers are with our friends in london who today are coping with what seems to be a second terrorist attack in 2 weeks . 
and my colleagues and i in this house offer our most sincere hope that no one in london will have to suffer this pain again associated with the abominable actions taken 2 weeks ago and unsuccessfully attempted again today . 
mr. speaker , i rise today in defense of nothing less than our national security , but national security is not just about protecting our borders . 
all of my colleagues understand that the patriot act has provided the law enforcement agencies with many valuable tools which facilitate their work in the struggle against terrorism . 
but with these new tools comes a very real danger that the liberty we seek to protect could be easily compromised in the overzealous pursuit of greater security . 
and while the restrictive rule we are debating this morning has allowed us to improve the patriot act in several important ways , the leadership has chosen to prohibit open debate in consideration of the most sensitive , controversial , and important issues that surround this bill . 
it is ironic that on consideration of a bill which seeks to protect our freedoms , our freedom to debate and amend the legislation has been strictly curtailed , as is too often the case in this body . 
mr. speaker , when the patriot act was passed in 2001 , 16 provisions were set to expire in 5 years because some of them could possibly be used to violate the very freedoms our young men and women in uniform too often die to protect . 
the version of the bill voted out of the committee on a near unanimous vote in that committee included a provision which allowed for a sunset review of the lone wolf provision of this bill , which was not included in the final version . 
but perhaps most importantly , we are not even allowed to consider an amendment that would require congress to do its job and fulfill our responsibility to the american people by going back and taking a look at these laws every few years because the leadership decided that none of them can be considered today by the congress , even though they deal with the most sensitive and important security and civil liberty issues we face in this country today . 
the chairman of the committee on the judiciary stated last night in the committee on rules that sunset review is not necessary in the future because he and his staff are providing all the oversight needed of the justice department , the fbi , and the patriot act . 
with all due respect to the esteemed chairman , i do not think that is enough of a safeguard for the american people to accept in this case . 
our ability to ensure the proper oversight and protection of liberty must be larger in scope than the career or judgment of a single individual . 
the chairman has even acknowledged that the justice department has been uncooperative in his attempts to conduct the appropriate reviews and oversight of the bill thus far . 
we have evidence which suggests , in contrast to information coming out of the justice department , that many of these measures have resulted in the violation of the civil liberties of american citizens . 
in addition , we understand that some of the extended search and seizure powers used by the law enforcement are apparently not being used for their intended purpose , which is strictly to fight terrorism , and that is unacceptable . 
whether this information is true or not , the fact remains that an honest discrepancy exists , and that is reason enough to ensure proper congressional oversight and why we should include sunset provisions in the bill . 
the republicans support sunset review for the epa , it is in the president 's 2006 budget , but not for the patriot act . 
we would do well to remember that they were passed into law in the frantic weeks after september 11 , hastily , without our understanding of their potential impact or benefit , and that is why we created a sunset review in the first place and why we need a sunset review as long as these incredible powers are in place . 
mr. speaker , i am going to ask for a `` no '' vote on the previous question so that i can amend the rule and allow the house to consider the sanders amendment that was rejected in the committee on rules last night on a straight party-line vote . 
mr. speaker , an identical version of this amendment was passed in the house a month ago during consideration of the science , state , justice , and commerce appropriations bill . 
i want to emphasize that a `` no '' vote will not stop the house from considering the patriot act reauthorization bill , and it will not block any amendment made in order under this rule . 
the continued threat of a terrorist attack in the united states and this month 's terrorist attacks in london remind us of the need to prevent , investigate , and prosecute all terrorist acts . 
it passed by a margin of 98-1 in the senate and by a margin of 357-66 in the house . 
giving the department of justice , the central intelligence agency , and the fbi information-sharing powers enabled law enforcement officials to disrupt terrorist cells in new york , oregon , florida , and virginia . 
the patriot act helped also investigate and apprehend an individual who in texas threatened to attack a mosque . 
mr. chairman , our success in preventing another attack on the american homeland would have been much less likely without the patriot act . 
first , we are revisiting an issue that we just covered in the flake/delahunt/otter/nadler amendment -- protections for recipients of a national security letter , which is an administrative subpoena used in terrorism investigations or in covert intelligence activities . 
they are a necessary and critical tool in our fight against terrorism . 
non-disclosure orders prevent others being investigated for involvement in terrorist activities from being alerted to that investigation . 
it passed by a margin of 98-1 in the senate and 357-66 in the house . 
over 200 people in the united states have been charged with crimes tied to international terrorist investigations and have been convicted or have pled guilty because of the patriot act . 
also , i am placing in the record an op-ed that appeared in the washington times on december 13 , titled `` preserving the patriot act. '' preserving the patriot act the proverbial rubber is about to meet the road . 
patriot act -- the most important domestic security legislation since september 11 , 2001 -- will be re-enacted in slightly weakened form or allowed to lapse in a number of its key provisions . 
they tend to characterize the act as an assault on the basic freedoms enshrined in the bill of rights and have sought far-reaching changes in the tools it provides law enforcement to detect and prevent terrorist plots inside the united states . 
in reality , the patriot act is an eminently sensible overhaul of the government 's antiquated counterterror arsenal , an overhaul that reflects the realization we can not hope to fight a 21st-century war using 20th-century legal instruments . 
for one thing , libraries are not mentioned anywhere in the pertinent patriot act provision . 
moreover , law enforcement has been authorized for decades in ordinary criminal cases to subpoena library records ( along with any other business records ) . 
the patriot act only made business records ( including those of libraries ) available on roughly the same terms in national security cases as they have long been in criminal cases . 
in fact , as we now know , many of the september 11 hijackers used american and european libraries to prepare the run-up to the attacks . 
privacy extremists of organizations like the american civil liberties union ( aclu ) nevertheless have reacted to the patriot act 's much-needed business records law as if the gestapo had seized office in the united states . 
the patriot act 's notification provision is no different in principle from the legal notice previously required to persons intercepted in a court-ordered wiretap . 
in such situations , notification of the target has routinely been delayed for weeks or months after the eavesdropping ends . 
the patriot act , in the so-called `` sneak-and-peek '' arena , established consistent standards federal courts must follow in determining whether to permit delayed notification . 
previously , a hodgepodge of different rules were applied in various jurisdictions . 
this is precisely the sort of fairness and equal protection congress should provide -- yet , it has been criticized sharply for doing so in the patriot act . 
they not only oppose such legislation in the patriot act . 
we need to keep in mind , moreover , that if its precautions fail to prevent some future terrorist attack , we are likely to see impassioned demands for greater security measures at the expense of our freedoms . 
since few , if any of us relish that prospect , we need to ensure the patriot act retains its core provisions and authorities -- and remains an effective tool for securing the home front in the war for the free world . 
well , in madrid it probably was fairly small . 
the link between narcotics and terrorism is growing , as the distinguish chairman pointed out ; and we have heard the same thing in the drug policy subcommittee , and that is anywhere from slightly below half to slightly over half of the major terrorist organizations in the world are funded by drugs , most likely heroin and hashish , but also cocaine . 
as we get better at driving them underground , we are going to see an increase in narcotrafficking and terrorism around the world , as we will see in human trafficking , as well , as we drive this underground . 
if you are selling drugs , and even inadvertently , and these groups often are hear no evil , see no evil , and they pretend like they are not involved in narcotics trafficking , but as they swap with different cells and work with these cells around the world , i hope they have a mandatory minimum , if they blow up and terrorize america , terrorize london and terrorize spain . 
we need to have conspiracy clauses that enable us , as they start to interconnect from south america , asia and the middle eastern gangs as they swap cocaine for other things and convert and move in the underground market . 
as they start to interconnect , we need laws that can address this , and i commend the chairman from the committee on international relations with trying to address this rapidly growing threat in all regions of the world . 
i urge this congress to send a strong message that this needs to be part of the patriot act as we look at the international efforts and the international connection in the funding of terrorism . 
mr. speaker , i rise in support of the patriot act and , in particular , title vii of that report , the combat methamphetamine epidemic act of 2005 . 
this is certainly the biggest , and last night we passed chairman boehlert and congressman gordon 's environmental meth bill , but this is the biggest comprehensive bill on meth that we have ever had in front of the united states congress , and it is important that we pass this . 
it is impossible to thank everybody who has been involved in this , but i would like to thank chairman sensenbrenner of the judiciary committee for his co-sponsorship and his willingness to put this in a conference report . 
if we did not have this in a conference report , it would not see the light of day . 
i thank chairman sensenbrenner ; also majority leader roy blunt , who has been an early leader in this charge ; chairman barton of the energy and commerce committee for his willingness to have this i would also thank the several members who have worked so hard to make this comprehensive anti-meth legislation happen . 
in particular , i would like to thank representatives mark kennedy , darlene hooley of oregon , dave reichert and john peterson , because they provided much of the content of this comprehensive bill and their consistently strong leadership on the house floor . 
i would also like to thank the four co-chairmen of the congressional meth caucus , congressmen larsen , calvert , boswell and cannon , for their staffs ' assistance in putting this together so we could have a bipartisan effort . 
mr. speaker , i rise in support of the conference report to h.r. 3199 , the usa patriot and terrorism prevention reauthorization act of 2005 , and in particular of title vii of that report , the combat methamphetamine epidemic act of 2005 . 
i believe this bipartisan legislation is a vital first step in our renewed fight against the scourge of methamphetamine trafficking and abuse , and i hope the house will support its passage . 
first , i 'd very much like to thank chairman sensenbrenner of the judiciary committee for his cosponsorship of the methamphetamine epidemic elimination act , h.r. 3889 , one of the two bills that was incorporated into today 's legislation , and for his leadership in ensuring that anti-meth legislation would be added to the conference report . 
in particular , i 'd like to thank representative mark kennedy , representative darlene hooley , representative dave reichert , and representative john peterson for providing much of the content of this bill , and for their consistently strong leadership on the house floor on meth issues . 
and to every other member who has cosponsored either h.r. 3889 , or the other major bill incorporated in this conference report , the combat meth act of 2005 , h.r. 314 , i express my deep appreciation . 
as chairman of the government reform committee 's subcommittee on criminal justice , drug policy and human resources , i have held 11 hearings on the meth epidemic since 2001 , not only in washington , dc , but in places as diverse as rural arkansas , ohio , oregon , and indiana , suburban minnesota , island of hawaii , and urban detroit . 
there are regional and local variations on the problem , of course , but one thing remains constant everywhere : this is a drug almost unique in its combination of cheapness , ease of manufacture , and devastating impact on the user and his or her community . 
that , combined with the rise in criminal behavior , child and citizen endangerment , and other effects , have made meth the number one drug problem for the nation 's local law enforcement agencies , according to a study released over the summer by the national association of counties . 
another survey by the national association of counties found that 40 percent of child welfare agencies reported an increase in `` out of home placements because of meth in the past year. '' this abuse unfortunately includes physical and mental trauma , and even sexual abuse . 
finally , the meth threat is not confined to the small , local labs , but extends well beyond our borders to the `` super labs '' controlled by large , sophisticated mexican drug trafficking organizations , and the international trade in pseudoephedrine and other precursor chemicals fueling those super labs . 
among other things , the act would : require all pseudoephedrine , ephedrine , and phenylpropanolamine products to be stored behind the counter or in a locked cabinet ; impose a daily and a monthly purchase limit ; require purchasers to show i.d . 
and sign a logbook ; and require training of all employees handling the products ; close a number of loopholes in existing import , export , and wholesale regulations of meth precursor chemicals , including import and manufacturing quotas to ensure no oversupply leads to diversion ; and regulation of the wholesale `` spot market '' ; require reporting of major meth precursor exporters and importers , and would hold them accountable for their efforts to prevent diversion to meth production ; toughen federal penalties against meth traffickers and smugglers ; authorize the `` meth hot spots '' program , as well as increase funding for drug courts , drug endangered children programs , and programs to assist pregnant women addicted to meth . 
each of these steps is vital to our success in the fight against meth , and i hope that the house will support them . 
every one of us , republican or democrat , urban or rural , has a stake in the outcome of that fight . 
i believe that this legislation will be an important step in that process , and i urge my colleagues to vote for its passage . 
madam speaker , i thank the chairman for his cosponsorship and his leadership in making sure that this meth bill can pass this bill in the form of passing a conference report , which is the only real way to get this done . 
eighteen of the 40 major organizations that are involved in terrorism also deal in narcotics . 
the methamphetamine act is the single , first comprehensive anti-meth bill that we have ever introduced in congress , let alone passed in congress . 
it will require all pseudoephedrine and ephedrine products to be stored behind the counter or in a locked cabinet ; impose a daily and monthly purchase limit ; require purchasers to show id and sign a logbook ; and require training of all employees handling the product . 
it closes a number of loopholes in existing import , export , and wholesale regulations of meth precursor chemicals , including import and manufacturing quotas to ensure no oversupply leads to diversion ; and regulation of the wholesale `` spot market. '' it requires reporting of major meth precursor exporters and importers . 
in addition , it has epa environmental regulations . 
this is something we did in a bipartisan way . 
i rise in strong opposition to h.r. 3199 , the usa patriot and terrorism prevention reauthorization act , because i swore to uphold the constitution . 
if the government takes our rights away in order to supposedly defend them , what are we even fighting for ? 
it has searched homes without warrants and listened in on phone conversations without any reasonable justification . 
the terrorist who mailed anthrax to the u.s. capitol and shut down a senate office building for two weeks is still at large , but a university of connecticut graduate student who studies anthrax in petri dishes was charged with bioterrorism . 
the cargo that rides aboard almost every commercial flight remains unsecured , but a new jersey man faces up to 20 years in prison under the patriot act for looking at star 's with his seven year old daughter because he shone a laser beam on an airplane . 
i am proud to represent one of the most diverse congressional districts in the country . 
that 's why cities across the east bay were among the first in the nation to pass resolutions condemning the patriot act . 
i stand with them in support of those actions . 
i urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this unpatriotic act . 
madam speaker , i rise in strong opposition to h.r. 3199 , the usa patriot and terrorism prevention reauthorization act conference report . 
for example , the formerly bedrock principle that government can not spy on you unless it provides strong evidence of wrongdoing to a judge no longer exists in america . 
as a `` compromise '' in this bill , americans can now talk to a lawyer when the fbi sends them a national security letter . 
madam speaker , there is no room for compromise in the bill of rights . 
while no amount of success in the war on terror could justify the patriot act , it is especially tragic that we have little to show for 5 years of police-state tactics . 
the american people might be surprised to know that the median sentence for people convicted in terrorist investigations over the last 5 years was just 11 months . 
in other words , the war on terrorism is just an irrelevant excuse for the expanded power of government to find out what books you buy , send undercover agents to your community group meetings , or search your home without a warrant . 
i urge my colleagues to join me in rejecting this underhanded ploy . 
i rise , obviously , in support of the coble-schiff-forbes amendment and in favor of the underlying bill . 
probably the most important thing with this amendment that we are talking about this evening that it accomplishes is that it requires that cargo theft reports be reflected as a separate category in the uniform crime reporting system , or the ucr , the data collection system that is used by the fbi today , currently , no such category exists in the ucr , which results in ambiguous data and an inability to track and monitor trends . 
so i am very pleased that the committee on the judiciary incorporated that provision and also raised criminal penalties for cargo theft , which is included in this bill . 
throw in the fact that cargo thieves are tough to catch , and what we have here is a low-risk , high-reward crime that easily entices potential criminals . 
the sentencing enhancement proposed in this amendment will go a long way in making a career in cargo theft less attractive . 
this information could then be used to help fight this theft in everyday law enforcement . 
mr. chairman , this is a commonsense cargo theft provision , along with efforts to strengthen our seaport security , vitally effective tools in our war on terrorism . 
i rise today in support of the coble/schiff/forbes amendment , and in favor of the underlying bill . 
many of the industries involved in delivering cargo : trucking , shipping , and businesses -- are genuinely concerned about how security gaps expose cargo to terrorism . 
that 's why the three particular provisions in this amendment relating to cargo theft are so important . 
probably the most important thing this amendment accomplishes is that it requires that cargo theft reports be reflected as a separate category in the uniform crime reporting system , or the ucr , the data collection system that is used by the fbi today . 
currently , no such category exists in the ucr , resulting in ambiguous data and the inability to track and monitor trends . 
i am also pleased that the provision raising criminal penalties for cargo theft is included in this bill . 
throw in the fact that cargo thieves are tough to catch , and what we have here is a low-risk , high-reward crime that easily entices potential criminals . 
the sentencing enhancements proposed in this amendment will go a long way in making a career in cargo theft less attractive . 
this information could then be used to help fight this theft in everyday law enforcement . 
these common-sense cargo theft provisions , along with the efforts to strengthen our seaport security , will be vital and effective tools in our war on terror . 
mr. chairman , i rise in strong support of this amendment and want to thank my good friend and colleague , the gentlewoman from new york ( mrs. lowey ) xz4002460 . 
so if it is in the subway systems or the rail systems or the aviation system or some other system that the threat actually exists , the secretary will have the capacity and the tools to indeed take all of the resources that we have as a nation to protect ourselves . 
it is the highest order of duty here in this body . 
this is rectifying something that was an oversight in the original patriot act bill . 
mr. speaker , i rise in opposition to this rule . 
the bill today is about eliminating the sunsets of a handful of provisions in the patriot act and the 9/11 bill . 
the sunsets are critical in keeping this administration honest and truthful in its efforts to protect our nation . 
it was due in congress 3 months ago . 
during the civil rights movement , an agency in the mississippi state government called the state sovereignty commission kept files on me and countless other people working for change . 
nothing good will come from many of the tools in the patriot act , and i fear that it will lead to more misuse of power . 
i am also opposed to the conference report because it fails to include the provision in the house bill that would allocate more homeland security funds based on risk . 
without that measure in this patriot act reauthorization , i can not support it . 
there is a lot of individual information somewhere in the country in little pieces . 
the challenge we have in the war on terrorism is looking around for those pieces that matter and trying to fit them together . 
to the extent this amendment adds additional reporting requirements and sends a message that we want to discourage them in various agencies from using those tools , i think , does a disservice . 
it will sunset so we can see if there were any violations of civil liberties during the time it was in effect , which will be approximately 4 years by the end of this year . 
so what we are talking about in this bill is sort of splitting hairs . 
there is judicial oversight for almost everything involved in the patriot act with few exceptions , like national security letters , which does require a certification of relevance before they move forward . 
we use these tools in the patriot act so we can catch terrorists and prevent acts of violence against american citizens . 
we use these same tools in other parts of the law , like when we are trying to find patent infringement , when we are trying to catch organized criminals , when we are trying to stop drug trafficking . 
in the years since , we have seen these senseless attacks continue on our allies across the world . 
the gravity of the situation is not lost on me , or any of my colleagues in this chamber . 
on october 24 , 2001 , a justified sense of urgency resulted in an unjustifiably rushed vote on the patriot act . 
many members had outstanding questions about the bill , which the rules committee put in place of another bill that had been passed by the judiciary committee . 
in the years since that bill passed , over 374 cities , towns , and counties in 43 states have passed resolutions expressing concern about the patriot act or an extension of it . 
in new mexico alone , ten cities and four counties have passed resolutions . 
i have received over 3 , 000 letters and emails from constituents on this issue , and i have met with hundreds of constituents in my district to discuss the patriot act in town hall meetings . 
the first , sponsored by representative bernie sanders , would have reined in what is probably the most notorious provision in this bill -- section 215 . 
because these surveillance powers were cast so broadly and the law prohibits them from revealing to the subject that an investigation is occurring , librarians , storeowners and operators are left in an impossible position . 
librarians and library and bookstore patrons in my district will have i also brought to the rules committee , along with representative carolyn maloney and representative chris shays , an amendment that would strengthen the privacy and civil liberties board created in last year 's intelligence reform bill . 
unfortunately , in its current form , the board does not have the tools to adequately do its job . 
changes to this section should have been included in the bill before us . 
mr. chairman , i will vote against this bill today not because i oppose the patriot act in its entirety , but because i do not believe this bill represents the will of the people or their representatives . 
in their final report , the 9/11 commissioners brilliantly stated , `` the choice between security and liberty is a false choice , '' and that `` if our liberties are curtailed , we lose the values that we are struggling to defend. '' we must continue to encourage debate on this law , the events leading up to its passage , and the long-term implications . 
i rise today in opposition to the patriot act reauthorization conference report . 
i am also a strong supporter of civil liberties and believe that our constitution must be guarded against encroachment even in the name of security . 
on october 24 , 2001 , a justified sense of urgency resulted in an unjustifiably rushed vote on the patriot act . 
a bipartisan bill was junked by the majority 's rules committee in the middle of the night . 
since this legislation was enacted , over 385 cities , towns , and counties in 43 states passed resolutions concerning the patriot act . 
in new mexico alone , 10 cities and four counties have adopted resolutions calling for reform . 
i had hoped during the conference committee senate provisions granting more congressional oversight and constitutional protections would have been kept in this bill . 
i will vote against this bill today , not because i oppose the patriot act in its entirety but because i believe that the needs of law enforcement can be met without eroding our liberties . 
some of the provisions that are being reauthorized in this bill provide law enforcement officials with important tools that may be helpful in detecting and disrupting terrorist activities . 
it is very important that , in our effort to defend the liberties that americans cherish , we not enact measures that erode the very freedoms we seek to protect . 
we can ensure that the government has the necessary surveillance powers without sacrificing the privacy rights in the aftermath of september 11 , 2001 , it is essential that we strengthen our ability to detect , deter , and disrupt terrorist activities . 
many provisions in the patriot act accomplish this objective in a balanced way . 
i am hopeful that the senate will address these shortcomings in the house bill so that , at the end of the day , we can enact a balanced bill that protects both our security and the rights and liberties we seek to secure . 
some of the provisions that are being authorized in this bill provide law enforcement officials with important tools that may be helpful in detecting and disrupting terrorist activities . 
it is very important that , in our effort to defend the liberties that americans cherish , we not enact measures that erode the very freedoms we seek to protect . 
in the aftermath of september 11 , 2001 , it is essential that we stregthen our ability to detect , deter , and disrupt terrorist activities . 
many provisions in the patriot act accomplish this objective in a balanced way . 
many of these concerns were addressed in the senate bill that passed by bipartisan , unanimous support . 
unfortunately , the conference abandoned many of the safeguards in the final conference agreement . 
the conference report falls short in a number of areas . 
this is a departure from current law which allows the recipient of such a letter to challenge it in court . 
( 3. ) moreover , the conference report allows the government to maintain information gathered from the national security letters to be kept forever in government databases . 
`` foreign intelligence surveillance act '' ( fisa ) court orders for tangible things ( section 215 ) : ( 1 ) unlike the senate bill , the conference report allows the government to obtain personal information on a mere showing of `` relevance '' , thereby striking the safeguard contained in the senate passed bill that required a 3-part test . 
the court must review any government submission in secret , whether or not it contains classified material . 
as a result i voted in favor of mr. conyers ' motion to recommit the conference report to the conference committee so that the conferees could return to the consideration of the senate passed bill . 
mr. speaker , i thank the gentleman from georgia , and i thank the chairman and chairman souder for not only bringing the patriot act reauthorization to the floor but including these important meth provisions in this legislation . 
in rural east tennessee , over 10 years ago meth production showed up in a real ugly way and spread like moonshine of 50 years ago , but 100 times more lethal , through the mountains and the hills . 
we attacked it with ?a comprehensive state-federal-local partnership called the southeast tennessee meth task force and that grew to the east tennessee meth task force , and now it is a statewide , state-of-the-art , frankly , national model for how to combat this problem ; and we were second in the country last year in lab seizures . 
one of the innocent results here , though , of fighting meth and the production of meth are the children that are left in these homes . 
in my state , 750 alone so far are wards of the state . 
in ordinary circumstances , it might not be necessary . 
we can not just pander or engage in mythological discussions . 
today , we need to reauthorize it and keep the teeth in federal law enforcement and keep the terrorists out of our country . 
mr. chairman , i rise in strong opposition to h.r. 3199 , the u.s. patriot and terrorism prevention reauthorization act . 
the patriot act is misleading american citizens and causing them to forfeit their civil liberties in the interest of what has become a political war on terrorism . 
at the same time , the president 's war on terrorism fails to fund protection for our transportation systems , our ports and , still today , uninspected cargo is being placed in the belly of the airplanes of all of our airlines . 
yet we continue in this act to violate the privacy of our citizens with section 505 , the national security letters section of the patriot act , which allows law enforcement to demand detailed information about an individual 's private records without judicial review , without the individual ever being suspected of a crime , without a requirement that law enforcement notify the individual that they are the subject of an investigation . 
in one section of the law , 215 , they can get an attorney . 
in section 505 they can not . 
in fact , a u.s. district judge struck down section 505 in a case involving the government 's collection of sensitive customer records from internet service providers without judicial oversight . 
however , the amendment was not made in order . 
it talks about a provision of law both in sections 215 and 550 that does not allow one who is the target of an investigation or one who has assisted the fbi in gaining records , access to records , to talk about the investigation , to let people know they have been contacted , or that they in some way have been involved in assisting the authorities in seeking information . 
this amendment of mine is a very , very simple amendment that talks about what happens to someone who is under a gag order who may , through no fault of their own , place themselves in danger of being harmed or being killed because someone finds out that they have been involved , they are involved in the investigation in some way , and they are threatened by the person who discovers that they have been involved in the investigation ; or what happens to someone who is employed at a particular business where they give the fbi access to information . 
so i have raised the question about this gag order of what happens when someone is placed in a position through no fault of their own that they have to give up information . 
and someone may argue that in one section of the law , 215 , they have the right to get a lawyer and this could be included in the information that they share with the lawyer that would attempt to get them out from under the gag order . 
but we know that there is nothing in 215 or 550 specifically that would protect this person under the gag order . 
mr. chairman , what i am attempting to do , and in the scheme of things perhaps it is not that important because we have a patriot act , patriot act ii , that will basically extend two sections of the patriot act for 10 years , sections 206 and 215 , access to businesses and other records and roving wiretaps ; and we have these 14 other sections of the patriot act that are made permanent . 
i suppose my colleagues and the people of america should be worried about all of this , all of what is being done in this patriot act in the name of fighting terrorism . 
we want you to understand that there are enough people in power who believe that in order to exercise the power as they see it , they have a right to undermine the constitution of the united states of america . 
so my amendment in the scheme of things is not that important to try and protect a person or some persons . 
we are now being led to believe that anything that is done , and that is what this patriot act is all about , it goes beyond what anybody should have to expect in order to fight terrorism . 
this patriot act is not in the best interest of americans . 
it is about whether or not the children of this nation , the children of the future , it is about whether all americans are being denied their civil liberties because they have been led into the support of a patriot act that really just flies in the face of the constitution of the united states of america . 
and so when i talk about the gag orders and i reference them in order to frame an amendment or to have this platform to talk about this patriot act , it is really about whether or not i am talking about all americans being gagged in a very , very clever and sophisticated way . 
i stand here in the congress of the united states questioning the wisdom of my colleagues on the patriot act , and i dare anyone to say i am unpatriotic because i do it . 
i do it because i am patriotic , and i live in an america that has taught me that there is a constitution that demands we as american citizens question our government , that we do not allow our government to do anything that they want to do . 
i have been elected by the people , and i could be a part of this charade of the government doing whatever we want to do in the name of so-called terrorism , but i do not see myself as an elected official nor do i see myself simply as a citizen that believes that the government is right in everything that it does . 
patriotism is about a constitution and a democracy that says america is different from everybody else and that we have come through a time and a history that has taught us that if you are to have a democracy , you must have certain guarantees , and those guarantees are embodied in the constitution that guarantees us freedom of speech , freedom of movement , freedom of religion , and freedom of privacy . 
i hope that somewhere in america , in some fourth and fifth grade out there , there are teachers who are watching the debate on the patriot act . 
i hope that these are the teachers who are teaching the constitution of the united states and the history of this constitution , about how it evolved and how it developed ; and i hope they will teach them about the amendments to the constitution that strengthen it to make sure that we embody in this constitution all that may not have been thought about in the original framing of it by way of amendment . 
i hope that the teachers are able to say watch the debate on the floor of the congress of the united states so that you can understand that there are some intrusions that are taking place today with the patriot act that fly in the face of the constitution . 
i want you to be aware of it because when you leave this class , when you grow up to be whatever it is you are going to be , i expect that no matter where you are , whether you are in the united states , abroad , no matter where you are , you know how to stand up and fight for the constitution of the united states that guarantees certain rights and privacies that are now being intruded upon with this kind of act . 
and so when we passed the patriot act originally , our effort was to try to find a new security balance for people here in our country , and we thought we had done a tremendous job of doing that in the judiciary committee , only to find that the rules committee , which did not even have any jurisdiction over the matter or had any hearings about the matter , took the bill , rewrote it , brought it to the floor and struck a completely different balance between the rights of government on one hand and law enforcement and the rights of individuals on the other hand . 
i voted against the original patriot act , and i still believe that the balance that was struck in that bill was inappropriate . 
i think the balance that we have struck in this bill is not the appropriate balance . 
if we wait on something outrageous to happen , then we will react back in the opposite direction of against government and law enforcement in unreasonable ways , just as we are reacting in favor of law enforcement now . 
in section 213 it talks about sneak-and-peek searches . 
in a letter to the gentleman from virginia ( mr. scott ) xz4003641 , the department of justice said on july 5 , 2005 that that section had been used 153 times as of january 2005 . 
well , what is happening with the other 80 percent is in my estimation an abuse of this provision because we passed the law so that we could make it easier for law enforcement to get to terrorists . 
the law is being used in ways that , but for the events of 9/11 and the terrorism that occurred , we would not have accepted as residents of this country . 
the tools that we have put into the patriot act are identical to the tools that law enforcement have had for a long time in criminal cases , but we did not have those authorities in foreign intelligence and counterterrorism cases . 
under the patriot act , they need a court order in order to get any business records or library records or anything else , under the supervision of a federal judge . 
the most important thing that the patriot act did was to break down the walls between law enforcement and intelligence to be able to share information across that wall in order to protect us before the attack comes . 
we need to reauthorize this act , and we also collectively as americans need to dispel the myths about the act and make some important strengthening of the act so that in the future it can continue to protect us . 
mr. speaker , i rise in strong opposition to and utter disgust with this bill . 
patriot ii does nothing to correct the major flaws in the original legislation . 
basic civil liberties continues to be in jeopardy . 
in defense of freedom , we are undermining freedom . 
it appears now that its authors were always interested in a permanent clampdown on civil liberties . 
mr. speaker , the president and his administration continue its rhetoric that anyone calling for a withdrawal of troops or questioning the intelligence that led us into the iraq war is unpatriotic , while , on the other hand , using this war as an excuse , a patriot act was passed that recklessly violates our civil liberties and attacks the very freedoms our troops in iraq are told that they are fighting to protect . 
this administration and the leadership in this very house we are standing in has tried every trick in the book to spread the blame , pass the buck on this misguided war . 
they continue to filter the debate in our very own country and to discredit those who disagree with them . 
this bill they want us to pass today would continue to limit our constitutional freedoms in our very own country . 
if you want to talk about dishonesty , look at this administration 's policies that have led us to ignore facts in order to manipulate the very policies that fly in the face of our own honesty , and this is an administration that also pays for `` canned '' news overseas . 
actually , it is patriotic to question how the patriot act affects the very rights that we live under in this country of ours . 
mr. chairman , i rise today in support of the usa patriot act . 
in the end , i wholeheartedly support all 16 provisions . 
the ultimate fate of this legislation will determine how effective we will be in investigating the clandestine activities of terrorist organizations and in preventing catastrophic events in the future . 
i think we should make that very clear , particularly today when we have another instance , presumably , in london , of what we are facing . 
this is serious business , and allegations that are easily thrust in this body , in my judgment , are irresponsible . 
i authored the amendment in the committee on the judiciary to require two sunsets of the two most controversial provisions in this bill , but i did not do that based on any suggestion there is any record of a violation of civil liberties . 
some have suggested in 1-minutes this morning that there is something wrong with the process here . 
in the committee on the judiciary , with respect to this bill , the bill was available on a friday . 
i can recall being a member of that committee when i was in the minority when we received the bill on the midnight before we were supposed to consider things . 
mr. speaker , we considered over 50 amendments in the committee on the judiciary . 
i would hardly suggest that we are moving with undue dispatch here or that somehow we are not considering this in proper order . 
this is an important day for us today , not just because of the explosions that have taken place in london today or those that took place several weeks ago , but rather because of 9/11 and our response to that wake-up call of the war on terrorism . 
in the delicate balance of these important interests . 
rather , they must be applied to the facts which confront us in the war on terrorism . 
the provisions contained in the chairman 's bill and the amendments adopted by the committee on the judiciary provide additional protections against any possible abuse in the future . 
we have put in the statute the relevant standard , which was the practice we were told , but people wanted more . 
we have put that in there . 
on these and other parts of this bill , we have done the work in the committee to deal with the problems that have been suggested . 
mr. chairman , i thank the gentleman for yielding me this time , and i rise in support of the flake-schiff amendment . 
this is another effort in our continuation to support section 215 in all of its aspects , with the protections that i think are reasonable that allow us to take into consideration some of the concerns that people have expressed , even though there have been no examples , i repeat , no examples of abuses under this act . 
the justice department has told us they have not used this section in the area of libraries . 
yet , it is relevant , and we already discussed the ways in which it may be relevant to terrorism cases . 
so i would hope that we would have strong support for this amendment , recognizing that this , along with the other changes that we have added to section 215 , will allow us to have this still be utilized and utilized in a way that is not undone , as i thought the amendment that we had on the floor just a few weeks ago would have done so . 
mr. chairman , i thank the gentleman for yielding me this time , and i rise in support of this amendment . 
they are limited in their scope . 
so in a very real sense this amendment both protects those who would receive one of these letters , and if they object to it they can go to an attorney , they can fight it , and it also gives the government a means of attempting to try and secure compliance with it . 
so in both instances , i think what we have done is give a little more regularity to it . 
mr. chairman , the hyde amendment recognizes a new reality in a very real danger that is growing : the deadly mix of drug trafficking and terrorism . 
it has now been estimated that nearly half of the designated foreign terrorist organizations are involved in the trafficking of illegal drugs . 
terrorists in afghanistan are now infiltrating and controlling the cultivation of poppy and ultimately heroin . 
the deadly bombings in spain were financed through drug money . 
let us remember that since most of the afghan heroin goes to europe and not here to the united states , our justice department and hard-pressed dea are very limited in going after the drug dealers and drug lords who facilitate terrorism directed at our troops . 
please join me in supporting the hyde amendment . 
yes , it is tough ; but we need to be tough in this circumstance . 
and one of the things that i thought i would never see in the house of representatives is an alice in wonderland type atmosphere where just because you say something , you think it is true . 
the fact of the matter is , many of the complaints registered by my friends on the other side of the aisle are taken care of in this conference report . 
some have said , look , these changes in the patriot act change what was current law . 
and some have argued all we need to do is to follow what has been the law in the past . 
the distinction that must be drawn is that , in the war on terrorism , it is not good enough to collect the evidence after a terrorist attack to try and bring people to justice . 
the imperative is to stop the terrorist attacks from occurring in the first place . 
that is why we have the differences in this law . 
the standard is to allow us to stop the terrorist attacks in the first instance . 
we have , as a result of oversight , and i have attended every single hearing in the subcommittee and full committee , done unbelievable oversight , reviewing every bit of evidence that has been out there . 
and so really the question is , do you believe in the essential foundation of the patriot act which makes it is the primary responsibility of government to protect the safety of its citizens . 
the patriot act is a critical element in a strategy to provide law enforcement with the necessary tools to conduct antiterrorism investigations . 
this task is made all the more difficult in that unlike the traditional criminal case , our success will be measured by the ability to prevent a future terrorist attack . 
in the delicate balance of these important interests . 
at the same time , it is the solemn responsibility of committees with oversight responsibilitites to be ever diligent to assure that government does not overstep the proper limits of its authority in implementing the patriot act . 
in this regard , in our oversight of the patriot act , the judiciary committee conducted 13 hearings and there was no finding of abuse . 
the conference report contains a number of provisions which maintain the integrity of those key provisions necessary to combat terrorism , while at the same time strengthening the protection of civil liberties : as the author of the 10-year sunset provisions in the house bill relating to section 206 , roving wiretaps , and section 215 , access to business records the final language in the conference report responds to the critics of the legislation . 
the conference report language relating to business record access includes additional protections not contained in current law . 
if the documents sought pertain to sensitive categories of records -- such as library , bookstore , tax returns , firearms sales , educational and medical records -- the fbi director , deputy director , or the official in charge of intelligence must personally sign off on the application before it can be submitted to the court . 
section 108 of the conference report imposes several additional safeguards on the use of roving surveillance : the conference report requires that the order describe the specific target in detail when authorizing a roving wiretap for a target whose identity is not known . 
the conference report specifies that the fisa court must find that the possibility of the target thwarting surveillance is based on specific facts in the application . 
the language in the conference report provides for explicit judicial review of an nsl . 
the conference report provides that a recipient of an nsl may challenge any non-disclosure requirement in court . 
i ran on a platform of freedom like most people did in this congress . 
i believe that we ought to look for other or additional sections of this bill to sunset , but i am happy to see that this congress is taking a hard look at the provisions and the sections that have already been mentioned to ensure that the freedoms that our families enjoy and the people in this country enjoy so much will be protected . 
my concern is for future generations and to make sure that none of the freedoms that americans enjoy today will ever be taken away from them in the future . 
i rise in support of the paul amendment and , in addition , in reluctant opposition to h.r. 3199 for several reasons . 
following the terrorist attacks of september 11 , i watched as members of congress came together in a bipartisan effort to craft legislation which would , it was argued , strengthen law enforcement 's hand in fighting terrorists . 
but by making these provisions permanent , without mandatory congressional review , we placed the very democracy that we hold so dear in jeopardy . 
in these contemporary times , it may be difficult for us to conceive of the barbarous proceedings of the salem witch trials . 
if they were , under the patriot act 's intrusive infringement on america 's book purchases and library records , when the most recent episode in the harry potter book series was released last friday , we would have had hundreds of thousands of children `` burned at the stake. '' and i know this analogy might seem a bit extreme , but that is just how extreme things can become without proper checks and balances when restricting our civil liberties and freedoms , which is why we should support the paul amendment , because true freedom of expression is an important thing to preserve . 
i am very cognizant of the concerns brought to me by many of my constituents in michigan regarding the patriot act . 
i appreciate the gentleman letting me inquire about these provisions in the bill that you have reported out of committee . 
in other words , we are not devolving to the executive branch powers of the judicial branch ? 
i have , and i hope the american people have , an accurate understanding of the safeguards put in place by the usa patriot act . 
mr. speaker , in the entire realm of human history there exists periods of time when evil people bent on destroying good , wholesome , wonderful ways of life get enough power to try to do that and to create chaos and to literally try to send us into a dark age . 
it happens where books are burned and people live in squalor and fear , and it has happened where al qaeda has gotten a stronghold . 
now , as a former judge and appellate judge , chief justice , i am very sensitive to the issues of due process , but we are in a war . 
going back to the civil war when lincoln suspended the writ of habeas corpus , it is in the constitution , `` the privilege of writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspended unless when in cases of rebellion or invasion the public safety may require it. '' he felt it did . 
we have not suspended writs of habeas corpus , even though we are in a war for our very existence . 
mr. chairman , i too rise in support of this bill . 
but there are safeguards in 215 . 
i was terribly concerned about the right to an attorney not being in there . 
and if you are in a position to review top secret records , you will see that this has been used effectively . 
the sunset is in here for 206 and 215 . 
so i am proud to rise in support . 
mr. chairman , i want to thank the gentleman from wisconsin ( mr. sensenbrenner ) xz4003650 for his leadership on this important legislation , and i rise today in support of this bill . 
i served in the justice department before and after 9/11 . 
i led the department 's counterterrorism efforts in the united states attorney 's office in the state of texas . 
i worked with the joint terrorism task forces fighting this war on terror in the trenches . 
but the patriot act provides many other tools for law enforcement in this war on terrorism . 
the patriot act also takes laws which have long applied in drug cases and organized crime cases and applies them to the terrorists , such as the roving wiretaps , such as the delayed notification for searches . 
it makes no sense for us to apply these laws only in drug cases and not in the most important cases affecting our national security , cases involving terrorists . 
the u.s. patriot act does not abrogate the role played by the judiciary in the oversight of the activities of federal law enforcement . 
and while we are talking about libraries , let us not forget al qaeda operative mohammed babar who used a computer in a library and when asked after he was arrested why , he said because the libraries will scrub the hard drives . 
mr. speaker , the patriot act was passed in october 2001 in response to the horrendous terrorist attacks on our country . 
the acts of september 11 were not the only events in our history where our nation 's leaders were asked to strike this balance . 
i clearly know how deeply this affected my parents , both american citizens born and raised in this country . 
mr. speaker , once again we are in a time of crisis . 
the freedoms in our country are known throughout the world . 
we here in this body have a sacred responsibility to protect what our nation stands for . 
mr. speaker , i rise today in support of the creation of a select bipartisan committee to investigate the preparation for and response to hurricane katrina . 
to those who are critical of the makeup of this committee , i say to them , the united states congress has responded in similar fashion 41 times , most recently with the formation of the select committee on homeland security in 2002 and 2003 . 
mr. speaker , i rise in support of house resolution 439 and in support of the underlying resolution . 
one suspects they believe it will be unfair largely because while they will have full rights of representation on the committee in question , they will inevitably be the minority on any panel that fairly represents the composition of both the house of representatives and the other body . 
it would be easy and entertaining to lampoon the consistency of the so- called party of the people rejecting a committee composed of the elected representatives of the american people in favor of one made up of individuals who are both unelected and unaccountable to the voters of this country , but i will avoid that temptation . 
the first is our faith as individuals in the efficacy of democracy itself . 
as the minority in this house for 11 years , i fear my friends on the other side of the aisle have lost their faith in the american people , because of the choices they have made at the ballot box in recent years . 
having served as a member of a seemingly permanent minority in the oklahoma state senate earlier in my career , i understand the frustration on which that sentiment is based . 
in the meantime , our job is to argue our point of view in the court of public opinion and accept the outcome at the polls when the verdict is rendered . 
its members , however expert and well-intentioned , did not design or create the agencies and processes we wish to examine in connection with hurricane katrina . 
my fellow members , let us have faith in the american people , our democratic institutions , and ourselves . 
there were , in fact , many investigations in this congress about the tragedy that took place on 9/11 , the permanent select committee on intelligence amongst them . 
but i would actually agree with his fundamental point in the sense that i think oversight is more effectively done by the elected representatives of the people , by the appropriate people who are responsible for implementing the solution . 
mr. speaker , time and time again here on the floor of the house i hear speeches : `` we will never forget 9/11 ; we will better prepare and defend america. '' but the most basic lesson of september 11 , where we tragically lost so many first responders in the collapse of the towers , was that they lacked secure interoperable communications . 
in fact , president bush this year zeroed out federal assistance to local communities for secure interoperable communications . 
there are still some good professionals there , but the leadership , appointed by the white house , and the fact it was subsumed in the bureaucracy at the insistence of the republican majority and the white house , they took away its independent agency status . 
will the other side of the aisle fess up , like the white house never does , that they were wrong to follow the lead of the white house to downgrade this agency , to politicize it , subsume it in a huge bureaucracy , and that we are less capable than we were on 9/11 to respond to these types of disasters ? 
from small businesses to large corporations , people are pitching in . 
he said that this week , and i am sure that it will be made clear in the remarks that he gives to the nation this evening . 
as debris is removed , water recedes and homes are rebuilt , we in congress must now assume our very serious and consequential constitutional oversight role of the executive branch and federal agencies so that we can find out exactly what went wrong and what went right in the early response to hurricane katrina . 
critical personnel are still on the ground and actively involved in a time-sensitive , decision-making process . 
that is what the establishment of this bipartisan committee is , in fact , going to do . 
mr. speaker , i yield myself such time as i may consume , and as i prepare to yield to my friend from moore , oklahoma ( mr. cole ) xz4000770 , i want to say to my good friend from massachusetts that it is very clear that members of the united states house of representatives do have the ability to deal with a disaster and at the same time engage in a very , very important investigatory process . 
as i said earlier , and i know my friend from rochester raised this when she said it was nice of me to say that democrats would have the opportunity to ask questions , but we know that democrats , by virtue of this being a bipartisan committee , will be able to be deeply involved and engaged in this process as well . 
mr. speaker , as we deal with this great challenge , one can not help but think back to the days following one of the most tragic events in our nation 's history , that being , of course , the attacks on the world trade center , flight 93 going down in pennsylvania and , of course , the plane hitting the pentagon . 
they came together committed to ensuring that we would never see the kind of terrorist threat that happened on september 11 hit the united states or our allies or anyone in the world again . 
mr. speaker , i am very proud of the democrats in this house who have come together in a bipartisan way to work with republicans in our shared goal of winning the global war on terror . 
and we know that , as we sit here today , another hurricane , hurricane ophelia , continues to pose a threat in the carolinas . 
and i will tell the members , as i stand here at this moment , mr. speaker , i live constantly with the prospect of a massive earthquake hitting the largest , most important state in the union , which i am proud to represent here . 
we in california deal with the threat of fires on a regular basis . 
and in the wake of those fires following that , we , of course , have terrible mudslides which impact tremendous numbers of people . 
we have gone through disasters in the past . 
obviously , as president bush has said , this is the worst natural disaster in our nation 's history , hurricane katrina . 
in california , one of the most prominent was the northridge earthquake on january 16 of 1994 . 
and i will say that , having gone through all of this , mr. speaker , it is absolutely absurd , it is absurd , to believe that any member of this house , that any member of this house would not want to get to the truth of exactly what happened in the case of hurricane katrina . 
just yesterday , governor blanco , the democratic governor of louisiana , said that she takes responsibility for what took place in her state . 
now , mr. speaker , we have a republican president and a democratic governor coming forward and saying they take responsibility for their roles in the governments that they serve , the federal government and the state government . 
the gentleman from illinois ( speaker hastert ) has come forward saying that it is very important for us to work in a bipartisan way . 
he has tried to work with the minority leader to make sure that , in appointing this select committee , we will have a chance to work in a bipartisan way . 
speaker hastert has just called for members of the committee on appropriations to go to the gulf coast to look at this situation and to report back to us , because the very important responsibility of oversight right now that the committee on appropriations has over the $ 60 billion-plus that we , in a bipartisan way , have appropriated to deal with this , needs to be addressed . 
i will tell my colleagues that this bipartisan committee is something that i think can play a very important role in ensuring that for all of us who face the prospect of a disaster in our states that we will be able to address it in a better way . 
this is my 25th year serving here , and i am proud of the role that i have been able to play in trying to address very important institutional concerns , and we have been able to address many issues in a bipartisan way . 
in fact , i would argue that we do more things coming out of even the committee on rules in a bipartisan way than we do the things that we do that are very , very strident and partisan . 
i do feel for our colleague mary landrieu in the other body , and the gentleman from mississippi ( mr. taylor ) xz4003992 ; but i also think it is important for us to note that in the other body , our colleague trent lott lost his home . 
it will focus on state government , on local governments , on even private entities that have been involved in this process . 
the speaker , again , has reached out to the democratic leader and very much wants to have appointments made , and democrats will be able to ask any question that they want ; they will be able to participate in the process of bringing witnesses before the committee . 
i urge my colleagues to support the underlying legislation which will establish this very important committee so that we can address this question and ensure that the american people will not go through what we have seen happen in the last several weeks . 
slaughter ( ny ) amendment in nature of substitute : strike all after the resolved clause and insert : `` resolved , that immediately upon the adoption of this resolution it shall be in order without intervention of any point of order to consider in the house the bill ( h.r. 3764 ) to establish a congressional commission to examine the federal , state , and local response to the devastation wrought by hurricane katrina in the gulf region of the united states especially in the states of louisiana , mississippi , alabama , and other areas impacted in the aftermath and make immediate corrective measures to improve such responses in the future . 
mr. speaker , i rise in strong support of house resolution 437 . 
i want to point out to my friends on the other side of the aisle that we are still in the hurricane season . 
in fact , we are just getting into the hurricane season , and we need to get this investigation going as soon as possible . 
we have the staff within this congress on both sides of the aisle , both in the majority and on the minority , and hopefully we would not spend more than $ 500 , 000 to get this work done and get it done in a bipartisan fashion . 
i am fully in support of that . 
i note peripherally that the distinguished chairman of the committee on rules has other business and has left the floor ; but i was prepared to ask him , and perhaps his replacement in the chair for the majority can answer for me , what did the house of representatives do in the last 3 years with reference to the tragedy of 9/11 ? 
but are you then prepared to admit that we did not exercise it correctly in the 9/11 commission period and that is why the 9/11 commission came into existence in the first place ? 
in the immediate and long-term aftermath , our communities saw fema 's shortcomings . 
we saw that a once-reliable agency had been placed on the back burner as an afterthought in the department of homeland security . 
natural disaster preparedness and response programs have become trapped in a homeland security bureaucracy . 
our delegation literally begged the committees of jurisdiction to hold hearings on what we saw in florida . 
i even introduced bipartisan legislation in march with our colleague on the majority side , the gentleman from florida ( mr. shaw ) xz4003690 , to address what we perceived to be fema 's largest problems . 
well , mr. speaker , what america saw in the gulf coast resembles the federal government 's absolute incompetence that florida saw last year . 
implicit in this mandate is the simple fact that congress alone would not or could not provide such a full and complete accounting . 
in stark contrast to the 9/11 commission , republicans outnumber democrats on the majority 's partisan katrina commission . 
in contrast to the 9/11 commission , which was given 18 months to do its job , the majority 's partisan katrina commission is only given 5 months . 
what about the committees of jurisdiction already in existence in congress ? 
for my constituents , it is about the failures of this congress , and for others it is about the failures in new orleans and in the states and at the federal government . 
mr. speaker , i rise in opposition to the rule and to the underlying resolution . 
furthermore , this commission will show whether or not , as i believe , fema lacked appropriate leadership , leadership with experience in disaster management , and then recommend ways in which the agency can be better prepared , both in terms of personnel and resources . 
and , third , some of the problems we saw in the gulf coast include bad funding choices made by congress itself . 
because it is neither bipartisan in terms of its authority , nor bipartisan in terms of its power , nor bipartisan in terms of its subpoena power . 
the question that must be answered is how is it that fema , which 5 years ago was a world-class agency that was being praised by republicans and democrats alike , by local officials , by governors , by mayors , by the international community , who were coming and visiting and taking lessons from fema , how in 5 years was that agency so incredibly hollowed out that it could not respond to hurricane katrina ? 
this president and this administration made some horrible decisions about putting political hacks and their cronies in charge of the agency that is in charge of the safety of the people of the united states , whether it is western fires , earthquakes , floods , tornadoes or hurricanes . 
the power in our democracy is with the citizens , and the citizens want a citizens ' committee . 
the people in louisiana and mississippi and the gulf region are displaced . 
but our country is grateful to the 9/11 families because they not only gave us that commission to review that terrible tragedy that befell our country , they gave us a tradition of transparency and finding the truth and holding people accountable and hoping to do so in a way that prevents future loss of life . 
so on behalf of the people in the region , i plead with my colleagues in this body to reject any sham committee . 
there was a natural disaster , a terrible natural disaster in the gulf coast states . 
that does not mean that many , many people who work for fema and many people , our first responders , police and fire , health care providers in the area and volunteers from every walk of life did not rise to the occasion . 
they certainly did , and we commend them for the sacrifice they were willing to make to rescue others in the time of the immediate recovery . 
the fact is that we should be spending our time figuring out how we are going to help the people of the region rebuild their communities , to create jobs , to educate their children , to rid themselves of the toxic , literally toxic , environment , and that is the situation that they are in there . 
we have called for it over and over again , whether it was the war in iraq or the price gouging at the pump of gasoline for america 's consumers , whether it is abu ghraib or guantanamo . 
there are so many subjects that this congress has been delinquent in its duty in doing oversight . 
in order to expedite help to the region , i suggested to the speaker that we have a truly bipartisan committee that could streamline how we would go forward . 
so the idea of this congress having a role in terms of oversight in a bipartisan special committee is one that i supported . 
but what the republicans came back with was really a slap in the face to the people who were affected in the region . 
sometimes it is really important , as we try to find our common ground , we stand our ground where we can not find that common ground , but we always have to come down in favor of the people , to yield on points . 
so i urge my colleagues to honor the sacrifice , the situation , that has affected the people in the region by at least telling them the truth and vote against this committee today , to vote against this committee , to say come back to the drawing board when they want to have honesty in what we are doing . 
but , first and foremost , we must have a truly independent commission , again , in the manner of the 9/11 commission that took testimony , that issued a report , that gave transparency and openness to the process and gave some level of truth to the american people . 
because the people in the gulf states , many of them affected are poor and economically disadvantaged and not as sophisticated , perhaps , as some of the people stricken with grief in the new york/new jersey area at the time of 9/11 , and in pennsylvania and in the pentagon . 
because these people are of a different economic status and because they are living in shelters and the rest and not really able to speak for themselves to the congress of the united states , we , the house democrats , will speak for them in asking for the truth and appealing to our republican colleagues for us to work together in a completely nonpartisan way to help meet their needs . 
senator landrieu , in the senate last week , brought the nation to tears with her presentation on what she saw in her beloved state of louisiana . 
the gentleman from mississippi ( mr. thompson ) xz4004021 , our ranking member on the committee on homeland security , spoke from authority in standing on the committee but experience as a mississippian . 
i could only see secondhand , joining the gentlewoman from texas ( ms. jackson-lee ) xz4001990 , the gentleman from texas ( mr. al green ) xz4006530 , the gentleman from texas ( mr. gene green ) , going to houston to meet with the victims of katrina in the astrodome and also in the george r. brown convention center . 
we saw children , little children , adorable little babies that we could hold in our arms , and 90-year-old great grannies , all of them , not the little babies , they did not speak for themselves , but their older siblings said , `` we want to go home. '' they praised the hospitality , the warmth , the generosity of the people of houston . 
as i said when i was in houston , i do not know of any city in america that could have risen to the occasion so quickly and so compassionately as houston . 
mayor white , judge eckels , the commissioner of harris county ; representative noriega , so many people in the community came together to help the victims of katrina . 
and a good way to have them come home and have confidence in the future that , should another hurricane strike , and we know that it will , that the precautions will have been taken , the accountability will be assigned , and that the people will be protected . 
this honorable response to the tragedy of september 11 puts to shame what has been proposed today in the wake of hurricane katrina . 
what was perhaps our federal government 's greatest failure to date to defend life at home is being met with a failure of leadership and openness and honesty in this chamber today . 
they would have the power to take the investigation in any direction they chose , with no checks , no balances and no incentives to get real answers . 
mr. speaker , i do not object to such a plan because republicans would be in control as opposed to democrats . 
never mind that in that situation a republican president was being investigated by a democratically controlled committee , eliminating the political pressure to sweep truths under the rug . 
last night , in the committee on rules , they told us , rather incredibly , that nobody is better to evaluate in this body than its own members . 
it did not investigate the role of top bush campaign contributors in writing vice president cheney 's energy plan . 
it did not investigate what led to our dehumanizing and shameful treatment of detainees at guantanamo bay in cuba and abu ghraib in iraq . 
if a true interest in a fair , open , thorough and independent investigation runs that deep with my republican colleagues , why not just create the independent panel ? 
the american people clearly had faith in the 9/11 commission model . 
in fact , exactly the opposite is the case . 
its findings would not just help us to prevent another terrible disaster from taking place , they would also help our government to regain its credibility in the eyes of the public . 
i offered this amendment in the committee on rules last night , but , sadly , it was rejected . 
i want to reiterate that 76 percent of americans in a recent abc/washington post poll preferred that a commission of outside experts , similar in nature to the 9/11 commission , and , in fact , i wish for the same people , to investigate the devastating events surrounding hurricane katrina , and that is not just democrats that were asked . 
sixty-four percent of republicans in that same poll said they , too , supported an independent commission to investigate the government 's preparedness and response effort . 
mr. speaker , i ask unanimous consent that the text of the amendment be printed in the record immediately prior to the vote on the previous question . 
mr. speaker , i rise today in opposition to house resolution 437 . 
this resolution puts a partisan congressional committee in charge of the investigation . 
we are not protecting what we need to protect , and there will be a lot more questions than answers in the end . 
in my role as ranking member of the committee on homeland security , i have looked for answers and have tried to put together a timeline of events . 
mr. speaker , when hurricane katrina came ashore and ravaged the gulf states and the levees in new orleans , americans united in their support of those in need and the communities devastated by this terrible disaster . 
as katrina passed over the gulf states and in the days that followed , americans saw firsthand the devastation and human suffering that resulted . 
we were also eyewitnesses to the tragedy of hundreds of thousands of people who had escaped the wrath of the terrible storm only to then be stranded in the superdome , the convention center , or trapped on the roofs , surrounded by rising flood waters with little in the way of food , water , or medical care . 
with the passage of time , our outrage and frustration set in . 
they are more interested in getting answers than pointing fingers . 
we saw the successful implementation following the tragedy of september 11 , and following this model congress will reassure the american people the answers that the independent commission finds and the recommendations they make are ones in which the nation can trust . 
my hometown of sacramento lies in a floodplain at the confluence of two great rivers and faces the constant threat of floods . 
if we find ourselves in dire circumstances , can my constituents be assured that they can count on prompt federal government response ? 
i am not interested in pointing fingers , nor are the american people . 
they are more interested in identifying areas of weakness and making the necessary improvements . 
this is about preventing another tragedy similar to what we witnessed in new orleans and the gulf states . 
mr. chairman , the endangered species act is a well-intentioned law that has failed in its implementation . 
as it has been pointed out , less than 1 percent of species listed have recovered in the entire history of the act . 
many species that were listed in error , yet because of flaws in the act , they are still listed . 
it 's simply a regular sturgeon living in alabama . 
mr. chairman , i and the rest of the alabama delegation worked directly with the gentleman from california to ensure that the bill is helpful to landowners in alabama and southeast . 
buried in this manager 's amendment in dry language is a contest between florida developers on the one hand and florida manatees on the other . 
in this republican congress , guess who wins , the developers or the manatees ? 
after losing in court , some boaters and marine contractors have come to congress asking for special favors so they can continue their development without addressing the impacts on the endangered manatee . 
this simple change in wording lowers our national standard for protection of this well-loved species . 
this amendment clearly targets manatees in florida , but we really have no idea what kind of precedent or implications this would have for other critically endangered marine mammals . 
they lost a lawsuit on july 13 , 2005 , against the fish and wildlife service in which the court found that the marine mammal protection act does in fact apply to dock-building activities that would lead to incidental take of marine mammals , and specifically manatees in florida 's inland waters . 
this amendment , therefore , is rushed into this particular bill , just part of the manager 's amendment ; it would undermine the process that has gone on for several years that the state of florida and the fish and wildlife service have engaged in to recover manatees in florida . 
finally , the minority and majority have already reached agreements and passed a version of the marine mammal protection act out of the committee on resources , and this amendment flies directly in the face of that process . 
so here is the situation : florida developers are not pleased by a court case in july . 
they rush in here , they get a provision in this bill to make sure that they win and the florida manatees lose . 
mr. chairman , i rise in support of h.r. 3824 , the threatened and endangered species recovery act . 
in the inland empire , the esa has prevented or increased costs for freeway interchanges , economic development , and things as simple as trash removal . 
there are certain areas that are blighted in portions of our communities . 
in my district , we have two infamous endangered species . 
as we can see in these posters next to me , the fly costs san bernardino county medical center $ 3 million to move the hospital about 200 feet when the fly was found in the property . 
also in my district , ambulances driving to this emergency room at arrowhead medical center need to slow down so that the endangered flies will not hit their windshield . 
can my colleagues imagine the traffic congestion in the area , the impact it would have in that area , on the flow of goods and others that would not be able to be moved ? 
for example , in the cities of colton and fontana , california , a handful of flies , yes , flies are responsible . 
the city of fontana alone has spent $ 10 million in legal fees associated with the esa and has been forced to put aside $ 50 million worth of land that has been intended for development . 
a scrapped commercial center with a supermarket would have generated $ 5 million in revenue . 
imagine if endangered species suddenly thrive in the areas flooded by the hurricanes . 
think of the farmers not able to harvest their crops because an endangered species is found in the field . 
local cities have offered land for habitat , changed development plans and tried to partner in that process ; but esa , as written , will not permit that . 
mr. speaker , i am pleased that both sides of the aisle have recognized the need of some modifications in the endangered species act . 
john gochnauer was the shortstop for the cleveland indians in 1902 and 1903 . 
in 1902 , playing full-time at shortstop for the indians , he hit a paltry .185 and committed a whopping 48 errors in that position . 
nonetheless , he came back the next year to play for them in 1903 , where he once again , full-time player , hit .185 , and this time set a major league record , which has yet to be broken , of committing 98 errors as shortstop , which means out of every five times , he touched the ball , he booted or threw it away once . 
whereas john gochnauer hit .185 , the endangered species act is hitting .009 , which means the endangered species act is the most inept program we have in the federal government . 
it actually penalizes the practices that help in the process , which is one of the reasons why this bill before us recognizes that , and especially in 13 ( d ) , a section that is in the bill but not in the substitute . 
i think that is probably one of the reasons why this bill is one of those unique bills to come before this body in which a majority of both parties in committee voted to support this particular bill . 
jim should today be a middle-aged person with a family , running a business , and living a healthy life in california . 
but in 1995 , in california , there was a levee that was in need of repair . 
the bushes were not part of the endangered species act , but a beetle who could potentially live in those bushes was , even though no beetle was found in those 43 bushes that grew up on that levee after it was built . 
this meant that the federal government went in there and captured all 11 geese , forced them to vomit to find out how many snails were actually consumed by the geese . 
in fact , it moves us somewhat backwards by weakening scientific standards and creating potential for more litigation . 
what we need to do is to make sure that we are engaging the private property owners so that they assist and work in cooperation with the federal government . 
mr. chairman , i rise in support of this bipartisan substitute and in unwavering opposition to the underlying threatened and endangered species act of 2005 , which does not defend endangered species as it purports , but rather protects the special interests of private industry and landowners . 
i am concerned about the environmental and fiscal health of our great nation and the path chosen by many of america 's leaders whose policies are painfully lacking in promoting conservation . 
in fact , tesra is a step back , furthering the degradation of species and compounding man 's conflict with the environment . 
america is still in mourning as we enter the early stages of rebuilding the gulf coast and fighting a war in iraq and afghanistan costing our nation hundreds upon hundreds of billions of taxpayer dollars . 
particularly egregious is that tesra will cost nearly $ 3 billion in new spending in just the next 4 years , which will be used not to protect threatened and endangered species , but rather the interests of private landowners . 
if we have $ 3 billion to give away , let 's give it to families in need by renewing tanf or to expand rather than cut pell grants so that students who wish to attend college can meet the financial demands . 
in my district , hardworking families are struggling to absorb the high costs of fuel into their budget while putting food on their tables and sending their children to college . 
mr. speaker , i rise in strong opposition to both the rule and the bill . 
we have been in a state of stalemate for a number of years because the goal has not been reasonable refinement . 
i have literally watched it work in my own backyard . 
putting in the hands , we have seen in this administration , of political appointees really perverting the decisionmaking in the name of science , these are not people that i think we ought to turn this over to willy-nilly . 
but the most troubling part of the legislation is found in the new entitlement program contained in section 14 . 
it actually would create a perverse incentive for developers to propose the most environmentally destructive projects possible in order to get higher payment from the government . 
i take modest exception to the implication that was made from the other side of the aisle that somehow the endangered species act and environmental legislation had something to do with the tragedy we witnessed unfurl in the katrina-affected region . 
the gao presented a report yesterday saying that the delays in the project , that none of the changes are believed to have had any role in the levee breaches . 
and , in fact , corps officials believe that the flooding would have been worse if the original proposed design had been built . 
knowledgeable people understand that in the long run environmental legislation , had it been enforced and applied uniformly , would have made things better . 
lake pontchartrain and vicinity hurricane protection project congress first authorized the lake pontchartrain and vicinity , louisiana hurricane protection project in the flood control act of 1965 . 
the original project designs were developed based on the equivalent of what is now called a fast-moving category 3 hurricane that might strike the coastal louisiana region once in 200-300 years . 
as gao reported in 1976 and 1982 , since the beginning of the project , the corps has encountered project delays and cost increases due to design changes caused by technical issues , environmental concerns , legal challenges , and local opposition to portions of the project . 
as a result , in 1982 , project costs had grown to $ 757 million and the expected completion date had slipped to 2008 . 
none of the changes made to the project , however , are believed to have had any role in the levee breaches recently experienced as the alternative design selected was expected to provide the same level of protection . 
in fact , corps officials believe that flooding would have been worse if the original the current estimated cost of construction for the completed project is $ 738 million with the federal share being $ 528 million and the local share $ 210 million . 
over the last 10 fiscal years ( 1996-2005 ) , federal appropriations have totaled about $ 128.6 million and corps reprogramming actions resulted in another $ 13 million being made available to the project . 
during that time , appropriations have generally declined from about $ 15-20 million annually in the earlier years to about $ 5-7 million in the last three fiscal years . 
mr. chairman , i rise in reluctant support of this amendment . 
i have serious concerns about the changes to the current endangered species act being discussed today , both in the underlying bill and this amendment . 
in fact , at shortstop they have a very able player , and they are hot in the middle of a pennant race . 
having said that , i rise in strong support of the rule and in strong opposition to the base bill which we hope with a substitute , the bipartisan substitute , to improve substantially and make it a product worthy of the support of the entire house . 
i do not think that it should go forward in this manner . 
we should not be dealing with the most fundamental rewrite of an environmental statute in 15 years in this manner . 
secondly , we do not allow the taxpayer protection in this bill that is allowed in highway cases . 
mr. chairman , we are all in agreement . 
the list of areas of disagreement are very strong , but i would also point out that we in the substitute bill embrace many of the provisions in the base bill because they need to be addressed in a responsible way and , in many cases , we take the exact language . 
mr. chairman , i rise in opposition to the bill . 
we eliminate all the provisions of current law that require critical habitat designations just as in h.r. 3824 , but we make recovery plans enforceable and we ensure that they have strong scientific basis . 
but instead , we have a bill before us that is balanced in its rhetoric , but not in its effect . 
in fact , many of its provisions -- the incentives for landowners to protect species , the public information requirements , the requirements to better involve the states -- are largely improvements to the law . 
that 's why our substitute includes all those provisions , often in language identical to that in h.r. 3824 . 
we do n't have to endanger taxpayers in order to reform the endangered species act . 
mr. chairman , i rise in strong support of the substitute . 
both the bill and the substitute require greater involvement of states in decisionmaking involving species . 
both the bill and the substitute ensure that the public will have greater information about and a greater role in the decisionmaking . 
in fact , while it is hard to quantify , i would guess about 80 to 90 percent of the language in the substitute is identical to the base bill . 
the substitute does not have the controversial section 13 in it ; the base bill does . 
in the meantime , the developer could proceed with the same project on other portions of the property , make substantial profits on his property , and never have that affect the steady stream of payments coming from the government from what was always known to be a problematic site . 
that is why the same concerns that we have expressed to our colleagues on the floor today have been expressed by the administration in the statement of administration policy , which is otherwise supportive of the bill , in part because of the provisions that we also have in our substitute . 
the statement of administration policy warns : `` the new conservation aid program for private property owners provides little discretion to federal agencies and could result in a significant budgetary impact ... .. 
the committee on resources has put a lot of hard work into and has come up with a product that , in many respects , is just wonderful , necessary . 
mr. chairman , in washington everything looks perfect on paper and people hate to admit they made a mistake ; but the truth of the matter is how it works in real life is completely different , and we have a responsibility to make those changes . 
but for decades , responsible landowners have been afraid that the federal government would swoop in and take their livelihood away for the sake of this bird due simply to the outdated and unsubstantiated burdens of the endangered species act . 
america 's farmers and ranchers and private property owners in east texas have spent long enough fearing the federal government . 
mr. chairman , in the 32 years that the endangered species act has been in effect , we have learned a lot of lessons over time and seen the areas where it needs some improvement . 
mr. chairman , one of the most important aspects of h.r. 3824 deals with private property owners ' participation in species recovery . 
i believe in america it is a fundamental right to be able to own property and to be able to enjoy that property . 
i visited a country back during the spring that no citizen in that country could own property or they could lease it for 25 years or 99 years ; and , mr. chairman , i do not believe america wants to return to that fundamental time where we could not own property , we could just live on property owned by somebody else . 
my district in california is home to a large comprehensive habitat conservation plan both in riverside and orange counties . 
in fact , the west riverside county multi-species conservation plan is the largest in the nation covering over 1 million acres of land . 
once fully implemented , 500 , 000 acres in western riverside county will be set aside for species habitat . 
it is our responsibility to ensure when landowners and local authorities undertake an extensive planning like that back in my district , the federal government lives up to its part of the agreement . 
i just discovered in the miller-boehlert substitute that the habitat conservation plans that we put a lot of time in to work out in southern california may be put at risk . 
i rise in opposition to the substitute amendment and in support of the underlying bill . 
by my count , the number of democrats who voted for the underlying bill in committee was greater than the number of democrats who voted against it . 
in the first place , it raises the regulatory bar . 
in the second place , the substitute does nothing to provide straightforward answers to property owners . 
in other words , the fundamental problems , which have caused such division in america , are not dealt with in the substitute bill . 
we need to have some kind of a compensatory process , and we do not have that in the substitute bill . 
what that is , i do not know that we can figure that out until we have done a lot of litigation and have been through a great deal of pain in america . 
and a landowner , after he volunteers , could get 70 percent of his costs back for participating in the program . 
i am put in the unenviable position today , as a lifelong democrat , to have to stand and oppose the democratic position on this rule . 
as i have sat here and listened to the debate on the rule , i simply do not feel that some of the statements by my colleagues are accurately reflecting what is in the bill as it currently is written . 
the reality is that under the endangered species act , most of the provisions of the act , as it currently stands , will be in place . 
we had a vote recently on this floor of over 400 members who said exactly that in one of the eminent domain cases that was recently challenged , when the supreme court took someone 's property . 
in my state , the fish and wildlife service said that 4.7 million acres of california had to be set-aside for the red-legged frog , 1.7 million acres for vernal pools and fairy shrimp . 
those in support of the substitute have been distributing a handout , and in the substitute it says virtually everything that the gentleman from california ( mr. pombo ) xz4003220 and i and others have written and coordinated on . 
in fact , about 90 percent of this bill was written by democratic staff . 
i will say that , frankly , that does not happen in this house very often where there is a bipartisan attempt to come to an agreement . 
well , the reality is most of the endangered species , in fact , 90 percent of the endangered species , are on private lands . 
so that provision that is in the substitute simply will not work . 
mr. chairman , when the endangered species act was adopted by congress in 1973 , it was heralded as landmark use of environmental legislation for the protection and conservation of threatened and endangered species . 
at that time , it was clearly understood that the ultimate goal of the act was to focus federal resources on listed species so that , in time , they could be returned to a healthy state and be removed from the list . 
i am in full support of the threatened and endangered species recovery act that we are hearing today because i think it is an innovative and creative approach to ending the long-running conflict between protecting species and enforcing conservation actions on private land . 
there seems to be no question that esa is due for an update since the substitute offered by many of my colleagues eliminates critical habitat in much the same manner as h.r. 3824 . 
for example , in 2002 , the service proposed to designate 1.7 million acres as critical habitat in california and oregon for vernal pool species . 
in 2003 , the service proposed over 4.1 million acres in california as critical habitat for the red-legged frog . 
this bill does not , and i repeat , does not weaken current law ; it does not create a sweeping new entitlement program for landowners ; it does not allow for pesticides to be used at random to harm farm workers and at-risk species ; and it most definitely would not in any case allow for national treasures like the bald eagle and the grizzly bear to become extinct . 
in fact , i think many of my colleagues would be interested to know that my office has been inundated by representatives from so-called industry lobbyists requesting that certain provisions that were once included in this bill be put back in . 
this bill is in no way a home run for anyone . 
in my opinion , it is a true balance between the sides , no side getting everything they want ; and , when you achieve that , you usually have the best policy . 
we can do better , and better is voting in favor of this bill . 
mr. chairman , i yield myself 1 minute to engage in a colloquy with the gentleman from california ( mr. pombo ) xz4003220 . 
these individuals , our constituents , are committed to doing what the federal government asked them to do in order to secure authorization to proceed with various activities . 
i want to conclude by saying i thank the gentleman from west virginia ( mr. rahall ) xz4003310 for his offering of working on this piece of legislation , and we do so in the spirit of cooperation . 
i also have to say , though , that in this chamber where we have seen lofty rhetoric for a number of years , i personally having witnessed it for 26 since i was first an intern here , i have frankly never seen the rhetoric not coincide with the reality more than in this case oftentimes . 
it encourages landowners to cooperate with biologists in the fish and wildlife service . 
mr. chairman , i rise today in opposition to the substitute being offered for a number of reasons . 
many of the opponents of this provision claim that landowners can simply go to court and get a decision but in reality , they can not because the court has ruled in previous cases that unless the service tells them no directly they have no standing in court . 
i understand that there is a provision in the substitute that attempts to address this issue with a similar 180 day timeline . 
the second is the strong private property rights section that are good in h.r. 3824 . 
they did not seem to make the cut in the substitute . 
i do have to say that i am pleased that my colleagues chose to include a number of provisions from the underlying bill in the substitute . 
so a farmer who is plowing his field and trying to grow a crop every day , if he is denied the use of that property , he can only be compensated for the loss of his farming income and he can not claim that it could be a high rise hotel in its place . 
when they buy an easement , they buy a perpetual easement unless the secretary were to make a mistake , and , simply , that is just not the way we do it in law currently . 
i applaud my colleagues here today for offering this amendment in the nature of a substitute . 
it goes a long way in making meaningful reforms to the endangered species act without hollowing the fundamental goals of america 's flagship wildlife conservation efforts . 
while there have been successes in species recovery since enactment of the 32-year-old endangered species act , most would agree that it is in need of real reform to make it more effective in species recovery , less demanding on some landowners , and less prone to lawsuits and bureaucracy . 
however , pushing the problematic and prohibitively expensive h.r. 3824 , the threatened and endangered species recovery act through the legislative process has left a sour taste in many of our mouths because it removes the enforceable protections for species recovery and creates the entitlement program for private landowners . 
at a time when our country is still coping with the cost of the wars in iraq and afghanistan , and most recently with hurricanes katrina and rita , one has to wonder why a rewrite of the endangered species act that includes an entitlement program is even a consideration . 
mr. chairman , it has come to my attention that certain federal agencies with permitting , licensing , and leasing authority are requiring some of my constituents to agree to stipulations in their coal leases that go beyond protecting threatened or endangered species . 
for example , before the bureau of land management will issue a lease , they require the lessee to agree to potential modifications in the lease . 
i wore my eagle tie today in the hope that we will continue to protect the bald eagle , the symbol of our country . 
among them , and one that has to give pause to this body as we wrestle with how we are going to pay for hurricane katrina and other essential things here , and how much money is being borrowed in the name of future generations , is a section regarding compensation . 
if people across america thought that this was going to become law as written , which it will not , it will be changed dramatically after the senate acts , if they do act , they would be out right now purchasing , on a speculative basis , or getting options on property that in any way was restricted by the endangered species act . 
and , remember , the compensation is in an amount no less than the fair market value . 
it is binding only on the secretary as i understand in the new manager 's amendment . 
if that amendment had been allowed , i think many more members could support this bill ; but that amendment was not allowed here in the house of representatives today . 
it was marked up one day in committee , and now it has been changed further by a manager 's amendment last night which no one has seen . 
mr. chairman , i rise in strong opposition to this bill . 
the legislation before us today turns back the clock on 35 years of progress in responsible environmental stewardship by gutting the current endangered species act and replacing it with little to preserve endangered wildlife for future generations . 
but had this bill been the law of the land over the last 30 years , the fish and wildlife service points out that the bald eagle -- an icon of american freedom -- would exist only in our memones . 
indeed , in my home state of connecticut , we are concerned that oysters , a key aquaculture product , may be unnecessarily characterized as an endangered species . 
rather , the purpose of this legislation is to remove obstacles inconvenient to special interests with whom the republican leadership is in partnership . 
as such , this legislation would eliminate conservation measures on tens of millions of acres of land around the country , the `` critical habitat '' of endangered species , and prevent such conservation activities in the future . 
a study published in the `` annual review of ecological semantics '' calculated that 172 species would potentially have gone extinct during the period from 1973 to 1998 if endangered species act protection had not been implemented . 
everybody has been saying that h.r. 3824 has been this great effort in terms of collaboration , and i respect that . 
i think that the esa should be reformed in a responsible manner . 
in fact , the substitute amendment that i have cosponsored with the gentleman from california ( mr. george miller ) xz4002780 , the gentleman from new york ( mr. boehlert ) xz4000350 , and others that will be debated later today embodies those kinds of practical reforms which still provide us the kind of potent tools necessary to prevent extinction of species and to work towards their recovery . 
over time , many supporters of the esa have come to question the way in which habitat is designated as critical in order to help species recovery . 
in addition , the substitute amendment will require that federal land be considered first for designation as habitat necessary for a species ' survival and recovery before private landowners are burdened . 
this is enough to defeat this bill in its own right . 
he has behaved in all manners in this connection with this , as he always does , as a complete gentleman . 
i greatly regret that we were not able to conclude our negotiations in a way which enabled us to together support this legislation . 
large numbers of species which would have been extinct are saved by the fact that this has been in place . 
it passed in 1973 . 
it passed by a heavy bipartisan vote in the house . 
it passed 92 to nothing in the senate . 
56 percent of the top prescription drugs in the world contain natural compounds from plants found in the wild , many of which come from endangered plants . 
in a sense , we do good by doing well . 
i would note that wildlife has created recreation for more than $ 108 billion in revenue and more than a million jobs in both the public and private sector at the local and national level . 
h.r. 3824 regrettably changes it so that scientific data do not work in the same fashion they do and it creates new layers of bureaucracy . 
it also creates impacts which are supposedly related to national security , which may be important in terms of the recovery plan but not in terms of whether the animal should be listed or the species should be listed . 
economics are treated in the same way . 
they become a part of the decisionmaking rather than in the creation of the recovery plan . 
i would note that the president has expressed concerns in his statement of the administrative policy on september 29 and he says , `` requirements related to species recovery agreements , new statutory deadlines , new conservation and programs for private property owners provide little discretion to federal agencies and could result in a significant budgetary impact. '' so if you want fiscally and financially responsible legislation , legislation which , in fact , protects the species , which is fair to all , which makes progress and which is close to the area of the legislation but which has broad citizen support , conservation support , and does move the process forward , i would urge my colleagues to support the substitute which will be offered by my colleagues , the gentleman from california ( mr. george miller ) xz4002780 , and the gentleman from new york ( mr. boehlert ) xz4000350 . 
we can continue our efforts to try in good faith as has been done by both the distinguished gentleman from west virginia ( mr. rahall ) xz4003310 and the distinguished gentleman from california ( mr. pombo ) xz4003220 to achieve good legislation which will again address the concerns of all while at the same time protecting and conserving species which we have no right to remove from this world . 
mr. chairman , i rise in strong support of the substitute . 
in order , however , to maintain a strong esa , the substitute gives a strong definition of what is meant to jeopardize continued existence of the species . 
the substitute directs the secretary to first determine whether public lands are sufficient to protect and save the species ; if we could protect the species , and save the species in our public lands , in our national forests , our national blm lands , and in our parks and wildlife refuges , we should do so without placing the burden on private landowners . 
mr. chairman , this amendment represents a broad bipartisan and fiscally responsible effort to move this process forward in a manner that can not only get an overwhelming vote of support in the house , but which can move on to the president 's desk for signature in the same manner as the original act . 
i urge my colleagues to support the substitute , and i say that it will be not only a successful undertaking , but one which will be much more in the interests of the landowners and of the species that we are trying to protect and preserve . 
mr. chairman , it has been represented that this legislation is going to cost billions of dollars potentially , and for that reason we should reject it in the fiscal crisis in which we currently live . 
i might also note , as a representative of one of the districts that has vast amounts of property in the mountains and so forth , that a lot of small property owners , people who want to use their property , have that ability compromised by the cloud that is placed over their property once they get word of a threatened or endangered species . 
i rise to support the rule and the underlying legislation and to begin by praising the gentleman from california ( mr. pombo ) xz4003220 , the very distinguished chairman , for all of the effort that he has put in to assembling a bipartisan compromise on this . 
i will say i am somewhat disturbed with what i just heard from the gentleman from california ( mr. cardoza ) xz4000650 that 90 percent of this legislation was , in fact , crafted by democratic staff . 
but i think that that is demonstration of the fact that we are working in a bipartisan way and the gentleman from california ( mr. pombo ) xz4003220 has demonstrated his willingness to do just that . 
when i think about the long struggle which the gentleman from california ( mr. pombo ) xz4003220 has been involved in for a decade to try to bring about reform of the endangered species act , i think back to one of the challenges that we have in southern california , and the gentleman from california ( mr. calvert ) xz4000570 , who has worked long and hard on this , represents part of riverside county , and i recounted up in the committee on rules yesterday the fact that dealing with the stephens ' kangaroo rat , an endangered species , we had conflicting directives that came from government . 
the fire department in riverside county said you should clear the brush away from your homes to ensure that you do not face the threat of fire . 
and , by the way , the stephens ' kangaroo rat had been found in great numbers later in texas , but we would jeopardize that if you did clear the brush away from your home . 
we right now in southern california are dealing with tremendous fire problems in that area ; and , frankly , i do believe that the kind of reform that is going to be assembled in a bipartisan way on the endangered species act will go a long way toward preserving property and to make sure that we diminish the kind of threat that does exist out there . 
mr. chairman , i rise in strong support of the threatened and endangered species recovery act , h.r. 3824 . 
as my colleagues can imagine , this is a very big issue in my state . 
in fact , in almost any other country in the world , h.r. 3824 would be held as great environmental legislation . 
the united states has made greater progress in regard to environmental protection than any other country in the world in the last 30 years . 
this bill blows another hole in the federal deficit . 
enacted in 1973 , this landmark legislation has been hugely successful in saving many species from becoming extinct and has been an important conservation tool . 
newly named , the threatened and endangered species recovery act ignores this success and carves out loopholes in the act that will allow developers and others to avoid the law 's protections . 
it is a travesty that the leadership in this house , is yet again giving business the upper hand over sensible and effective environmental protection law . 
in fact , the federal government will now pay landowners for merely abiding the law ! 
mr. chairman , today i rise in opposition to h.r 3824 , the threatened and endangered species recovery act . 
when this legislation was first passed , many species in this country were on the brink of extinction , and many more were in severe decline . 
in the thirty years since the passage of the endangered species act , we have seen an amazing turnaround in both the population numbers of species that were in decline , as well as in the significant environmental improvements that have fostered their recovery . 
h.r. 3824 was introduced just last week and was marked up without any public hearings , yet this legislation would most certainly rank as the most sweeping and significant change of environmental law in the past three decades . 
i have grave concerns about provisions in the bill that give political appointees the power to remove species from the endangered list based on political decisions rather than on sound science . 
i do not understand how eliminating protected areas can result in greater protection of endangered species . 
i urge my colleagues to vote against h.r. 3824 , and to vote in favor of the balanced , bipartisan substitute legislation for esa reform . 
alabama ranks in the top five states in the number of listed species , and passage of this legislation will move us closer to achieving the goal of protecting and recovering the nation 's threatened and endangered species by adding a layer of common sense . 
such timely notice serves to let everyone know whether they should be interested in the listing process and , ideally , brings them to the table to participate . 
i would like to thank chairman pombo for all his hard work on crafting this important piece of legislation , and i am very appreciative of his efforts to include this provision in his manager 's amendment . 
mr. chairman , i thank the gentleman for yielding me this time , and i rise as a member probably more affected by this law than anybody else in the united states congress . 
i probably represent more critical habitat in the coastal counties of monterey bay than anybody . 
watchable wildlife is the largest business , fastest-growing business in the united states . 
of all the sports in this country , watchable wildlife exceeds them all . 
i am on the committee on appropriations , and in 2003 the fish and wildlife service said it needed approximately $ 153 million to address the critical backlog of listings of critical habitat ; yet the president only asked for $ 18 million . 
every city councilmember , every city supervisor in the united states ought to wake up and look at this law because now they give full development rights under this law . 
if you do not like the way the law is , you have trees in your backyard that the government says , the community says you ought to preserve , you do not have to worry about that now because you can say that is a taking . 
mr. chairman , i rise in support of the underlying amendment , because in the middle of the night , the manager 's amendment removed the noaa fisheries provision in the interior . 
mr. chairman , i rise in opposition to h.r. 3824 , the threatened and endangered species recovery act , as it is currently drafted . 
my home on the central coast in the 17th district has more habitat where both endangered plants and animals have lived with commercial farming and ranching . 
the same climate that produces over three billion dollars annually in agriculture farm gate also is home to the tar plant in santa cruz and the california condor in big sur . 
i recognize the need for some `` tune-ups '' in the esa , unfortunately , h.r. 3824 takes a meat axe approach when what we need is a scalpel . 
as one of the pillars of environmental law , it has brought public attention to the impact of human activities on our nation 's wildlife that contributes so much beauty and delight to life as well as growing economic development in environmental tourism . 
with the recent discovery of the once thought to be extinct ivory-billed woodpecker in arkansas and the mount diablo buckwheat in california , i think this is an opportune moment to highlight the success of many of our conservation efforts . 
for example , in my home state of california , i am especially proud of the conservation and management efforts that have helped significantly restore populations of california condor , the southern sea otter , the winter run chinook salmon , the least bell 's vireo songbird , the california brown pelican , and the california gray whale . 
mr. chairman , it is fitting that congress is moving to reauthorize esa on sea otter awareness week since the sea otters are a success story in my district . 
the dramatic turnaround realized by the once thought extinct southern sea otter is a result of two critical protection laws -- the esa and the marine mammal protection act , the southern sea otter population grew from less than 100 otters in the 1930 's to the present total of 2 , 800 . 
as reauthorization of the esa moves forward this week in the house , i will fight to keep it strong enough to successfully overcome these threats to the southern sea otter . 
at this time , more than 1 , 000 species in the u.s. and abroad , are designated as `` at risk '' for extinction . 
fish in one river that arrive in spring will be managed by the department of commerce , while fish that arrive in that same river during fall will be managed by the department of interior . 
to make things more complicated , who will manage these fish when they are all mixed together in the ocean ? 
as the pew and us commissions on ocean policy recommended , we need to consolidate our ocean management under one roof , specifically the national oceanic and atmospheric administration in the department of commerce , to be effective . 
mr. chairman , let 's not send the message that this congress is more interested in private property development than in the common good of america the beautiful , from sea to shining sea . 
the action this house takes today is a step in the long process to reauthorizing the endangered species act . 
i would say that that is precisely the reason we need to reform it , because everybody can find not just one but two or three or a dozen examples in their own state of how the current law is not leading to recovery , but it is , rather , tying people up and making individuals and organizations simply pay for a regulation rather than recovery . 
mr. chairman , i appreciate the opportunity to stand in strong opposition to the substitute and in strong support of the underlying bill . 
unfortunately , i may not be able to stay for the vote because there are fires in my district and my neighborhood is being evacuated . 
mr. speaker , i am in strong support of this rule . 
he has been in congress for seven terms . 
he has worked very hard on the things that he believes in . 
he has been relentlessly patient to deal with a number of issues that have affected his district and those in the western areas of the united states , and he has presented to us today a bill that will reform , refine , and reauthorize the endangered species act . 
now , i do not agree with everything in the chairman 's bill or his approach , but i want to state here this morning that i respect his courage and his relentless patience to take years to bring something to the floor that he believes in . 
the substitute which i support , and i hope my colleagues in this body will support , is not a whole lot different than the base bill . 
we went through the base bill hour after hour after hour , members and staff ; and we changed a few words here and there that we feel will present the approach to protecting endangered species in the appropriate way . 
i think we need to do a number of things that we have done in the substitute . 
we are reviewing all species every 5 years to see if the change of status is there , page 5. we repeal the critical habitat requirement in the base bill and replace it with a slightly different recovery plan . 
the two major industries in my district are agriculture and fishing . 
here are some reasons why : in the substitute , there are specific criteria for science laid out . 
mr. chairman , i think we are here in some sense , past all the clutter of people articulating their most emotional feelings , is a bill set aside some 30 years ago to have an understanding about how we as members of congress , the government , can restore the prodigious bounty of god 's creation . 
well , in the real world , well , actually , in the real world which is nature , but in the reality of the human condition , we have a lot of other little things that we have to take into consideration . 
all these things have to be taken into consideration so that we create a policy that protects private property rights , that brings individuals on those farms and that landscape into the process and helps pay for their contribution to the process , that brings federal agencies in so they can view the landscape , not from just one small little fly or tiger beetle or some other particular species , but upon which the landscape that supports that species , supports clean water , supports clean air , supports the whole ecosystem including human beings , including us as a species . 
so how do we clarify all these different perspectives and views based on different things that happen in our districts ? 
i would tell my colleagues that i feel strongly this is the best policy change , the best reauthorization plan that we can use to deal with the endangered species act that will deal with nature 's design and man 's impact on nature 's design , which includes private property rights , which includes reimbursements for helping to preserve endangered species , and by the way , in this substitute is a provision to pay those private property individuals . 
mr. chairman , i rise in support of h.r. 3824 , the threatened and endangered species recovery act . 
i would like to make a comparison that may put this dismal success rate in perspective . 
if i , for instance , ran a hospital where only one half of 1 percent of the critical patients who checked in recovered , i could hardly claim to be doing a good job . 
in fact , landowners have come to fear the endangered species act as it has evolved into a giant regulatory menace . 
private property rights are fundamental rights embodied in the constitution , and congress periodically needs to take steps to ensure that government is protecting them , not trampling on them . 
in my own committee , the committee on agriculture , we have recently examined another example of the infringement of property rights through the use of eminent domain . 
these reforms will not only be more effective in achieving species recovery , but do so in a flexible , non-adversarial manner . 
failing to improve the lot of species in more than 99 cases out of 100 is n't working . 
the endangered species act plays a prominent role in my state of missouri with over 25 endangered and threatened species located within the borders and nine in my district . 
also , landowners seem to be getting cheated when species are identified on their property resulting in lower property values , less production and limited use . 
these unintended adverse impacts have resulted in a law that is hurting landowners while not recovering any species . 
the language in section 10 of the bill creates `` species recovery agreements. '' basically , it is an all-inclusive incentive program that will compensate landowners for their conservation efforts . 
it is my hope that this provision will foster a better working relationship with landowners and the federal government resulting in recovery of more species . 
another reason why i chose to get involved in this debate is because of the implication this act has on the management of the missouri river . 
ultimately , i would like to see the provisions in this bill fix the situation so navigation becomes more reliable . 
mr. chairman , today i rise in opposition to h.r. 3824 . 
in the 1960s , rachel carson 's book `` silent spring '' documented the harmful effects of ddt and other pesticides on songbirds . 
today we are considering a bill that would usher in another silent spring by eliminating the oversight for the registration of pesticides which harm wildlife and people . 
h.r. 3824 contains a provision allowing epa to consult with itself in determining the potential impacts of pesticide registration on endangered wildlife and fish , instead of consulting with the fish and wildlife service or the national marine fisheries service , which are the expert agencies whose mission is either in whole or in part to conserve species . 
the endangered species act , on the other hand , recognizes what almost all americans believe , that no dollar amount can be placed on the extension of our nation 's treasured wildlife or on the human health of people who work in those fields . 
it would leave in place current safeguards by requiring an analysis based on the health of wildlife , not the company 's bottom line . 
for this reason and many others , i urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this controversial bill and voting `` yes '' on the miller substitute . 
house resolution 470 provides that , in lieu of the amendment recommended by the committee on resources now printed in the bill , the amendment in the nature of a substitute consisting of the text of the committee on resources print dated september 26 shall be considered as an original bill for the purpose of amendment and shall be considered as read . 
the rule waives all points of order against the committee amendment in the nature of a substitute . 
house resolution 470 makes in order only those amendments printed in the committee on rules report accompanying the resolution . 
the rule provides that amendments printed in the report may be offered only in the order printed in the report , may be offered only by a member designated in the report , shall be considered as read , shall be debatable for the time specified in the report equally divided and controlled by the proponent and opponent , shall not be subject to amendment , and shall not be subject to a demand for a division of the question in the house or in the committee of the whole . 
lastly , the resolution waives all points of order against amendments printed in the report and provides one motion to recommit , with or without instruction . 
unfortunately , some of the most well-known examples of the esa problems have occurred in my region of the country , the pacific northwest . 
four years ago , water to family farms in the klamath basin in oregon was cut off in the name of the sucker fish , when everyone knew there were other measures that would truly help species recover without bankrupting businesses and families . 
every summer , in excess of $ 3 million is being spent per listed salmon . 
every summer in excess of $ 3 million per salmon is spent to spill water over dams , even though science and common sense tells us that there are better ways of species recovery . 
simply put , this act is broken , and it is in need of updating . 
these plans will require the identification of lands important for species recovery , in lieu of the cumbersome and litigation-driven critical habitat process . 
in addition , the bill authorizes collaborative recovery teams made up of a diverse group of stakeholders , including people with conservation expertise as well as those whose livelihoods are affected by environmental policies . 
this legislation also offers important new tools for encouraging voluntary participation in species recovery efforts by private property owners . 
in addition , this bill offers financial aid to those whose property has been restricted for conservation purposes . 
another important improvement in the esa that this bill would provide is strengthening the science and data used in decision-making . 
stronger science and esa information will result in our limited federal resources going to where they will do the most good , while reducing instances of drastic federal actions being taken on poor or limited data . 
mr. speaker , i would advise the gentleman from oregon that his amendment during the markup in the rules committee was not offered by either side to be voted on . 
my point was during the markup of the rule , there was no attempt on the other side to amend the rule to make his amendment in order . 
i contend that is huge , huge movement from where we have gone in 10 years . 
mr. chairman , i rise in support of the legislation offered by the gentleman from california ( mr. pombo ) and would like to give you an example of why this bill is needed . 
the front range of the rockies could also claim at least three government reservations -- the u.s. air force academy , rocky flats and warren afb in wyoming -- which offered the mouse almost untrammeled range in which to roam . 
hopefully , we 'll see it completed sometime in the near future though there is some evidence that fish and wildlife is taking its time in doing so . 
mr. speaker , i rise today in support of the rule and in strong support of the underlying bill . 
in 2001 , a community of family farmers in the klamath basin of northern california and southern oregon had their entire water supply shut off to prevent a perceived threat to two species of listed fish . 
several years ago a levee protecting one of the communities i represent had deteriorated , and the army corps of engineers predicted that in the event of high water , there would be a significant threat to human life . 
mr. chairman , it is my understanding that the legislation would provide the president the authority to waive or expedite any provision of the act in the event of a major national disaster . 
as you know , mr. chairman , a terrible situation occurred in my district in northern california several years ago where a levee that protects one of the communities i represent had deteriorated to such a point that the corps of engineers predicted that this degraded levee , without repair , presented a threat to human life . 
regrettably , repairs to that levee were unable to proceed in a timely manner due to the lengthy consultation process , even though this very serious warning had been issued by the corps . 
mr. chairman , it is my understanding that the secretary currently has in place emergency regulations that allow for expedited consultation in the event of an immediate threat to public safety , as , for example , when the floodwaters are rising and are feet or perhaps even inches away from breaking or breaching a levee . 
again , mr. chairman , i want to commend the gentleman for his leadership and years of work he has invested in making the endangered species act a more responsive and effective law . 
i just want to focus on one aspect of this legislation which i think would be amusing in some sense if it were not for the fact that it is an example of a kind of cynical hypocrisy in those people who call themselves fiscally conservative . 
you might want to even cast aside the environmental aspects of it , because if you look at the monetary implications of this and the budgetary implications of this bill , it is going to create an even bigger budget deficit in the context of this huge giveaway program . 
they want to sell off the national parks , they want to remove the safety net for millions of americans who rely upon government services , and now they are going to make it even more difficult for this congress to provide the kind of programs and assistance that are needed in terms of health care , education , a variety of things by passing a piece of legislation that builds an even bigger budget deficit by creating a whole new giveaway program , a new entitlement program for some of the wealthiest people in the country , some of the biggest landowners in the country . 
in 1973 congress enacted the esa to address this problem of species extinction . 
under this law , once a species is designated as either `` endangered '' or `` threatened , '' powerful legal tools are available to aid in the recovery of the species and to protect its habitat . 
the bill we are debating today is flawed in many ways , but i am particularly concerned with its removal of habitat protection from the endangered species act . 
this legislation blatantly ignores the integral role habitat plays in the survival of a species by eliminating the designation of `` critical habitat. '' without this special designation , our government 's ability to recover species will be severely undermined . 
it is undeniable that the world in which we live is an intricately connected environment that is suffering from human abuse and neglect . 
the loss of a species interrupts the life cycle of the ecosystem it was part of and alters our environment in ways far beyond this isolated event . 
the endangered species act is a vital tool in preventing and reversing these life cycle disruptions before they ripple out and cause further damage to our natural communities . 
i urge my colleagues to oppose this legislation that will result in far reaching and detrimental impacts . 
over its 32-year history , the endangered species act has been 99 percent successful in saving species from extinction , with only 7 out of over 1 , 200 species having gone extinct after being listed under the act . 
the act was written to protect all plants and animals in the united states from extinction and to restore them to stable populations . 
limiting protections for imperiled species now would serve only to make protection and recovery much more difficult and expensive in the future . 
adding another layer of bureaucracy would serve only to slow the process , to the detriment of both the species in question and affected citizens . 
thirty-two years ago , we passed a bill that a republican president , richard nixon , signed to protect and conserve species in danger of extinction . 
in contrast , the bipartisan substitute offered by the gentleman from california ( mr. george miller ) xz4002780 has a far more reasoned approach . 
thirty-two years ago , congress passed and a republican president -- richard nixon -- signed the endangered species act to protect and conserve species in danger of extinction . 
today , there are 1 , 268 species listed as endangered or threatened in the united states , including 26 in the state of maryland . 
in contrast , the bipartisan substitute offers a far more reasoned approach . 
third , and importantly , it will have a conservation grant program to allow the use of federal funds to help private landowners who will agree to use their lands to help in the preservation of these species . 
when a developer comes in there , buys up land that is used for a wheat field and says he wants to put in a strip club or a casino , american taxpayers , under the underlying bill , would now have to pay entitlement funds where there is no money in this bill appropriated to do it , or even especially authorized for these highly speculative enterprises . 
and , by the way , nowhere in american law is any taxpayer required in any jurisdiction in this country to do that right now . 
mr. chairman , i think it is appropriate to refer to the first endangered species act in genesis . 
`` bring out every kind of living creature that is with you , the birds , the animals , and all the creatures that move along the ground , so that they can multiply on the earth and be fruitful and increase in number upon it. '' are we acting in the spirit of noah when we purport to vote , some may vote , for a bill that would prevent protecting the bald eagle from pesticides , when ddt almost removed it from the treasure-trove of american icons ? 
are we acting in the spirit of genesis ? 
when we act to remove any meaningful enforcement provisions to protect the habitat , are we acting in the spirit of genesis ? 
what is a bird without a tree to nest in ? 
and under the bill , as written , the maps will hang on the walls of these agencies in beautiful pink and blue , and the cub scouts and the girl scout troops can come through and look at the beautiful maps . 
i want to tell my colleagues of a woman who was in my office the other day . 
and just to make sure no one thinks this is just some esoteric thing , her name is gail and she lives in miller bay in washington state , kitsap county . 
mr. chairman , that is why we need to do this substitute , which has a better way of identifying habitat in the recovery process so we do not have this frustration with the landowners , so we do not waste 3 years just bothering landowners and not recovering species , but we have a mechanism to get this job done . 
this is a failure in drafting . 
mr. chairman , i rise today in opposition to h.r. 3824 . 
this issue needs to be looked at from a bipartisan perspective and because of this i am in support of the substitute amendment offered by mr. miller of california . 
the amendment not only addresses the current problems in the pombo bill , but also improves the current law . 
species conservation is an essential tenet in the effort to promote and maintain a healthy environment . 
although i agree with congressman pombo 's initiative in principle , after reviewing the legislation closely i came to the conclusion that this bill would jeopardize critical habitat protections that endangered plants and animals need to survive and recover their populations , and it would do little to protect the planet 's most threatened wildlife . 
as a senior member of the house science committee , i also have serious reservations that in its current form , h.r. 3824 attempts to substitute politics for sound science in decisions involving endangered species , letting expediency and profit motives influence what should be scientific decisions . 
mr. chairman , i appreciate the approach that the committee is taking in trying to revamp and revise the endangered species act . 
and while there is wide agreement here on the house floor that it should be amended and tweaked and improved on in light of past experience and modern times , we need to do it responsibly ; and i believe that responsible approach is better reflected in the substitute that is being offered here today . 
unlike some in this chamber who believe that the endangered species act has been an unmitigated failure , there are countless success stories around the country . 
in my home state of wisconsin , an example of how well it has worked , working with local officials and the stakeholders involved , the higgins eye mussel has come back in the mississippi river , which acts as a great filtration system in the river basin . 
the karner blue butterfly , on the verge of extinction in wisconsin , due to the endangered species act and the recovery plan that was in place , is making a healthy comeback . 
the whooping crane is making a strong comeback in the necedah wildlife refuge , as has the granddaddy of them all , which has been referenced here today , the american bald eagle . 
there are new nests that are going up in habitat where they had never been found before . 
and the grizzly bear that is about to be delisted in yellowstone and portions of montana from the threatened species list , i can personally attest to the strength of their comeback , having just been in glacier park in august and coming within 20 yards of a big grizzly bear and her two cubs . 
the act has worked , and the point is there is a responsible approach that recognizes the bureaucratic red tape that we streamline , working with private property owners and also putting in place a strong recovery plan for species that makes more sense . 
that sentiment was reflected in president richard nixon 's words during his signing of the act on december 28 , 1973 when he said , `` nothing is more priceless and more worthy of preservation than the rich array of animal life with which our country has been blessed . 
anytime you extinguish a species , the consequences are serious. '' thankfully today , citizens can see firsthand in every state the progress being made in bringing wildlife back from the brink of extinction . 
for example , in wisconsin , for the first time since its 1991 listing as an endangered species , the winged mapleleaf mussel , a species found only in a small area of the st . 
the state 's project , which involves 38 public and private partners , began after the butterfly was listed as endangered in 1992 . 
lastly , perhaps best known , is that bald eagles are increasing in wisconsin , where 645 pairs occupied territories in 1997 , up from 358 in 1990 . 
in fact , since eagles are relatively numerous in wisconsin , the state has donated them to other areas from which they have vanished , including to the nation 's capital -- washington , dc . 
that said , i agree with my friend and colleague , congressman john dingell , author of the original esa in 1973 , that this landmark bill could use an update -- that it could be and should be strengthened in ways that cuts bureaucratic red tape , broadens stakeholder participation , and most importantly better facilitates the revival of more threatened and endangered species . 
mr. chairman , the bipartisan substitute does a substantially better job in these areas . 
for instance , it is widely agreed the esa has done a good job in preventing the extinction of many species but it has been less successful in bringing about `` the recovery of listed species to levels where protection under the act is no longer necessary. '' i believe it is crucial the legislation provides for the development of strong , comprehensive recovery plans within a short period of time after a species is listed as threatened or endangered . 
i believe we should have at least considered expanding the habitat conservation plan land acquisition program in h.r. 3824 which has proven itself effective in reducing conflicts between the conservation of threatened and endangered species and land development and use . 
that , unfortunately , is not in the base bill . 
instead , h.r. 3824 provides a new , uncapped entitlement program in section 13 that will only plunge our nation 's finances deeper in the red , and then prohibits common-sense steps that could at least provide some protection to the taxpayer . 
in contrast , the boehlert substitute would establish a land owner incentive program that would operate much like a farm bill conservation program , with 70 percent cost sharing . 
let 's mend it in light of past experience and the demands of modern times , but let 's do it responsibly -- support the substitute . 
i would urge our chairman to reform the provisions in the bill , to keep the spending within the budget , and make it subject to appropriations . 
cbo warns that in their score of this bill both costs and litigation will go up under the bill . 
mr. chairman , i thank the gentleman for yielding me this time , and i rise in opposition to the threatening endangered species from recovering act . 
every schoolchild in america is aware that pesticides are threatening to birds . 
pesticides have played a large part in the decline of many species , including the bald eagle . 
there are deeper questions here about who we are as human beings that are reflected in legislation like this . 
i could talk about all that , but i want to stress that what we are really doing here in voting for this bill is rejecting the whole idea of interdependence and interconnection ; rejecting the idea of a bald eagle which stands for national unity and that we are all together . 
mr. chairman , i rise today in opposition to the threatened endangered species act , the so-called `` reform '' that will dismantle our nation 's most fundamental wildlife protection law and in support of the bipartisan miller , boehlert , dingell , gilchrest , dicks , saxton , tauscher , kirk substitute . 
i am disappointed at the missed opportunity for the house to strike a real balance in the protection of rare species facing extinction and landowners from future government constraints . 
this amendment maintains several provisions in the underlying bill , but would , among other things , take a more comprehensive approach to recovery plans and create an advisory board to provide scientific advice to the interior department about applying the best science when enforcing endangered species law . 
for over 30 years , the esa has been a work in progress . 
as members of congress , as responsible citizens , i urge my colleagues to join me in supporting real reforms to the esa by supporting the bipartisan substitute amendment and rejecting the underlying bill . 
mr. chairman , i rise in support of the boehlert-miller substitute and against the underlying bill . 
we can not expect a species to recover without first ensuring that it has the habitat in which to do so . 
we have arrived at a situation where the underlying bill will offer no enforceable protection for the habitat that endangered species need to survive , but will only create a blizzard of unenforceable bureaucratic paperwork which , in the words of shakespeare , would be `` full of sound and fury but signifying nothing. '' the boehlert-miller substitute would retain the enforceable protections for habitat provided under a strong jeopardy definition and i urge its adoption . 
in 1994 , many republicans were elected to this body promising to repeal the endangered species act . 
ten years after the republicans took control of the house , they may be one step closer to repealing one of the most successful environmental laws in the history of the country . 
in fact , just months ago , legislation was drafted and subsequently circulated by the chair of the committee on resources that would have completely eliminated endangered species protections over the next 10 years . 
over 30 years ago , the endangered species act was signed into law by president richard nixon , and in the years that followed , it became renowned as one of our nation 's most successful , effective , and vital conservation laws . 
in fact , there are clear economic benefits to this law . 
each year , hunting , fishing , and wildlife watching bring in over $ 100 billion in revenue . 
for example , the reintroduction of the gray wolf into yellowstone national park 10 years ago increased revenues in adjacent local communities by $ 10 million annually . 
no alternative is provided , and in the end , the u.s. fish and wildlife service is left in an unenforceable and nonbinding mandate . 
that amounts to an additional $ 118 million in the first year alone . 
with the largest deficit in american history , with mounting costs from the recent hurricanes , and with the war still raging in iraq and afghanistan , is this the right time to open a slush fund that will funnel millions of dollars to developers and businesses , while undoubtedly resulting in the extinction of unique animals and habitats across this country ? 
on a smaller scale , a similar approach has been overwhelmingly successful in my home state of massachusetts . 
in 1985 , the piping plover , a small shore bird , was in steep decline . 
there were approximately 130 pairs remaining in the united states . 
but in just 14 years , they have made a dramatic comeback , and this was largely the result of coordinated efforts between conservationists and private land managers . 
mr. speaker , i submit herewith for the record the editorial i quoted from earlier : an endangered act since president richard nixon signed it in 1973 , the endangered species act has prevented the extinction of hundreds of species of american plants and animals , restoring many to sizable populations . 
in the process of designating 1 , 370 species eligible for protection , the act also has generated court battles by opponents who chafed at restrictions on commercial development of essential habitat . 
backed by land development and agricultural interests , as well as the bush administration , several members of congress are pushing legislation that would gut what some consider the most important environmental law in u.s. history . 
the existing law requires that species be protected if they are endangered in a significant portion of their range . 
this month the u.s. fish and wildlife service adopted similar reasoning when it proposed the removal of the pygmy owl in arizona from the list of threatened species because healthy populations exist in mexico . 
under president clinton the agency had proposed designation of 1.2 million acres in the state as critical habitat . 
under the pombo standard , animals such as the grizzly bear , bald eagle and timber wolf , with large populations in alaska , would not have qualified for protection in other parts of the united states . 
the supreme court recently refused to hear a challenge to enforcement of the act brought by developers in a dispute involving the endangered kretschmarr cave mold beetle in texas . 
pombo 's bill would allow the secretary of the interior to determine what scientific evidence is relevant in deciding if a species is endangered and give the secretary the power to overturn decisions by federal biologists and wildlife managers . 
texans are justly proud of the vast array of wildlife that thrives in protected forests , mountains and marshes across the state . 
i will also provide for the record an article that appeared in the salt lake tribune by ben long , who is a contributor to the writers on the range , a service of high country news , who has written a great article about how the endangered species act succeeds with flying colors . 
hundreds of them live in my home state of montana . 
`` the act is n't working to recover species now , '' pombo said in a recent speech in washington state . 
if he got out in the forests and rivers more , he might know the story of the bald eagle . 
the american symbol was listed as endangered in 1978 . 
that year , surveys turned up only 12 bald eagle nests in all of montana . 
then , environmental laws such as the endangered species act and a federal ban on the pesticide ddt kicked in . 
by 2005 , the number of bald eagle nests in montana multiplied to 300 nests -- 25 times the number before the bird was included on the endangered species list . 
eagles were similarly successful in other states as well . 
in 1999 , the bald eagle 's status was upgraded from `` endangered '' to `` threatened. '' if trends continue , they will soon be officially recovered and all america will celebrate . 
today , montana is one of the top 10 eagle-producing states in the united states . 
in a recent winter , i watched more than 30 eagles clean up a carcass in a rancher 's back pasture . 
bald eagle congregations have been tourist attractions at places like canyon ferry and libby dams , where they feed on fish in the winter . 
success happens in quiet obscurity . 
gray wolves are another endangered species act success story in the northern rockies . 
wiped out by over-zealous predator control a century ago , wolves began trickling back into montana in the 1980s . 
now , there are hundreds of wolves in western montana , and more in neighboring idaho and wyoming . 
again , we believe his amendment should have been made in order . 
it is what our colleague from illinois ( mr. kirk ) xz4002220 who testified yesterday on behalf of the republican study committee and the republican tuesday group said last night in the committee on rules , that this bill creates an expensive new federal entitlement program . 
mr. chairman , i rise today in strong opposition to this bill , h.r. 3824 , which would substantially weaken the essential protections we have in place for endangered plants and animals . 
it eliminates the designation of critical habitat , which is one of the most important provisions in the endangered species act . 
this is insane , and would ensure that all the money in the endangered species program would go to developer payoffs , and not species protection . 
just in two counties in southern new jersey alone , red knot watchers spend over $ 4 million a year . 
a recent study by the national cancer institute showed that in the past 20 years , 78 percent of new antibiotics and 74 percent of new anticancer drugs were linked to natural products . 
i urge my colleagues to join me in defeating h.r. 3824 . 
nothing has been taken , only the suggestion in the proposal on a plan . 
`` shortsighted men , in their greed and selfishness will , if permitted , rob our country of half its charm by the reckless extermination of all useful and beautiful wild things. '' so said republican president theodore roosevelt almost 100 years ago , and how relevant his remarks are today . 
if we can not find a way to live in harmony and conserve our natural resources in a sustainable way , we humans may , too , be doomed to extinction . 
there are problems with the act that need to be addressed , but many of the changes embodied in this bill are not designed to fix the problems . 
we are a nation of laws and constitutional rights , but where in the constitution does it say property rights are an immutable and an open-ended entitlement ? 
that kind of regulation occurs every day in every state in every locality throughout the country . 
but this bill turns that principle on its head , and in so doing it creates a very dangerous precedent that this body should not knowingly adopt . 
it is a standard for compensation that goes far beyond the standard imposed under the constitution 's `` taking '' clause , and it does not exist in any other federal statute . 
if enacted , this bill will set a very dangerous precedent that could lead to the insertion of similar provisions in other environmental and regulatory statutes . 
the current `` critical habitat '' designation needs to be revised and should be established later in the process during the development of species recovery plans . 
in that regard , the approach taken by the substitute put together by the gentleman from michigan ( mr. dingell ) xz4001100 and the gentleman from washington ( mr. dicks ) xz4001090 and others is the right way to go and should be adopted . 
in 1978 , 50 miles of the central platte river in nebraska was designated as critical habitat for whooping cranes . 
mr. speaker , i would first like to congratulate the gentleman from california for the great work he has done in getting the endangered species act reform to the floor . 
this is a very controversial issue , and he and the committee should be commended for working to address some of the real problems in the current law . 
there are a couple of provisions for which i have been a strong proponent , and i am pleased that the chairman has agreed to include them in the manager 's amendment . 
specifically , the provision requires that each of the power marketing administrations , the bonneville power administration , western area power administration , southwestern power administration , and the southeastern power administration , to include costs related to the endangered species act in their customers ' monthly electricity billings . 
in the pacific northwest alone , the bonneville power administration accounts for 45 percent of the region 's electricity sales and 75 percent of the transmission lines . 
bonneville power 's rates have risen 46 percent since 2001 , due in main part to the endangered species act 's impact on the columbia/snake hydropower system . 
i would like to thank the chairman for including language in the bill that consolidates jurisdiction of the endangered species act management of species under one agency . 
during my first term in congress , i introduced legislation that did just that , and i am pleased to see the concept is finally moving forward . 
now the agency 's mission of managing commercial and tribal harvests of salmon and recovering endangered species are in conflict . 
in a hearing we had on endangered species last year , she described california as being the greenest state , santa barbara as being the greenest of the cities in california , and she as being the greenest of the green . 
she said that the endangered species act is blocking people from making additions onto their homes , it is keeping the beach closed , it is stopping development in their town , and they are tired of it . 
the gentleman from california ( mr. pombo ) xz4003220 , our chairman , has taken a very good stance in reforming it . 
in new mexico , we have the silvery minnow . 
in order to keep the flow in the rio grand river at the level that the biologists said we had to have , we had to release storage of water that had been building up for 50 years in four different reservoirs . 
and storage for water like that in new mexico is not easy to get . 
so one of the most important provisions in this bill is that sound science must be used for any decision . 
mr. chairman , i thank the gentleman for yielding me this time , and i thank him for his extraordinary leadership on behalf of the american people in terms of the air they breathe , the water they drink , in protecting god 's beautiful gift to us , this beautiful legacy that we have in our environment , and i commend the ranking member , the gentleman from west virginia ( mr. rahall ) xz4003310 , for his leadership as well . 
he has been a champion as well in this area . 
mr. chairman , i rise in opposition to this legislation which would critically undermine protections for our nation 's endangered species . 
i rise as house democratic leader , of course , in support of the substitute , but i also rise as a mother and as a grandmother ; mother of five and grandmother of five . 
but we teach our grandchildren , and i did teach my children when they were little , that everything in nature is connected and that there is a reason , a balance to it all , this beautiful web of life that is nature . 
today 's bill of course in this debate points out what value we place on that . 
with the passage of the first endangered species law in 1966 and the modern endangered species act in 1973 , congress made a commitment to future generations of americans , at that time that would be our children , my grandchildren . 
earlier in the debate , i heard the gentleman from washington ( mr. dicks ) xz4001090 speaking , and i see he is still in the chamber , and i thank him for his very enlightening presentation about how many species have been saved during the life of this law . 
it saved the florida manatee , the grizzly bear , the southern sea otter , sea turtles , and many other animals and plants , all important in the balance of nature . 
in wisdom you made them all ; the earth is full of your creatures . 
there is the sea , vast and spacious , teeming with creatures beyond number , living things both large and small. '' in wisdom god has made them all `` living both things both large and small , '' and in wisdom we should preserve and protect them . 
we have yet to learn the roles that many creatures play in the web of life , and we are yet to discover the practical effects many species may bring to humankind . 
one example in california is the pacific forest yew . 
it undermines sound science by directing the secretary of the interior , a political appointee , to issue regulations locking in a static definition of specific acceptable scientific data . 
i think that is why it is important for congress to be very clear what our intent is , so that intention of congress and that clarity of our voices here will give guidance to those who enforce the law so that is the implementation and the execution of it is not in a way that is so risk averse as to be counterproductive . 
i urge my colleagues to strengthen the endangered species act by voting for a bipartisan substitute and opposing the underlying bill , and in doing so , to truly , as members of congress , show our children that we mean it when we say that we all know that everything in nature is connected and it is important to maintain the balance , the web of life . 
in isaiah in the old testament , we are told that to minister to the needs of god 's creation , and that includes our beautiful environment , is an act of worship . 
first of all , i want to thank the major coauthor of the bill , the gentleman from california ( mr. cardoza ) xz4000650 , for working with me in a bipartisan way over the last several months to craft a bipartisan solution to the problems that we have got with the endangered species act . 
i also would like to thank the gentleman from west virginia ( mr. rahall ) xz4003310 , the ranking member on the committee , for all of the work that he put in , and that his staff put in , particularly jim zoia , who did yeoman 's work in putting this bill together . 
this debate over endangered species has been raging across this country for years , and our effort was to throw away everything that we had tried to do in the past and put it aside and try to start again and say how do we sit down as members of the committee on resources and come to a solution that we can all agree with . 
we knew that there were things that had to be fixed , that just were not working in current law . 
it is amazing to hear all of this stuff that is supposedly in the bill . 
it claims to deal with all the same issues , and in fact they use the exact same language . 
in our bill , we protect the small property owners . 
if the federal government steps in and takes somebody 's land for a highway , we all pay for it . 
half the democrats that voted in the committee voted for it . 
it was a compromise , a reasonable way to protect endangered species , to protect the habitat in which they need to recover ; and if that does involve private property , yes , we pay them for it . 
if one goes back and reads the original endangered species act , it becomes difficult to be critical of specific language that is it in because the purpose of the endangered species act was to , first of all , prevent species from becoming extinct but , more importantly , to recover those species . 
that became a big issue in my district and throughout much of the west . 
that became a big problem , and it is something that we began to work on , to try to have some kind of property rights protections in the law . 
but the more i got into the endangered species act , the more i realized the law was just not working in terms of recovering species . 
about three-quarters of the species are either declining in population or the fish and wildlife service has no idea . 
it is something we all share in terms of preserving wildlife and preserving species . 
but when the law is not working , we have to respond to that and step in and reauthorize the bill , put the focus on recovery and protect private property owners . 
in the end , there were a few issues that we just disagreed on , there were issues we could not come to a conclusion on , but the vast majority of what is in the underlying bill was an agreement that we were able to work out and that i stand by . 
but i will say that , in the end , private property rights , the protection of those property owners , has to be in the final bill , because the only way this is going to work is if we bring in property owners to be part of the solution and be part of recovering those species . 
it is not in there . 
it requires the four power marketing administrations to include esa costs in their monthly billing statements . 
that is the short version of what is included in the manager 's amendment . 
again , what the underlying bill does is if you step in and take habitat from a private property owner and you tell them that you restrict them and you tell them they can not use part of their property , then we set up a system of incentives and grants . 
but , if in the end , the secretary says your property is necessary for the recovery of an endangered species , therefore you can not use it , we compensate them for that and we pay them for it . 
mr. chairman , reclaiming my time , this provision was not in the contract with america . 
and all of you ran down on the floor and said you were all in support of that . 
i mean , you guys have no consistency in this whatsoever . 
i believe if you take away somebody 's private property , you should have to pay them for it , and that is what we are trying to do in this underlying bill . 
it does not say the government can step in and take 90 percent of your value and then it is okay ; it does not say they can take away 30 percent of your value and that is okay . 
why is it okay in that instance , but it is not okay when it comes to protecting habitat ? 
the only way you are going to recover species is if you bring in the property owners and have them be part of the solution . 
you are stopping that from happening right now under current law and in the substitute . 
that is what is in the underlying bill . 
one of you comes down and beats us up because we are spending too much money about this massive increase in spending under this bill . 
i know that there are issues in the underlying bill that we disagree on , and we probably always will . 
that is what is in the bill , is current law . 
we had a different definition in the bill originally , and that caused the administration to say that it would result in new litigation , so we said we will stay with current law ; and that eviscerates the act , staying with current law that they have so dutifully defended . 
the substitute represents , i think , a step back in the negotiations in that everything that you wanted that you did not get , you put in the substitute ; change the words a little bit so that they really do not mean anything . 
i remember 10 years ago , i introduced a bill on endangered species , and one of the major provisions in that bill was to utilize public lands , and i got ripped over it because 90 percent of the species have their habitat on private land . 
we hear a lot of horror stories about things that have happened in my district and mr. cardoza 's district and mr. costa 's district and mr. baca 's district , in your district , mr. miller . 
the act has been a failure in recovering species . 
i salute the manner in which the gentleman from california conducted himself and the manner in which his staff treated the minority during this entire process . 
in the end , however , we could not reach agreement . 
yet we still have differences that divide us , differences in some instances that i have yet to discover . 
in fact , the manager 's amendment has been redrafted so many times , the latest version is still hot off the presses . 
i wish the bill , because of these latest changes in the manager 's amendment , were not being rushed to the house floor . 
with a little more time to consider how much this bill is going to cost the american taxpayers , we could at least have had a chance to see how much we are going to lose in the exchange . 
in the last several hours , the bill passed out of the committee has completely blown apart . 
for example , the manager 's amendment abandons the definition of jeopardizing a species we agreed upon in committee . 
so in my view , this bill offers endangered species less protection at far greater cost . 
not only was fiscal responsibility thrown to the wind in this process , but we have turned back the clock to an era in which ddt was commonly known as `` drop dead twice. '' h.r. 3824 includes a provision adopted in the committee on resources that would repeal the endangered species act provisions that protect threatened and endangered species from the harmful impact of pesticides . 
as long as corporations comply with federal requirements to register pesticide users , they will have no obligation to meet the requirements in the endangered species act . 
this , i might add , is where we truly broke down in our negotiations . 
under current law , the fish and wildlife service analyzes a proposed action to gauge if it is likely to place the continued existence of a species in jeopardy . 
the process is grounded in science and must meet reasonable criteria . 
it is questionable whether consultation would ever occur , even in those situations causing jeopardy to a listed species . 
quite likely it will result in more extinctions , the loss of more of the creatures god has placed in our care . 
however , i have worked , as i said in the beginning , well with the gentleman from california on this bill ; and i do salute his tenaciousness , his patience , and his courage in bringing this bill to the floor . 
i would have preferred we keep trying to resolve our differences , but that is not the situation we are in today , so i would urge my colleagues to oppose h.r. 3824 . 
mr. chairman , in response to the last colloquy that just took place between the two gentlemen from california in regard to emergency powers that would be granted the president to waive provisions of the endangered species act , i just wanted to respond that the endangered species act did not get in the way in any manner whatsoever of recovery efforts in response to hurricanes katrina and rita . 
the previous gentleman , while not speaking to the legislation whatsoever , should take note , and he has referred to the cost to a hospital in his district that had to pay some enormous costs , but it is important to realize anytime we allow species to go extinct we lose enormous potential to understand and improve our world and to create medicines that many times can save people 's lives . 
nowhere is that more evident than in the world of medicine . 
mr. chairman , psalms 104 , verses 25 , 30 : `` in wisdom you made them all , the earth is full of your creatures . 
in the earlier comment , i stated that there are numerous members of this body , perhaps to the person , who could tell of horror stories involved with the administration of the current endangered species act . 
indeed , there are some in this administration that would sell our national parks and other public lands in order to address our ever-mounting deficit . 
and as i have said and referred to in earlier responses , why should we care about critters ? 
nowhere should that care be more evident than in the world of medicine . 
nearly 50 percent of all our medical prescriptions , for example , dispensed annually in our country , are derived from nature or modified to mimic natural substances . 
mold fungus , it has saved countless lives in recent generations , and it continues to do so every day . 
morphine and codeine , both made from poppy plants , are among the most widely used medications in the world today . 
even insects have their value in medicine . 
we now know that the genes that turn out to form a heart in a fruit fly are actually the same genes that form hearts in higher animals and people . 
all have the same breath. '' mr. chairman , at the appropriate time , i will be speaking on the manager 's amendment and i will also be speaking in support of the substitute amendment that will be offered . 
as i said in my opening comments , i introduced these negotiations in good faith with the gentleman from california ( mr. pombo ) xz4003220 , my chairman , because i thought there was not adequate funding to enforce the current endangered species law , and those negotiations were conducted in good faith , and we came quite close , and he will say probably that 90 percent of the current bill is a bill upon which i agree . 
but at the same time , in the manager 's amendment that will be coming up , there were changes made in literally the last minute that came very close to violating the good-faith negotiations that were ongoing on this legislation . 
but i will say at this point that this legislation needs to be defeated , the substitute that will be offered needs to be supported , and we need to look very seriously at how we can enforce better the endangered species laws on the books today rather than the overhaul that exists in the pending legislation , and i urge defeat of the legislation . 
mr. chairman , the manager 's amendment makes significant changes in the bill as it was reported from the committee on resources . 
these changes are likely to result in more species extinctions at greater loss of taxpayer dollars . 
the pending legislation will increase direct spending in the discretionary funding law , which we will get into in general debate , and it could rise to more than $ 600 million a year , $ 235 million more per year than we are spending today for species conservation , according to the congressional budget office . 
let me make one point perfectly clear here : the manager 's amendment is not something i agreed to in my discussions with the gentleman from california ( chairman pombo ) . 
while i was willing to eliminate critical habitat , it was only on the condition that we ensure that there were adequate provisions in place to encourage recovery . 
it is upon that ground that i oppose this manager 's amendment , as well as the loosened compensation standards put in order by the manager 's amendment . 
mr. chairman , i say to my chairman , i appreciate his concluding comments there and , as i have said all along , we have negotiated in good faith , and i do want to continue that relationship that we have . 
mr. chairman , i rise in support of the substitute amendment . 
it will assist landowners in their efforts to conserve species . 
i have come to learn in my time in congress that people support reform , as long as it does not change anything , and that is what we find with the endangered species reform . 
i thought i was given a great honor when i first got here in the year 2001 . 
i brought along a shovel today because the biggest joke in montana is shoot , shovel , and shut up . 
mr. chairman , i rise in strong support of the bipartisan substitute . 
today , we have wolves in yellowstone , manatees in florida , and sea otters in california , largely because of the act . 
in the southern part of new jersey , we have bald eagles , timber rattlesnakes , and barred owls because of the protections provided by the endangered species act ; and by protecting their habitat , we have protected our own habitat . 
i am concerned that the provisions contained in h.r. 3824 would profoundly alter the act and the process . 
there is broad consensus in congress to reform the endangered species act , mr. chairman ; but it is vital that in doing so we maintain the integrity of the act and our ability to conserve these species for future generations . 
mr. chairman , i rise in support of the miller-boehlert substitute amendment because i believe we will not have a world to live in if we continue our neglectful ways . 
it is vitally important that we not alter it in any way that could result in the protection it provides from being compromised . 
according to the u.s. fish and wildlife service , 99 percent of the species ever listed under the esa have been prevented from going extinct , and 68 percent are stable or improving ; but the recovery plans in place may need 50 years to restore these to relative abundance . 
the substitute also restores the role of science in the endangered species act . 
mr. chairman , i rise in support of h.r. 3824 . 
mr. chairman , i rise today in opposition to h.r. 3824 , the threatened and endangered species recovery act . 
perhaps if some of these endangered species were in a persistent vegetative state , republicans would come rushing to their aid . 
this bill grants unprecedented and immeasurable subsidies to land owners rather than ensuring their fair costs are covered ; so much so in fact , that the nonpartisan congressional budget office can not estimate the potential impact to the federal budget . 
i urge my colleagues to join me , and every environmental organization on god 's green earth , in opposing this bill . 
mr. chairman , i thank my good friend from california ( mr. george miller ) xz4002780 for yielding me the time , and i join him in offering this substitute , because the bill we are considering today , h.r. 3824 , will make it less likely that threatened and endangered species will recover ; but today we can support this bipartisan substitute which will update and improve the endangered species act . 
in some cases , private property owners will be asked to mitigate for the effects of preserving threatened and endangered species . 
i encourage my colleagues to join me and a bipartisan group of members in supporting this reasonable , better substitute and opposing h.r. 3824 . 
and the resources committee did make improvements in the original bill . 
had it been adopted , we would have kept the best parts of the bill as reported -- including the authorization for reimbursement for livestock losses that i supported in the resources committee -- and made the further improvements that were needed for it to deserve approval by the full house of representatives . 
but according to the bush administration 's analysis of the bill as reported , `` the new definition of jeopardy in the bill , as well as various statutory deadlines , may generate new litigation and further divert agency resources from conservation purposes. '' the substitute did not have the same problems . 
those provisions worry the bush administration , which has told us that they `` provide little discretion to federal agencies and could result in a significant budgetary impact. '' and after reviewing the bill as reported , the nonpartisan budget watchdog group , taxpayers for common sense , concluded that `` this legislation is rife with loopholes and vague wording that have the potential to cost taxpayers billions of dollars , and must be revised. '' i supported the bipartisan substitute because it would have made the revisions necessary to close those loopholes . 
mr. speaker , i rise in opposition to the rule . 
this bill was put on a rocket docket so that no one knows what is in it . 
unveiled on monday , and did not see it until tuesday , democrats and republicans not knowing what is in the bill . 
we only had four witnesses and several hours of hearings ; and the crucial witness in this case , the administration witness , would not even take a position on the bill . 
here is the agency that for 30 years has administered the bill , with the scientists , with the expertise , and the administration witness walks in and says , we do not know . 
well , last night in the committee on rules , there were major changes to the bill again in the manager 's amendment . 
so what the gentleman from california just said about the democrats writing the bill , sure , we contributed some of the language , but the manager 's amendment makes significant changes in this bill ; and the things that we are really fighting over , we may have contributed 90 percent , but the things we are fighting over in the 10 percent are huge things at stake : this huge giveaway to big developers , major changes in the environmental laws . 
those were written by others in the bill . 
it basically does not put a dollar amount in the bill , because they are afraid of the dollar amount because it is an entitlement program for landowners that want to gut the endangered species act . 
the majority bill , and this is another major difference , changes the endangered species act in a radical , radical way , especially with the adoption of the manager 's amendment . 
at the end of this , we have not respected this institution by the way we brought the bill before the floor , the way we have worked in committee to put it on a rocket docket and speed it through , speed it through this process . 
we need to take a look at this and work in a bipartisan way . 
mr. chairman , i rise today in support of the substitute amendment in opposition to h.r. 3824 . 
that goes to the basic fact that practically every adult in america has worked hard at a job for a business or a corporation at some point in his or her life . 
i am not here to say whether that is good or bad but just to offer one explanation why we find it so difficult to grasp that the health of our environment and the continuity of all the pieces in our environment is as important to the health of our society and the strength of our economy as sound labor practices . 
most of us in the house were alive in the early 1960s when rachel carson published her book , silent spring . 
in my lifetime , i have witnessed the near extinction of these birds . 
even though the birds have returned , did we ban ddt too late , because we all know that every one of us harbors residues of ddt in our bodies , that ddt is found in our mother 's milk ? 
or , were the eagle and the pelican sentinels , helping us to right our wrongs just in time , before they disappeared from this planet and our own bodies weakened along with , them . 
the endangered species act is not about saving the tiny silvery minnow that lives in the rio grande and it is not about saving the spotted owl that exists in mature forests . 
these economic analyses do not account for the cost if environmental protections are not put in place -- an aquifer that dries up , a hillside that erodes into a river , people stricken with cancer from unsafe pesticides . 
it is easy to hold up the first balance sheet and say , `` business will suffer '' in the same way one could say that by prohibiting the labor of children , `` business will suffer '' . 
but the cumulative costs of a thousand cuts into the environment that sustains us as humans will be borne by everyone in society , consumers and businesses alike . 
he created the wildlife refuge in the klamath basin to ensure that we would have healthy wildlife populations for generations to come ; and , indeed , the wildlife refuge is home to the greatest concentration of bald eagles in the united states , in the lower 48 . 
ninety-six years after he created that refuge , this federal government made a decision to shut the water off to 1 , 200 farm families in that basin based on the endangered species act and interpreted by the government scientists without peer review , without peer review . 
when the national academy of sciences reviewed the decisions , they said the agency made mistakes in the outcome under the endangered species act ; and further they went on to say that those decisions put in jeopardy potentially those very species , the sucker fish in the upper klamath lake and the coho salmon in the klamath river . 
we do not define it in the statute ; we give guidance and then there will be a full public process . 
it sets it in standard . 
i believe in them . 
but it does not open the door as a blank check to developers to go out and pick the most sensitive wildlife habitat area in the country and say , i am going to build a $ 50 million hotel and casino here . 
in the case of the klamath basin , in many respects they were taken away when their water was cut off and 1 , 200 farm families were left destitute . 
i believe in recovery , i believe in species , and i think what we are changing in this bill will build new partnerships that will bring landowners and the government together like never before , that respects the rights of private owners of property , and will actually result in increased recovery of species and habitat . 
they put it in the deed when they cut the deal , and they pay fair and just compensation for taking somebody 's property . 
they do that in the deed , and that is a restriction that carries with the property . 
so if they want to recover species , we say get it done in 2 years with the recovery plan ; they say 3. if my colleagues want to talk about spending , they create a new science board . 
gs15s , section 20 in the bill , $ 1 million a year . 
cbo says we will compensate private property owners to the tune of maybe $ 6 million in the first 5 years . 
that is not fair and right in america . 
so if the members want bigger bureaucracy , pay gs15s here in washington , a total of $ 1 million combined over the year , and they get just as much as we are talking about trying to help out the private property owners . 
so what we are trying to do is create cooperative partnerships with private landowners through new conservation programs and give certainty over 10- , 20- , and 30-year periods to recover species and set up recovery programs that would come together in 2 years , not 3 , and provide for compensation when somebody loses their farm or a portion thereof just as if a highway ran through it . 
the stringent regulations in the endangered species act have benefited many species in our great country . 
our national symbol , the bald eagle , is one of the most profound stories of recovery in progress . 
the american alligator , the peregrine falcon , and the california condor are but a few examples of species that have benefited by the provisions in the bill . 
the pombo legislation includes provisions that require the government to use taxpayer dollars to pay developers and other special interests not to violate the endangered species act , instead of creating commonsense incentive programs that would foster greater involvement in conservation efforts . 
if not , further abuses will occur as evidenced by governor schwarzenegger in my own home state of california . 
congress would be wise to take notice , in light of the no-bid contracts , pleas to exempt all environmental regulations in the gulf states after katrina , and the same old companies slurping up federal funds in egregious excess . 
this bill would repeal all endangered species act provisions that regulate the use of pesticides like ddt , which nearly resulted in the extinction of the american bald eagle in the mid-20th century and decimated the california brown pelican population in my own state . 
wasteful drilling in the arctic and dismantling the clean air act are bad enough , but now the republican majority wants to weaken the endangered species act , weaken it by handing out subsidies to oil and gas companies and land speculators for not killing endangered species , meaning taxpayers will be giving money to these land developers for simply following the law or for taking a risk by making a big investment in land so they can sell it at a higher price . 
mr. chairman , i thank the gentleman from california for yielding me this time , and i wish to engage the chairman of the committee on resources in a colloquy . 
for many years , mr. chairman , the u.s. army corps of engineers has engaged in river management practices that have harmed several species of native wildlife that live in and near the missouri river and undermine the economic livelihood of many communities along the upper missouri river basin . 
my state , and others in the upper reaches of the basin , have repeatedly endeavored to influence the decisions of the corps as it makes critical river management decisions . 
the interagency consultation provisions found in the current law are one of the few tools at our disposal . 
so i am concerned that the alternative procedures defined but not specified in section 12 of the threatened and endangered species act would create a way for the corps to disregard the consultation requirement , and i want to make sure the alternative procedures provision is not designed as a way to eliminate consultation between federal agencies . 
therefore , under the new bill , would the corps be required to manage the missouri river in a manner that meets current standards under the esa ? 
mr. chairman , i rise in support of h.r. 3824 . 
that has given us an awful good opportunity to see what sort of insight and experience in terms of what has worked in preserving and protecting endangered species and habitat and what just as importantly has not worked . 
california faces numerous challenges in complying with the endangered species act , like many parts of our country . 
in california , we have 293 threatened and endangered species in the state , the second largest number in the nation . 
in kern county , part of which lies in my district , we have more listed species than any other county in the state of california . 
to relay an anecdotal story of which there have been many here today , in 1995 , we had a chinese immigrant farmer who , believe it or not , was jailed and prosecuted due to an accidental taking of a species on his land that he had farmed for years . 
as a result of that , i and others in the california legislature led a successful effort to change the law to ensure that that would not happen again . 
during the committee markup last week , i successfully passed two amendments that clarify local governments ' role in participating in the development of habitat conservation planning . 
as we know , many of the habitat conservation plans have had difficulty in their adoption . 
the on-the-ground information from our local governments and water agencies and land use agencies is beneficial in the crucial input in the listing process and for trying to provide recovery efforts that are successful . 
mr. chairman , the endangered species act needs improvement , and i think this bill is a step in that direction . 
it obviously is a work in progress , but we should understand that the dilemma that we face in america today is that while we all want to protect native plants and species , the dilemma is that our population growth has threatened the habitats for many of those plants and animals , and therein lies the dilemma . 
we must continue to work on efforts that i think are included in this legislation , realizing that we are going to have to revisit them in future years . 
my amendment that i referenced a moment ago that was accepted by the committee is meant to assure that states and units of local government have fair input in the listing process for threatened and endangered species . 
local governments , we know , often have the best on-the-ground information on the status of communities of plants and animals that are in the area . 
in many areas of california , we have water districts that are an extremely active part of the local governmental units that are involved in the species recovery process . 
in order to understand the status and the challenges of the various species that are listed , is it the chairman 's understanding that the reference to units of local government in section 8 of the bill would include water districts ? 
both he and i have been afforded the opportunity to spend some time together in the wonderful sierra nevada mountains , and i know how much respect and pride he has for america 's natural resources . 
first of all , the definition as it relates to property rights i think is lacking and needs to be worked on in an important way . 
finally , this is very important and i mentioned it in my comments in supporting the bill : there are no clear definitions as it relates to takings for farmers and ranchers , not just in california but throughout the country . 
farmers and ranchers , i would maintain , are , in many cases , one of the last bastions of protection for habitat . 
when we have growth areas throughout the country , like in california , those farms and those ranches are one of the last hedges to urban sprawl and uncontrolled growth . 
mr. chairman , i rise in opposition to the substitute and in favor of the underlying bill . 
an amendment offered by the gentleman from california ( mr. radanovich ) xz4003300 in committee , which was accepted without objection , will allow local officials to perform vital work needed to prevent the potential threat of catastrophic flooding . 
i rise in opposition because this needed amendment is stripped out of the substitute . 
we know how complex federal bureaucracy can be , but in times of emergency nothing is more important than human health and safety . 
my disaster declaration and protection provision in this bill must be preserved . 
current agency regulations only allow for an expedited consultation in a presidentially declared disaster area for levee repair , but they only allow that after flood waters have topped or broken through levees and devastated the communities that they are designed to protect . 
the amendment that we offered in committee is narrowly tailored to give local flood protection officials the same flexibility to make needed repairs ; but importantly , it does so before the onset of deadly flooding . 
my colleague advised in california back in 1990 and 1991 , the corps of engineers warned the community that their levees needed repair work . 
mr. chairman , i rise today in support of this important very important reform legislation because it is an issue that is very important to me and many of my constituents in my district . 
as we all know , the challenge we face in reforming the esa is to create a balance between the important goal of conservation and preservation of our nation 's species and making sure property owners , businesses , workers and communities do not suffer unnecessarily for these efforts . 
by reforming the current law , we have the opportunity to craft balanced legislation that brings all stakeholders together in common interest . 
a community in my district seeking this balance is durant , oklahoma , which is in part of the `` historic range '' of the american burying beetle . 
the leaders of durant have worked hard and have had success in bringing business to their area of far southeastern oklahoma , but each year , the construction of new sites for these businesses is brought to a screeching halt , always looking for the burying beetle , but no presence of the beetle has been found for a number over years . 
this reform should improve the recovery process and provide real success in saving our national treasures . 
mr. chairman , i appreciate the chairman not only yielding me time but , more especially , i appreciate all the work that he has done in this . 
we heard over and over in the hearings that democrats really appreciated the way in which the gentleman reached out and started from scratch and negotiated with them . 
but nonetheless i also want to thank those democrats who , with an open mind and with a regard for fairness , have assisted the chairman in trying to put together a good bill . 
under this substitute , all property owners can find out is if they need to be having a habitat conservation plan and if they do , well , gee , the government will help you fill out the application in begging to see what you can do with your own property . 
we will be $ 39 billion deeper in debt a month from today . 
well , perhaps we could make some real cuts in wasteful programs in the budget , instead of attacking the vulnerable , the students , kids getting lunches at school . 
kids in foster care , long term care for seniors . 
the republicans do not want to go where the money is because that is where the special interests are , the people who fund their campaign machine to keep them in the majority , to keep them borrowing $ 1.3 billion a day , indebting the american people as far as the eye can see . 
the president has this bizarre idea that we should borrow a trillion dollars , one thousand billion dollars to go to mars while we can not meet the needs of people here on earth , here in the united states of america . 
the general in charge of star wars gave us some very , very encouraging news . 
he said the system to protect us against missiles that will never be fired against the united states because we could track them back and retaliate , they will smuggle a bomb in if they want to attack us . 
well , maybe we could visit that issue in an open rule . 
there is a lot of money coming in there . 
how about the $ 19 billion in the energy bill in subsidies to the oil industry in the hope that they will take money , borrowed by the taxpayers , given to them to go out and explore ? 
so maybe we could take back that $ 19 billion and spend it on lunch for hungry kids or maybe we could put the money back into the student loan program that you want to cut out in the reconciliation bill . 
then we have a few tax giveaways out there , offshore companies like accenture , largest homeland security contractor in the history of the united states , $ 10 billion , who has moved their headquarters to the bahamas so they will not pay any taxes in the united states of america , but they are going to defend us against foreign enemies , but they just do not want to pay any taxes here . 
mr. speaker , reclaiming my time , i would schedule some up-or-down votes on these sorts of major cuts in a much expanded reconciliation under an open rule . 
you do not intend to get a single democratic vote ; and the biggest cut in the bill is student loans , the party of opportunity . 
the second biggest cut in the bill is medicaid ; dump those problems on the states and deprive people of needed health care . 
then , of course , we have the cuts in food security and other things in that bill . 
in case anyone is unclear , so far the president has signed only five of the 12 appropriations bills that must pass and become law before september 30 . 
no one is to blame but the party in control . 
more than 45 days have passed since congress passed its last continuing resolution , 48 to be exact ; and in that time , republicans have managed to pass a measly three of the ten outstanding appropriations bills at the time of the last continuing resolution . 
in baseball , their batting average would be pretty good . 
but in the real world where salaries and promotion are based on accomplishments and contributions , getting done 30 percent of what you are supposed to get done is absolutely abysmal . 
in any other job in america , 30 percent would get you fired . 
so i ask , what in the world have the majority members been doing over the last month and a half that they can not get these constitutionally-mandated appropriations bills done on time ? 
i have been trying to get them to deal with fema since the agency messed up florida recovery efforts in the year 2004 . 
republicans have not dealt with the national security leaks in the bush white house . 
they have not dealt with increasing access to health care or investing in affordable housing for low and moderate incomes . 
they have not dealt with unemployment in this nation . 
in fact , this morning the chairman of the rules committee said to us that we have `` full employment '' in this nation . 
i guess there is no one looking for a job in san dimas where he is from or the greater los angeles area . 
so forgive me , mr. speaker , if i feel it unnecessary to grant republicans another 30 days to fix a problem that they , one , created on their own , and two , have shown zero ability that they are capable of leading our country in a responsibly fiscal manner . 
it is not even the failing war in iraq . 
the problem republicans have is their beloved tax cuts that 95 percent of the people in this country barely benefit from . 
the suggestion that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle should have completed their work by september 30 is mandated by our responsibilities here in the house of representatives . 
and i find it disingenuous to speak of the other body , which i heartily endorse what my colleague said with reference to the gentleman from california ( mr. lewis ) xz4002392 in this house of representatives but the other body is controlled by the majority . 
the gentleman asks for another date or debate about this continuing resolution , doubtless what we would have been able to do is stay here and that may have lit a fire under some of the people in the other body who need to get their work done . 
we have all sorts of problems in this nation and there is no reason for us not to complete our work . 
i join the gentleman from oregon ( mr. defazio ) xz4001000 , my colleague , in asserting that we should stay here and complete the task that is before us . 
i say to my very good friend from florida that your and my chairman of the rules committee speaking about closed rules in another time made the following statement , that closed rules are anathema to democracy . 
when you argue that we are going to have time to do this , when we take the budget deficit matter up , what you are talking about is 1 hour on the rule , 1 hour on general debate , you say 2 hours , i will accept that , on general debate , 10 minutes in the motion to recommit , and that then is what 435 members and five delegates have that they can deal with in terms of time . 
the problems pointed out by my friend from oregon are significant , and the things that you have heard me say in the rules committee , the things that disturb me and distress me most are these things having to do with education . 
no one can tell me that they are not prepared to make the sacrifices for our children to have afterschool programs ; and yet , what we are going to find in that program are substantial cuts . 
there are no afterschool programs in the counties that i represent . 
in medicaid , it is no secret what is about to happen . 
what part of closed rule that i heard so often in 1992 does the majority not understand that that does not give the members of this body the opportunity to come forward with amendments that might make sense with reference to fiscal responsibility here in the house of representatives ? 
mr. speaker , that is worth avenue in palm beach , not west palm beach . 
i represent pahokee and belle glade , which are also in palm beach , and you are talking about no tax base . 
in private schools . 
this is a continuing resolution that simply includes a change of date extending our work through december 17 in order to give the president and others enough time to review these conference reports and other pieces of legislation being sent to the administration in rapid fire . 
the reason that has occurred , in my view , is because the budget resolution was so skewed in favor of the ideological right within the majority party caucus that in the end , even a number of republican moderates have not wanted to vote for some of these bills , most especially in the senate . 
this country is in the middle of fighting a war . 
that war has a huge cost , and yet the republican majority is in pursuit of its goal of providing huge tax cuts , a huge percentage of which will be put into the pockets of the most wealthy people in this country . 
their desire to do that has led them to a willingness to borrow whatever it takes in order to put the money in those pockets and then use the resulting deficit as a reason to cut back on a number of other bills . 
they use it as a reason to make significant cuts in education , in health , in science , environmental protection and the rest , and then pretend that the cost of katrina is what made them do it , when , in fact , the cost of tax cuts for persons in the top 1 percent of income in this country over the next decade will cost about 10 times as much as the cost of katrina . 
and i would point out that after we have gone through all of this effort , we , in the end , are probably still going to be stuck with an omnibus appropriations bill at the end , despite the fact that the majority party indicated they were going to move heaven and earth in order to avoid such an eventuality . 
the game plan apparently is to try to pass three appropriations bills yet this week , and then that will leave us in december with the defense appropriations bill , and evidently the intention at this point is to attach everything but the kitchen sink to that bill so that we will , in effect , have a recreated omnibus . 
it could be avoided if the majority had chosen to be a little less ideological , if they had chosen to pull the rubber band just a little less tightly , and if they had chosen to cross the aisle and work in a bipartisan fashion on taxes , on spending , and on other items that affect the shape and nature of the budget . 
as we approach the end of the week and the time that we will be taking in our districts to celebrate the thanksgiving holiday , this particular rule and the cr probably are among the least controversial things that the gentleman from florida and i will discuss today . 
the rule provides for 1 hour of debate in the house equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the committee on appropriations . 
i want to commend chairman lewis , ranking member obey , and the entire appropriations committee in the house for the determined effort this year to avoid an omnibus spending bill . 
this is something that unfortunately has become a routine part of our end-of-the-year appropriations process and chairman lewis under tremendous leadership with a great committee behind him has managed to avoid that this year , in fact , setting almost a record by completing all of the house 's work on the appropriations process before july 4. the committee has practiced due diligence and is working to pass each of these bills individually rather than having them attached as a train at the end of the year . 
this continuing resolution is necessary because our friends on the other side of the rotunda are a little bit further behind in their appropriations process and we are working through the conference report stage . 
this cr will allow the appropriators to continue that conferencing work to ensure that we have a clean appropriations process where bills are moving individually in the regular order . 
in fact , mr. speaker , it is a one sentence change , only shifting the date to december 17 for the continuing operations for the government . 
the cr is a clean continuation of h. j. res. 68 , which passed the house in september by a vote of 348-65 , and which funded programs and activities at the lowest of the house-passed level , the senate-passed level or the fiscal year 2005 current rate and included language prohibiting agencies from resuming or initiating programs for procurement not funded in fy 2005 and prohibited agencies from awarding new grants and other forms of assistance during the period of continuing resolution . 
throughout the appropriations process , the appropriators have demonstrated their commitment to fiscal responsibility by working within the framework we established in the budget resolution earlier this year . 
i urge members to support the rules and the underlying continuing resolution so we can finish the appropriations process in regular order and continue on our way toward responsibly funding the needs of america . 
i would just point out that we finished all of the house 's work , and i gave equal credit to both our chairman , the gentleman from california ( mr. lewis ) xz4002392 and the rest of his committee and the ranking member , the gentleman from wisconsin ( mr. obey ) xz4003000 , who finished all of our work by july 4 , all of our appropriations processes in regular order , in an individual manner instead of having to bundle them up into a train at the end of the legislative season . 
we will do the eighth in a couple of hours here on this floor today , which leaves three remaining waiting to be returned from their conference work with the senate . 
so it is often said at times in the house that your opposition is the other party , but your enemy is the other chamber . 
would the gentleman have the cr expire on thanksgiving day when no one will be in this chamber to act to fund the operations of the government so that national parks remain open and social security checks continue to go out ? 
just briefly , i respect the gentleman 's observation that the majority party in the senate is the party that i share , the republican party , but i learned a long time ago to stop trying to answer for that chamber over there . 
the gentleman knows as well as i do that they tend to bog down in the oratory and slow down on the action . 
mr. speaker , the gentleman clearly has come to the floor a little bit early , because all of these things are going to be eligible for debate here in another several hours when we move forward on our deficit reduction package , and the gentleman will have an opportunity to exercise through his vote that savings process , that deficit reduction process . 
but i am just curious , in all the gentleman 's rhetoric , what would you do differently about the continuing resolution that funds government through december 17 until we finish our regular appropriations process ? 
the gentleman is passionate about his concern for the fiscal well-being , but he is clearly misdirected in the sense that he will have an opportunity to vote on a number of these deficit reduction measures , a number of these savings , a number of these government reform mechanisms ; and he will have the opportunity to present all of the things that he talked about in his own recommittal motion , which is a right that has been granted to the minority party . 
so all of the things that he talked about , all of the things that he objects to , the sound agricultural policy that guarantees that we continue to have the safest , cheapest food supply in the world , if you want to cut those things , you can put it in your program . 
the point is that we are here today debating the rule on the continuing resolution of the government because we have three regular order appropriations bills yet to move , because i believe , to our credit and to this chamber 's credit , to the credit of the entire house , we are not moving a last minute omnibus choo-choo train that all of us have to go home and then discover something in that that we are not real terribly proud of . 
we know that it is going to be a long day as we approach the debate over the labor , health and human services appropriations bill , the ongoing debate over the continuing resolution to fund our government , and later today the deficit reduction package , which i dare say will not take food from any child in america 's mouth , despite the overheated rhetoric of the gentleman from oregon , respectfully the gentleman from florida and a number of others on that side of the aisle who it would appear from their media statements discuss in the salons and parlors of the beltway whether republicans hate children or old people more . 
i dare say that as we bring up this deficit reduction act , which finally for the first time since 1997 puts us back on a serious track to finding savings not just in the discretionary side of our spending but in the mandatory side which makes up over half of federal spending today and which slows the rate of growth in government , again , one of those washington , d.c.-style cuts , where budgets grow 7 percent instead of 7.3 percent or they grow 6 percent instead of 6.3 percent , and we find $ 50 billion worth of savings in a $ 2.5 trillion per year budget . 
so $ 50 billion in savings over 5 years in what would then be a $ 14 trillion pot . 
i think there are a number of counties that would gladly trade their tax base for his , and i would also say that i believe that somewhere in palm beach county there is an afterschool program of some shape or form . 
there must be an afterschool program somewhere in all of palm beach county , florida . 
i believe that as we move through this debate it is important for us to be responsible in our rhetoric and keep our eyes on the ball , which is the looming fiscal crisis that is out there if congress does not have the courage to get its arms around mandatory spending , which is consuming federal spending , making up over 50 percent of it today and two-thirds of federal spending . 
but i believe somewhere in your county you have an afterschool program .
