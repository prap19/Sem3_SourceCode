with respect to its misunderstanding of the best way to build a career , i think that these personal retraining accounts , although clearly well intentioned , have exactly the wrong effect on an unemployed person . 
later this month , i will honor my religious tradition and commemorate christ 's crucifixion on good friday and his resurrection on easter sunday . 
that is the religious liberty that our friends on the other side refer to correctly . 
by repealing long-standing civil rights protections that were signed into law by president reagan , this bill allows job-training providers to discriminate on the basis of religion . 
i urge my colleagues to join me in voting no on final passage . 
through local and state workforce investment boards , this legislation will strengthen job training programs to meet the needs of local businesses , many of which rely heavily on information technology , it . 
mr. speaker , by direction of the committee on rules , i call up house resolution 126 and ask for its immediate consideration . 
mr. speaker , house resolution 126 is a structured rule providing for 1 hour of general debate equally divided between the chairman and ranking minority member of the committee on education and the workforce . 
the rule makes in order only those amendments printed in the committee on rules report , and for the time specified in the report . 
by definition we can deal with people only as objects on a factory conveyor belt designed to meet the federal factory specifications . 
what we need is creativity , efficiency , and caring ; and that can only be done effectively on the state levels , which is why this particular bill has gone from several years ago , 63 programs , has now taken three funding streams and tried to bring it into one so they could help individual people by trying to apply 70 percent of the funding that has been given to students to those who have been unserved and out of school , to create a demonstration project for personal reemployment accounts to meet individual needs prior to coming to congress , i had the opportunity , like many of you , of serving in the state legislature , and i was a teacher for a long time . 
in that position , or those positions , i witnessed firsthand the years of oftentimes federal programs and mandates shoved on states , on local school districts , on local units of governments with this one-size-fits-all uniform approach . 
others beside sanctioned-government programs care and help and are effective , and we ought to forget the old pattern of confrontation and pointless attacks on groups that we see as different ; we should join for the common goal of helping people . 
the rule allows for three specific amendments to focus discussion on key elements of the proposal . 
i am looking forward to riveting debate on this bill , with the realization our goal is to help the micaelas of this world who have been hurt because there have been programs which are too high , too far away , and forgot our purpose of helping real people . 
in closing , my friends on the other side have had numerous objections to provisions in h.r. 27 . 
many amendments that we will be discussing on the floor have also been discussed in committee . 
our goal should be to try to join hands to help all the micaelas in the world solve the problem of employment , retraining , and servicing , not to try to change our friends in other particular ways but to join together on a common front , in a common effort , to help people , not to harm people . 
mr. speaker , i yield back the balance of my time , and i move the previous question on the resolution . 
mr. speaker , we are going to talk about economic competitiveness in the economy tonight , but before we start on that topic , i just want to draw attention to a couple of things that have appeared in the newspaper and talk about iraq and the middle east . 
i think we join with every one of them , all of our military families and with all of these iraqis who love freedom and are loving having the opportunity to grasp on to freedom , and we join them in saying no to terrorism and standing strong for freedom . 
one of my colleagues was talking about the headlines that we do not see on some of the national media , some of the leftist media , and i think this one is worthy of a mention . 
it was a scene the arab world 's autocratic regimes have dreaded , and through the power of satellite tv , it could catch on as fast as the latest music video . 
after fighting an expensive global war on terrorism , being in the middle of that fight , we have faced significant challenges and we have made some very wise decisions . 
we have known that small businesses and working families need tax relief , and we have fought hard to make that happen so that we see the opportunity right there for our economy , for the growth in our economy , for the opportunity for competitiveness not on just a local scale , not just on a local scale , but on a global scale . 
it says here : `` confidence in the economy at the u.s. biggest companies has soared to the highest level in 3 years as increasing numbers plan to spend more on capital investment. '' well , who would have thunk ? 
mr. speaker , i am joined here on the floor tonight by one of my colleagues , a gentleman from the freshman class i served in in the 108th congress , the gentleman from iowa ( mr. king ) xz4002201 . 
he is a small businessman , a farmer , and he does a lot of thinking when he gets out there on that tractor , and he brings a lot of wisdom to this chamber . 
we know that working on our tax reform issues , working on tort reform issues to eliminate frivolous lawsuits , are going to be a way that we can begin to benefit , that we can see the products that are manufactured here be more competitive in a global marketplace . 
mr. speaker , much of our focus this session is going to be on economic growth , economic competitiveness , doing the things that encourage , that create the right environment . 
our government does not create jobs , it is this free enterprise system that creates jobs , and doing things so we help create the right investment , focusing on tax reform and trade issues , on regulatory reform and on energy independence . 
these are the areas that are going to have a tremendous impact on our economy as it expands . 
the gentlewoman from north carolina ( ms. foxx ) xz4006430 has come to our congress this year and is serving on the committee on education and the workforce . 
the gentlewoman from north carolina ( ms. foxx ) xz4006430 has some thoughts she would like to share with us tonight on economic competitiveness . 
and they are going to be honored later this week for their excellent work that they are doing for jobs retraining , helping people focus on the importance of developing and having that career . 
and i would like to commend him for meeting with the students and working with the students from grace high school in tyler , texas , and for their study , their caring about the free enterprise system and seeking greater information on that . 
i want to see if i can grab on to that american dream of owning my own company , starting a company , having an idea , watching that idea come to fruition in the form of a company that creates jobs . 
that is why it is so important that we carry forth on this commitment to be certain that we have the right environment for an economic renaissance in this country . 
republicans have passed legislation to stem the tide of frivolous lawsuits , and we are continuing to do more on the tort reform issues . 
we are planning and continue to work daily on trade and opening foreign markets for american-made goods so that our employers in our local communities have access to markets around the globe , ways that they can place their products before a world that is ready to buy them . 
that is an obstacle that we need to get rid of , and we are committed to working on that . 
and , mr. speaker , one thing that we know for sure in this 109th congress , we are committed to moving forward on commonsense reforms that will continue to work toward greater effectiveness and greater competitiveness for our nation 's economy . 
mr. speaker , i congratulate the gentleman from utah ( mr. bishop ) xz4000291 as a new member of the committee on rules for his work today on his first rule that he is bringing to the floor of the house . 
there is one amendment that we will debate that we have had considerable debate on over the last several years in this congress and considered in the committee twice during the markup of this bill . 
it is on the faith-based language . 
this is a great debate which has gone on for several years . 
i think it will provide for a very meaningful debate today on this reauthorization . 
federal reserve chairman alan greenspan agreed with this view when he testified before the committee on education and the workforce last year . 
when we considered this bill in committee , we twice rejected it on a bipartisan basis , and i urge all members to vote against it today . 
the 1964 civil rights act made clear that when faith-based groups hire employees on a religious basis , it can exercise the group 's civil rights liberties and not discriminate under federal law . 
as my colleagues can see from the chart that i have next to me , former president bill clinton signed four laws allowing faith-based groups to staff on a religious basis when they receive those federal funds . 
unfortunately , the only plan that my colleagues on the other side have put forward to address the needs of american workers is the status quo . 
mr. chairman , i am pleased to yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from california ( mr. mckeon ) xz4002670 , the author of the bill , the chairman of the subcommittee on 21st century competitiveness . 
data on young adults participating in adult education programs is important information for our committee as well as for the adult education programs and for school districts to keep in mind as we work to raise our high school completion rates . 
mr. chairman , again i want to thank the gentleman for his work on this issue . 
i want to thank the chairman on the committee for adopting two amendments i have introduced to enhance further employability of the limited english proficient calculation by providing necessary skills , training and english language instruction . 
the bill on the floor today is an excellent source to achieve that goal . 
i pledge to work with her and other interested members of the new york delegation during conference on this legislation to identify and remedy any governance problems which new york may have under this bill . 
and while my friends on the other side of the aisle have some disagreement , i think all of us understand that by and large , this is a good program , that the bill before us is worth the support of my colleagues and i would ask them to do that . 
they may go to the committee on the judiciary and change that law , but let us not try to do it in this bill . 
we believe and the majority of this house has believed on a number of occasions as we have had this vote , that faith-based organizations who want to help the neediest of the needy should in fact be able to have their rights under the 1964 civil rights act . 
the fact is i think it is a cruel hoax on those who may be unemployed , who may fall into one of these categories to think that they are going to be eligible for unemployment-type assistance or be eligible for unlimited training when , in fact , there is no appropriation and the fact is the program will take years to implement . 
the bill before us today builds on the efficiency of the `` one-stop delivery '' model by streamlining unnecessary bureaucracy , eliminating duplication , strengthening resource allocation , and improving accountability . 
you are saying it is okay for a church associated with bob jones university , at least based on its past philosophy , it can take a $ 1 million job training grant and pay for a sign that says , no jews or catholics need apply here for a federally funded job . 
it is unbelievable that on the very day american soldiers are risking their lives in iraq , and perhaps some have given their lives today in iraq to give the iraqis religious freedom , we are debating a bill on the floor of this house that would say an american citizen can be denied a federally funded , tax-funded job for simply one reason , the exercise of your religious faith . 
if saying we are going to take away your ability to put food on the table for your children and a job that is paid for by taxpayers , to say that you can not have that job because you do not pass my private religious test , if that is not prohibiting the free exercise of religion , what is ? 
yet repeatedly i have heard on this floor those say on this side of the floor that supporters of the scott amendment are opposed to faith-based groups being involved in providing social services . 
i urge members on both sides of the aisle to put partisanship and politics aside . 
i will be addressing just one particular topic which has been controversial in committee discussions and will be the subject of an amendment later on , and that is turning the clock back on the civil rights act of 1964 and changing what it says . 
those who are opposed to this bill on that ground believe that somehow it is wrong to allow religious institutions to receive federal funds for programs that benefit the public at large , are not restricted to people of particular faith but are operated by organizations that are religiously based . 
i have yet to understand precisely what the objections are , but it seems that opponents are afraid of two things : one , that this provision in the bill somehow will allow these organizations to discriminate on other grounds in their hiring , which is , first , contrary to the civil rights act , and second , i would say religious organizations are the least likely to discriminate on the basis of race or any of the other forbidden categories . 
when my wife and i moved to grand rapids , michigan , in 1966 to take on a new position , we looked for a church . 
it was on the top story of a ramshackle building which housed a small convenience store in the lower floor . 
they purchased a school which was being abandoned , filled up that school , and they now have just successfully completed a $ 2.5 million capital drive to add on to their facilities and improve them . 
we did have and still largely do have religious restrictions on the hiring of individuals , but the facility serves all people in that community . 
the employees are hired partially on the basis of their faith and their commitment to serving in the inner city and often work for less pay than they could get elsewhere . 
it serves many people of different faiths and of no faith , but it is a faith-based institution because their treatment modalities are based , to a large extent , on our beliefs about the nature of people and their interaction with each other . 
we have purchased a truck to go around and collect this on fridays . 
we charge them roughly 10 cents on the dollar because we think it is a good thing for them to feel they have bought something ; but a family of four can buy a week 's worth of groceries for about $ 10 . 
you have to be multifaceted to be on the staff of a church , and that is precisely what we have in our church . 
courts have been on both sides . 
what is so terrible about saying to the orthodox jews in brooklyn who were cited , you want to help the people in brooklyn , the people you want to help will be black and hispanic , they will be white and poor and jewish and christian , if you really want to help them , on your own , whatever you want to do , you can do . 
so understand that when you empower the religious groups to discriminate based on religion , you will also de facto empower some segregation . 
it established a commonsense clause prohibiting job discrimination on the basis of religion . 
h.r. 27 would allow faith-based organizations to discriminate not just on the basis of a person 's religious affiliation , but also on how closely they follow the tenets of that religion . 
this would include religious beliefs on medical treatments ; procedures ; marriage ; pregnancy ; gender ; and , yes , even race . 
it is simply unamerican to set the clock back on the safeguards provided to protected classes , including religion , sex , race , ethnicity , and sexual orientation . 
h.r. 27 would remove these important protections , allowing faith-based organizations to discriminate on the basis of religion , even regarding the secular social services they provide . 
mr. chairman , i urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the scott amendment and voting `` no '' on the final passage of this bill that endorses a federal rollback of decades-old civil rights and privacy protections . 
i oppose this legislation and urge a `` no '' vote on the underlying legislation . 
mr. speaker , on that i demand the yeas and nays . 
mr. chairman , i rise to engage the gentleman from ohio ( chairman boehner ) of the committee on education and the workforce in a colloquy . 
during our full committee consideration of h.r. 27 , i offered and withdrew an amendment to ensure that data on high school-aged students participating in adult education programs is publicly available and reported to our committee . 
our first step in shining the light on this issue is to make sure that we have accurate and regularly reported data . 
it is simply a matter of clearly communicating to the department that we would like to see focused information on high school-aged students in adult education reported by race , ethnicity , language proficiency , and program enrollment . 
the gentleman from ohio , the chairman of the committee on which i serve , is correct . 
however , the committee on rules did not see fit to accept the amendment . 
through the one-stop delivery system , job seekers have access to labor market information , job counseling , and job training to help them get back on their feet . 
he said : when senator paul wellstone walked off the floor arm in arm with senator mike dewine of ohio , bipartisan i should point out , paul wellstone said , `` mike , this may not be the lead story on the network news , but it 's a good piece of work. '' well , indeed it was not the lead story on the network news . 
it would fund one-stop infrastructure by siphoning off funds used to serve veterans and individuals with disabilities ; and importantly , the legislation before us here would allow discrimination in hiring based on individuals 's religious beliefs . 
mr. speaker , i rise in opposition to the structured rule that has been reported out of the committee on rules for this debate . 
the party-line vote of 220-204 that we saw in the 108th congress on the debate of the then h.r. 1261 should evidence the need for the most open debate over the issues . 
as representatives of the united states congress , we all have a duty to fully debate the issues on behalf of our constituents . 
we must address the needs of our unemployed now and in a manner that respects the rights of individuals regardless of their faith , while they are struggling to pay their mortgages and to put food on the table for their families . 
mr. chairman , i rise in support of the amendment offered by my colleague the ranking member of the judiciary subcommittee on crime , mr. scott xz4003641 along with ms. woolsey , mr. van hollen , mr. frank , mr. edwards , and mr. nadler , to the base bill , h.r. 27 . 
as i stated with respect to the rule , h. res. 126 , the party-line vote of 220-204 that we saw in the 108th congress on the debate of the then h.r. 1261 should evidence the need for the most open debate over the deficiencies that lie within the provisions on the floor . 
as representatives of the united states congress , we all have a duty to fully debate the issues on behalf of our constituents . 
each of my colleagues should understand that without this important amendment , we are advocating the notion that one 's ability to provide employment to those who are in need is contingent on the religious institution to which the individual belongs . 
the founding fathers of this country found it necessary to say that no one should be unfairly judged or discriminated against on the basis of their religion . 
surely , this country prides itself on its diversity and its willingness to open its doors to people of different religions , races , and ethnic backgrounds . 
yet on the floor of the people 's house we are faced with an attempt by the republicans to create a monolithic sub-culture within our employment training programs . 
despite the rhetoric on the other side of the aisle , h.r. 27 as it currently reads will not only result in the loss of jobs for applicants who do not identify with their prospective employer 's religious beliefs but more importantly it will cause the loss of quality workers . 
particularly when we talk about these programs , what comes to mind , and i heard the gentleman from michigan ( mr. kildee ) xz4002160 be so eloquent in the committee on rules about the effectiveness and the importance of a training program , number one , for the new jobs of the 21st century . 
i am reminded of the fact that i spent a good part of my time as a locally elected official on the houston city council promoting the job training programs of our community that came down through the workforce board commissions in texas . 
you go into these youth training programs and you look at the smiles on the faces of individuals who have come from experiences where there was no work , where their families are unemployed , and where there is no hope and opportunity . 
frankly , i believe this bill , even in its presence on the floor of the house , should go no further than this house ; and i ask my colleagues to support the tierney amendment , but to oppose the underlying bill . 
this bill is nearly identical to the wia bill that passed this house last congress on a near party-line vote . 
instead , this legislation focuses on moving around and changing the bureaucratic elements of wia without focusing on getting more resources to the consumers of these programs . 
they no longer will have a voice on the local boards . 
these lost resources will translate into disruptions and lost opportunities to people who presently rely on these services . 
third , the bill allows discrimination in hiring based on religion with wia funds . 
the bill turns back the clock on decades of civil rights protections in our job training programs . 
research on similar schemes have proven that pras are not an effective means of providing job training . 
in summary , i urge a no vote on this bill . 
nothing in the act prevents states from spending all of youth funds on out-of-school youths . 
in fact , as many as 17 states spend more than 30 percent on out-of-school programs . 
reservists who have spent a year or more overseas have put their careers on hold to serve our country . 
and that is that as we see people demonstrating in the streets of lebanon , when they have made the pledge that they are not leaving the public arena until they are a government governed by themselves and that they are a free people , that magnificent display that is going on in lebanon today , as i watched that , i looked back through my mind 's eye and i asked myself where i have experienced anything like that before ; where i have seen anything like that in history . 
yet our president stood just outside this capitol building on january 20 and gave his second inaugural address , and even the liberal news media understood there was a bush doctrine , and that was the doctrine of freedom . 
we stand with all people on this planet that yearn for freedom . 
when that day comes , we will no longer see the habitat that breeds terror , and we will be able to actually stand here today and define a victory in the war on terror , and that is the absence of the habitat that breeds terrorists . 
i characterize it a couple of ways and add to the gentlewoman 's discussion , and that is that our jobs growth in this country has been going on at such a torrid pace that we will soon , within the next 3 months , reach the level of over the last 2 years having had job growth of 1.5 million jobs a year . 
seven out of ten people you meet on the street live in a home they own or are making payments on . 
earlier we heard on the floor some remarks that we have a lot of problems with the trade imbalance , and i will not deny we have a trade imbalance . 
but we can not go on forever letting foreign interests own u.s. assets and holding them for collateral . 
what is in our control in this congress are our tax policy , regulatory policy , and that is what we need to focus on . 
today , today every day when people go to work and punch the time clock or make the sales calls or throw that bale of hay , uncle sam stands there with his hand out with the first lien on everyone 's labor , on the productivity of america , on your investment interest and on your labor . 
the irs right now is a trillion dollar drag on an $ 11 trillion economy when we add the cost of funding them , enforcing them , and the disincentives that are in place that people decide i am not going to make that sales call , i am not going to do that extra overtime , i am not going to make that investment in that farm or industrial factory because the tax burden is too high . 
take-home pay goes up 56 percent under a national sales tax , and items on the shelf , their price goes down by an average of 22 percent because there is an imputed cost in everything that is sold . 
so , for example , if there is a japanese-made mazda that is imported from japan sitting on the dealer 's lot at $ 30 , 000 , and pick your american brand sitting on the other side of the street with a $ 30 , 000 sticker price , we remove the federal tax that is imputed into the american made because it is imputed in the japanese made overseas . 
we have approximately a $ 9 , 000 advantage on those two vehicles of equivalent value that were selling competitively at $ 30 , 000 each . 
we are on the right track , but we can do more . 
mr. chairman , i rise to join the chairman of the committee on education and the workforce , the gentleman from ohio ( mr. boehner ) xz4000360 , in a colloquy on how certain provisions in this legislation might affect the governance of wia funding in new york state . 
mr. chairman , i want to thank the chairman for agreeing to work with us on this issue of importance to new york . 
american business needs the best , most qualified workers on earth , but this bill does nothing to reach that goal . 
one can not plan for their children 's college education with income swings like that , and they are lucky to put food on the table . 
this bill , even without the bad provisions such as personal reemployment accounts and the provisions that allow workplace discrimination based on religion , does nothing to meet the new challenges that workers and businesses that rely on them face in the new global economy . 
the poor have more things today -- including wild income swings `` the poor are not like everyone else , '' social critic michael harrington wrote in the 1962 bestseller `` the other america , '' which helped shape president johnson 's war on poverty . 
the family struggles to meet its monthly bills but has taken on a mountain of credit card debt . 
they have used plastic to buy a large-screen tv and other luxuries but have also relied on it to cover bare necessities such as rent and emergency-room visits . 
`` we 've won the war on poverty , '' asserted robert rector , an influential analyst with the heritage foundation , a conservative washington think tank . 
protections that americans , especially poor ones , once relied on to buffer them from economic setbacks -- affordable housing , stable jobs with good benefits , union membership and the backstop of cash welfare -- have shriveled or been eliminated . 
for the most part , the poor have been left to cope on their own , scrambling from one fragile employment arrangement to the next , doubling up on housing and borrowing heavily . 
the times ' figures are based on the panel study of income dynamics , a database funded by the national science foundation and run by the university of michigan . 
`` the only way to improve your life if you 're poor is to be very prudent and make very , very few mistakes like getting fired or splurging and ending up with a lot of debt , '' said christopher jencks , a harvard university authority on poverty . 
but with the average rent on a one-bedroom apartment in the city then running about $ 600 , they could not afford a first foothold in their new country -- a place of their own to live . 
`` i wanted to go home. '' with nowhere else to turn , they moved in with one of maldanado 's aunts , her five children and four cousins in a two-bedroom house on firmona avenue in hawthorne . 
they slept on the kitchen floor . 
`` i did n't want to be a burden on the government , '' she explained . 
in all , the amount of money that congress and the president have authorized to be spent on housing assistance has plunged by nearly two-thirds in the last 25 years , from an inflation-adjusted $ 82 billion in 1978 to $ 29 billion last year . 
she was making more than $ 12 , 000 dashing between a part-time job at an airline linen service on prairie avenue in hawthorne and a temporary position with kelly services , packing magazines , perfume and shampoo in samplers for direct-market mailings . 
in the fall of that year , the couple , with another of maldanado 's aunts and her children , moved into a white stucco bungalow on burin avenue in inglewood , not far from los angeles international airport . 
albert 's uncle , walter dicks , ran the municipal workers union and helped the younger grimes find a job right out of high school on a city sanitation truck . 
for most of the postwar era , working americans could count on big business even more than big government to provide safeguards against economic risk . 
on top of that , his health care was covered . 
grimes , then on leave with a bad back , soon found himself out of a job . 
the combination of recession and steep cuts in defense spending , brought on by the end of the cold war , walloped southern california . 
unremitting pressure from low-cost foreign producers and wage competition from new immigrants such as rojas took a severe toll on unskilled workers like grimes . 
as grimes ' world caved in on him once more , rojas ' prospects were looking up . 
she was still shuttling between her jobs at the airline laundry service and as a packer of sundries when one of maldanado 's cousins told her that the dishwashing department at the wyndham hotel on century boulevard near lax was hiring for the 4-to-midnight shift . 
about a year after it had closed , the hotel on century boulevard reopened . 
she signed on anyway and , to make ends meet , kept her job at burger king as well . 
these numbers , though , are about all the experts can agree on . 
she has thus continued to collect benefits off and on from the state 's cash welfare program , calworks . 
this part of the law built on other efforts undertaken since the 1970s to go after absentee parents and compel them to help finance their kids ' upbringings . 
whether a mix-up or not , the effect on grimes ' finances has been devastating . 
`` in imposing these huge judgments on fathers , we 're confronting these men with an awful choice : go underground , which is just what child-support enforcement was intended to stop , or let themselves be financially ruined. '' in august 1997 , grimes was ordered to start sending the county $ 173 a month in current payments , plus an additional amount for past-due support totaling $ 4 , 900 . 
their average balance on those cards has climbed , in inflation-adjusted terms , from about $ 825 to more than $ 2 , 000 . 
economists dirk krueger of the university of pennsylvania and fabrizio perri , a new york university professor now on sabbatical at the federal reserve bank of minneapolis , say families of all incomes increasingly rely on loans , rather than on business and government safety nets , in times of trouble . 
some of the items purchased on rojas ' and maldanado 's credit cards can seem frivolous or extravagant -- the tvs , for example , or a $ 150 set of sepia-toned studio photographs of katherine and her mom dressed in feather boas and gowns . 
chipping away at what 's due on their cards is virtually impossible . 
although the stated interest on the couple 's most heavily used cards , a pair of direct merchants bank mastercards , ranges from 20.49 % to 31.99 % , a review of recent bills indicates that they are consistently charged close to the higher amount . 
it is not clear that this happened to rojas and maldanado. ) rojas and maldanado now owe $ 14 , 592 on their four credit cards -- a burden that financial experts say is appropriate for a household making about $ 100 , 000 , but not one like theirs . 
in february , after a dispute with their landlord , he and his family were evicted from their apartment on fedora street , where they had lived for several years . 
before long , he fell behind again on his court-ordered child-support payments . 
for the time being , he is working for the service employees international union on a campaign to organize security guards in the city 's high-rise offices . 
based on the panel-study sample , the times estimated the annual income swings , up or down , for 68 % of all u.s. families -- those who did not have the most extreme fluctuations . 
as a result , the newspaper 's conclusions do n't rest on cases outside the mainstream : the movie star whose career dries up overnight , say , or the hourly worker who wins the lottery . 
to zero in on working families , the times focused on men and women 25 to 64 years old whose households had some income . 
it then concentrated on those in the bottom one-fifth of income earners and especially those right at the 20th percentile . 
the committee on rules has reported eight rules , including the one we are considering today . 
the republican majority is zero for eight on open rules . 
in other words , this bill would allow a religious organization that discriminates based on religion , like a bob jones university , to get taxpayer money and use that federal funding to legally discriminate on religious grounds when hiring staff to carry out the job training programs and services in this bill . 
last night in the committee on rules , i heard my colleagues , the gentleman from virginia ( mr. scott ) xz4003641 and the gentleman from florida ( mr. hastings ) xz4001701 talk about a return to discrimination practices that forced these men and millions of other african americans to drink from separate drinking fountains and eat at separate lunch counters from white americans . 
mr. speaker , many democrats offered several high-quality amendments in the committee on rules yesterday . 
just because the republican leadership allowed the scott amendment to be considered on the floor today does not make this a good rule . 
it is truly a tragedy when a nation that prides itself on democracy and equality considers and will most likely pass a bill that would permit employment discrimination in federally-funded programs . 
it is a slippery slope from here on out , and i fear this may just be the beginning . 
i would just reiterate that what we believe is that taxpayer money should not be used by faith-based organizations to discriminate against people based on religion . 
what we feel is that this provision in this bill is offensive and it turns the clock backwards on civil rights . 
mr. speaker , i include for printing in the record a letter opposing this bill signed by 67 religious organizations and civil rights organizations that have great concerns not only with the provision on religious-based employment discrimination but on a whole series of other provisions . 
national law center on homelessness & amp ; poverty . 
one-stop partner programs will no longer be required to have a seat on the local boards . 
one of them went on to become a school teacher , one a worker in the computer industry . 
members on the other sides of the aisle say that this would roll back the ability of churches and synagogues to discriminate on the basis of religion now . 
and the $ 3 , 000 reemployment accounts to purchase needed services to ensure reemployment seem to me to be a good idea because ofttimes when a person is trying to get back on their feet , they need to have money to pay for child care . 
i would like to amplify on that just a little bit . 
in fact , the civil rights act made clear that when faith-based organizations hire employees on a religious basis , it is an exercise of the organization 's civil liberties and does not constitute discrimination under federal law . 
the success of any organization is having everyone on board with its essential principles and vision . 
we look forward to working with you , chairman boehner , and chairman mckeon on this innovative plan to help workers in transition . 
thank you again for your leadership on this initiative . 
hard-working families in my district who have been laid off rely on programs like the one-stop workforce development system , which helps states and communities ensure workers to get the training they need to find good jobs . 
based on current labor market information and the high demand for this occupation , she will easily make $ 25 to $ 30 per hour . 
current law prohibits sponsors of job training programs from discriminating based on race or religion , and that policy goes back decades . 
moreover , mr. speaker , when the government refuses to prohibit discrimination based on religion , it can not effectively enforce laws against discrimination based on race or national origin . 
so if they restrict hiring based on their religious organization , they can effectively discriminate based on race . 
mr. speaker , for 40 years , if an employer had a problem hiring the best qualified applicant because of discrimination based on race or religion , that employer had a problem because the weight of the federal government was behind the victim of discrimination . 
the dear colleague went on to say that congress needs to `` continue to uphold the basic civil right of america 's religious organizations to hire the staff they judge to be best qualified to carry out their programs and missions when they provide job training assistance. '' mr. speaker , the language fails to say that they can hire whoever they want to promote their religious missions with the church money . 
as a representative said during the debate on the civil rights act of 1964 , he said , `` stop the discrimination , get the money ; continue the discrimination , do not get the money. '' employment discrimination is ugly . 
we can put lipstick on a pick , but we can not pass it off as a beauty queen , and we can not dress up `` we do not hire catholics and jews '' with poll-tested semantics and euphemisms and pass it off as anything other than ugly discrimination . 
mr. chairman , i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from california ( mr. george miller ) xz4002780 , the ranking member of the committee on education and the workforce . 
we also heard , mr. chairman , about the hiring for planned parenthood , i believe , and what your position is on abortion or gun control or something . 
there is a difference between telling somebody they can not get a job because i do not like your position on gun control and we do not hire blacks or jews . 
race and religion are protected classes ; positions on gun control and abortion are not , and there is a difference . 
mr. chairman , i want to further elaborate on the last point in this amendment 's attack on religious liberty in the united states , that in fact the interpretation in the presiding bishop v. amos , the supreme court unanimously upheld the language permitting religious organizations to staff on a religious basis in matters concerning employment when they receive federal funds , in a unanimous decision . 
and as the member from maryland has pointed out , he did not enthusiastically say this was going to be upheld ; but the fact is over the objections of many on his side , he supported it . 
the fundamental question here is , and through my subcommittee on criminal justice and human services we held eight hearings across the united states and we had a great debate in every region of the country , but many organizations came forth , whether they were muslim , jewish or christian in some form , and said , we can not compromise the nature of our faith if you are going to make us change our hiring practices . 
mr. chairman , i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from georgia ( mr. price ) xz4006261 , a member of the committee on education and the workforce . 
how else can you explain being so cruel and unfair as to pull the rug out on our nation 's unemployed ? 
this puts a greater financial burden directly on the states , exacerbating their budget deficits and perversely triggering layoffs among the very state employees who administer these programs . 
current law prohibits employers participating in federal job training programs from discriminating based on race , color , religion , sex , national origin , age disability , or political affiliation or belief . 
the republican bill would allow the taxpayer dollars that pay for these job-training programs to go to religious organizations that blatantly discriminate in hiring based on religious beliefs . 
will the next bush initiative include allowing discrimination based on race , sexual orientation or political affiliation ? 
but suddenly , under the leadership of the white house , we are being asked to forget the principle of equal opportunity on which our country was founded . 
i urge my colleagues to vote `` no '' on h.r. 27 . 
you can go right on down the line . 
this is an example of the collegiality of our committee on education and the workforce . 
and guess what , today they are doing it under current law which says when they receive those federal tax dollars , they may not discriminate in who they hire based on religion , and not one of those organizations has come to me and said we could do a better job in providing job training services if only you would let us discriminate based on religion . 
the civil rights act of 1964 does not say in any way that religious organizations can take taxpayer dollars and then discriminate in their hiring based on religion when they are providing services based on those dollars . 
that i urge my colleagues to stick with the current law , because what the underlying bill does is eliminate current law and give a green light that allows people to discriminate based on religion , a terrible message to send . 
in the latest attack on october 1 , the president doubled the fees that small businesses must pay to receive a 7 ( a ) loan . 
it affirms that new fees on 7 ( a ) loans are hurting small businesses and demonstrates congressional support for using federal funding to cover the cost of these fees . 
a vote for this amendment is a vote against the bush administration 's policy raising the fees on 7 ( a ) loans . 
i have serious reservations about personal reemployment accounts , as they will place severe limits on the amount of training an unemployed worker can receive . 
on october 1 , the bush administration effectively implemented a tax on u.s. entrepreneurship . 
by doubling the fees on 7-a loans , the bush administration has severely limited access to critical source of capital for our nation 's small businesses . 
i want to be on record , and i want every member in this house to be on record about the fact that last july , an amendment to the cjs appropriations that would have protected the 7-a program was approved with strong support . 
the house was on record then , and we should continue to be on record for the small business community . 
our goal is to fully repeal the freeze on the 7-a loans . 
mr. chairman , once again my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are claiming they want to help workers in this nation . 
money and services are both critical for many workers to get back on track , particularly when they have become unemployed over and over again , and workers who should not have to make the choice between one or the other are continually faced with the dilemma . 
now workers will be judged on how they serve the company they work for rather than on the quality of services they received under wia . 
since when was wia focused on big business ' needs rather than the worker 's needs ? 
yesterday president bush called on congress , and let me quote , `` to judge faith-based groups by results , not by their religion. '' well , current law does judge faith-based organizations by results , not by their religion . 
a wide range of faith-based organizations support this amendment because they recognize that it is not an attack on american religious freedoms , but a defense of those freedoms . 
what we owe them is the opportunity to make good on the american dream that they have fought to defend . 
now , the demagoguery that you hear from the other side on this issue , and , frankly , on every issue , seemingly every issue , frankly is a disservice to this debate and does a disservice to our nation . 
there is no discrimination on the provision of services . 
mr. chairman , i appreciate the opportunity to speak again on this , and i am astounded , frankly , at the level of misinformation that is coming from the other side . 
some of those programs are title i grants to improve education for the disadvantaged , neglected and delinquent grants to local educational agencies , 21st century learning centers , safe and drug-free schools and community state grants , bilingual education instructional services , dropout prevention grants , and on and on and on , striving readers grant and vocational technical education . 
mr. chairman , i appreciate the opportunity once again to speak on this , and i urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment . 
there has been some discussion about previous language that many members on the other side of the aisle have adopted in previous bills , four pieces of legislation under the clinton administration . 
i urge my colleagues to oppose this and to be certain , to be certain , there is no intent or desire on anybody on this side of the aisle to encourage discrimination by faith-based institutions . 
by the second generation , both had become professionals and had made a great impact on their local economies , passed that on to the third generation with their children , adding value , working to create jobs in the long term . 
i think the exciting thing of the values of this nation is the people who have come here from every ethnic background , from every nation on this earth . 
it has to do with jobs in our communities , local farmers , small family farmers , people that own family businesses that have gone on for generations , to make sure that they have the opportunity to keep those jobs in the community . 
the reason for this , working with public-private partnerships , working closely with our local communities from the federal government is to assure that we are staying on the cutting edge of technology innovation , looking for opportunity for the long term . 
it seems to me in our country right now we have an all-out assault on faith-based groups . 
all we are saying is let us build on a bipartisan precedent , a precedent set in the civil rights act , a precedent reaffirmed under president clinton under four different bills . 
let us build on that bipartisan precedent of opening the doors and allowing faith-based groups to participate as equal partners . 
today this bill that we are going to approve later on the floor today simply takes another step forward . 
we have the healthiest economy in the world , and i want to build on the things that my colleagues have said . 
i want to talk a little bit about the job training improvement act which is going to be voted on here tomorrow . 
the committee on education and the workforce has passed it out of our committee after a great deal of debate . 
it builds on the significant reforms made in the bipartisan workforce investment act improvements that were enacted in 1998 . 
the landmark 1964 civil rights act makes clear that faith-based groups have the right to hire workers on a religious basis , and that such hiring practices do not constitute discrimination . 
i am frankly appalled at the scale of the rhetoric being presented by the minority party on this issue . 
a secular group , such as planned parenthood or the sierra club , that receives government money , is currently free to hire based on their ideology and mission but still use federal funds in accordance with the terms of the program . 
for us to forget that and to place restrictions of this sort on our churches is contrary to the very foundation of this great nation . 
we were having hearings a couple of weeks ago and finding that one of the drains on the medical economy is the fact that 70 percent of all the massive number of physicians who are sued are dropped without any finding of fault and without paying anything in settlement . 
well , that is an area we are working on to help reform , to help eliminate ; 70 percent of the physicians that are sued having to be sued and providing a carrot and a stick to correct that form where abuse has occurred . 
and i am excited about the potential this government has and to be a part of this congress with you because i think we have more potential to get this country on the right road than any congress since the 1930 new deal congress . 
of particular importance to me and my colleagues who support this plan is provision i proposed that is reflected in the bill we 're voting on today . 
he said , his father just died and they have to pay the estate tax on the farm . 
and yet i am hearing the democrats saying over here that they are all upset because we have already taxed a dollar the first time the guy earns it ; then we are going to tax him again on sales tax and other things he buys , and now it is not fair to tax a dollar the third time it comes around . 
vote `` no '' on s. 256 . 
mr. speaker , i strongly support h.r. 8 , the death tax repeal permanency act of 2005 , and i urge my colleagues to vote `` no '' on the pomeroy substitute amendment . 
there are many reasons to support this bankruptcy reform bill , but i want to focus on one that is important to many of my colleagues , to me , and to the american people . 
there are many reasons to support this bankruptcy reform bill , but i want to focus on one that is important to many of my colleagues , to me and to the american people . 
the counseling must include a budget analysis and disclosures regarding the possible impact of bankruptcy on a debtor 's credit report . 
next : the bill will provide for pre-discharge financial education , requiring debtors to complete an approved instructional course on personal financial management prior to receiving a discharge under chapter 7 or 13 . 
finally , the bill requires the director of the executive office for u.s. trustees to : ( 1 ) develop a financial management training curriculum and materials to educate individual debtors on how to better manage their finances ; and ( 2 ) evaluate and report to the congress on the curriculum 's efficacy . 
the death tax represents all that is unfair and unjust about the tax structure in america because it undermines the life work and the life savings of americans who want only to pass on to their children and grandchildren the fruits of their labor and the realization of their american dream . 
employees of family businesses , many of whom are minorities , are at risk of losing their jobs because their employers are forced to pay the unfair and exorbitant death taxes levied on them . 
mr. speaker , although reasonable minds may differ on this issue , i believe that the death tax is politically misguided , morally unjustifiable , and downright un-american . 
then they turn around , they buy an asset , and they spend their money , and they are paying a tax on every bit of that . 
mr. speaker , i appreciate my namesake 's courtesy in permitting me to speak on his substitute . 
and if the republican majority would have permitted a fair and honest debate on this floor of the inheritance tax , we would have enacted significant permanent adjustments that would have solved the vast majority of the problems for 99.9 percent , i dare say . 
my friend from missouri says , well , on the one hand , it is only 1.5 percent of federal revenues ; but that is half of the problem of social security that has driven some people into a frenzy . 
mr. speaker , for as long as i 've been in congress i have supported bankruptcy reform on two simple principles ; i believe people should pay their debts , if they are able , and that we should end abuses in the system , whether by people who deliberately run up their bills or by businesses who exploit the gullible and the unfortunate . 
the senate , however , was unwilling to compromise and approve any of these provisions and the house leadership has prevented any of these proposals from even being debated on the floor . 
this legislation is going to put an unnecessary burden on the vast majority of unfortunate people and still allow too many of the unscrupulous to avoid their responsibilities . 
mr. speaker , i thank my good friend , the gentleman from missouri ( mr. hulshof ) xz4001900 , for yielding to me and for the great work he has done on this issue from the day we came to congress 8 years ago . 
the house and senate are already both on record for repealing the tax . 
in fact , we have all heard about the impact on small businesses and family farms , but it bears repeating as we consider this legislation today . 
it is hard to tell who made the money and who did not , but on the day that the original member of the family passes away , suddenly the side-by-side partner has a big problem . 
on friday of this week , i am going to visit with mark and kim larson who own a family farm right outside of joplin in my district . 
i commend mr. hulshof for his leadership on this issue and praise his vision to continue lowering the federal tax burden . 
an increased demand for these goods and services will require more employees ; therefore , providing incentives for businesses to hire more workers -- putting unemployed americans back on the job and providing a framework for long-term economic growth . 
for example , we voted to extend relief from the marriage penalty tax , a burdensome tax on married couples for doing nothing more than saying `` i do. '' we also voted to extend the alternative minimum tax reforms ( amt ) , which is the right step toward making sure the amt applies only to those people it was designed to cover , not working families just trying to make ends meet . 
i urge my colleagues to join me in supporting h.r. 8 , and put an end to this unfair , unjust , and inefficient burden on our economy . 
the reform also helps consumers by requiring clearer disclosures of the cost of credit on credit card statements , and the reform will be a major benefit to single parents who receive alimony or child support . 
mr. speaker , i rise today to comment on the republicans ' priorities . 
the cost on the first 2 years could go as high as $ 1 trillion . 
this bill gives a tax break to the wealthiest three-tenths of 1 percent of estates , while imposing a new capital gains tax on most of us , including small business owners and farmers . 
clearly , the republicans are attempting to balance the budget on the backs of the veterans . 
tomorrow , this same house will vote on bankruptcy legislation that does not protect our veterans . 
many of our servicemembers , especially the citizen soldiers of the guard and the reserve forces , face terrible financial problems because they do not qualify for a narrow protection of debt incurred while on duty if s. 256 becomes law . 
it is clear that they are slipping through the cracks , and we need to focus our attention on how to assist veterans returning from the war , whether it is economic , whether it is health care , or whether it is to make sure that they have their jobs and have a seamless transition . 
we need to make sure that our money follows all of this rhetoric we have on the floor constantly about how we support the veterans . 
as chairman of the subcommittee on commercial and administrative law , i take considerable satisfaction that , through collective effort , we would be able to achieve what many said would never happen . 
i was heartened by the assurance of the chairman of the committee on the judiciary during the markup of senate 256 that this matter will be considered later this year . 
in that regard , i would like to thank the gentleman from georgia ( mr. kingston ) xz4002210 who has worked tirelessly on the issue of expanding the number of bankruptcy judges we have to meet this need . 
mr. speaker , at this point i will place additional information on the bill in the record . 
all too often , companies that fail to reorganize successfully are converted to chapter 7 for liquidation , where creditors receive pennies on the dollar and employees face job dislocation . 
creditors receive pennies on the dollar and employees see their jobs and retirement savings destroyed . 
unfortunately , s. 256 as reported by the senate judiciary committee includes an amendment authored by senator edward m. kennedy xz4002142 ( the kennedy amendment ) that places significant limits on retention bonuses and severance payments to employees of companies in chapter 11 . 
it would prohibit a bankruptcy judge from approving retention bonuses in every chapter 11 case unless he or she finds that the company in question has proven that the employee has a bona fide job offer at the same or greater rate of compensation ; was prepared to accept the job offer ; and the services of that employee are `` essential to the survival of the business. '' the amendment also places significant caps on the amount of such bonus and payments . 
still , if the congress wishes to improve the operation of current law while still safeguarding the ability of the courts to approve legitimate kerps , we would welcome a discussion on how best to achieve that end . 
mr. chairman , we thank you for considering our views on this important matter . 
we would be pleased to address any questions you or other members of the committee on the judiciary may have . 
mr. speaker , our republican majority stands firmly against double taxation on working families . 
taxes have already been paid on the assets subject to additional taxation under the death tax . 
bankruptcy abuse represents a `` hidden tax '' on the american people . 
i was proud to be in this chamber 4 years ago on the day congress began phasing out the death tax . 
if we do not act now to permanently eliminate the death tax , it will be revived at the stroke of midnight on january 1 , 2011 . 
the death tax repeal permanency act represents the changes to our tax code called for by our nation 's farmers and small business owners who want to pass their family business on to the next generation . 
small business owners and farmers devote their time , energy and money into building a business so it can be passed on to their sons or daughters . 
in the absence of the death tax , these small businesses become a legacy for one generation to pass on to the next . 
with the death tax , families face a whopping tax bill on the property and assets even though taxes have already been paid annually by the owners . 
the wall street journal wrote in 1999 that 60 percent of small businesses would add jobs if death taxes were not on the books . 
the very threat of a revived death tax has a negative impact on small business . 
so if members are fiscal conservatives and are concerned about the cost of this bill on our children and seniors and if members want predictability in the estate tax , this legislation does not give it to us . 
those debtors who charge thousands of dollars on luxury items prior to declaring bankruptcy , should be held accountable . 
i voted against the rule because it provides the house no opportunity to vote on amendments that would allow a court to consider extreme circumstances that might have led to bankruptcy filings . 
that translates into greater burdens on our federal and state budgets , and higher costs for us all . 
in the last few years , the ways and means committee has held fifteen hearings on a bill to reduce social security number theft , and last year , we reported out a responsible bipartisan bill , but it was not brought to the floor . 
unfortunately , our vote on the previous question -- to allow bankruptcy judges to take into consideration the fact that persons are forced into bankruptcy because of identity theft -- was defeated . 
these costs will be shifted to american families who are paying the price for this debt , some studies reflect $ 400 per year in every household , by higher interest rates on their credit cards , auto loans , school loans and mortgages . 
as chairman of the subcommittee on education reform , which has jurisdiction over k through 12 , i feel strongly that educating future spenders can prevent debts incurred as adults . 
again , mr. speaker , i want to thank chairman sensenbrenner for his years of strong and tenacious support for this legislation and thank him for not giving up on these important , common-sense changes to our bankruptcy system . 
thank you for this opportunity to submit testimony for the record on this legislation . 
the washington post ran a story recently about a woman whose identity was stolen , yet her credit card company forced the fraudster 's debt on her by using the arbitration clause in her card agreement . 
american families are paying the price for this debt -- some studies reflect $ 400 per year in every household -- by higher interest rates on their credit cards , auto loans , school loans and mortgages . 
the delaware district tends to have the largest chapter 11 business cases , often referred to as the `` mega '' chapter 11 cases which are `` those involving extremely large assets , unusual public interest , a high level of creditor involvement , complex debt , a significant amount of related litigation , or a combination of such factors. '' these are again , mr. speaker , i want to thank chairman sensenbrenner for his years of strong and tenacious support for this legislation and thank him for not giving up on these important , common-sense changes to our bankruptcy system . 
i want to thank the chairman of the committee on the judiciary , the gentleman from wisconsin ( mr. sensenbrenner ) xz4003650 , for his leadership and his efforts in making this bill a reality . 
it is basically a $ 500 per family annual tax on each and every american family . 
it requires those who have the means to repay debts to do so while protecting those who truly need the assistance provided by chapter 7 , such as those with serious medical conditions , the men and women of our armed services who are on active duty , as well as those disabled veterans who served in years past . 
mr. speaker , all i want to say as we open this debate is that to those who assert that this bill cracks down on creditor abuse , i would ask them to realize that this bill does absolutely nothing to discourage abusive , underage lending ; nothing to discourage reckless lending to the developmentally disabled ; nothing to regulate the practice of sub-prime lending to persons with no means or little ability to repay their debts ; nothing to crack down on the sharks , the lenders , that charge members of the armed forces up to 500 percent interest per year or more . 
mr. speaker , i am pleased to yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from north carolina ( mr. watt ) xz4004240 , the ranking member of the subcommittee on commercial and administrative law . 
mr. speaker , i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from new york ( mr. nadler ) xz4002890 , the former ranking member of the subcommittee on commercial and administrative law . 
mr. speaker , how much time remains on either side ? 
mr. speaker , i rise in support of this rule and the bill authored by the gentleman from missouri ( mr. hulshof ) xz4001900 and commend him for his great work on behalf of america 's job creators . 
what we are trying to get rid of is the complexity of the tax code and the $ 20 billion a year that the death tax consumes from the american economy that does not go to the treasury but , rather , goes to tax lawyers and accountants and life insurance sales and keyman policies and so on , all of this estate planning which is economic waste . 
much as we would like to be able to tax the super-rich , they get out of the tax with trusts and loopholes and so on , as will the rich after we do what the democrats want , which is to create some complicated new definitions to try and cabin off this tax so it only affects a few people . 
but here is the kind of helpful thing one will find when a loved one dies : `` generally , you may list on schedule m all property interests that pass from the decedent to the surviving spouse and are included in the gross estate . 
however , you should not list any `nondeductible terminable interests , ' described below , on schedule m unless you are making a qtip election . 
the property for which you make this election must be included on schedule m. see `qualified terminable interest property ' on the following page . 
`` for the rules on common disaster and survival for a limited period , see section 2056 ( b ) ( 3 ) . '' this is just one little paragraph out of 40 pages of this . 
when that small business is liquidated in order to pay the death tax because it is a tax on property of small businesses , people lose their jobs , and that is where the burden and the incidence of this tax falls . 
it is a drag on economic growth , and it is the greatest disincentive to invest additional capital in family businesses in america . 
you will not know until it is too late whether you are on one side or the other side of that threshold . 
and if you are trying to employ some people , you have 10 , 11 , 12 people that work for that business , what are you going to say to them when they lose their jobs because the family business has to be liquidated on the death of the entrepreneur in order to come up with the actual cash to pay for it ? 
some of the previous speakers on this side of the aisle have made reference to the fact that a number of us on the democratic side have worked over this issue since actually the early nineties . 
i know the gentleman 's predecessor jennifer dunn and i and a number of people from this side of the aisle had worked hard together to look for a commonsense way that we could end this burden which , in my opinion , is an extreme burden on the small business community and on the farm community . 
for generations , they have struggled and used tax lawyers and tax strategies to try to find a way to effectively pass that farm on to the next generation that we want to continue engaging in that farm business . 
slow job creation has also put little pressure on businesses to raise wages . 
additionally , from 2009 forward , the tax exemption level would be $ 3.5 & lt ; center & gt ; & lt ; pre & gt ; [ page : h1939 ] & lt ; /pre & gt ; & lt ; /center & gt ; i know my friends on the other side of the aisle desperately want to make sure that the paris hiltons of america are fully covered , but they have done pretty good the last 100 years ; and i am sure under the pomeroy bill in the future they will continue to do pretty good . 
additionally , the substitute bill eliminates the liability for tax on gains accrued before death . 
by using the stepped-up basis to calculate the value on an estate at a time of death , the substitute bill is actually making the tax code simpler and less cumbersome . 
to my friends on the right who believe that any estate tax is so vile that you took your polling advice and decided to start calling it the death tax , you should read leviticus 25 containing god 's message to moses that every 50 years , called the jubilee , all possessions must be returned to the original owners . 
to cite just one example , myself and the gentleman from north carolina ( mr. watt ) xz4004240 proposed an amendment to limit the interest charged on a credit card to 75 percent . 
mr. speaker , to listen to this majority , we have a crisis in this country -- one brought on by spendthrifts defrauding the public via our bankruptcy system . 
last year , more than a million-and-a-half families resorted to declaring bankruptcy -- a full half of which occurred not because of any irresponsible behavior but because of unexpected medical expenses brought on by an illness or death in the family . 
if there is any `` crisis , '' it is the skyrocketing cost of health care , which has left more than 14 million americans spending more than a quarter of their every paycheck on medical costs -- that mr. speaker , is what i call a crisis . 
we can all agree that individuals should be accountable for living beyond their means , but if anyone is `` gaming '' our bankruptcy system , it is the credit card companies , who have long been advocating for this bill at the same time they prey on unsuspecting customers . 
mr. speaker , i rise in opposition to this latest republican assault on social security and on fiscal sanity . 
at a time of apparently unending war and the largest budget deficits in american history , our republican colleagues are intent on solving a crisis that does not exist . 
as the president wastes millions of our taxpayer dollars crisscrossing this country to declare that there is no social security trust fund and questioning the full faith and credit of the federal government , his republican allies here seem intent on actually making his dire and inaccurate statements a self-fulfilling prophecy . 
they keep talking about the little family business that with good reason wants to be able to pass that enterprise on to the next generation of that hard-working family . 
this bill will do nothing to stimulate the economic growth or savings , which is what we should be focused on , rather than further shifting the tax burden from wealth to work . 
we could be debating and using this time on simplifying the code . 
that is where we should be focusing , on simplifying the code and taking away the incentive to cheat , which is what we have today in our code . 
but the republicans will soldier on and continue to fight until taxes are eliminated for the very last multimillionaire . 
instead of adopting a bill that would increase the burden on our children and grandchildren , we need a common-sense solution that would exempt the vast majority of americans from an estate tax while maintaining a degree of fiscal integrity . 
furthermore , this plan would instantly repeal the estate tax on a vast majority of farms and small businesses , as well as shield heirs from dramatic capital gains tax liabilities that are part of the republican plan . 
it is very important to note that the bill does absolutely nothing to discourage abusive underage lending , nothing to discourage reckless lending to the developmentally disabled and nothing to crack down on unscrupulous pay-day lenders that prey on members of the armed forces . 
first , i would like to take this opportunity to thank the gentleman from missouri ( mr. hulshof ) xz4001900 for his leadership on the bill . 
mr. speaker , i do not believe that there has ever been a more reprehensible tax on the face of the earth than the death tax . 
the death tax represents not only a tax on the deceased but also on their families . 
mr. speaker , it is intolerable and absolutely unacceptable for the federal government to exact a tax on death and on the surviving families , causing them to lose their homes , their business , their farms and the lives they have struggled to build . 
mr. speaker , i want to commend the gentleman from missouri ( mr. hulshof ) xz4001900 , the gentleman from alabama ( mr. cramer ) xz4000840 , the gentleman from california ( mr. cox ) xz4000830 , and all those who have worked so hard to get rid of this onerous burden on a number of american citizens . 
we have a number of counties and jurisdictions that focus on manufacturing . 
a factor in their selling out was the federal death tax because they would not have the cash to pay when death knocked on the door . 
as chairman of the house committee on agriculture , i am pleased that we are finally making the chapter 12 provisions of the bankruptcy code permanent . 
what these people may not realize or care about is that these debts do not just disappear -- they are passed along in higher chargers and rates to hard-working folks who pay their bills on time . 
specifically , this legislation restores fairness and equity to the relationship between the u.s. trustee and private standing bankruptcy trustees by providing that in certain circumstances , after an administrative hearing on the record , private trustees may seek judicial review of u.s. trustee actions related to trustee removal . 
i want to commend chairmen sensenbrenner and cannon for their tremendous work on this legislation , and i urge each of my colleagues to support this fair and reasonable overhaul of the u.s. bankruptcy system . 
texas , which has the longest and oldest history of homestead protection laws in our country , has no cap on homestead protection , along with kansas , iowa , florida , and south dakota . 
while i understand there must be a sensible cap on exemptible home equity to ensure the law is not protecting million dollar mansions , $ 125 , 000 is unreasonable given the skyrocketing price of real estate in texas and many other parts of the country . 
this bill will make bankruptcy even more expensive and burdensome than it already is , on hardworking americans who have fallen on hard times and seniors on fixed incomes , while doing nothing to address the out of control lending practices by credit card companies . 
the death tax distorts economic decisions on a massive scale . 
you see , no matter what kind of spin our friends on the other side of the aisle try to use -- the death tax simply is n't fair . 
it 's an unfair burden that the government has placed on families and small business owners . 
our friends on the other side of the aisle say that this is too costly and it 's bad for the budget . 
what kind of nation have we become when a small family farmer ca n't afford to pass the business on to his children ? 
mr. speaker , by direction of the committee on rules , i call up house resolution 202 and ask for its immediate consideration . 
mr. speaker , house resolution 202 is a structured rule providing for 1 hour of general debate on h.r. 8 , a bill to make the repeal of the estate tax permanent , to be equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the committee on ways and means . 
the rule provides for consideration of the amendment in the nature of a substitute printed in the committee on rules report accompanying the resolution , if offered , by the gentleman from north dakota ( mr. pomeroy ) xz4003230 or his designee , which shall be considered as read and shall be separately debatable for 1 hour equally divided and controlled by the proponent and an opponent . 
death taxes are an unfair assault on every american 's potential life savings . 
the committee on rules reported house resolution 202 by a voice vote . 
mr. speaker , i am pleased to yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from west virginia ( mrs. capito ) xz4000610 , a valuable member of the committee on rules . 
mr. speaker , i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from florida ( mr. putnam ) xz4003280 , a powerful member of the committee on rules . 
we will have a vigorous debate on that . 
in the 106th congress , on a bipartisan basis , with 279 votes in favor , this body voted in favor of permanently eliminating the death tax . 
and the other body , also on a bipartisan basis , they , too , voted to permanently eliminate the death tax , but president clinton vetoed that bill . 
in the 107th congress , again on a bipartisan basis , the house voted to eliminate the death tax permanently . 
the bill that we will address when we pass this rule is exactly the same as the bill that we passed on a bipartisan basis in the last congress . 
transfers to social security. & lt ; p & gt ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; ( a ) findings. -- congress hereby finds that -- & lt ; p & gt ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; ( 1 ) permanent repeal of the estate tax will cost $ 290 billion over the 10-year budget window , & lt ; p & gt ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; ( 2 ) this $ 290 billion understates the long-term cost of repeal -- in the last year of the budget window repeal of the estate tax will cost $ 70 billion , & lt ; p & gt ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; ( 3 ) in the next decade , the cost of repealing the estate tax together with the increased interest cost to the united states would be substantially above $ 1 trillion , & lt ; p & gt ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; ( 4 ) the enormous cost of repealing the estate tax would only benefit the wealthiest 0.3 percent of all families in the united states , & lt ; p & gt ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; ( 5 ) permanent repeal of the estate tax would result in a substantial reduction in income tax receipts , and could result in lower receipts in the social security trust funds because of that tax avoidance , & lt ; p & gt ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; ( 6 ) the provisions of this act would prevent the reduction in social security receipts that could result from permanent repeal and it would preserve funds necessary to meet commitments made to the social security system or other programs , & lt ; p & gt ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; ( 7 ) the provisions of this act provide immediate and substantial estate tax relief , exempting 99.7 percent of all estates from the estate tax , & lt ; p & gt ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; ( 8 ) the united states is faced with many other fiscal challenges , including the requirement to meet the commitments made through the social security system , and & lt ; p & gt ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; ( 9 ) the amounts saved by enacting this act as compared to permanent repeal -- & lt ; p & gt ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; ( a ) in the long run on an annual basis would equal the current costs of the operations in iraq , & lt ; p & gt ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; ( b ) could be used for improvements in veterans benefits , and & lt ; p & gt ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; ( c ) would close half of the shortfall faced by the social security system. & lt ; p & gt ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; ( b ) transfers to social security. -- section 201 of the social security act ( 42 u.s.c . 
`` ( 2 ) for fiscal years beginning after september 30 , 2015 , the transfers in each year shall total the amount the secretary of the treasury determines to be the savings from the enactment of such act as compared to such permanent repeal of the estate tax. '' . & lt ; p & gt ; mr. speaker , i yield back the balance of my time , and i move the previous question on the resolution . 
i believe , as most americans do , that it is unacceptable for a grieving family who has recently lost a loved one to get a visit from the undertaker and the irs on the very same day . 
the death tax is really a tax on the american dream . 
now , mr. speaker , i grew up working on a farm , and i represent a large portion of rural east texas . 
it is not fair that americans are being taxed twice on the same income . 
unfortunately , due to outdated senate budget rules , the 2001 tax law will sunset on december 31 , 2010 . 
consider that the heirs of those who pass away in 2010 will face no death tax whatsoever , while those whose families are unfortunate enough to pass away in 2011 or thereafter will face tax rates of up to 55 percent on their assets , forcing many of them to have to sell . 
studies have found that family businesses spend up to $ 125 , 000 on attorneys , accountants and financial experts to assist in estate planning . 
vote `` aye '' on this legislation . 
with a war in iraq and looming postwar costs , increased expenses for domestic security and a ballooning budget deficit , congress must exercise restraint on both revenues and spending to prevent fiscal policy from spiraling out of control . 
there are a wide range of pressing national challenges that need action , from rapidly increasing health care costs , to our increasing dependence on ever-more-expensive foreign oil , to a broken and increasingly corrupt political system , and yet today we are passing a bill that will only help a few of the already wealthy . 
here we have another tax cut that is not being paid for , even as the bush administration and the leadership of this congress spend more than the american government has ever spent on homeland security and on all the other expenses of running the government -- especially the huge costs of the war in , and occupation of , iraq . 
government borrowing of this scale places the burden of repaying our debts on our children . 
they did not send us here so we can pass those decisions on to our children , and they certainly did not send us here to pass the cost of our decisions on to our children . 
$ 163 billion ; taiwan , $ 59 billion ; germany , $ 57 billion ; opec countries , $ 65 billion ; switzerland , $ 50 billion ; korea , $ 68 billion ; mexico , $ 41 billion ; luxembourg , $ 29 billion ; canada , $ 43 billion -- the list goes on and on . 
massive deficits now create large debt and will create high interest payments that will crowd out spending on public investments for future generations . 
the provision in the bill dealing with `` asset protection trusts '' also does not adequately address the problem of wealthy individuals stashing millions away the bill also imposes artificial deadlines and cumbersome new paperwork requirements on small businesses trying to reorganize , and it unnecessarily limits the discretion of bankruptcy judges in crafting the best possible result for small-business debtors and creditors . 
however , this should coincide with greater responsibility on the part of the creditors . 
mr. speaker , today , the republican majority continues its assault on hardworking americans by ramming through the house of representatives bankruptcy legislation that harms even the most ethical among us . 
sadly , the mechanisms employed by this bill to crack down on bankruptcy abuse will have a disproportionate impact on women , minority communities , the elderly and the unemployed . 
it betrays veterans who accumulate debt following an injury or disability sustained on active duty . 
amendments to close loopholes for millionaires , discourage predatory lending , and cap interest on extension of credit were flatly rejected by the republican majority on the rules committee . 
for years , house republicans have proclaimed that the elimination of the inheritance tax , a tax , now hear me on this side of the aisle , i know you want to hear this , a tax first proposed by theodore roosevelt in 1906 . 
but there are a whole lot of people that are not doing nearly as well as we are doing , and we are not helping them at all by simply giving away revenue that we could spend on the education of their kids and the defense of their country , which we are borrowing for , of course , so that their kids will pay the debts . 
now even as this bill increases the capital gains tax on many farm estates and small businesses , i tell my friend , it still adheres to what seems to be the republican party 's core economic principle : fiscal irresponsibility . 
there are a lot of taxes on all of us , and we have a lot of services in this country . 
in sharp contrast , i tell my friend from missouri , and i wish there were more people on this floor , but it is only giving away , you know , $ 250 billion to $ 1 trillion . 
mr. speaker , i ask unanimous consent that all members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on h.r. 8 . 
on behalf of the lead democratic sponsor , my colleague , the gentleman from alabama ( mr. cramer ) xz4000840 , as well as the over 200 bipartisan members who have co-sponsored this bill , i am pleased that we are poised to pass in this body this commonsense legislation . 
of course , they want this family business that has been in their family since its modest beginnings in 1965 to be able to be passed on pursuant to the american dream , that is , to create a legacy , to help your children be better off than you were . 
yet the effert family today , mr. speaker , has to write a check for $ 1 , 000 a week , $ 52 , 036 to be precise , to purchase a term life insurance policy , the proceeds of which will be to pay the federal government on that inevitable day that howard effert passes from this world to the next . 
let me touch briefly on some policy rationales for finishing this unfinished work . 
not only does this have a very real effect on taxpayers and their behavior but a negative impact on the economy . 
with a tax like the death tax , a family business or farm has no choice but to divert these precious resources , as in the case of the effert family , to plan financially for the financial impact for the tax : money that could be used to expand the business , to purchase a forklift , to bring another person on the payroll , whatever is in the best interest of that business . 
i am mindful of the bumper sticker that i saw recently traveling missouri 's highways on a big recreational vehicle that says `` i am spending my children 's inheritance. '' if you wanted to give some good estate tax advice to someone that has put together some assets to pass along , it would be simply to consume it . 
yet as we talk about some sort of tax reform and perhaps a consumption tax , this tax actually focuses on non-consumption and on thrift and savings . 
mr. speaker , a lot of individuals have worked on h.r. 8 , and i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from california ( mr. herger ) xz4001760 , one of those individuals . 
mr. speaker , i certainly respect my friend from tennessee and i trust he will bring that passion to the floor when we have our discussion on our spending bills . 
when you woke up this morning , if you hit the snooze button on your electric alarm clock , you are paying an electric tax . 
if you saw the gentleman from north dakota ( mr. pomeroy ) xz4003230 and i on c-span debating this issue this morning , you are paying a cable tv tax . 
now i have heard from my colleagues on the other side who say that family farms are not affected . 
and i am sitting across the mahogany desk from our long-time family accountant with the adding machine with a tape on it , and he is plugging in an arbitrary value for these assets that my parents invested their soul into . 
and i am breaking out into a cold sweat wondering whether or not this business that they built and wanted to pass on is going to fall above an arbitrary line or below an arbitrary line that we in congress have set . 
and let us hope and pray that as permanent repeal occurs , if it occurs , in the outyears that we will not be in that war on terrorism . 
in essence , the letter reads as follows : the groups listed below support permanent estate tax repeal , ask for this body to vote for h.r. 8 , and the letter goes on to say , individuals and families own virtually all of the farms and ranches that dot america 's rural landscape . 
mr. speaker , the gentleman just indicated that the pomeroy substitute solves the problem once and for all , and i have listened to a number of individuals on the other side during the course of this discussion that this is only going to affect the superwealthy and that really there are no family businesses that are affected by the estate tax . 
it has been interesting , because some of those comments have come from colleagues of mine on the committee on ways and means . 
so i will mention some of these folks who have come and testified in front of the committee on ways and means . 
it is a rhetorical question , and the gentleman from north dakota ( mr. pomeroy ) xz4003230 knows it , and i do not mean to put him on the spot , but he can not answer the question because when we draw a line , an arbitrary line , wherever we draw that line , we still are going to have those entrepreneurs that have been willing to invest in their businesses , hire employees , build local communities ; and as long as the death tax remains in existence , they are going to have to do some sort of estate planning . 
mr. speaker , many have worked on the death tax repeal and going back even to the , i think , family heritage preservation act of 1993 . 
now , of course , we are over 200 on permanent repeal . 
regarding his criticism on philanthropy , the estate tax according to the joint economic committee study , the estate tax may actually be one of the greatest obstacles to charitable giving as estate taxes crowd out charitable bequests . 
mr. speaker , i appreciate the opportunity to address the house today on this very important piece of legislation , the repeal of the death tax and making it permanent . 
the repeal of the death tax is one of the first bills that i was honored to place my name on as a cosponsor . 
growing up on a family farm in eastern washington , i have seen firsthand the negative impacts the death tax has on our families and our businesses . 
some family farmers have had to take out a second mortgage on their home to pay for the tax . 
i support the passage of h.r. 8 in order to end this unjust , unfair , and inefficient tax burden on our families , businesses and especially our farming communities . 
in 2010 , it magically disappears , and then on january 1 of 2011 it springs back to life , and the uncertainty , how would one as an estate planner advise a client when the tax is gone today and comes back again in the very next year ? 
lastly , when it comes down to the nuts and bolts of it , whether or not the pomeroy substitute , and again , in the effort to pursue the american dream , whether those businesses are going to be shielded by the pomeroy substitute or not shielded , the fact is that as long as the tax is on the books , as long as congress draws some line in the sand , and that is all we are doing with the substitute , is just some arbitrary line , we are still going to have those family businesses that are going to be taking some of their resources and these convoluted schemes , legal , but efforts to avoid the tax . 
the gentleman from illinois ( mr. emanuel ) xz4001200 , again a colleague of mine on the committee on ways and means , said , why are not we debating real reform ? 
there is a lot of talk about the consumption tax , and yet it is notable that , while there may be support for the idea of a general consumption tax , the death tax , by contrast , is a tax on nonconsumption . 
why can we not put taxes on alcohol or on cigarettes and the like and whether or not that generates support among certain groups . 
this death tax is a tax on virtue . 
the gift and estate tax is quite simply a bad tax , even , and maybe especially , when viewed from a liberal perspective. '' professor mccaffrey goes on and says , `` this is not a supply-side argument but a moral one . 
and they have refrained from spending all of their wealth on themselves. '' in fact , professor mccaffrey across the capitol some years ago i think before the senate finance committee said , to paraphrase scripture , the reason he changed his mind , i was blind but now i see . 
the fact is that under h.r. 8 , if it were to pass and become the law of the land , the tax rate imposed at death on a lifetime of work and thrift is zero percent . 
i urge a `` no '' on the substitute and a `` yes '' on the underlying bill . 
so let me suggest to you as i look at the medical conditions , i would ask my colleagues on the other side of the aisle does their stale old bill , this stack of old papers respond to the medical causes of bankruptcy that shows that because there is death in the family , illness or injury , people who go try to repay their bills and they fall into bankruptcy and this old stale 1998 bill does not respond to that . 
testimony of elizabeth warren before the senate committee on the judiciary my name is elizabeth warren . 
in the eight years since this bill was introduced , new cases have burst on the scene . 
problems not even on the horizon when this bill was written are now front and center . 
unlike eight years ago , we need not have a theoretical debate about the effects of the proposed legislation on small business . 
for the first time ever , congress would pass a law that says companies like enron and worldcom do n't have to file extra forms , enron and worldcom do n't have to schedule meetings with the office of the united states trustee , and enron and worldcom do n't have to meet fixed deadlines that a judge can not waive for any reason -- but every troubled small business in the chapter 11 system would have to file those papers , undergo that supervision and meet those deadlines or be unlike eight years ago , we need not have a theoretical debate about the economic impact of bankruptcies on credit card company profits . 
with increased fees and universal default clauses that drive up interest rates even for customers paying on time , a growing number of people have no option but to declare bankruptcy . 
proponents like to say that the means test will put pressure only on the families that can afford to repay . 
other provisions will compromise the privacy of millions of families by putting their entire tax returns in the court files and potentially on the internet , making them easy prey for identity thieves . 
if congress is determined to sort the good from the bad , then begin by sorting those who have been laid low by medical debts , those who lost their jobs , those whose breadwinners have been called to active duty and sent to iraq , those who are caring for elderly parents and sick children from those few who overspend on frivolous purchases . 
do n't press `` one-size-fits-all-and-they-are-all-bad '' judgments on the very good and the very bad . 
based on the harvard medical study and other research , i think you will find that most debtors are filing for bankruptcy not because they had too many rolex watches and gameboys , but because they had no choice . 
they effectively shut democrats out of the markup process and thereby ignored the voices of the people 's representatives on this very serious policy matter . 
the banking industry has spent $ 22 million on federal lobbying in the past five years . 
in fact , according to the new york times , `` the main lobbying forces for the bill -- a coalition that included visa , mastercard , the american bankers association , mbna america , capital one , citicorp , the ford motor credit company and the general motors acceptance corporation -- spent more than $ 40 million in political fund-raising efforts and many millions more on lobbying efforts since 1989. '' clearly , the republican majority has shut democrats out of the process in order to appease these special interest groups -- to the detriment of middle-class and elderly americans . 
proponents of this bankruptcy bill suggest that it will put pressure only on the families that have the ability to repay . 
what was meant to bring short-term budgetary relief has become a permanent burden on america 's farmers , small business owners and families . 
for example , it is often claimed that the tax only falls on the `` rich '' and thus serves to reduce income inequality . 
the freedom to attain prosperity and accumulate wealth is the basis of the `` american dream. '' we are taught that through hard work we can achieve that dream and , god willing , pass it on to our children . 
this is tragically wrong and nullifies the hard work of those who have passed on . 
on a smaller scale , another potential victim , a storeowner named leonard l. harris who is a first generation owner of chatham food center on the south side of chicago is frightened that all the work and value he has put into his business will be for naught because it will be stripped from his two sons . 
for this reason , cash resources to pay federal estate taxes , based on the way valuation is made , would force my family to sell the store in order to pay the irs within 9 months of my death . 
they argue that the estate tax falls on wealthier and higher income individuals and increases the total tax paid by this segment of the population relative to their income . 
this helps offset the regressivity of payroll taxes and excise taxes , which fall more heavily on low-income groups relative to their income . 
the institute for policy innovation recently revealed evidence of this fact in a study showing that the effective tax rate on the most valuable estates was actually lower than that on medium-sized estates . 
second , the insignificant amount of money the estate tax raises for the federal government can not justify the harmful effects it has on business owners who spend more to avoid the tax than the federal tax revenue raised . 
therefore , the total impact on the economy was a staggering $ 44 billion . 
and , when one calculates the amount of money spent on complying with the tax , the number of lost jobs resulting from businesses being sold , or the resources directed away from business expansion and into estate planning , it is clear why this punitive tax must be eliminated . 
the small business administration 's definition of a small business is based on industry size standards . 
permanent repeal of the estate tax will provide american families with fairness in our tax system and remove the perverse incentive that makes it is cheaper for an individual to sell the business prior to death and pay the individual capital gains rate than pass it on to heirs . 
it will allow wealth created in one generation to be passed on to the next thereby establishing sustainable minority communities through better jobs and education , better healthcare , and safer communities . 
debate on an amendment to the bill was prevented . 
i also oppose s. 256 because it does absolutely nothing to stem the predatory practices employed by credit card companies , or the abusive fees and penalties imposed on individuals who make just one late payment . 
i encourage my house colleague to vote no on the bankruptcy abuse prevention and consumer protection act . 
specifically , i am concerned about the impact on our brave service members and our military families . 
somehow , we expect the spouse to care her children , to make the house payment , and to pay the bills on an income that is significantly lower . 
i am against passing legislation only adding to the enormous burden we are already placing on those defending the united states and the families sending a loved one into harm 's way . 
the system in place now gives incentives to people in trouble and encourages them to steamroll headfirst into chapter 7 liquidation of all their debts , even when they could get back on their feet through a reasonable repayment plan or basic credit counseling . 
bankruptcy costs are passed on to other consumers , and the average family pays hundreds of dollars each year in higher prices . 
with an over-reliance on credit cards and a lack of saving for retirement , too many americans find themselves on shaky financial ground . 
i am particularly pleased to note the compromise reached on healthcare and employee benefits . 
mr. shapiro testified in support of these patient health provisions before the u.s. senate committee on the judiciary subcommittee on administrative oversight and the courts on june 1 , 1998 . 
on behalf of my colleagues in congress , i offer my sincere gratitude for their dedication to fair bankruptcy policy . 
because commercial institutions have to pass their losses on to everyone else in the form of higher prices and higher interest rates . 
the bankruptcy abuse prevention and consumer protection act is a well-balanced measure that will permit people with real financial need to get a fresh start , but lessen the burden placed on other working americans who now must support people who are taking advantage of the system . 
now this new law will put people on their own . 
as the son of a small business owner , i know firsthand the tax burden placed on entrepreneurs and working families , and i support efforts to responsibly protect small business owners . 
small businesses and farm owners should not be penalized for their success , nor should they need to worry about their ability to pass the family business on to future generations , and the substitute addresses these concerns . 
while the benefits overwhelmingly go to the wealthiest 0.3 percent of estates , republican leaders fail to mention that their proposal actually raises taxes on thousands of estates , including those not previously affected by the estate tax . 
this is because their legislation increases capital gain taxes owed on inherited property . 
the department of agriculture estimates that this change will raise taxes on more farms than would benefit from repealing the tax . 
based on internal revenue service data for 2004 , out of approximately 10 , 000 deaths in my home state , only 312 rhode island decedents filed estate tax returns . 
i can tell you firsthand from real life , honest experience the effect that the death tax has on families and creating jobs and opportunities and being able to continue what i believe is the american dream , and that is to have an opportunity for your children and your grandchildren to continue a life that you love and cherish . 
the idea , while the gentleman from north dakota ( mr. pomeroy ) xz4003230 , i have the greatest respect for him , but the idea of continuing an immoral tax that destroys family , destroys family businesses , i have seen neighbors who have lost everything they have , lost generations of work on a family farm because of the death tax . 
this country is based on farms , on small businesses . 
it is a death wish on the part of some of my colleagues about fiscal responsibility . 
what this is also , everybody should understand , is a further raid on social security funds . 
my colleagues have come here , some of them on the majority side , talking about social security and how we need to address the shortfall . 
we need to make a distinction between a family who is struggling to pay for a medical operation for a child and a person who maxes out their credit cards on a shopping spree at the mall . 
a recent harvard university study underscores the fact that the bankruptcy bill 's impact will extend well beyond cracking down on people who abuse credit . 
the industry hands out credit cards like popcorn , and then loads on extraordinary penalty fees and higher interest rates after a payment is late . 
i include with my statement an article from the march 6 edition of the washington post entitled , `` credit card penalties , fees bury debtors ; senate nears action on bankruptcy curbs. '' credit card penalties , fees bury debtors ; senate nears action on bankruptcy curbs for more than two years , special-education teacher fatemeh hosseini worked a second job to keep up with the $ 2 , 000 in monthly payments she collectively sent to five banks to try to pay $ 25 , 000 in credit card debt . 
the senate is to vote as soon as this week on a bill that would make it harder for individuals to wipe out debt through bankruptcy . 
owens tried for six years to pay off a $ 1 , 900 balance on her discover card , sending the credit company a total of $ 3 , 492 in monthly payments from 1997 to 2003 . 
consumer-advocacy groups and many democrats say people who seek bankruptcy protection do so mostly because they have fallen on hard times through illness , divorce or job loss . 
opponents also argue that the legislation is unfair because it ignores loopholes that would allow rich debtors to shield millions of dollars during bankruptcy through expensive homes and complex trusts , while ignoring the need for more disclosure to cardholders about rates and fees and curbs on what they say is irresponsible behavior by the credit card industry . 
credit card companies declined to comment on specific cases or customers for this article , but banking industry officials , speaking generally , said there is a good reason for the fees they charge . 
`` there has to be some onus on the cardholder , some responsibility to manage their finances. '' high fees `` may be extreme cases , but they are not the trend , not the norm , '' feddis said . 
u.s. bankruptcy judge david h. adams of norfolk , who is also the president of the national conference of bankruptcy judges , said many debtors who get in over their heads `` are spending money , buying things they should n't be buying. '' even so , he said , `` once you add all these fees on , the amount of principal being paid is negligible . 
and just like a mortgage payment and a car payment , if you are late you are assessed a fee. '' the 29.99 percent interest rate , he said , is the default rate charged to consumers `` who do n't meet their obligation to pay their bills on time '' and is clearly disclosed on account applications . 
the interest is much , much more than the principal. '' samuel j. gerdano , executive director of the american bankruptcy institute , a nonpartisan research group , said that focusing on late fees is `` refusing to look at the elephant in the room , and that 's the massive levels of consumer debt which is not being paid . 
`` late and over-limit fees alone can easily rack up $ 900 in fees , and a 30 percent interest rate on a $ 3 , 000 balance can add another $ 1 , 000 , so you could go from $ 2 , 000 to $ 5 , 000 in just one year if you fail to make payments. '' according to r.k . 
this makes it more difficult for debtors to get back on their feet . 
as a result , more families facing medical bankruptcy will be presumed to be abusing the system , will be forced into chapter 13 and will never be able to stand on their feet again . 
incredibly , they also cut back on needed medications to try to avoid bankruptcy . 
`` if the debtor be insolvent to serve creditors , let his body be cut in pieces on the third market day . 
it remains on credit reports for a decade , making everything from car insurance to house payments more expensive . 
most previous studies of medical bankruptcy , however , have relied on court records -- where medical debts may be subsumed under credit card or mortgage debt -- or on responses to a single survey question . 
none has collected detailed information on medical expenses , diagnoses , access to care , work loss , or insurance coverage . 
the health policy literature is virtually silent on bankruptcy , although a few studies have looked at impoverishment attributable to illness . 
about 16 percent of families now spend more than one-twentieth of their income on health care . 
our study provides the first extensive data on the medical concomitants of bankruptcy , based on a survey of debtors in bankruptcy courts . 
under both chapters , taxes , student loans , alimony , and child support remain payable in full , and debtors must make payments on all secured loans ( such as home mortgages and car loans ) or forfeit the collateral . 
this study is based on a cohort of 1 , 771 bankruptcy filings in 2001 . 
these 1 , 250 cases constitute our `` core sample. '' for planned studies on housing , we collected identical data from an additional 521 homeowners filing for bankruptcy . 
we based our analyses on all 1 , 771 bankruptcies with responses weighted to maintain the representativeness of the sample . 
in total , we collected in-depth medical information on 391 people with health problems in 332 debtor households . 
on average , each bankruptcy involved 1.32 debtors ( reflecting some joint filings by married couples ) and 1.33 dependents . 
although our interviews occurred soon after the bankruptcy filings ( seven months , on average ) , many debtors had already been turned down for jobs ( 3.1 percent ) , mortgages ( 5.8 percent ) , apartment rentals ( 4.9 percent ) , or car loans ( 9.3 percent ) because of the bankruptcy on their credit reports . 
our interviews yielded detailed data on diagnoses , health insurance coverage , and medical bills for 391 debtors or family members whose medical problems contributed to bankruptcy . 
those with continuous insurance coverage paid $ 734 annually in premiums on average over and above the expenditures detailed above . 
as in all surveys , we relied on respondents ' truthfulness . 
might some debtors blame their predicament on socially acceptable medical problems rather than admitting to irresponsible spending ? 
though republicans want to undo all the good for the sake of greed , please , america , do not be phonied up by this rhetoric that we hear on this bill . 
we just came from the committee on ways and means . 
ronald reagan put the sign of the cross on it . 
never does anyone say on my colleagues ' side , are we better off . 
my colleague , the gentleman from washington ( mr. hastings ) xz4001711 , will claim that this bill will help family farmers and small business owners pass their assets , their farms and businesses , on to their children . 
mr. speaker , for most of the 20th century , this country operated on a progressive taxation system . 
president bush came into his first term with a surplus and ended his second term with the largest deficit in the history of the united states of america , and now they bring forward another tax cut that costs $ 290 billion according to the joint committee on taxation . 
it is a credit card bill that they are passing on to our children and our grandchildren . 
so let us be clear about what is going on , and let us also be clear about the cost to our kids . 
the joint committee on taxation says that this is going to cost up to $ 290 billion . 
there seems to be no concern on the other side of the aisle about what this does to our deficit or our debt . 
let me just remind my colleagues that the debt that we are faced with right now is close to $ 8 trillion , and the interest on that debt is astonishingly high . 
that is the legacy that they are passing on to our kids . 
our debt is close to $ 8 trillion , and there is no outrage on the other side , there is no concern about what we are doing and what it means to our economy by making these tax cuts permanent . 
i think that people need to understand what is going on here . 
i enter into the record an article that appeared in today 's washington post that really kind of explains what this debate is all about , about how mars candy , gallo wine , and campbell soup fortunes have been lobbying for the complete repeal of the estate tax for some time so they can end all taxation on their inheritance . 
fortune joined a few other wealthy families to hire the law firm patton boggs llp to lobby for estate tax repeal , the joke on k street was that few washington sightseers had paid so much for a fruitless tour of the capitol . 
today , the house is expected to vote to permanently repeal the estate tax , moving the mars candy , gallo wine and campbell soup fortunes one step closer to a goal that once seemed quixotic at best : ending all taxation on inheritances . 
last month , graetz and yale political scientist ian shapiro published `` death by a thousand cuts , '' chronicling the estate tax repeal movement as `` a mystery about politics and persuasion. '' `` for almost a century , the estate tax affected only the richest 1 or 2 percent of citizens , encouraged charity , and placed no burden on the vast majority of americans , '' they wrote . 
while repeal opponents bellowed that only the richest of the rich would ever pay the estate tax , proponents appealed to americans ' sense of fairness , that individuals have the natural right to pass on their wealth to their children . 
the pomeroy bill would cost the treasury $ 72 billion over 10 years , compared with the $ 290 billion price tag of a full repeal through 2015 , according to the joint committee on taxation . 
`` the public does n't believe people should be taxed at the time of death , whether they are paupers or billionaires , '' said frank luntz , a republican pollster who has been working on estate tax repeal for a decade . 
by then , soldano 's policy and taxation group was spending more than $ 250 , 000 a year on lobbying . 
a parade of small-business owners and family farmers appealed to their congressmen , worried that they could not pass on their enterprises to their children , even though most of them would not be affected by the tax . 
but ultimately , whether people believe the estate tax will affect them has little bearing on support for repeal . 
i appreciate the words from my colleague on the committee on rules , the gentleman from florida ; but quite frankly , i do not know what he is talking about . 
right now , this year , we are paying $ 177 billion this year in interest on the debt . 
it falls , in effect , on the heirs to the wealthiest americans . 
counting both revenue losses and added interest costs , complete repeal of the estate tax would cost the government close to $ 1 trillion between 2012 and 2021 , according to the center on budget and policy priorities . 
what would happen if , instead of repealing the tax , congress left it in place at a 45 percent rate , and only on fortunes that exceeded $ 3.5 million -- which would be $ 7 million for couples ? 
michael j. graetz and ian shapiro , authors of a new book on the estate tax , `` death by a thousand cuts , '' have referred to its repeal as the `` paris hilton benefit act. '' to pick up on the metaphor , why should congress be more concerned about protecting paris hilton 's inheritance than grandma 's social security check ? 
this also means that democrats now talking about reaching a `` compromise '' with the republicans on the estate tax should put the discussions on hold until the social security debate plays itself out . 
that 's why they 're hoping they can sucker defenders of estate taxes into a so-called compromise that gives away the store -- the store , in this case , going to neiman-marcus shoppers , not to those who rely on target . 
what we are having is not a real debate on the future of social security but a sham discussion in which the one issue that matters to the governing majority is how to keep cutting taxes on the wealthiest people in our country . 
but it 's not serious enough to warrant a minor inconvenience to those who plan to live on their parents ' wealth . 
what is unconscionable is that we are moving forward on this at a time when the majority of this house is proposing budgets that slash medicaid , that cut community development block grants , that cut veterans health benefits , that cut education , that cut things that people rely on every single day . 
i want to make it clear , as there is a lot of misinformation being promoted on the other side here : our side supports relief for family farmers and small businesses . 
we all agree on that , and the substitute that the gentleman from north dakota ( mr. pomeroy ) xz4003230 puts forth does that , with very generous exemptions . 
mr. speaker , at the end of this debate , i will call for a vote on the previous question ; and if the previous question is defeated i will offer an amendment to the rule . 
mr. speaker , there are a lot of people on the other side of the aisle who go back home and do town hall meetings and tell their constituents that they are for protecting social security . 
mr. speaker , i ask unanimous consent to insert the text of the amendment immediately prior to the vote on the previous question . 
again , mr. speaker , i would urge that the people join with us on this vote . 
mr. speaker , on that i demand the yeas and nays . 
supporters of this bill claim to have exempted service members who become disabled on active duty , but to be exempted you have to go into debt while on active duty . 
a veteran who returns home from iraq or afghanistan and then goes into debt because of the injuries sustained on active duty is still subject to the punitive means test . 
what a way to treat the men and women in uniform fighting on behalf of the united states . 
it is an unfair loophole that we should have had the opportunity to close here on the house floor . 
it is an outrage that we can not debate these issues here on the house floor . 
this bill is simply an attempt to reward credit card companies by removing a last resort available to middle-class families who fall on hard times . 
this excessive , unnecessary cut will pass despite the fact that , within the last few legislative sessions , this congress has voted to take 300 , 000 families off food stamps , to take 300 , 000 children off daycare , to run the risk , by taking $ 20 billion out of medicaid , that as many as 7 million very poor elderly people dependent on government help in nursing homes will not get that assistance . 
we are taking hundreds of billions of dollars , borrowing it from the social security trust funds , just to give more help to the very children who , because of the accident of birth , have the very best education that this country can allow , have all the contacts imaginable , are virtually guaranteed economic success unless they choose to turn their backs on it . 
what we have done is to turn our backs on the vast majority of the american people , and to close our consciences to our children 's generation , who are getting swamped with debt . 
this bill is going to cost $ 290 billion added on to a public debt that our children will never be able to recover from . 
the main component of the commission 's recommendations and the legislation we have here today is to establish a means-based test to determine who should work with creditors on a plan to repay their debts and those who can not afford to do so . 
these provisions : require credit card companies to include a disclosure statement highlighting the number of months necessary to repay a balance if the card holder were to pay only the minimum amount due ; require credit card companies to inform cardholders on when their low introductory rates expire and new higher rates take effect ; and prevent deceptive and fraudulent advertising practices by debt relief agencies by making certain that creditors are informed of their rights as debtors . 
s. 256 has been criticized for advancing the interests of the credit card industry on the backs of the poor and the middle class , many of whom are in debt because of circumstances beyond their control . 
another is because 7.3 million americans live on the minimum wage , more than one-third of whom rely on the $ 5.15 cents per hour to support their family . 
we just passed this week a permanent elimination of the estate tax , helping the wealthiest among us avoid paying any tax on their untaxed earnings , and passed a budget resolution that will cut health care to the indigent . 
those credit counseling operations that we have investigated for dishonest activity , they now get a monopoly on granting access to bankruptcy . 
did you buy a trailer home or a car on credit ? 
so what is going on here ? 
but the republican leadership would not allow us to consider an amendment that would sunset the bill in several years if no savings are passed on to consumers , and they will not be . 
interest rates have come down over the last 10 years on mortgages , on cars , on everything , but not on credit cards . 
they now get a monopoly on granting access to bankruptcy . 
did you buy a trailer home or a car on credit ? 
so what 's going on here ? 
it will impose new costs on the private sector of more than $ 123 million per year , in violation of the unfunded mandate reform act . 
what are we spending this money on ? 
just to administer this whole mess , we will spend another $ 26 million on extra judges -- and no one here thinks that will be enough . 
if they do n't they will play into the hands of the opponents of the bill -- it would reduce their credibility. '' i agree , but the republican leadership would n't allow us to consider an amendment that would sunset the bill in 2 years if no savings are passed on to consumers . 
the idea that we would be borrowing the money to pay for afghanistan and iraq when by just leaving this tax in place we could pay for those incursions and maybe get the humvees to those men and women who are defending us every single day , or maybe get bulletproof vests to them on time , borrowing the money . 
who should be first on the list of congressional priorities ? 
this legislation does nothing to put caps on interest rates or late fees or the overtime limits and other penalties , even those among reasonable people . 
mr. speaker , i thank the gentleman for his leadership and his recognition on this very important legislation that is before us today . 
i am very proud of the work of the gentleman from north dakota ( mr. pomeroy ) xz4003230 , our member of congress , a very distinguished member of the committee on ways and means , for his initiative and leadership in presenting to the congress today an alternative that makes sense to the american people , that is fair to america 's families . 
the gentleman from north dakota ( mr. pomeroy ) xz4003230 speaks with authority on the issues that impact rural america , small business , and america 's families and certainly america 's family farms . 
in its analysis of the president 's budget , the nonpartisan congressional budget office found that the tax rate on wage income is nearly twice the rate of capital income , unearned income . 
the republican approach would hurt more people than it helps by increasing taxes and administrative burdens on more than 71 , 000 estates . 
democrats want to be fair to all americans , and we support being able to pass a better life on to our children and our grandchildren . 
i urge our colleagues to support the very responsible pomeroy resolution and vote no on the irresponsible and reckless republican proposal . 
mr. speaker , i thank the gentleman for yielding me time and thank him for his distinguished leadership as the ranking member on the committee on the judiciary and his important statements on this bankruptcy bill today . 
that would have been an amendment on identity theft , which this week 's news accounts demonstrate there are real problems of identity theft , and an amendment was rejected . 
we tried to take a legislative course of action in our previous question , which is a technicality , is a procedure here on the floor ; but we were not able to get any republican support to address the issue of identity theft and how individuals can be protected from identity theft under the bankruptcy bill . 
this bill attempts to kill a mosquito with a shotgun. '' i have a problem with the bill on several counts as to what is contained in the bill . 
the bankruptcy bill fails miserably , i believe , on its merits . 
i just would like to quote keith lundin , a federal bankruptcy judge in tennessee and an authority on bankruptcy repayment plans . 
judge lundin says , `` the folks who brought you `those who can pay , should pay ' are pulling the stuffing out of the very part of the bankruptcy law where debtors do pay. '' he says , `` the advocates are n't trying to fix the bankruptcy law ; they 're trying to mess it up so much that nobody can use it. '' they interviewed dozens of bankruptcy judges , whose names have been suggested by proponents and opponents of this legislation , for their standing on this issue , to speak out ; and the reasons why these judges are opposed are several reasons . 
one is the judges now have broad discretion to determine how much a debtor must pay to creditors and on what schedule , and the schedule is very important , after declaring bankruptcy under what is known as chapter 13 ; but under the legislation , that discretion would be substantially curtailed . 
the new legislation would bar courts from reducing the amount that many debtors would have to repay on their cars and other big-ticket items . 
`` the folks who brought you `those who can pay , should pay ' are pulling the stuffing out of the very part of the bankruptcy law where debtors do pay , '' said keith lundin , a federal bankruptcy judge in the eastern district of tennessee in nashville and an authority on bankruptcy repayment plans . 
judges now have broad discretion to determine how much a debtor must pay to creditors and on what schedule after declaring bankruptcy under what is known as chapter 13 . 
the new legislation would bar courts from reducing the amount that many debtors would have to repay on their cars and other big-ticket items . 
`` when you have seen a system that has gone from a few hundred thousand cases to 1.5 million last year -- most of that increase during the fat years of the clinton administration -- you must conclude something is not right , '' said edith h. jones , a federal appellate court judge in houston who served on a blue-ribbon panel to review bankruptcy law in the 1990s and is widely believed to be seen as on president bush 's short list for a position on the supreme court . 
and , according to bankruptcy experts , it means that auto lenders are treated on an equal footing with other `` secured '' creditors -- they are promised repayment only to the value of the item they could repossess . 
under the new measure , debtors would have to pay the full amount on any vehicle purchased within 2 1/2 years of bankruptcy , or risk losing the vehicle . 
under the legislation , many debtors would have to make full payments on such big-ticket items as houses , furniture and appliances . 
under current bankruptcy law , two guiding principles are that debtors should not be required to repay indefinitely , or they effectively become indentured servants to their creditors , and that they should eventually be given a debt-free `` fresh start '' on their economic lives . 
the bill is particularly harsh on women who are often the primary care givers for their children or their parents and are the largest single group in bankruptcy ; on older americans who are the fastest growing group in bankruptcy due to medical costs ; and on children . 
in fact , the other body rejected an amendment to tell customers how much it would cost in additional interest if they make only minimum payments on their credit card bills . 
it happens to be an unfortunate anniversary in my family , but on april 13 , 1988 , we said goodbye to my father . 
he was a small business owner that many on the floor of the congress today would classify as a rich american . 
because while my family was reeling from the grief of the loss of my father to a sudden heart attack 17 years ago today , also we were settling into the reality that much of what he had built , all of which he had already paid taxes on , was now subject to as much as a 47 percent estate tax . 
and we come into this well today on behalf of small business owners and family farmers just like my dad to put to an end permanently this truly immoral death tax in america . 
it has waged war on small business and family farmers all across america , and we will begin to reverse that in a permanent way today . 
let me tell you what is not on the floor . 
so that , as my colleague from west virginia talks about the concern of estate tax on small businesses and farms , that may have been more the case at that time . 
not to get technical with you , but what that does is impose capital gains tax exposure on estates . 
at a time when we are talking about how we address the long-term solvency of social security , to just , without a concern , pass a $ 290 billion bill to help three-tenths of 1 percent of the most affluent in this country seems to be standing priorities directly on their head . 
the very people that favor privatizing social security , which is going to add risk in the social security benefit , which is going to reduce benefits sharply because they change the inflation index going forward , that is going to reduce the benefits on our children and grandchildren , want to now run up the debt on our children and grandchildren in order to help that three-tenths of 1 percent , the very wealthiest among us . 
mr. speaker , i thank my colleague , the gentleman from massachusetts , for leading the debate on this important rule in this fashion . 
language like `` waging war on small business '' and the majority reason for why small family farms do not pass on , 99.7 percent have no , absolutely no estate tax under the proposal that we are advancing . 
i believe another immorality is on the floor today , and that is the immorality of privatizing social security and reducing the benefits of social security for our children and grandchildren . 
what i think we ought to have captured in this debate on estate tax is the trade-off , because they say it is just estate tax ; believe me , it is also social security . 
well , by dedicating the sums that we capture with this three-tenths of 1 percent , we could fill 40 percent of the hole on social security . 
mr. speaker , it is a privilege to carry this debate today on behalf of the minority , and a privilege to participate with the gentleman from missouri , who is one of my favorite members of the house . 
i can just imagine members in the majority , some of them that might have signed that `` no new tax '' pledge that was going around last congress , just wringing their hands because they are about to vote for a tax increase , a tax increase in the form of capital gains taxation on estates . 
trying to establish what the taxable basis on this is , which their law would require , is a nightmare . 
the cattlemen 's association , one touted as one of these that want to re-establish capital gains on estates , they say , because of its complexity , carryover base is impossible to comply with . 
so says the national federation of independent business , the very group that they have cited as trying to re-establish carryover basis in the tax code and put capital gains back on estates . 
mr. speaker , how much time remains on each side ? 
there has been some on our side that suggests the pomeroy substitute provides too much estate tax relief . 
those of my colleagues looking at this chart may not be able to see this tiny red line , because that is what three-tenths of 1 percent represent with looking at the total population , three out of 1 , 000 , and we know that on average those estates are going to average $ 15 million . 
i am proud to be a part of the committee on rules , which reported out a very balanced rule that allows both sides to be heard on this issue . 
taxes have already been paid on the assets subject to the taxation under the death tax during the lifetime of the owners . 
they eliminate the opportunity for that next generation to participate even though they worked on it themselves , growing up , paying their way through school , helping to support all of the family efforts . 
you can not afford a brand-new car , you can not afford a brand-new tractor , you can not afford all the nicer things ; but yet on paper you are quite wealthy , because you purchased land , you gave value to that land as time passes . 
mr. speaker , i urge that we adopt the rule and continue forward with the repeal of this scurrilous tax on death . 
mr. speaker , the issue before us today is certainly not a new on new one . 
small businesses and farmers , in particular , are unfairly penalized for their blood , sweat and tears -- paying taxes on already-taxed assets . 
instead of investing money on productive measures such as creating new jobs or purchasing new equipment , businesses and farms are forced to divert their earnings to tax accountants and lawyers just to prepare their estates . 
is it so much to ask that they be able to pass on the fruits of their labor -- their small business or their family farm -- to their children ? 
the fact is that they paid their taxes in life -- on every acre sown , on every product sold , and on every dollar earned . 
i commend congressman hulshof for introducing this crucial legislation and chairman thomas for his continued leadership on this issue . 
this long-overdue legislation will reform the critically-flawed bankruptcy process , and prevent affluent filers from gaming the system and passing on their bad debt to hard-working families while preserving the ability of people who truly need to discharge their debt through bankruptcy to do so . 
i commend my colleagues for their hard work on this legislation , and i strongly urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this report and help honest taxpayers by closing the loopholes in the current bankruptcy system . 
mr. speaker , this is actually one of the more absurd debates that i have ever heard in my life , and i think anybody who turns on the television and wonders what is going on here in congress will then conclude that the reason that this institution is held in so low regard is because we have debates like this . 
let us look at what is going on in america today . 
in america today we have the most unfair distribution of wealth and income in the history of our country and of any major country on earth . 
mr. speaker , we are here debating an issue that has zero impact on 98 percent of the american people . 
as my colleagues know , president bush and the republican leadership are supporting increased fees on our veterans . 
they are substantially increasing health care costs for veterans who have put their lives on the line defending this country . 
they are increasing our deficit , increasing our national debt , all on behalf of the richest people in this country . 
mr. speaker , i rise today with the gentleman from ohio ( mr. strickland ) xz4003900 to offer this motion on behalf of our brave citizen soldiers who are risking their lives for us and then , as a thank you , risking their homes and their businesses , too . 
it builds on senator durbin 's amendment to the senate bankruptcy bill which exempts from the bill 's means test disabled veterans if their debts were incurred primarily when they were on active duty or performing homeland defense duties . 
regardless of members ' position on the overall bill , we owe it to those who risk their lives and their livelihoods to prevent financial catastrophe caused by their service . 
soldiering is not their livelihood , but they take it on . 
on behalf of the dav , i ask you please keep in mind the sacrifices of the brave men and women of our armed forces as you consider s. 256 , the bankruptcy abuse prevention and consumer protection act of 2005 . 
mr. speaker , i object to the vote on the ground that a quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not present . 
mr. speaker , i ask unanimous consent that all members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on s. 256 . 
it is important to note that over the course of the last four congresses , the house has passed bankruptcy reform on eight separate occasions by overwhelming and bipartisan margins . 
that is a $ 400 tax on every household that no politician has to vote for , but gets paid anyhow . 
s. 256 will provide the tools to crack down on bankruptcy petition mills , which often misrepresent the benefits and risks of bankruptcy relief . 
it will require certain credit card solicitations , monthly billing statements , and related materials to include important disclosures and explanatory statements on a broad range of credit terms and conditions , including introductory interest rates and minimum payments . 
beginning with my colleagues in the house , i would like to mention the many contributions of the chairman of the subcommittee on commercial and administrative law ( mr. cannon ) xz4000590 for his hard work on behalf of this legislation . 
i also appreciate the contributions of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle , the ranking member of the judiciary committee ( mr. conyers ) and the gentleman from virginia ( mr. boucher ) . 
in addition , i would like to mention the following staff on the judiciary committee for their contributions : phil kiko , majority committee general counsel and chief of staff ; rob tracci , chief legislative counsel and parliamentarian ; raymond smietanka , chief counsel , subcommittee on commercial and administrative law ; perry apelbaum ; david lachmann ; matt iandoli , legislative director for representative cannon ; todd thorpe , chief of staff for representative cannon ; laura vaught , deputy chief of staff for representative boucher ; jean harmann , house legislative counsel and dina ellis , counsel for the house financial services committee . 
from her service as general counsel on the congressionally-created national bankruptcy review commission to her often behind the scenes work on bankruptcy reform legislation extending to the 105th congress , susan jensen , counsel to the judiciary subcommittee on commercial and administrative law , deserves special recognition . 
in light of the disaterous impact that bankruptcy cases like worldcom and enron have had on their employees , reforms that more than double current the monetary cap on wage and employee benefit claims entitled to priority under the bankruptcy code . 
mr. speaker , i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from utah ( mr. cannon ) xz4000590 , the chairman of the subcommittee on commercial and administrative law . 
and if this bill goes down , a corporate crook can build a multimillion dollar mansion on the intercostal waterway in florida and be able to shield that asset from bankruptcy . 
i would like to quote from page 4 of the committee report from testimony that was given by professor todd zywicki , and he said , `` like all other business expenses , when creditors are unable to collect debts because of bankruptcy , some of those losses are inevitably passed on to responsible americans who live up to their financial obligations . 
exactly how much of these bankruptcy losses is passed on from lenders to consumer borrowers is unclear , but economics tell us that at least some of it is . 
now if my friends on the other side of the aisle were so concerned about bankruptcy abuse and the fact that this bill does not deal with the problem , they could have spent the time drafting an amendment in the nature of a substitute . 
they were offered by the committee on rules and i requested the committee on rules to make such a substitute in order , but , no , all they want to do is criticize , attack and come up with no positive alternatives . 
if that is their position , then the bankruptcy tax that everybody realizes is passed on to people who pay their bills as agreed to is on their shoulders , because we are trying to stop the abuse . 
if this bill goes down , eight states and the district of columbia will continue to have an unlimited homestead exemption where corporate crooks can hide their assets from bankruptcy in a homestead and , once they get their discharge , sell that mansion and go off on their merry way . 
page 506 of the bill contains a new section on fraudulent transfers and obligations that says that anybody who creates one of these trusts within 10 years of the date of filing can have that transfer voided if such a transfer was made to a self-settled trust or similar device , such transfer was made by the debtor , the debtor is the beneficiary of the trust or similar device , and the debtor made the transfer with actual intent to hinder , delay , or defraud any entity to which the debtor was or became , on or after the date such transfer was made , indebted . 
if the other side votes this bill down , they continue on and the blame for that is on their shoulders . 
well , the people who are complaining about medical bills put a tin ear on to the testimony that has been submitted in this extensive hearing record . 
the united states trustees program , independent people who administer the bankruptcy code , collected data and made findings on medical debt . 
this is not the big problem that the people on the minority side have said it is . 
finally , we have heard about debt that has been run up by service people who are on active duty , whether it is the permanent active duty military service or guard and reserve members who have been called up to active duty . 
in the last congress , the congress enacted the servicemembers civil relief act , public law 108-189 , which gives protection to people on active duty from collection of these debts by those that they have become indebted to , and this law puts a cap on interest at an annual rate of 6 percent on debts incurred prior to a person 's entry into active military duty service . 
mr. speaker , the motion to recommit creates a blanket exemption from the bill 's needs-based test , and i do not think that that is necessary because it would exempt a wealthy debtor from the needs-based test solely based on the debtor 's military service . 
the bill also contains an exception from the needs-based test for disabled veterans who incurred indebtedness while on active duty . 
there is a cap on the interest rates of 6 percent . 
there are protections against evictions from rental property or foreclosures on mortgaged property . 
there are restrictions on cancellation of life insurance and more flexible options to allow servicemembers on active duty to terminate residential and automobile leases . 
mr. speaker , on that i demand the yeas and nays . 
because estate and gift taxes have had devastating effects on small businesses -- many of which are forced to liquidate assets simply to pay taxes ranging from 35 to 55 percent of the value of the business -- i think we need to provide significant relief in this area . 
i share their concern and believe that after passing this legislation today , we must redouble our efforts to pass legislation curbing predatory lending , and we must build on the legislation we passed during the last congress regarding identity theft . 
this is comprehensive legislation and while supporting its passage , this body should pledge strong oversight and the willingness to review its effect on bankruptcy filers and the economy at large . 
and this courage is all summoned up on behalf of the one quarter of 1 percent of american families it is designed to help . 
so it is not just a loss to the federal treasury , it is a loss to our hospitals and a loss to our universities , who are strangely silent on this bill because they are afraid of angering 1/4 of 1 percent of the families in the united states who happen to be a huge chunk of their donors . 
under their bill , more compliance work and sharp restrictions on the step up in basis . 
so this bill is an attack on working families , an attack on the middle class , and an attack on widows . 
i am on the international relations committee . 
we are waging a war on terrorism . 
allowing millionaires to pay virtually nothing on dividend income , $ 80 billion . 
eliminating the estate tax even on the richest estates , $ 290 billion . 
it is the wrong tax at the wrong time on the wrong people . 
often , individuals go on spending sprees for luxury goods and services just before filing for bankruptcy , knowing that they can wipe the slate clean and avoid paying for what they bought . 
when individuals avoid their debts when they could be paid off , the costs are passed on to america 's businesses and consumers . 
this bill will only inflict additional hardship on over a million economically vulnerable women and their families . 
107 on motion to recommit with instructions ( s. 256 ) i was unavoidably detained . 
108 on final passage ( s. 256 ) i was unavoidably detained . 
another huge tax cut or break for the less than 1 percent of the richest americans while they turn their back and cut medicaid , refuse to recognize that social security is not in crisis but needs some adjustment , cut head start , cut programs for housing , cut programs for the environment , fail to provide the promised benefits to our 140 , 000 servicemen in iraq , turn their back on all that is american to give a few dollars to the very richest of americans . 
until now there has not been a family farmer or a small business who has been unable to pass the business on to the next generation . 
i might add to my friend from missouri of his people in the lumber business , if their children can not get the first $ 7 million handed to them and then get a 50 percent down payment on the balance of the business and be given 10 years at less than 6 percent to pay off the balance of that , they are probably too dumb and would lose the business in no time at all anyway . 
so what the current law allows is so generous , and there have been absolutely no instances , not one , of a family farmer or family business being lost , decimated or put on the auction block because of the estate tax . 
it is indeed a follow on of the republican mantra , give money to the rich , give it to them in huge amounts and cut back on education , cut back on health care , do not help the environment , cut back on support for our troops and cut back on improving america 's infrastructure , all in the name of helping the few rich who may be contributors to the republican party . 
i urge that my colleagues vote `` no '' on the final bill . 
mr. speaker , in 1997 , jennifer dunn , a republican from washington , and i started this debate on the estate tax . 
it is because , as i look in the faces of these young people , you are looking at a house , a senate and an administration that has embarked since 2001 on the most radical , irresponsible financial riverboat gamble that this country has ever seen . 
mr. speaker , in pertinent part , section 202 of s. 256 , the `` bankruptcy abuse prevention and consumer protection act of 2005 , '' amends section 524 of the bankruptcy code by making the discharge injunction inapplicable to certain acts by a creditor having a claim secured by a lien on real property that is the debtor 's principal residence , so long as the creditor satisfies certain criteria . 
moreover , despite the express reference in this provision to liens on real property , section 202 should not , by negative inference or implication , be construed as limiting any rights that may have developed through existing case law , or otherwise , that permit secured creditors to send , or consumer debtors to request and receive , monthly billing statements or payment coupons for claims secured by real or personal property . 
they would not pay a dime on the first $ 7 million and only pay a portion of anything above that . 
the fact of the matter is that most of the money that is going to be taxed on that top three-tenths of 1 percent was not earned money . 
and all the while this is going on , we are not even paying america 's bills . 
mr. speaker , i am cosponsor of the death tax repeal permanency act of 2005 because this tax is an unfair burden on american families . 
these amendments would have addressed the impact that this bill would have on groups such as disabled veterans returning from iraq , single parents , families experiencing a catastrophic medical event , and people who are victims of identity theft . 
these provisions result in an unbalanced and punitive measure that will have a devastating effect on women , the unemployed , and the elderly . 
reform in this bill is skewed toward restricting the consumer 's access to relief from overwhelming debt , while making it easier on those creditors who encourage additional unwise borrowing . 
many important , common-sense amendments on subjects such as alimony , child support , exemptions for medical emergencies , and job loss , underage credit card lending , predatory lending and protection for disabled veterans , just to name a few , were all rejected by the judiciary committee . 
these credit card companies set up on the college campuses . 
some of them are now 30 , 35 years old , out of college for years , still paying on these credit cards because they allowed their minimum payments that do not even take into account all of the interest on the debt . 
it is outright unreasonable that we did not have an amendment allowed by my friends on the opposite side of the aisle to try and protect families and future young families from this kind of exploitation . 
mr. speaker , those of us who started this process 6 years or so ago in the good faith belief that there were problems with the bankruptcy system , in the sense that people were gaming the system , and felt that there needed to be genuine reform can not help but be disappointed today because , in the process , we have lost sight of the objective of reforming to do away with the sinister influences and the advantageous corruption that is going on in the system . 
because we are here on the floor with 30 minutes of debate on our side to tell the public the problems with this bill . 
small business owners and family farmers pay taxes throughout their lifetime , then at the time of death they are assessed another tax on the value of the property on which they have already paid taxes . 
this is unfair , unjust and an inefficient burden on our economy . 
he joined me several years ago in washington to highlight the adverse impact the death tax had on his family business . 
the death tax is n't a tax on just the rich , it is a tax that hurts family owned businesses -- family owned businesses that are the backbone of this great nation . 
when we make this tax repeal permanent , taxpayers will have the ability to make long-term financial plans with certainty and will have the opportunity to pass on their hard earned family businesses and farms to future generations . 
the way the system is supposed to work , the bankruptcy court evaluates various factors including income , assets and debt to determine what debts can be paid and how consumers can get back on their feet . 
do my colleagues think that was allowed to come down here on the house floor for a vote ? 
as we all know , the estate tax is scheduled to be totally repealed on january 1 , 2010 ; unfortunately , this repeal will sunset on december 31 , 2010 . 
as no one i know can accurately guess which year they might pass on to the hereafter , only one year of complete relief of the estate tax is not only cynical -- it 's bad policy . 
on the one hand , i am pleased that the house is once again taking action today to rid our tax code of this punitive measure . 
families should never have to visit the irs and the funeral home on the same day . 
our credit markets have been undermined on a daily basis because of the abuse of the existing laws . 
the act places compassionate , coherent , and common-sense reforms on the current system . 
it ensures that frivolous costs are no longer unfairly passed on to american families . 
mr. speaker , as a supporter of the bankruptcy abuse prevention and consumer protection act , i encourage my colleagues to vote for this well-balanced measure that will protect those individuals who need a fresh start while cracking down on abuse of the system . 
i thank the gentleman for his leadership on this issue . 
families should not have to visit the undertaker and the tax collector on the very same day . 
i urge all of my colleagues to act positively today on behalf of all americans and let the death tax die for good . 
one thing i have learned in the short time i have sat here is that the democrats really look at the person whom this bill would affect , and , by the way , i do not think any of them are watching this on tv right now because they are all probably at work , but they are looking at the person whom this bill would affect as someone who got up early , worked hard all his life , looked after his family , built infrastructure , saved money , put capital back into this system , provided jobs , benefits , health care for people , and the democrats look at this individual as a gift who keeps on giving . 
small business owners must be able to focus on their business . 
and in spite of all this , the death tax does not even generate that much revenue or `` windfall profit '' for the government , yes , a `` windfall profit '' for the government , while placing this huge burden on the families of this country . 
getting rid of the death tax will simplify our nation 's laws and ease the burden on our country . 
if it takes a cpa or a lawyer to figure out what one is trying to do and what burdens the government has put on them , then it is too much of a burden . 
the death tax is a burden on our economy that costs the country between 170 , 000 and 250 , 000 jobs every year . 
the rate of taxation is as high as 47 % , and this is in addition to the taxes that were already paid on the assets subject to this tax . 
i urge congress to act today to permanently repeal the death tax and ensure that our future generations will be able to carry on the heritage of our forefathers . 
the death tax is an unreasonable and unfair burden on thousands of american families , small businesses , and family farms . 
she died in july of 1986 , and shortly thereafter land was dumped on the market . 
i would like to thank the gentleman from missouri for his leadership on this issue and his good timing , for in 2 days the tax man cometh . 
for too long , the federal government has been taxing working americans , not once , not twice , but three times , on their hard-earned money . 
mr. chairman , i rise today in opposition to the rule on h.r. 1817 , the homeland security authorization act for fy2006 . 
republicans on the rules committee blocked the consideration of several amendments offered by me and my colleagues to this bill . 
last year , the 9/11 commission specifically recommended that the tsa and the congress improve the ability of screenings checkpoints to detect explosives on passengers . 
the tsa and airport operators rely on commitments in letters of intent ( lois ) as their principal method for funding the modification of airport facilities to incorporate in-line baggage screening systems . 
mr. chairman , i ask my colleagues to vote no on the rule so we can work to deploy technologies that will help our screeners do their jobs and keep the american traveling public safe . 
the amendment previously referred to by ms. slaughter xz4003780 is as follows : previous question statement on h. res. 283 -- rule for h.r. 1817 , department of homeland security authorization act of fiscal year 2006 at the end of the resolution , add the following new sections : sec . 
2. notwithstanding any other provision of this resolution the amendment specified in section 3 shall be in order as though printed after the amendment numbered 1 in the report of the committee on rules if offered by representative barrow of georgia or representative markey of massachusetts or a designee .

& lt ; p & gt ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; ( c ) a material that is highly explosive ; and & lt ; p & gt ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; ( d ) any other material designated by the secretary to be extremely hazardous . 
i also thank the committee on rules for making in order an amendment by myself and the gentleman from florida ( mr. mica ) xz4002730 that will help perfect the federal flight deck officer program . 
many , many pilots are willing to volunteer to undergo rigorous training to certify themselves as federal flight deck officers to become the last line of defense on our planes . 
there can not be an air marshal on every plane . 
my colleague , the ranking democrat on the subcommittee on aviation , wanted to offer an amendment to mandate that the taxes we are collecting from the traveling public to pay for enhanced security at the airports ; that is , to put in-line explosives detection systems at airports that do not have it across america to find explosives in checked bags , and possibly that same equipment could be used for cargo on those planes , was not allowed . 
some of it is being loaded on the plane . 
the president refused to create a homeland security cabinet-level position or department until one day when an fbi agent was spilling her guts here in washington , d.c. , to a committee and karl rove wrote out the plan on the back of a napkin . 
we are about to embark on a very new experience for us . 
we obviously have had to focus for the first time on our homeland security . 
at the beginning of this congress , we established a new permanent standing committee on homeland security , and we selected my extraordinarily able colleague , the gentleman from california ( mr. cox ) xz4000830 , to serve as chairman of the committee on homeland security dealing with jurisdictions that fell within a wide range of other committees . 
we had our committee chairmen and ranking members agree to come together on establishing this new committee on homeland security . 
it is jurisdiction which focuses on a lot of new things for us . 
the fact that when we refer to men and women in uniform on the front line , they are no longer just the men and women in our armed forces , they are now men and women who wear the uniforms of firefighters and law enforcement officers . 
we now have , because of the threat , a greater focus on border security . 
we have focused on ensuring that people who pose a terrorist threat to us are not able to get documents that have been easily fabricated in the past . 
frankly , i will say that we are continuing to work on that , and i urge my colleagues to join in cosponsoring h.r. 98 , which will help us produce a counterfeit-proof social security card so we can diminish the flow of illegal immigration with the magnet of jobs that draws people across our southern border and instead allow our border patrol , which is increased in this authorizing legislation , to focus their attention on criminals and those who pose a terrorist threat to the united states of america . 
he was a member of the select committee on homeland security . 
he was unable to serve on the committee in this congress because of the exclusivity of the committee on rules , but as the gentleman from california ( mr. cox ) xz4000830 pointed out , he is serving as the committee on rules liaison focusing on these very important new homeland security issues . 
we will be having a full 5 hours of debate on this issue , and i am pleased we made in order a democratic substitute which is 221 pages long , a full substitute which frankly includes many of the amendments that have been proposed by both republicans and democrats . 
the bill that we are going to vote on later today reduces it to $ 10 million . 
over the past several years , the gentleman from florida ( mr. mica ) xz4002730 , republican chairman of the aviation subcommittee , and i have been working on this issue . 
everyone who has studied this issue , the president , the department of homeland security , the state department , the fbi , the cia , the aviation subcommittee , the committee on appropriations , agrees that this threat needs to be addressed . 
we are going to be worried about the end of the aviation industry as we know it and devastating consequences to our economy and the american people will look at what we did on this floor today and ask why we turned our backs on the president 's request , the state department 's urgency , the committee on appropriations , the aviation subcommittee , republicans and democrats , and , most importantly , the flying public . 
i will vote for the bill , but i am hopeful that we can work together on the basis of common sense and proceed to protect the american flying public . 
ruling only a quarter of the 80 amendments offered at the committee on rules meeting does not measure well with the action that the appropriators have taken to hold the department of homeland security ( dhs ) accountable for its unfulfilled reporting requirements . 
the appropriators withheld over $ 700 million from dhs due to these requirements ; therefore , our passage of the most comprehensive and representative measure possible would equate to having conducted `` due diligence '' on our part . 
an open rule for debate on the authorization measure would have continued the spirit of true bi-partisanship . 
i joined my committee colleagues in considering this bill from its incipiency as it passed in both the committees on homeland security on april 28 , 2005 and judiciary on may 12 , 2005 unanimously by voice vote . 
furthermore , i achieved an agreement from the majority committee leadership to collaborate on addressing the mr. speaker , what the house has done this week and will do today will establish the breadth and efficacy of the entire department of homeland security . 
i want to congratulate the gentleman from california ( mr. cox ) xz4000830 and the gentleman from mississippi ( mr. thompson ) xz4004021 , ranking member , for bringing this important bill on the floor . 
i am proud to serve with them on the committee on homeland security . 
that is why i will be supporting a substitute amendment offered later today by the gentleman from mississippi ( mr. in closing , mr. speaker , let me again thank the gentleman from california ( chairman cox ) and the gentleman from mississippi ( mr. thompson ) xz4004021 , ranking member , for their hard work on this legislation . 
all were blocked by the rules committee from even the opportunity to be debated on the floor . 
the rules committee also blocked an amendment by congressmen markey and shays that would have required 100 percent check of cargo on commercial airlines . 
these are men and women who were there for us on 9/11 and now we have turned a cold shoulder to them in their time of need . 
unfortunately the rules committee did not see it this way , because they would not even give us the opportunity to debate this on the floor today . 
mr. speaker , under cover of darkness and hidden from public view , the republican-controlled committee on rules cooked up an unwise , unfair and ill-considered rule that shuts out dozens of democratic amendments designed to close dangerous homeland security loopholes that put the american public at risk . 
for example , one of the amendments would have been one made by the gentleman from connecticut ( mr. shays ) xz4003700 and myself which would have ensured that all cargo which is placed upon passenger planes in the united states was screened , so when the people in this gallery and people around the country step on planes they have to take off their shoes , their bags go through , they are screened , their bags are put in the belly of the plane , they are screened , but the cargo , the cargo , which is placed on the very same plane , is not screened . 
the people on the plane are accompanying their bags . 
the people who are sending cargo are not on the plane . 
that on a plane is where the least resistance is , in the cargo bay . 
we should not put americans on planes where the cargo has not been screened knowing that al qaeda continues to place civilian aircraft at the top of their terrorist target list . 
it is wrong for the republicans not to have a debate about this incredible , glaring vulnerability in passenger aircraft as hundreds of millions of americans put their families on planes , especially as we are nearing the fourth anniversary of 9/11 . 
the gentleman from georgia ( mr. barrow ) xz4006280 and i made a request to the committee on rules , let us debate it out here on the house floor , let us debate if we want to put any additional security protections on something , which , for all intents and purposes , has no security around it as it goes through the cities and towns of the united states . 
but the republicans say no debate on that . 
no debate on putting cargo into the bay of passenger planes that people fly every single day across america after they have taken off their shoes . 
the republican party is putting a gag on debate on the most important issues that face the security of america and attacks by al qaeda on our country . 
and this issue , especially the issue of cargo on planes , is an absolute reprehensible neglect of the responsibility that congress has for the flying american public . 
mr. speaker , the republican leadership in the committee on rules have done it again . 
last night , on a party-line vote , the republicans in the committee on rules refused to allow the house to consider two important amendments which would have improved safety on airplanes and would have notified the flying public about the safety of the airplanes they fly on . 
currently , cargo that is transported on commercial airplanes is not inspected . 
even though our passenger luggage is inspected by tsa , the cargo that is transported on those same planes is not inspected . 
the tsa has not implemented regulations as the law requires them to do to inspect the cargo on these planes , and now the republican leadership has taken direct action to prevent these inspections . 
yesterday , the gentleman from massachusetts ( mr. markey ) xz4002530 asked that the committee on rules make in order an amendment that would have required all cargo to be screened within 3 years . 
additionally , the gentleman from connecticut ( mr. shays ) xz4003700 offered an amendment that would require tsa to notify passengers flying on a plane carrying uninspected cargo , the rationale being if we are not going to inspect the cargo the flying public should at least have the right to know that they are flying on a plane with uninspected cargo . 
mr. speaker , i do not think that is too much to ask for , but the republican leadership in the committee on rules decided not to make these amendments in order . 
i asked the distinguished chairman of the committee on rules why these amendments were not made in order , and all he could say is they decided not to . 
they are no-brainers , and yet the republicans refuse to even allow us to debate and vote on these amendments . 
instead of taking action to protect the american public , the committee on rules decided to protect the interest of the airlines and the cargo shippers . 
mr. speaker , legislation on homeland security should result in a safer public . 
i am pleased to speak before the house and also for the record on the rule . 
i view , as chairman of the house subcommittee on aviation , one of the greatest threats that we face other than a suicide bomber or several of them getting on planes , which they can easily do in our flawed system today , i view the second greatest threat as shoulder-launch missiles . 
with the conflict in the world , particularly in the middle east , thousands of these shoulder-launched missiles have gone on the market . 
this bill unfortunately limits the amount of money that can be spent on moving that program forward . 
my purpose for being here on may 18 , 2005 is to remind us that they missed in kenya an israeli plane in november 2002 with many passengers . 
not that we have to hang one of these on every commercial aircraft , but we will be remiss if we do not carry this program that has already started forward . 
i look forward to working with the gentleman from california ( mr. cox ) xz4000830 and others as they take on the responsibility of protecting not only the homeland but the flying public . 
mr. speaker , i congratulate the chairman of the homeland security committee for his success last week on legislation to improve the first responder grant program and again today for bringing bipartisan consensus legislation to the house floor . 
on 9/11 aviation fuel and four commercial aircraft were turned into missiles carrying incendiary explosives . 
representatives barrow , markey , and oberstar have crafted thoughtful responses to a threat that has not been fully addressed : rail security and the transportation of hazardous cargo on our rail system . 
the focus with aviation is strictly on deterrence : stopping an event from happening . 
with the madrid bombing , the bombs went off on multiple trains over a 10-15 minute period . 
the economic consequences to a major metropolitan region would be devastating , not to mention the impact on the federal government if an attack occurred in washington , dc . 
local emergency responders in urban areas with potential targets of key infrastructure and national icons understand this threat , but are limited on what they can do to prevent an attack . 
if they exist , they are not being shared or discussed with the very people , local officials and emergency response planners , who have the best information on the local geography , vulnerabilities and potential set of targets . 
the laws on the books today did not envision hazardous cargo as a weapon of mass destruction , and under current law interstate commerce trumps local ordinances to suspend or redirect hazardous cargo . 
congress should not defer to the courts on this important and weighty issue . 
i think we can craft a responsible resolution , but denying an important floor debate on this issue is wrong . 
mr. speaker , each member of this house knows that when we go on vacation , one of the first things that we want to do is get a map so that we know where we are going and know the stops we are going to make and have a general idea of what is facing us on this vacation . 
well , yesterday , my colleagues , the gentleman from michigan ( mr. stupak ) xz4003910 , the gentleman from texas ( mr. ortiz ) xz4003020 , and myself offered an amendment at the committee on rules that would have required the department of homeland security to develop and begin to carry out a comprehensive , long-term border strategy to secure this nation 's borders . 
unfortunately , the committee on rules voted against making this amendment in order on a straight party-line vote . 
mr. speaker , by direction of the committee on rules , i call up house resolution 283 and ask for its immediate consideration . 
mr. speaker , the rule before us today is a fair , structured rule that provides for 1 hour of general debate , equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the committee on homeland security . 
it provides that in lieu of the amendments recommended by the committee on homeland security , the committee on energy and commerce , and the committee on the judiciary now printed in the bill , the amendment in the nature of a substitute printed in part a of the committee on rules report shall be considered as the original bill for the purpose of amendment and shall be considered as read . 
it waives all points of order against the amendment in the nature of a substitute printed in part a of the committee on rules report and makes in order only those amendments printed in part b of the committee on rules report . 
finally , this rule waives all points of order against the amendments printed in part b of the committee on rules report and provides for one motion to recommit with or without instructions . 
it also includes a number of other legislative and oversight measures to strengthen and improve the safety of americans here at home , including : deploying counterterrorism technologies within 90 days so that federal , state , local , and private sector officials can prevent domestic terror ; funding 2 , 000 additional border patrol agents ; assessing the effectiveness of operations at the departments of customs and border protection and immigration and customs enforcement so that spending on these programs is efficient and effective ; consolidating the current background check system , so that individuals can be prescreened by checking their names and biometric identifiers against terrorist watch lists and other criminal databases ; adopting risk-based cargo screening , and expanding the number of foreign ports where customs and border patrol agents screen incoming containers from 36 to approximately 50 ports ; improving information analysis and infrastructure protection recruiting ; improving nuclear and biological intelligence ; establishing a one-stop shop within the department of homeland security for reliable , comprehensive , and accessible open-source intelligence information and analysis ; providing better information to local leaders by requiring that any threats be communicated in a manner that limits confusion and operational conflicts ; clarifying the color-based threat system so that specific information is given directly to regions , states , localities , and private sector industries ; creating a national terrorism exercise program to coordinate and establish minimum standards for all federal , state , and local terrorism drills ; and providing for greater federal , state , and local homeland operations collaboration that needs to take place . 
by providing leadership and guidance on these issues and many others , chairman cox and his committee have provided this house with a product that i believe is effective in providing for the security of our homeland , which deserves the support of every single member of this body . 
yesterday , the committee on rules had an opportunity , virtually all day , to hear testimony from members across the aisle talk about ideas and thoughts and suggestions that they had that would make this a better bill . 
the chairman , the gentleman from california , not only listened to them but he worked with the chairman of the committee on homeland security , the gentleman from california ( mr. cox ) xz4000830 , on perfecting this bill by adding in amendments . 
mr. speaker , i am pleased to yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from california ( mr. dreier ) xz4001150 , the chairman of the committee on rules . 
mr. speaker , i yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from indiana ( mr. souder ) xz4003850 , chairman of the subcommittee on criminal justice , drug policy and human resources . 
mr. speaker , i yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from florida ( mr. mica ) xz4002730 , the chairman of the subcommittee on aviation . 
we know that we talked yesterday in the committee on rules about the canadian border and how the canadian border needs the attention that they not only deserve but also with the flow of goods and services with the economies that are affected and products and services that are denied when the backlogs occur . 
i think the committee on rules was wise in what it did . 
mr. speaker , we spoke earlier about how members provided information back and forth not only to the gentleman from california ( mr. cox ) xz4000830 and the homeland security department but also about how we were able to have a committee on rules meeting yesterday with thoughtful ideas that were presented yesterday . 
the committee on rules did a great job . 
the gentleman from massachusetts ( mr. markey ) xz4002530 and the gentleman from georgia ( mr. barrow ) xz4006280 did come before the committee on rules . 
the committee on rules did not put it in the bill , but it is not in the democrat substitute either , so the democrat leadership chose not to include that in their substitute . 
the committee on rules i believe did a fair job . 
mr. speaker , i yield back the balance of my time , and i move the previous question on the resolution . 
i want to say i am not in doubt on this issue , and i think i am right . 
first , we started to inspect the carry-on luggage , and americans thought we must be checking baggage on the belly of an aircraft . 
and we worked on an amendment , and we put and got in the bill a few years ago that there had to be deadlines for eventually inspecting all baggage that went in the belly of an aircraft . 
it simply said to tell the passenger that the cargo on this plane has not been inspected . 
but to not even allow a debate on the floor of the house about this issue ? 
i had a constituent who was on pan am 103 . 
i got the call at 11 in the morning that said she thinks her daughter was on this aircraft but 30 kids were not , 30 people were not ; and she hoped and prayed her daughter was one who could not get on it . 
i was at her home that evening about 11 : 30 that night when she got the call that said her daughter was on that plane . 
i salute the committee on rules for allowing for 25 amendments . 
mr. speaker , famed writer and political commentator george orwell once wrote that `` people sleep peaceably in their beds at night only because rough men stand ready to do violence on their behalf. '' that statement should have a special resonance for americans in today 's world . 
with such a weighty mandate , i would like to congratulate the committee on homeland security in putting together their first committee authorization . 
the terror alerts were raised on what secretary ridge himself called `` flimsy evidence '' by individuals in the administration who were really aggressive about raising it , which shows that they were used for political purposes . 
that constitutes a violation of trust with the american people , and we can not afford that in this war on terror . 
i know many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle agree on this principle , and i am pleased that the committee has seen fit to include more specific criteria for how the terror alert is and is not to be utilized . 
this funding would mark a welcome change in the administration 's approach to handling border security issues away from an economically disastrous agenda of imposing passport requirements on our citizens who want to cross our northern border and towards a more sensible policy of effective border enforcement , one which maximizes security resources and safeguards the freedoms and options our citizens and our trading partners deserve . 
the house leadership 's decision to include in this rule two amendments of mine suggests there may be room for common ground on the critical border issue after all . 
it will be smart management , and i look forward to the upcoming debate on the amendment . 
but there are many others , i know , we would all like to debate here on the floor today ; but of 89 , only 25 were ruled in order , which is less than 30 percent . 
and as i have said previously , i do wish this had been an open rule because we need to spend the extra time and we need to allow our colleagues to consider more ideas on how to improve the homeland security . 
and , incredibly , an amendment which would have required all cargo transported on commercial and passenger airplanes be inspected for explosives was not allowed . 
how could we not allow a debate on a critical homeland security issue such as this ? 
mr. speaker , i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from mississippi ( mr. thompson ) xz4004021 , the ranking member on the committee on homeland security . 
mr. speaker , i will be asking members to oppose the previous question and , if it is defeated , i will amend the rules so that we can consider the amendment offered by the gentleman from georgia ( mr. barrow ) xz4006280 and the gentleman from massachusetts ( mr. markey ) xz4002530 rejected by the committee on rules last night . 
as always , i want to emphasize that a no vote on the previous question will not prevent us from considering the homeland security bill , but will allow members to vote on the barrow-markey amendment . 
at this point , mr. speaker , i ask unanimous consent to insert the text of the amendment immediately prior to the vote , and request a no vote on the previous question . 
mr. speaker , i object to the vote on the ground that a quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not present . 
this has been a very difficult process , and as the committee on rules along with the gentleman from california ( mr. cox ) xz4000830 , the chairman of our permanent select committee on homeland security on which i also serve , this has been an incredibly difficult process from the time this committee has been organized . 
the american people want to see action on homeland security . 
i withdrew them in front of the committee on rules after talking with the gentleman from california ( mr. cox ) xz4000830 and the other relevant committees . 
this is not a commentary on the gentleman from ohio ( mr. boehner ) xz4000360 , who is doing the best he can with an organizational nightmare as we blend these things together . 
so obviously the gentleman from wisconsin ( mr. sensenbrenner ) xz4003650 has deep concerns , and we have to figure out what is going to be under the committee on homeland security and what is under the committee on the judiciary . 
similarly , a second amendment i had on intelligence that is trying to coordinate this proliferation of intelligence agencies , and we seem to create a new one every 6 months , both in congress and in the administration , one or the other of us , and we are getting all this stovepiping and no coordination which is exactly opposite of what the 9/11 commission proposed . 
i want to continue to work on this . 
it has passed the house , but the question is what falls under the committee on homeland security and what falls under defense and intelligence committees . 
this is the primary committee on homeland security . 
every year we are going to have an authorization bill on homeland security , like the other committees , and i am sure that will be spoken to multiple times today . 
today is the first step and the committee on rules has made an important first step in allowing 25 amendments , many over the objections of people who are objecting to jurisdiction , and keeping enough out that we can keep a coalition together to show the american people we want to move homeland security bills and this house will not be held up by jurisdictional fights over homeland security . 
as a ranking member of the committee on homeland security , i strongly believe this base bill is deficient in a number of significant areas . 
this 79-page bill fails to address a number of critical aspects of homeland security and does not deliver on the homeland security commitments made in the 9/11 act . 
that is why i , like many of my colleagues in the house , felt compelled to submit amendments to the committee on rules for this bill . 
all told , there were 85 amendments offered , many of them from my colleagues on the committee on homeland security . 
the rule blocks a meaningful debate on important amendments like the one the gentlewoman from new york ( mrs. lowey ) xz4002460 offered to close a major aviation security gap . 
mr. speaker , i could go on and on listing good amendments that were done so wrong by this rule . 
but instead , i will close by urging a no vote on this rule . 
these safety standards are long overdue and they deserve a vote on the house floor . 
local leaders and the american people should not have to beg for sound safety measures and they should not have to wait for a debate on the issue . 
at that time , on august 9 , 2001 , the president promised 78 stem-cell lines would be available to federal researchers , yet almost 4 years later , there are at most , only 22 lines available . 
mr. speaker , h.r. 810 would simply allow federal funding for research on embryonic stem-cell lines regardless of the date on which they were derived . 
this means researchers and scientists would be eligible to utilize their federal funds for research on a new stem-cell line as long as it met the strict ethical guidelines contained in the bill . 
i wish to thank the majority leader , the gentleman from texas ( mr. delay ) xz4001040 , and the gentleman from florida ( mr. weldon ) xz4004271 for their work on this legislation against h.r. 810 . 
first , let me say that good people can disagree on this issue . 
the bill would compel all american taxpayers to pay for research that relies on the intentional destruction of human embryos to obtain stem cells , overturning the president 's policy that supports research without promoting ongoing destruction . 
the door unlocked and i was led again into the clinic and placed on the stainless table , but the injection this time was amber colored and i immediately sensed that something was wrong . 
i said , `tesia. '' ' mr. speaker , this building was built by our founders on pillars , but not just pillars of marble . 
on august 9 , 2001 , the hope and promise of this embryonic stem cell research was greatly curtailed . 
h.r. 810 creates strong new safeguards and guidelines concerning research on human embryonic stem cells . 
some members on the other side of this debate say their constituents are opposed to their federal tax dollars being used on this groundbreaking science . 
and michelle , like millions of other americans who could be helped by this science , very much want their tax dollars spent on stem cell research . 
tomorrow we are going to vote on a bill that would expedite embryonic stem cell research . 
in view of the interest all across america and in view of the fact that tomorrow we are going to be voting on a bill , i thought it might be well this evening to spend a few minutes putting this debate in context . 
the person whether they are young or old will go on to have circulatory problems . 
the debate that we are going to vote on tomorrow and the debate which was the subject of the special order just before i spoke has to do with whether or not we can effect the needed cures in medicine from adult stem cells or whether we need to move to embryonic stem cells to make this happen . 
knowing that in identical twinning , regardless at what stage it occurs and it can occur all the way from the two-cell stage clear up to the inner cell mass and there are several stages between these two , but no matter where it occurs , the embryo has lost half of its cells and both parts go on to produce a perfectly healthy baby . 
he asked karl rove to follow up on that . 
and so the president came out with his executive order which said that federal funds could be used in research only on the cell lines that had been developed from embryos that had been killed in the process of developing them , that no new cell lines could begin with embryos that had to be killed . 
my concern , mr. speaker , is that we in congress ought to be a player in this , and now we are standing on the sidelines . 
and then the egg , called a zygote , goes on to develop , and it is two cells . 
and they then do a preimplantation genetic diagnosis on that . 
this may have been going on when i talked to the president and when i talked to nih . 
i did not know that it was going on , but just a few months ago , this report came out , and now i spent the other day , for a half-hour , probably , talking with two investigators here in virginia who are doing this . 
the argument on the other side is twofold . 
the argument on the other side is that it is immoral , that we should not take one life to support another life ; and in making those claims , they state the following : this kills human embryos . 
they argue that h.r. 810 , which is the bill we will be voting on tomorrow , is an empty promise because the embryonic stem cells have not treated a single human disease , and that is true . 
twenty-five percent of those that are still alive after they thaw , only 25 percent will go on through this development stage , through the blastula , gastrula and so forth , so they can be implanted . 
i have here a very recent report , `` alternative sources of human pluripotent stem cells , '' a white paper by the president 's council on bioethics , and the next chart shows page 25 from this . 
they are not embryonic , they have limited application , but maybe , just maybe , we could produce something that would help that person later on with a disease . 
what our bill asks for is simply federal money to do research on animals , on nonhuman primates , that is , the great apes , which genetically are remarkably similar to humans , if it works there , it probably would work in humans , to determine the efficacy and the safeness of doing this . 
i would not be here on the floor today talking about a possible solution to this debate if i did not think that this was perfectly ethical and probably perfectly doable . 
i hope , mr. speaker , that a number of my colleagues will sign on to our bill . 
on the other hand , if he lets it become law , then he is going to offend all of those prolife people who really see this as life . 
what i hope , mr. speaker , is that my bill can be on the president 's desk when he is faced with the unhappy choice that he will have with this bill , so that he can now say , gee , i have a bill which supports what i want , and that is embryonic stem cell research without harming an embryo . 
nih shares your enthusiasm on the therapeutic potentials of hesc research and thank you for your continued support of this field . 
i am also aware that you have had previous meetings with nih officials , including myself , lana skirboll and richard tasca , on this topic . 
nih would welcome receiving an investigator-initiated grant application on this topic using animal embryos . 
i have enclosed a copy of a recently released white paper developed by the president 's council on bioethics ( pcb ) on alternative sources of human pluripotent stern cells . 
it shows the ovary on one side and the fallopian tube , with the funnel-like opening here called the infundibulum . 
then it shows the fallopian tube on down to the uterus itself . 
they may be so bent on dividing that we can not control their division . 
there is a controversy going on over the potential for embryonic stem cell medical applications and adult stem cell medical applications . 
as the next chart shows , when we were talking about the potential for embryonic stem cell lines , i remembered my training of more than 50 years ago when i got my doctorate at the university of maryland and had a course in advanced embryology and then went on to teach medical school for 4 years and postgraduate medicine doing basic research at the national institutes of health . 
on the other hand , if the only way to get embryonic stem cells is by destroying an embryo , then you are left with the quandary of , is it really acceptable to destroy one life with the hope that you are going to help another ? 
he recognized that a number of embryos had already been killed , destroyed to establish stem cell lines , and since you can not turn back the hands of time to change that , these embryos were gone , the stem cell lines were there , and so the president , recognizing the potential for embryonic stem cell research , and being concerned that you should not take one life with the hope of helping another , wisely i think , said we could spend federal dollars on any exploration we chose with the existing stem cells lines , and he thought there were about 60 . 
there have never been 60 , but he was told there were something like 60 stem cell lines , and federal dollars could be used for research on those lines , but no federal dollars could be used for developing or destroying any additional embryos for stem cell lines . 
so this is the argument on the other side , which is why the great debate over h.r. 810 . 
( 2 ) the president 's council on bioethics in its may 2005 white paper : `` alternative sources of pluripotent stem cells , '' describes several potential methods to derive stem cells like those now derived through the destruction of embryos , but which would not involve doing harm to embryos . 
409j. basic and applied research on derivation and use of pluripotent stem cells without harming embryos. & lt ; p & gt ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; `` ( a ) definitions. -- in this section , the following definitions apply : & lt ; p & gt ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; `` ( 1 ) human embryo. -- the term `human embryo ' includes any organism , not protected as a human subject under 45 cfr 46 as of the date of the enactment of the respect for life pluripotent stem cell act of 2005 , that is derived by fertilization , parthenogenesis , cloning , or any other means from one or more human gametes or human diploid cells. & lt ; p & gt ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; `` ( 2 ) pluripotent stem cell. -- the term `pluripotent stem cell ' means a cell that can in principle be differentiated to produce all or almost all the cell types of the human body , and therefore has the same functional capacity as an embryonic stem cell , regardless of whether it has the same origin. & lt ; p & gt ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; `` ( b ) in general. -- with respect to producing stem cell lines for important biomedical research , the director of nih shall , through the appropriate national research institutes , provide for the conduct and support of basic and applied research in isolating , deriving and using pluripotent stem cells without creating or harming human embryos . 
and so often we think that we are carrying on a dialogue and we are really carrying on simultaneous monologues . 
on july 20 of last year , for instance , we had an extended meeting in my office with representatives from nih , with representatives from health and human services , and with representatives from the white house . 
there appeared in the literature a paper , a very interesting paper , on preimplantation genetic diagnosis . 
and more than 600 times that went on to produce a perfectly normal baby . 
a few weeks ago i spent probably a half hour or more on the phone with two of the medical scientists there who were involved in this research . 
there is one potential ethical problem here , although the president 's council on bioethics thinks it is not a problem . 
the members of the president 's , and i have the white paper here i am going to refer to in just a moment , council on bioethics think that that is not feasible . 
while we are carrying on these discussions with the white house and nih and hhs and with the outside groups , the president 's council on bioethics submits a white paper ; and in this white paper they go over four potential techniques that might produce pluripotent stem cells , which is another way of saying the equivalent of embryonic stem cells , without destroying or harming an embryo . 
because in the cytoplasm of the egg outside the nucleus of the egg , there are some factors which turn on and turn off genes and kind of control what happens inside the nucleus . 
so what our bill does is to permit the research , particularly on two of these , the nucleus transfer and the taking of cells from the early blastomere . 
stem cells , a big article , very good article on stem cells there . 
nih shares your enthusiasm on the therapeutic potentials of hesc research and thank you for your continued support of this field . 
i am also aware that you have had previous meetings with nih officials , including myself , lana skirboll and richard tasca , on this topic . 
nih would welcome receiving an investigator-initiated grant application on this topic using animal embryos . 
i have enclosed a copy of a recently released white paper developed by the president 's council on bioethics ( pcb ) on alternative sources of human pluripotent stem cells . 
sincerely , & lt ; center & gt ; james f. battey , jr. , m.d. , ph.d. , & lt ; /center & gt ; & lt ; center & gt ; & lt ; em & gt ; chairman , nih stem cell task force and director , national institute on deafness and other communication disorders. & lt ; /em & gt ; gop probes non-destructive cell research washington ( ap ) . -- embryonic stem cell research that does n't destroy budding human life ? 
right now , it 's possible only in theory , or on animals . 
senate majority leader bill frist and other gop lawmakers are considering legislation drawn from a report in may by bush 's council on bioethics , which studied research that might carry medical promise but is in its infancy . 
he clearly supported it. '' another possible compromise , being drafted by representative roscoe bartlett , r-md. , a biological engineer , would send $ 15 million to the national institutes of health for stem cell research on animal embryos , according to a draft obtained by the ap . 
`` congressman bartlett sought and received technical assistance from the administration to ensure that the bill that he is working on would be consistent with the president 's principles and goals , '' said lisa wright , bartlett 's spokeswoman . 
senator gordon smith , r-ore. , said that in his own talk with bush , he found the president `` looking for a way to stay within his ethical boundaries. '' almost two-thirds of americans say they support embryonic stem cell research and a majority of people say they would like to see fewer restrictions on taxpayer funding for those studies , according to recent polling . 
but it also would spend millions of dollars on studies whose value is speculative . 
frist , who is a heart and lung transplant surgeon , told the ap at least three of the processes on the bioethics council 's list met his criteria for funding embryonic stem cell research . 
-- turning back the clock on older cells so they again become `` pluripotent , '' the scientific term for the ability to turn into any tissue . 
`` i 'm all for these alternative sources , ( but ) not as a substitute , not as some way of stopping what we 're about to do , '' said tom harkin , d-iowa , senate sponsor of a bill already passed by the house that would end bush 's 2001 ban on federal funding for new human embryonic stem cell studies . 
`` it 's a no-brainer , '' said robert lanza , one of the scientists working on a process by which embryonic stem cells are derived without destroying life . 
a member of the president 's council on bioethics , hurlbut noted that large sections of the public believe human embryonic stem cell research is immoral because it destroys the embryo , which many , including bush and some congressional conservatives , consider a budding human life . 
1 deadline for voting on the legislation , senate negotiators were no closer tuesday to agreeing on a list of bills to debate on the senate floor . 
the house approved the harkin-specter bill , 238-194 , on may 24 . 
in physiology , and bases his proposal on a report by the president 's council on bioethics and the latest research findings . 
stem cell legislation is at risk promising but still unproven new approaches to creating human embryonic stem cells have suddenly jeopardized what once appeared to be certain senate passage of a bill to loosen president bush 's four-year-old restrictions on human embryo research . 
during the fourth of july recess , many senate republicans struggled with the question of whether the new legislation should be brought to the floor as a substitute for the house-passed bill or as a competing bill -- and if both were to come up , then how to vote on each . 
the issue will get its first formal airings at a senate subcommittee hearing tuesday and at a hill media event on wednesday at which pro-research celebrities michael j. fox and dana reeve , widow of `` superman '' star christopher reeve , will call for an immediate loosening of bush 's policy . 
bush 's council on bioethics also expressed concerns recently that such a technique may subtly harm an embryo , even if it does not kill it . 
but other conservative leaders have mixed views on whether it makes sense to pursue the new alternative therapies or to focus single-mindedly on defeating any expansion of the current policy . 
`` i have significant concerns about all the alternatives , '' said david prentice , senior fellow for life sciences at the family research council , which he said does not yet have a formal position on the science . 
mr. speaker , i ask unanimous consent that all members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks on this legislation and to insert extraneous material on the bill . 
these patients must rely on the help of strangers to donate bone marrow for a transplant . 
the bill before us today builds on the critical investments we have made over the past 2 decades with the national bone marrow registry and retools this design into a new , more comprehensive stem cell transplantation program , which will include not only bone marrow but also cord blood units . 
it was the gentleman from florida 's ( mr. young ) xz4004391 drive , when he was chairman of the committee on appropriations , and his steadfast support for the idea of a national registry for bone marrow that led to the program 's creation . 
research on adult stem cells holds the potential to develop new cures for many diseases , as well as to expand our knowledge of how human beings develop and the body works . 
the bill would authorize research on the clinical outcomes of patients who are recipients of a stem cell therapeutic product , including bone marrow , cord blood , and other such products , from a biologically unrelated donor . 
i would also like to thank the gentleman from florida ( mr. young ) xz4004391 ; the house leadership , including the honorable gentleman from texas ( mr. delay ) xz4001040 ; congressional black caucus ; the gentleman from michigan ( mr. dingell ) xz4001100 , the ranking democrat on the committee ; the gentleman from ohio ( mr. brown ) xz4000501 , the subcommittee ranking member who is here to speak on the bill ; and all of the staff who have labored on this bill . 
particularly , i would like to thank cheryl jaeger , on my left , of my committee staff , for all of her efforts . 
she has been tireless in the last several months working on this bill . 
mr. speaker , i ask unanimous consent that debate on this motion be extended by 20 minutes , equally divided between myself and the gentleman from ohio ( mr. brown ) xz4000501 . 
mr. speaker , i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from new jersey ( mr. ferguson ) xz4001320 , a member of the committee on energy and commerce . 
mr. speaker , i yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from florida ( mr. weldon ) xz4004271 , a doctor , and one of our more thoughtful members on this subject and somebody who has given a lot of time to it . 
mr. speaker , i have three willing speakers now and more on the way . 
the first vote we will have is on the cord blood and bone marrow bill , h.r. 2520 . 
i am , obviously , as one of the original sponsors of the bill , going to vote for it and encourage all the members on both sides of the aisle to vote for its . 
the next debate that we will have is on the castle-degette bill which is another form of stem cell research , embryonic stem cell . 
that issue is much more controversial , but on its own merit that bill itself deserves a serious debate . 
let us pass in a strong bipartisan fashion the smith-barton-young adult cord blood bone marrow bill , and then go on to the next issue . 
mr. speaker , i ask unanimous consent that the gentleman from texas ( mr. delay ) xz4001040 be given 45 minutes of the debate time on the pending bill . 
mr. speaker , i ask unanimous consent that all members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and to insert extraneous material on the pending bill . 
mr. speaker , i have a prepared statement i am going to put into the record on this bill , h.r. 810 , but i am going to actually speak from the heart because i think that this is a very important issue . 
most of the issues that come before this body , there is an automatic position on . 
it is an issue that deserves to be thoughtfully considered , debated , and decided on its own merit . 
now , there are many members today that believe this particular issue is an issue that they feel so strongly about , on either side , that this is an easy issue for them , it is an automatic issue . 
i come to the floor as a 100 percent lifetime voting member on prolife issues , minus one vote , in over 21 years . 
on all the votes that the prolife coalition at the state and federal levels have scored as scorable votes , my record until this year was 100 percent , and i voted the wrong way on one issue so far this year from the prolife position . 
that is why i am going to vote `` yes. '' mr. speaker , i rise to manage the time of debate on h.r. 810 , legislation designed to expand the number of sources of embryonic stem cell lines that may be the subject of federally funded research . 
when president bush announced that federal research dollars could be used for the first time on then existing stem cells , it was believed that there were at least 60 viable lines of stem cells that could be used for this research . 
it is difficult to take an ideologically pure position on this issue . 
president bush recognized this on august 9 , 2001 . 
on recognizing the profound potential benefits of embryonic stem cell research , president bush permitted for the first time federal taxpayer dollars to be spent on embryonic stem cell research . 
today , on this difficult issue , members will need to vote their consciences . 
i come to my decision on this vote because i believe in life , and in the future . 
i do not believe that we can ever accept that proposition without setting out on an extraordinary and dangerous path . 
as we move forward with debate on this bill , my only request is that my colleagues try to respect one another and the deeply held beliefs on both sides of this very complex issue . 
mr. speaker , i yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from north carolina ( mrs. myrick ) xz4002880 , who is a member of the committee on energy and commerce . 
mr. speaker , i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from california ( mr. dreier ) xz4001150 , the distinguished chairman of the committee on rules . 
mr. speaker , i yield 1 minute to the gentleman from florida ( mr. stearns ) xz4003880 , the distinguished subcommittee chairman of the committee on energy and commerce . 
mr. speaker , i yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from new jersey ( mr. ferguson ) xz4001320 , a member of the committee on energy and commerce . 
mr. speaker , i yield 1 minute to the gentleman from pennsylvania ( mr. murphy ) xz4002850 , a distinguished doctor on the committee on energy and commerce . 
mr. speaker , first of all , i want to thank the majority leader , the gentleman from texas ( mr. delay ) xz4001040 , for the tenor of the debate today and for granting extended time and making sure all points of view have been heard on this important issue . 
i respect members on both sides of this issue . 
i made sure that members of the committee i chair , the committee on energy and commerce , regardless of their position , had an opportunity to speak and put their comments on the record . 
but i also say given a choice , let us err on the side of opportunity . 
given the promise that stem cells hold , it is time to drop the limit on current stem cell lines and allow researchers to do what they do best . 
you know , i believe that everybody engaged in this debate today means well , and this is one of those great debates that we have on this floor . 
you know , there is a fact on this , also , i think we ought to look at . 
i think we should all vote `` no '' on h.r. 810 . 
mr. speaker , i thank the chairman for yielding me this time and for his leadership and the leadership of others on this debate today . 
this debate is defined in so many ways by the conscience of each member ; and as each member comes to the floor , as each member speaks , i think my colleagues can see that this debate uniquely is based on their own view of this and their deeply founded view of this . 
i do not think my friends on the other side are whipping this vote either . 
why would we have a vote on a bill like this that , based on the debate , is so important that we would not be trying to persuade members ? 
because we feel on both sides of this aisle , apparently , today that this is a matter of real conscience . 
because of that , i am firmly on the side of those who believe it is not time yet to federally fund this particular kind of research . 
i urge a `` no '' vote on this bill , mr. speaker . 
i would like to thank the chairman for all of his work in bringing this bill to the floor , and i would like to thank my leadership for allowing a vote on this important legislation . 
scientists and researchers throughout the united states are constantly reminding us that the focus needs to be on the quality of the stem cell lines available which are eligible for federal research . 
i just do n't see how we can turn our backs on this . 
i am encouraged by scientists ' claims that embryonic stem cells will allow for more research on alzheimer 's , including the possibility that they may be used to grow new brain cells to replace the brain tissue destroyed by the disease . 
today , mr. speaker , we will consider two bills that have significant bearing on the future of medicine and medical research in our country . 
i want to thank the gentleman from new jersey ( mr. smith ) xz4003801 and the gentleman from texas ( mr. barton ) xz4000180 for their work on the first of these bills . 
i mentioned we will be considering two bills today that have significant bearing on the future of medicine . 
and it is in the research area that the distinctions between these two bills takes on the greatest significance . 
smith-barton focuses on cord-blood and adult stem cell research . 
in the castle-degette bipartisan bill , it focuses on embryonic stem cell research . 
embryonic stem cell , on the other hand , can grow into any type of cell in the body , making potential use of these far more diverse and far more valuable . 
we will have an opportunity today to pass two pieces of legislation , both are important , that will deliver hope to patients whose futures depend on new answers to life and death medical questions . 
we in no way want to restrict it to just one or the other like my friends on the other side of the aisle . 
mr. speaker , i would like to share the words from the president who seems to have sent a different message than my friends on the other side of the aisle . 
president bush said , `` most scientists believe that research on embryonic stem cells offers the most promise because these cells have the potential to develop in all of the tissues in the body. '' i hear my friends on the other side of the aisle argue that we really only need cord blood stem cell research , that that will lead us to all that we need . 
and the president said about that , that `` no adult stem cell has been shown in culture to be pluripotent. '' and he said , `` embryonic stem cells have the potential to develop into all or nearly all of the tissues in the body. '' i then hear my friends on the other side of the aisle talk about research , that this is going to lead to so much more research . 
yet at the same time we have seen no increase , flat-lined spending , budgeting on the national institutes of health , something that many of us , the gentlewoman from colorado ( ms. degette ) xz4001010 and many of the rest of us , have thought we should increase spending on , medical research all across the board in all kinds of medical research . 
so when i hear my friends talk on this , i do not quite get how this will expand medical research while closing out one whole avenue of medical research and , at the same time , cutting spending on what we should be doing to move our country ahead . 
mr. speaker , i come from florida , and a lot of people think that only retirees and seniors live in florida , but i want to put a face on a couple that was very successful with in vitro fertilization . 
and when you look at the huge book of pork that comes out every single year , when we go back home and say to our constituents , would you rather have some of this money going to , for example , some foreign countries that regularly turn their backs on us , or would you like to see some significant research done from embryonic stem cells that would be disposed of , the majority of our constituents are clearly going to say , use the money for significant research . 
i would like to especially thank congressmen castle and degette for their tireless efforts on behalf of the millions of people who may benefit from enhanced stem cell research . 
i would also like to thank speaker hastert and leader delay for the debate today and for giving the 200+ cosponsors of this legislation a vote on the house floor . 
in my congressional district on the gulf coast of florida , i have had the pleasure of meeting holly , a 47-year-old mother of two . 
passage of this bill today will let the research on stem cells continue under ethical guidelines , and will provide millions of americans suffering from terminal diseases the hope that they have been denied . 
all these organizations listed on this posterboard , such as the american academy for cancer research and the american medical association , support h.r. 810 . 
i urge my fellow members of congress to vote yes on the bill 
remember that that inner cell mass that we are talking about that is taken at about 2 weeks of development , if we put that on a timeline of a human pregnancy , about 5 days later we are going to see a heartbeat on a sonogram . 
my state of california is already on the way . 
current federal policy , put into place by president bush on august 9 , 2001 , allows federal funds to be used to support research from the stern cell lines that existed on that date , but it bans the creation of additional stern cells from embryos that are stored at in vitro fertilization clinics . 
it touches on questions of human suffering , medical ethics , scientific potential , the role of government , moral considerations , and life itself . 
it was right for the leadership to allow a vote on this important bill , and it is right for the house to pass it . 
no federal funds would be used to conduct research on unapproved stem cell lines . 
if you read the vast body of research in the united states of america on this subject by people who are truly knowledgeable , you are going to learn there is more potential here than anything that has ever happened in medicine in the history of the united states of america . 
congress should never , ever turn its back on this opportunity . 
i have been in public office for over 30 years and throughout my career , i -- just like all of you -- have had the opportunity to change and improve public policy so this country may continue to flourish on the principles it was founded . 
but in the past few years , the number one topic on these groups ' minds was embryonic stem cell research . 
she is the person we are fighting for on the floor today . 
i remember very clearly the difficult decision president bush made on august 9 , 2001 and i know how careful he was to balance the needs of science with his own moral concerns . 
at the time , the compromise -- to allow federal funding for research on embryonic stem cells lines that had already been derived -- seemed quite reasonable . 
the legislation we are going to vote on today , h.r. 810 , the stem cell research enhancement act , which has the backing of the medical groups , the scientists , the research universities and the patient advocacy groups , mirrors the president 's ethical requirements . 
on the other hand , embryonic stem cells are `` master cells '' -- they have the potential to grow into any type of cell in the body , they are easier to identify , isolate , purify and grow and they are capable of continual reproduction . 
listen to what the nih has to say on this topic : human embryonic stem cells are thought to have much greater developmental potential than adult stem cells . 
we must explore research on all types of stem cells , but the reality is the only policy that is restricted is the federal embryonic stem cell policy . 
mr. speaker , i yield 1 minute to the gentleman from new york ( mr. boehlert ) xz4000350 , the chairman of the committee on science . 
remember that this research is going on at the private sector level . 
it is also going on at the state level . 
it is even going on to a degree at the federal level . 
there has been $ 60 million spent over 3 years on this research at the federal level , and about $ 625 million has been spent on adult stem cells at the federal level . 
so the research is going on at the time . 
you can argue all you want , but if you do any extensive reading on this , that is where the science is . 
mr. speaker , on that i demand the yeas and nays . 
i commend my colleague , the gentlewoman from colorado ( ms. degette ) xz4001010 , for her leadership on this issue . 
this spring , i joined my colleague , the gentleman from new york ( mr. israel ) xz4001950 , for a congressional roundtable on stem cells and on the biotech industry . 
doctors , researchers , and scientists spoke about how the president 's strict limits on stem cell research is prohibiting them from conducting the level of research that they would like to do . 
from eradicating polio to advances in diabetes , american research has been on the forefront . 
i commend my colleagues again for this bill being on the floor , and i support it wholeheartedly . 
we have not done it on humans . 
i have had the honor for 2 years of working with the gentleman from new jersey ( mr. smith ) xz4003801 on this bill , and i am a democratic sponsor on it ; and i want to thank him for his good work . 
the young man that we saw on the cannon terrace yesterday who suffered from sickle cell anemia whose life has been permanently transformed by cord blood cell technology speaks to the power of this bill . 
that is why we should vote `` yes '' on this bill and h.r. 810 . 
mr. speaker , i yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from wisconsin ( ms. baldwin ) xz4000130 , who has been a wonderful help on this bill . 
in 1995 , two members of congress , mr. dickey and the gentleman from mississippi ( mr. wicker ) xz4004320 , inserted language in the appropriations bill , which is there every year and has been there every year i have been in congress , and it says : `` no federal funds shall be used to create or destroy embryos. '' now , those on the other side of this debate say they do not think federal funds should be used for this research , even though by their own admission the majority of americans support this research . 
i assume no one on the other side of this issue would want to force everybody to give up their embryos for adoption , because clearly that would be limiting the choice that people have . 
we are on the verge of breakthroughs that will cure diseases that affect tens of millions of americans . 
in the last 4 years , it has become clear that the policy has failed on both counts . 
that is why our bill sets explicit controls on how stem cell lines can be created . 
it gives the patients for whom the embryos are created the decision on how they will be used : as now , freezing for possible future use ; discarding them as medical waste or donating them to other couples for implantation ; and if this bill passes , another option , donating them for critical research that could save millions of lives of people who are already born . 
mr. speaker , i am proud to stand on the house floor today to speak in favor of the stem cell research enhancement act , legislation which will bring hope to millions of people suffering from disease in this nation . 
the house will convene on monday at 12 : 30 p.m . 
any votes called on these measures will be rolled until 6 : 30 p.m . 
on tuesday and the balance of the week , the house will consider several bills under a rule : h.r. 810 , the stem cell research enhancement act of 2005 ; h.r. 2419 , the energy and water development appropriations act for fiscal year 2006 ; and h.r. 1815 , the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2006 . 
while it is certainly subject to change , i would expect us to consider the stem cell bill on tuesday , followed on tuesday by the energy and water bill . 
hopefully , we could finish that bill by tuesday night and start the dod authorization bill on wednesday and thursday , if necessary , and complete the week with the military quality of life appropriations bill . 
i would anticipate the same types of amendments being allowed that has been sort of tradition around here on the dod authorization bill . 
we are working with your side on a unanimous-consent request to bring the bill up even without a rule . 
hopefully , we could have a full and open debate on this very important issue . 
and it will be hopefully done under a unanimous-consent request that will be worked out with your side , probably on monday . 
i would , along with the unanimous-consent request , anticipate us working out an agreeable time , and i would expect after discussions already being held that we would anticipate the debate to start on that bill somewhere early in the afternoon and running for the length of time agreed to by both sides . 
now , this bill , sponsored by the gentleman from new jersey ( mr. smith ) xz4003801 will , for the first time , provide for taxpayer-funded research on well-developed stem cells from umbilical cords , expand federal funding in bone marrow stem cell research , and provide for the development of a national stem cell therapy database for medical practitioners and researchers . 
this is what progress is , mr. speaker , concrete , definable and based on fact , rather than speculation or a false sense of hope . 
proponents of medical research on destroyed human embryos would justify admittedly unfortunate means with the potential ends of medical breakthroughs down the line . 
that is the whole notion of what is going on here . 
mr. speaker , how much time remains on all sides ? 
mr. speaker , could i inquire as to the time on all sides ? 
for all the arguments we have heard today , scientific , ethical , political , the debate for and against the castle bill , for and against the authorization of federal taxpayer dollars to fund medical research predicated on the destruction of human embryos is in essence a question of the level of respect and dignity our government chooses to grant human life in its earliest stage . 
of course , it is not the hoped-for end of the castle bill that we oppose , nor necessarily , among some on this side of the aisle , even its destructive means , but instead the entitlement of those destructive means to federal tax dollars . 
on the other hand , better developed stem cells from the umbilical cords of newborn babies and the bone marrow of fully grown adults have led to treatments of no fewer than 67 separate diseases . 
based on this successful track record , the biomedical industry is pouring its own money into adult stem cell research . 
we all know there are no guarantees at all , but passage of this legislation does provide an opportunity for hope , hope that we will be able to turn the corner on these debilitating diseases from which so many people suffer . 
mr. speaker , this legislation will help the u.s. to move forward on our moral imperative to perform stem cell research in an ethically responsible way . 
each life is precious , and so i must follow my heart on this and cast a vote in favor of h.r. 810 . 
we are now on the threshold , we are now on the threshold of debating an issue that can bring hope to our people . 
i urge all my colleagues to vote `` yes '' on h.r. 810 . 
however , with the federal government on the sidelines , scientists are still reluctant to pursue stem cell research and the private sector is unwilling to invest in the field . 
long-term economic growth depends on productivity , productivity depends on technology , and technology ultimately depends on basic science , which is why any policy restricting federal funding for embryonic stem-cell research threatens the long-term health and vitality of the u.s. economy . 
the stem cell research enhancement act of 2005 accelerates scientific progress toward cures and treatments for a wide range of diseases while simultaneously instituting stronger ethical requirements on stem cell lines that are eligible for federally funded research . 
scientists believe a cure is on the horizon within the next 5 to 10 years . 
we will decide whether those suffering from parkinson 's , diabetes , spinal cord injuries , and others will have the greatest potential for cures , or whether they will just simply sit on the bench . 
the stem cell therapeutic and research act focuses government efforts on research with real promise , providing federal funding to increase the number of cord-blood units available to match and treat patients . 
the bill also takes on the recommendations of the institute of medicine , providing a national network that would link all the cord-blood banks participating in an inventory program into a search system , allowing transplant physicians to search for cord-blood and bone marrow matches through a single-access point . 
my answer to that is an emphatic `` no. '' it is our duty to ensure that we spend our money on things that work , and there are no therapies in humans that have ever successfully been carried out using embryonic stem cells . 
look , even the president and ceo of the juvenile diabetes research foundation , a group that is a strong supporter of destroying human embryos for research , he said , `` there have been more promising results in adult stem cells than there have been in embryonic stem cells. '' he predicted that their foundation would soon be spending more on adult cells research than embryonic research . 
private organizations like these are choosing to use their research dollars on what works , adult stem cells research . 
washington must also spend its money efficiently on what works , while representing the values of the taxpayer . 
i urge a `` no '' vote on federal funding for killing living human embryos . 
this is being done right in my community of marietta , georgia , by reproductive endocrinologists , those doctors who specialize in infertility and doing those kinds of things ; and it has been going on for 10 , 12 years now . 
for goodness sake , we put a man on the moon in 1969 . 
so this is why it is so important for our colleagues to hear from the gentleman from maryland ( mr. bartlett ) xz4000170 and to think about this , to understand exactly what he is saying , because i think it is really on point and very timely . 
i have heard people on the other side of this argument say , well , we are talking about getting these stem cells , and they are not really embryos , they are pre-embryos . 
i wanted to just kind of follow on the gentleman from nebraska 's remarks . 
most of those rebuts are against people on my side of the aisle , because this issue is clearly a bipartisan issue . 
one of the gentlemen on my side of the aisle said that we need the federal government , we need the federal government involved in embryonic stem cell research and the funding of that to provide ethical guidelines to the states . 
as the gentleman from maryland points out , there are a lot more of those little lives that are still on ice , if you will ; and the gentleman from maryland is so right in pointing out that , hey , maybe one of those would be an einstein one of these days , the next einstein . 
there may be some real smart ones remaining on ice that possibly could end up being united states senators . 
i do not think , madam speaker , that we will ever get to the point in this chamber , as much as i , and i am sure the gentleman from maryland is of the same mind-set , of wanting to do things in a bipartisan fashion with our colleagues on both sides of the aisle , this issue , this pro-life/pro-choice issue . 
as i understand the bill , it is an opportunity to encourage , with the president 's blessing , increased funding through the nih for research on nonhuman primates to make sure that this biopsy , actually it has already been done in genetic counseling studies on couples who have a really strong family history of inheritable diseases , something like hemophilia or duchenne 's muscular dystrophy where maybe if it is an adult child , it has a 50 percent chance of having one of these life-threatening , eventually fatal diseases . 
we are already doing testing on those embryos to make sure that it would be safe to put them back into the mother 's womb to grow and develop and become a full-term fetus and there has been no harm in those instances . 
so it is with a deep amount of respect for him that i have signed on to this bill . 
there will be lots of money , federal dollars probably being spent on research . 
but the point is the president in august of 2001 was absolutely right , in my humble opinion , in regard to his decision to put a moratorium on the harvesting of stem cells , embryonic stem cells that would result in the destruction of human life . 
the president , this president , george w. bush , is the very first president that , in fact , allowed federal funding for research on embryonic stem cells . 
so that is why this issue is so important and why i feel so very passionate , not just myself and the author of this bill , the gentleman from maryland ( mr. bartlett ) xz4000170 , but a number of others who have signed on to this bill . 
we are on to something here . 
and again it is a pleasure to join my colleague tonight and share these thoughts , try to maybe enlighten my colleagues on both sides of the aisle , madam speaker ; and i do thank the gentleman for giving me an opportunity to be with him to discuss such an important issue . 
and i will be glad to stick around for a little while if we want to get into a colloquy later on , but i thank him for giving me this opportunity . 
undoubtedly , each of us on this floor today has a friend , family member or neighbor who could benefit from increased embryonic stem cell research , whether they suffer from spinal cord injury , alzheimer 's , ms or juvenile diabetes . 
as we consider both the castle/degette stem cell bill and the smith legislation on umbilical cord stem cells , it is important we differentiate between the effects of these two bills . 
the castle/degette bill will expand research on embryonic stem cells , which would have the ability to reproduce indefinitely and to evolve into any cell type in the body . 
we can not take away that hope by shutting the door on federal research on embryonic stem cells . 
slamming the door on stem cell research slams the door in their faces . 
today , congress has the opportunity to capitalize on breakthrough scientific research to help millions across our country . 
real political courage and leadership -- on both sides of the aisle , in the house and senate -- was required to bring us to this point . 
it is important for congress to fund research , but it is especially important for this congress to fund responsible research and that is the research supported on this bill on adult stem cells . 
this list on the left on this chart shows all the different treatments currently using adult stem cells . 
on the right is the list of success with embryonic stem cells . 
and just as we do not place ethical burdens on the children who were conceived through ivf , we should not place ethical burdens on the millions of americans suffering from parkinson 's , alzheimer 's , diabetes , et cetera . 
i support the additional research on adult stem cells provided for by h.r. 2250 , but this legislation is not a substitute for h.r. 810 and its emphasis on embryonic stem cell research . 
embryonic stem cells have a unique ability to develop into any type of cell as they mature , offering scientists tremendous insights on the replacement of damaged cells and organs , the mechanics of life-threatening diseases , and the testing and development of new drugs . 
adult stem cells , on the other hand , have not shown this ability to differentiate into specific types of cells , have not yet been identified in all vital organs , and are difficult to identify , purify , and grow . 
the passage of h.r. 810 will further empower and equip california scientific institutions to undertake cutting-edge research on the most pressing medical challenges of our day . 
let us make no mistake , the development of lifesaving medical procedures has been slowed by an unwarranted restriction on stem cell research . 
the defense authorization bill , mr. leader , do you expect at this point in time to have that on a particular day of the week ? 
all of us want to make sure that we have our ideas on how we can best strengthen our efforts in that bill . 
mr. leader , the stem cell research legislation you indicate will be on tuesday . 
i know that our leader and your office are working on that unanimous consent and the parameters of the consideration of , as you point out , a very , very important bill . 
there are obviously different points of view on the legislation . 
i think all members will want to make sure that that time frame in which it will be considered , they will be available to be on the floor or be watching the floor debate with the ability to come to the floor to offer their thoughts . 
the happy circumstance is we both certainly agree on this procedure , that it needs to have a thorough airing and debate and discussion . 
there are strong views on either side of this issue and quite obviously the consequences of this bill are very substantial . 
i thank the leader for that observation and hopefully we can , in fact , move on that . 
mr. leader , i would simply observe on our side and , frankly , on your side that the senate number is a number that i think our committee certainly and this house could well approve . 
i know the president does not like that number , but very frankly , as the gentleman knows , our own committee almost unanimously on voice vote passed out an authorization figure at , i think , 375 , so $ 80 billion more than the senate-passed bill . 
as a matter of fact , i voted to override a number of vetoes that the previous democratic president disagreed with us on . 
mr. speaker , i thank the gentlewoman for yielding and want to congratulate the gentleman from delaware ( mr. castle ) xz4000700 and the gentlewoman from colorado ( ms. degette ) xz4001010 for her leadership and his leadership on this bill . 
this important legislation simply expands the current federal policy of allowing federal funding for research on stem cell lines derived after the arbitrary date of august 9 , 2001 , from embryos created for fertility treatment that would otherwise be discarded . 
recall that on that date , president bush announced that federal funds would be available to support research on human embryo stem cells so long as such research was limited to existing stem cell lines . 
it is , however , i think , an issue that the american people have made a judgment on . 
we have talked much about life on this floor . 
and number two , this bill tramples on the moral convictions of an awful lot of people who do not want their tax dollars going to be spent for killing innocent human life . 
on the contrary , it is of transcendent importance that there be in this chaotic world one high spot , however small , which is safe against the deluge of immorality and savagery that is sweeping over us . 
her inspiring story was made into a movie on a & amp ; e and was directed by the late christopher reeves . 
i have worked with her to raise public awareness of the importance of stem cell research , and under the unanimous consent agreement , i am including an essay that brooke wrote on the issue in the congressional record . 
as everyone here knows , on august 9 , 2001 , president bush announced that embryonic stem cell research would be limited ; he limited federal funds by limiting eligible lines for research . 
the stem cell research enhancement act would expand research on embryonic stem cells by increasing the number of lines stem cells that would be eligible for federally funded research . 
today , i am introducing a resolution that expresses the sense of congress that the federal government should not infringe on states or private organizations that fund embryonic stem cell research . 
yet , despite this underlying and widely accepted notion of several voices speaking on behalf of many , this does not always appear to be the case and , in fact , those making collective decisions can become inextricably linked to their own , myopic ideology , failing to understand the situations of others or hear their voices . 
that accident left me paralyzed from my neck down and dependent on a ventilator for every breath i take . 
when we place our hopes and visions for our world into the hands of those making broad decisions , we do it with the belief that they will act on behalf of our best interest and not on an isolated viewpoint . 
this forces millions to wonder things like , `` if i could be freed from the on august 9th , 2001 , from his ranch in crawford , texas , president bush announced that he would significantly limit federal funds to stem cell research , only agreeing to fund research conducted on to stem cell lines already in existence at the time . 
according to this limitation , federally supported research could be done on no more than 78 existing genetic cell lines , although even the most optimistic estimates of viable cells were estimated to be far fewer , less than two dozen . 
california , with its proposition 71 , has been the most recent state to make substantive progress on the issue , passing a referendum to support research conducted in the state . 
to rob the stem cells of their other potential of life , which is to cure diseases or to help regenerate parts of the body that are not regenerating on their own , is really to devalue life in another , otherwise avoidable way . 
well , others have argued , is n't the work done on stem cells just the same as cloning ? 
just as we can not separate the pledge and the flag , let us unite today and vote unanimously on these two outstanding initiatives to support american stem cell research , and to save lives . 
mr. chairman , i rise this morning in support of the `` stem cell therapeutic and research act of 2005. '' this measure , sponsored by christopher h. smith , joe barton , and artur davis would promote research on a type of stem cell , known as an adult stem cell , taken from umbilical cord blood . 
i ask for a `` yes '' vote on h.r. 810 simply to save lives . 
finally , the measure requires hhs to report annually to congress on the activities carried out under this bill . 
acting on behalf of scientists around the country , the nas last week issued stem cell research guidelines that should become a blueprint for ethical behavior in both the public and private sector . 
kudos to the national academy of sciences for ably filling the breach caused by the absence of federal guidelines on human embryonic stem cell research . 
while we prefer that rules governing research on human tissues be federal and enforceable , the national academy of sciences ' new voluntary guidelines are a necessary stand-in . 
it builds on the president 's policy by merely allowing the use of embryonic stem cells created for fertility purposes to be donated with permission , but without payment , by the woman for research , research to cure some of the terrible diseases that plague our lives . 
now , we have heard a lot of discussion on the floor today about destroying these cells as taking life and , as a matter of conscience , this is a complicated issue and one on which we disagree . 
so i ask each of my colleagues to think carefully in conscience when life does begin ; and , on that issue , your vote on this bill rests . 
we must support our research institutions as they embark on the ethical , expert and very , very necessary trials . 
if we see the benefit to permitting research on 78 , then the argument is not embryonic research -- but rather numbers . 
in my district case western reserve university , the cleveland clinic , and university hospital have embarked on a monumental and groundbreaking project to establish the national center for regenerative medicine . 
within the walls of these three institutions lie perhaps some of the most advanced and prolific members of the scientific research community on regenerative medicine . 
while this research is basically focused on adult stem cell and umbilical cord research , we must continue to move forward with research in a responsible , compassionate , and humane way . 
what concerns me , as someone who cherishes life and is a strong supporter of medical research for epilepsy , for diabetes , for spinal cord injury , for alzheimer 's , for so many debilitating diseases , is that this bill seems to be on a very fast track . 
it is moving through this congress at record speed and not under the normal procedures we depend on to make informed decisions . 
today i rise with more questions than answers on this bill . 
but i know one thing : on a matter of life and death , congress should proceed carefully , thoughtfully and in an informed manner . 
i am not yet confident that this institution has allowed for full dialogue to develop on a matter of such gravitas . 
i ask myself , why is the normal committee process subverted on a matter of such consequence ? 
where is the committee transcript that will tell us the diverging views of scientists on the potentiality of adult stem cell versus embryonic stem cell to improve life ? 
where is the committee transcript that reveals to the majority of members not on the committee the ethical questions that we and every family should be addressing concerning the proprietary nature of the dna in any embryonic cell ? 
on a matter of such magnitude , where some human embryos will be destroyed in the hope that new cures are made possible , the congress needs to be more responsible . 
i ask my colleagues to vote `` no '' on the degette-castle bill and remand it back to committee . 
it saves lives , it prolongs life , and it helps unhealthy people remain existent on this earth . 
i urge all of my colleagues to support this bill and h.r. 810 `` stem cell research enhancement act '' introduced by representatives mike castle and diana degette that would lift bush 's 2001 ban on the use of federal dollars for research using any mew embryonic stem cell lines . 
i believe that we as the leader of the free world must provide important leadership on the ethical parameters , the ethical constraints that this research requires . 
this bill would expand the current federal policy on embryonic stem cell research by allowing federally funded research on stem cell lines derived after august 9 , 2001 , while implementing strong ethical guidelines to ensure federal oversight of the research . 
i ask myself this question : if we are going to deal with this debate on embryonic stem cell research , what are the ethics of this ? 
one can go to google and do a google search on permissible medical experiments . 
and i did that , and i found that there is a list of 10 things that have to be qualifiers for permissible medical experiments on human beings . 
this legislation appeals to hope , but it insists on caution as well . 
by permitting research only on excess embryos created in the in-vitro fertilization process , and by establishing a clear , voluntary consent process for donors , h.r. 810 meets this responsibility . 
in 2001 , president bush announced that for the first time federal funds could be used to support limited research on human embryonic stem cells , specifically `` existing stem cell lines where the life and death decision has already been made. '' under this policy , only 78 embryonic stem cell lines are eligible for use and according to the national institutes of health ( nih ) , only 22 of those lines are viable for human research . 
there are deep and profound moral and philosophic issues surrounding the research , but our government should be very cautious about coming down on the wrong side of science , especially when the scientific endeavor is designed to lengthen and ennoble life . 
a number of those lines have developed genetic mutations which will make research on them useless . 
the bill also implements strong ethical requirements on stem cell lines that would be eligible for federally funded research . 
nih said that u.s. scientists are falling behind because of the bush 2001 limitations on stem cell research . 
elizabeth nable of the national heart , lung and blood institute said , `` because u.s. researchers who depend on federal funds lack access to newer human embryonic stem cell lines , they are at a technological disadvantage relative to researchers funded by california , as well as investigators in asia and europe . 
dear representative lofgren : we are writing to express our support for changing federal policy on human embryonic stem cell research to allow an expansion in available cell lines . 
as you probably know , a vote on legislation that would alter current policy is expected in the coming weeks , and we urge your `'yes '' vote . 
please support scientific advancement and the possibility of new cures by voting `` yes '' on h.r. 810 to expand federal stem cell research policy . 
i also sit on the committee that funds the national institutes of health with the gentleman from florida ( mr. weldon ) xz4004271 . 
but as i sit on that committee and we hear the testimony , one after another , of people who are suffering , who have lost their loved ones , who are on the verge of losing another loved one , look at the 200 major groups who are supporting this legislation . 
this legislation retains the current restrictions on creating human embryos for the purpose of research . 
with the appropriate guidelines in place , we are closer than ever to remarkable discoveries and on the brink of providing hope to millions of individuals who otherwise have none . 
i urge my colleagues to vote `` yes '' on h.r. 810 . 
mr. speaker , i have never seen such a well-attended debate , which shows the importance of this issue ; and i rise today on behalf of my father who died of parkinson 's disease . 
i also rise today on behalf of the millions of americans like me who have watched their loved ones battle the ravages of some dreaded disease . 
as a founder and co-chair of the congressional working group on parkinson 's disease , i support this legislation that will expand the number of stem cell lines that are available for federally funded research . 
i have been persuaded by directors at the national institutes of health who have spoken out against the white house policy on stem cells . 
juvenile diabetes , lou gehrig 's disease , spinal cord injuries will wreak havoc on the daily lives of millions of american families . 
there was no in vitro fertilization or stem cell research when jesus walked on the earth . 
we are left to make the decision on our own . 
this is a perfectly good values judgment on which everybody should vote `` yes . '' 
and in my home state of massachusetts , viacell and new world laboratories , two small biotech companies , have made notable progress in their research on spinal cord injuries and tissue regeneration . 
with federal support , this research could have a real and tangible impact on millions of lives in this country . 
our nation 's current policy severely limits scientific research , and we must not continue on this dangerous course . 
this bill only allows for research on embryonic stem cell lines retrieved from embryos created for reproductive purposes that would otherwise be discarded . 
i just do n't see how we can turn our backs on this . 
i just really ca n't bear to lose any more. '' let us not turn our backs on this important research and the 128 million americans who could benefit from it . 
this bill allows funding of research on stem cells that are harnessed from fertility clinics . 
not only are our hospitals , research facilities , and institutions of higher learning on the cutting edge of conquering disease , they are also major economic drivers keeping us competitive in the global economy and employing tens of thousands of people . 
if we continue the current ban on stem cell research , it does not mean that research will stop elsewhere . 
but it would put america -- the world 's most powerful engine of innovation and progress -- on the sidelines . 
embryonic stem cell research is necessary in discovering the causes of a myriad of genetic diseases , to testing new drug therapies more efficiently on laboratory tissue instead of human volunteers , and to staving off the ravages of disease with the regeneration of our bodies ' essential organs . 
president george w. bush 's policy on stem cell research limits federal funding only to embryonic stem cell lines that were derived by august 9 , 2001 , the date of his policy announcement . 
what is even more disturbing is the fact that there are at least 125 new stem cell lines , which are more pristine than the lines currently available on the national institutes of health registry , which are ineligible for federally-funded research because they were derived after august 9 , 2001 . 
the stem cell research enhancement act does not change the current policy on the use of federal funds ; this measure simply seeks to lift the cutoff date for lines available for research . 
h.r. 810 will also strengthen the ethical standards guiding the federal research on stem cell lines and will ensure that embryos donated for stem cell research were created for the purposes of in vitro fertilization , in excess of clinical need , would have otherwise be discarded and involved no financial inducement . 
now i have no doubts about the compassion and convictions of both sides on this issue , but i take issue with the direction of their convictions , because in the end a life without a name is still a life . 
when i see these little children , i know their intrinsic value ; and how we treat people , in whatever form of development , depends on how we perceive them . 
there is no ban on research for the limited number of ivf embryos on which such research would even be possible . 
this debate is about federal tax dollars and whether these dollars should be spent on the destruction of embryos , which i do not support . 
i would ask my colleagues to recall the reason why we do not conduct scientific research on federal death row inmates . 
by all accounts , death row inmates are not innocent lives -- but we do n't conduct destructive experiments on them because it would be ethically reprehensible . 
but that 's how the bill will be sold on the floor today . 
h.r. 810 is merely the first step in an effort to spend federal money -- not only on the destruction , but on the creation of cloned embryos for research . 
mr. speaker , the debate on stem cell research challenges all of us to think carefully about the value we place on human life . 
none of us has the right to legislate our religious beliefs and impose them on others . 
mr. speaker , the issue of embryonic stem cell research places humanity on the frontier of medical science and at the outer edge of moral theology . 
on the side of science there is much hope , even expectation that extraordinarily effective therapies will be developed due to a wide range of maladies from diabetes to parkinson 's , spinal cord injury and a host of others . 
but i can not get over the moral theology underpinning of this extraordinary research on the frontier of science that we are tinkering with human life . 
i do not have that depth , but i would just like to reflect on the dilemma that many members will be placed in tomorrow as we decide on this particular vote . 
there are many who have parents or others with parkinson 's or alzheimer 's and lou gehrig 's disease and so on . 
we have heard that 400 , 000 embryos are going to be discarded anyway , and on and on and on . 
yet , on the other side of the argument , as the gentleman has amplified so well , there are some other dilemmas . 
obviously , we would not take a 2-year-old and do any harm to that child ; we would not experiment on that child . 
there is no restriction on private funding on embryonic stem cell research . 
then i guess the last thing that i would mention is that there is the ethical question , should we use public funds in doing research that is so divisive , that has so many people on both sides of the fence ? 
of course , that removes the dilemma on both sides . 
thus , scarce resources will be allocated according to who has the most effective lobby rather than allocated on the basis of need or even likely success . 
i served for many years , probably 10 , on the labor-hhs subcommittee which funds the national institutes of health . 
it is difficult to imagine that now , but they were against in vitro fertilization and considered it not to be on high moral ground . 
but this should be happening all over the country , and it should not depend on the local initiative of the state . 
while i have the utmost respect , and the gentlemen know i do , for those who oppose this bill on moral grounds , i believe faith and science have at least one thing in common : both are searches for truth . 
i urge all of my colleagues to support this bill , thank all of our colleagues on both sides of this issue for their very dignified approach to how we are dealing with this legislation today , but also say that today is a historic day , that the gentleman from delaware ( mr. castle ) xz4000700 and the gentlewoman from colorado ( ms. degette ) xz4001010 have given us the opportunity to move forward , again to answer the prayers of america 's families , to meet their needs , to allow the science to use its biblical power to cure ; and for that i am deeply in their debt . 
as we begin this debate , i am confident we will hear the supporters of this bill argue in the name of president ronald reagan , that somehow this research is consistent with his long-held views on the sanctity of life . 
physicians on our side of the aisle will make the case for the ethical alternative of adult stem cell research , and congress today has already voted to greatly expand funding in this area . 
sadly , embryonic stem cell research is completely legal in this country and has been going on at universities and research facilities for years . 
this morning on capitol hill i was surrounded by dozens of `` snowflake babies , '' some 81 children who were born from frozen embryos , the throw-away material we will hear about today . 
there are 20 others like this child here in town today -- the `` snowflakes '' -- babies who developed from embryos given by their biological parents to a couple unable to conceive on their own . 
zara is living proof that advocates of h.r. 810 are wrong on this issue . 
i am voting for this legislation with the face of ashley dahly on my mind . 
ashley is north dakota 's delegate for children 's congress through the juvenile diabetes research foundation , taking place here in washington on june 18-22nd . 
embryonic stem cell research is an extremely difficult issue , involving the potential for critical medical breakthroughs on the one hand , and very complex bio-ethical issues on the other . 
the bill requires that research only be conducted on stem cells derived from embryos created for fertility treatments that were in excess of the need of the mother and would otherwise have been destroyed . 
as another leading researcher said , `` this limit on research has stunted progress on finding cures for a number of fatal and debilitating diseases. '' mr. speaker , it is too late for my beloved mother who was totally debilitated by alzheimer 's disease which killed her . 
it is too late for my cousin who died a tragic , cruel death from juvenile diabetes while still in his 20s ; but it is not too late for the 100 million other american people counting on us to support funding for life-saving research on embryonic stem cells . 
let us not turn our backs on these people . 
as another leading medical researcher said , `` this limit on research has stunted progress on finding cures for a number of debilitating and fatal diseases. '' mr. speaker , the scientific evidence is overwhelming that embryonic stem cells have great potential to regenerate specific types of human tissues , offering hope for millions of americans suffering from debilitating diseases . 
but it 's not too late for 100 million other american people counting on us to support funding for life-saving research on stem cells derived from donated surplus embryos created through in vitro fertilization . 
let 's not turn our backs on these people . 
the real heart of this argument is whether something so innocent should be killed and whether americans should pay to facilitate the government-sanctioned experimentation on human life based upon a prospect , based upon a maybe , based upon a possibility , based upon the potential . 
i say stand fast against the secret pollsters and vote `` no '' on this legislation . 
those of us who have long supported the increased accessibility and possibilities of ethical stem cell research appreciate the opportunity the leadership has granted us by allowing a vote on this legislation today . 
i urge all of my colleagues to vote in favor of h.r. 810 , not only because u.s. based researchers deserve to be at the forefront of the development of promising new treatments , but also for all of our constituents , friends , and family members who are counting on us to support the effort to find cures for so many different diseases and illnesses . 
stem cells are relatively new on the research scene ; it was only in 1998 that the techniques were developed to isolate stem cells from humans , and we have a lot to learn about how to make the cells develop in the ways that will be essential for therapeutic application . 
keirstead 's cells are on the federally approved list . 
imagine the progress that could have been made with , 100 labs working with embryonic stem cells on not only spinal cord injury but alzheimer 's , parkinson 's , diabetes , and so many others . 
stem cell research is a medical issue , one that should and fortunately does transcend political lines and instead focuses on human lives . 
there are limitations on the usefulness of adult stem cells when compared to embryonic stem cells . 
this is a contest between us as a society and disease. '' i hope my colleagues will vote `` yes '' on this bipartisan legislation . 
their work and dedication on this legislation has been tremendous and praiseworthy . 
but this must complement , not substitute , scientific research on embryonic stem cells -- which is much more promising and will yield to advancements in the prevention and treatment of almost every disease american families face . 
the united states must be on the cutting edge of this important research . 
mr. speaker , i thank my good friend for yielding and for his leadership on this bill and for cosponsoring it , along with the gentleman from alabama ( mr. davis ) xz4000921 on the other side of the aisle for his leadership over the last 3 years as we crafted this legislation . 
it is finally on the floor after almost 3 years of work ; and again i thank my friend , the gentleman from alabama ( mr. davis ) xz4000921 for his leadership . 
amazingly , we are on the threshold of systematically turning medical waste , umbilical cords and placentas , into medical miracles for huge numbers of very sick and terminally ill patients who suffer from such maladies as leukemia and sickle cell anemia . 
the new program created in our legislation is named for our distinguished colleague , the gentleman from florida ( mr. young ) xz4004391 , because of all of his great work on bone marrow transplantation over the last 2 decades . 
that is not too surprising , i say to my colleagues , when you simply read the published literature on the flexibility of cord-blood stem cells . 
last month , celgene corporation announced that cord-blood cells `` are `pluripotent ' , or have the ability to become different types of tissue. '' so we are just on the beginning of realizing the vast potential of what was formerly medical waste and has now been turned into these medical miracles . 
let me just say to my colleagues that this idea that research on bone marrow and cord-blood stem cells has been researched on for decades and that embryo stem cells have only been researched for a short time is ludicrous and an unfair attack on cord-blood stem cell research . 
mr. speaker , i just want to make the point that some misinformation perhaps inadvertently is being spread on this floor , that these stem cells that are derived from cord blood only have a blood application . 
mr. speaker , on that i demand the yeas and nays . 
let them be adopted , not killed and experimented on . 
my patients and i relied on past research done by many good scientists striving in an ethical manner to end the harsh realities of so many diseases . 
the ultimate decision on what happens to unneeded embryos should be up to that fully informed family , and fully informed consent is part of this bill . 
as chairman of the government reform subcommittee on criminal justice , drug policy and human resources , i sent a letter to the director of the national institutes of health in october , 2002 requesting a detailed report providing comprehensive information about the medical applications of adult and embryonic stem cells . 
finally , let me be clear : there is no `` ban '' on embryonic stem cell research . 
do not tell my constituent don reed and his son roman , who is paralyzed from a high school football accident , that scientists working on stem cell research in california will not be able to collaborate with the nih . 
frankly , mr. speaker , i do not need a lecture from the majority leader on moral and ethical leadership . 
i stand proudly with millions of americans on behalf of this country 's tradition of scientific leadership , and i urge a `` yes '' vote for h.r. 810 . 
i also notice that there is no cbo estimate on this legislation h.r. 810 . 
nearly 4 years ago , in august 2001 , president bush announced his executive order limiting federal funding to studies on existing cell lines . 
the least that we can do is prevent the further spending of taxpayer dollars on these ill-advised experiments . 
on april 21 , 2003 , nih scientists reported that for the first time , `` baby '' teeth , the temporary teeth children begin losing around their sixth birthday , contain a rich supply of stem cells in their dental pulp . 
the enthusiasm is based on followup studies , in which the researchers implanted the human adult stem cells into rodents and found most of them had differentiated into a mixture of periodontal ligament -- including the specific fiber bundles that attach tooth to bone -- and the mineralized tissue called cementum that covers the roots of our teeth . 
regrettably , this discussion will only last a few hours on the floor of the house of representatives today . 
there have been no hearings on this bill or on the previous stem cell bill . 
it is my hope that families , individuals , couples and our children will have a discussion on human life and when it begins . 
instead , this will only be discussed for a few hours on the house floor . 
the other body has just gone through public , political , and senatorial debate on the use of a filibuster in our democracy . 
yesterday in a news show , the commentator asked me why not allow stem cell research on discarded medical waste . 
but where do we draw the line on medical research and say we as a nation , we as a people will not cross that line ? 
i ask these questions because h.r. 810 is silent on these issues . 
yet their legislation is silent on the ethics , other than subsection c that directs the secretary of hhs to create guidelines within 60 days . 
two presidential bioethics advisory panels have given us differing guidance on when and how research should be conducted . 
i know many members on both sides of the aisle , of all political philosophies , have struggled with questions of morality , questions of life and questions of faith this past week . 
the national institute of health spent $ 24 million on embryonic stem cell research in fiscal year 2004 , the last year that data was available . 
recognizing this , the national institutes of health spent $ 568 million in fiscal year 2006 on adult stem cell research . 
there is no room for shades of gray on this issue . 
again , 58 conditions are being treated using placental and adult stem cells , and we can not begin to imagine the promising new treatments and drugs on the horizon . 
mr. speaker , as this debate has gone on , and it has been a good discussion here today , i think it is worthwhile to come back to where we are on this whole issue here . 
mr. speaker , i have one more speaker and then i plan on closing . 
`` based on our findings we believe these newly discovered stem-cells may have the capacity to generate into most tissue types in the human body . 
but where do we draw a line on medical research and say we as a nation , as a people , will not cross that line ? 
vote `` no '' on h.r. 810 . 
on sunday , tambrie turns 47 . 
tambrie lives on borrowed time and worries about losing her sight and not being able to see her grandchildren grow up . 
congressional oversight on this ethically sensitive issue is the right balance to ensure that our nation remains diligent in our approach to medical research , while taking important steps to improve the quality of life for those who suffer from debilitating diseases . 
today we are asked to sear our conscience and harden our heart towards human life so we can experiment on fertilized human embryos because we are told it holds such great promise . 
the remarks made on the floor today by my colleagues have reflected the difficulty in dealing with this issue , as many members wrestle with their beliefs and emotions . 
most familiar with this issue know that in august 2001 , president bush announced that federal funds for the first time would be used to support research on human embryonic stem cells . 
he says : `` presently , only the few lines established prior to the date , '' this is in reference to the president 's initial plan back in 2001 , `` are eligible for government support , a prohibition that has had a crippling effect on researchers in this emerging field. '' it further says , it relates to the cord bill , in essence : `` it seems extremely unlikely that adult blood cells or blood cells from the umbilical cord will be therapeutically useful as a source of anything else but blood. '' mr. speaker , there are few families that i know that have not been impacted by a myriad of these diseases . 
the latest tempest has emerged from remarkably modest congressional legislation , proposed by republican michael castle and democrat diana degette and scheduled for a vote today , which would permit federal funds to be used on human embryonic stem cell lines derived after aug . 
presently , only the few lines established prior to this date are eligible for government support , a prohibition that has had a crippling effect on research in this emerging field . 
consequently , conservative stem cell opponents have now begun to argue in earnest that embryonic stem cell research is not just morally wrong , but also unnecessary , an argument that relies on suspect science and appears motivated by even more questionable principles . 
thus , relying on adult stem cells to generate replacement insulin-producing cells for patients with diabetes is probably an exercise in futility . 
if conservatives believe their own rhetoric , they should vigorously critique embryonic stem cell research on its own grounds , and not rely upon an appeal to utilitarian principles . 
human embryonic stem cell research represents one of the most important scientific frontiers , and also one of the most controversial : our national debate on it deserves to be informed by our loftiest ethical aspirations -- but also grounded in our most rigorous scientific standards . 
mr. speaker , i commend the chairman of the committee on energy and commerce and his staff , as well as the gentleman from new jersey ( mr. smith ) xz4003801 , for their diligent work on bringing this very , very good bill to the floor of the house . 
just yesterday i was flying up here , and as i often do , i grabbed some medical journals to read on the plane . 
i was reading the may 19 issue of the new england journal of medicine and , lo and behold , another research article , this one on transplantation of umbilical cord blood in babies with infantile krabbe 's disease , a rare disease , a terrible disease , the babies die ; and this cord blood study shows if you catch it early , you can actually cure these kids . 
but i just want to clarify on the cord blood , it has been used to treat leukemia , adrenoleukodystrophy , burkitt 's lymphoma , chronic granulomatous diseases , congenital neutropenia , digeorge 's syndrome , fanconi 's anemia , and these are just some of them , gaucher 's disease . 
the list goes on and on . 
he said , we will not allow any more federal funds to be used that involve the killing of human embryos , but we will allow research to proceed on the existing cell lines . 
and i sit on the committee that funds this . 
meanwhile , on the adult stem cell line it is breakthrough after breakthrough after breakthrough . 
mr. speaker , i thank the gentleman for yielding time to me , and i commend the gentleman for his leadership on this issue . 
mr. speaker , it takes us to a very important part of this debate that we really have not dwelled on very much . 
vote `` no '' on castle/degette . 
california is using some $ 3 billion right now on what this bill is attempting to deal with . 
they have studied medicine , they understand medical research , they understand bioethics far better than i ever will , and i come down on their side . 
i come down on the side of life . 
mr. speaker , i oppose this bill and support the president 's position on embryonic stem cells . 
but spend the people 's money on proven blood cord , bone marrow and adult stem cell research . 
unfortunately , president bush has threatened to veto this bill when it arrives on his desk . 
mr. bush 's ban on providing federal funds for stem cell research has seriously damaged our nation 's efforts to be a leading voice in the development of this new technology . 
allowing federal funding for research on stem cells is vital to making real progress as quickly as possible to find real cures . 
the science will go on with or without the united states . 
i would also like to thank my friend , mr. this legislation builds on the investment made by congress 18 years ago when we established a national bone marrow donor program to save the lives of patients with leukemia and many other blood disorders . 
with this legislation , transplant doctors and patients will have an enhanced , single point of electronic access to the full array of information on possible bone marrow matches , as well as matches with cord blood units from the new national inventory which would be created . 
in addition , the new effort will facilitate accreditation of cord blood banks , stimulate research , and collect and share data on the outcomes of all transplants . 
last month , at the request of our appropriations committee direction , the institute of medicine released its report on cord blood and how the inventory should be built and integrated into the existing national registry . 
claude lenfant , the former director of the national heart , lung and blood institute at nih who initiated the major coblt study on cord blood banking and transplantation . 
every patient who has sought a marrow or cord blood transplant has helped in the overall effort to gain more scientific knowledge on perfecting the transplant process . 
let me thank every member of this house for their support for the efforts we started 18 years ago on behalf of patients everywhere . 
during this debate , some would attempt to justify embryonic stem cell research on the basis that we are dealing with something other than real human beings . 
these are justifications based on definitions of life that are purely arbitrary . 
instead , we should focus our resources on supporting medical research such as cord blood and adult stem cell research that respect human lives and have an actual track record of creating cures . 
i rise in support of h.r. 2520 , which i really view as a noncontroversial , bipartisan piece of legislation that we should all be able to agree on . 
mr. speaker , just in response to what was said on the floor , this is a statement that has appeared on the floor , and also in print , which says that the bill before us prohibits federal funding used for the destruction of embryos . 
after i left this house on the first occasion , within 2 years , my brother developed parkinson 's . 
i would like to thank representatives castle and degette for their leadership on this important issue . 
their personal health battles took on a new meaning as the public debate heated up over the merits and ethics of embryonic stem cell research . 
as a physician i have seen government inject itself in places it ought not go and spend countless dollars on fanciful and distorted claims . 
decisions in science should be based on the scientific method -- a standardized method of evaluation and implementation of a solution or treatment of a disease . 
it does not promise miracle cures based on scanty evidence . 
to make such exaggerated claims , at this stage of our knowledge , is not only scientifically irresponsible -- it is deceptive and cruel to millions of patients and their families who hope desperately for cures and have come to rely on the scientific community for accurate information . 
non-embryonic stem cells '' on the other hand have a history `` very different from that of embryonic stem cells. '' cord and adult stem cells are `` producing undoubted clinical benefits and ... .. 
it expressed real concern about a cavalier public posture and policy during a debate on such a sensitive ethical matter . 
it does not `` promise '' miracle cures based on scanty evidence . 
to make such exaggerated claims , at this stage of our knowledge , is not only scientifically irresponsible -- it is deceptive and cruel to millions of patients and their families who hope desperately for cures and have come to rely on the scientific community for accurate information . 
based on this evidence , claims of a safe and reliable treatment for any disease in humans are premature at best . 
based on the available evidence , no one can predict with certainty whether they will ever produce clinical benefits -- much less whether they will produce benefits unobtainable by other , less ethically problematic means . 
and in one trial , patients who were bedridden , not able to walk , were found to be jogging on the beach or climbing eight flights of stairs after successful treatment . 
mr. speaker , it is irresponsible to spend scarce federal dollars on false promises when there are certainly alternatives with existing treatments that do not create an ethical dilemma . 
and for these reasons , i oppose h.r. 810 and urge my colleagues to vote `` no '' on this as well . 
stem cell research , especially embryonic stem cell research , is going to go on apace very rapidly in all parts of the world , whether it is singapore or korea or japan or china or the united kingdom or canada , other places on continental europe . 
science will march on . 
mr. speaker , i want to thank the gentleman from delaware ( mr. castle ) xz4000700 and the gentlewoman from colorado ( ms. degette ) xz4001010 for their leadership on this issue . 
just like polls around the country , when nancy reagan called to lift the bush administration ban on this research in 2004 , three-fourths of americans have come to the support of this cause . 
i also became involved in this debate because of the extraordinary citizens that have come to advocate on its behalf , advocates like bernie frank , an accomplished st . 
our nation is blessed with the greatest minds and researchers on this planet . 
even after the president has spoken , we are , as a nation , still sleeping too close to where we got in with regard to research on stem cells . 
mr. speaker , i was recently asked by a kind and gentle lady my position on stem cell research . 
and she went on to tell me that she had ms herself . 
the institute has sponsored or collaborated on more than 350 clinical trials of promising new cancer treatments and its developing cancer genetics program will rival the world 's leading programs in that field . 
but to fund federal research on stem cells derived from killing human embryos is unethical and irresponsible . 
in these 4 years , government and private research on those stem cells have produced nothing , cured no one ; and there is no indication that that will change . 
let us learn from their example and not squander taxpayer dollars on unethical research . 
we are here debating h.r. 810 , which directs the federal government to spend tax dollars on embryonic stem cell research . 
this bill , therefore , implies that stem cell research is not already going on , but stem cell research is alive and well in america . 
mr. speaker , i rise today to speak on behalf of h.r. 810 , the stem cell research enhancement act of 2005 . 
mr. speaker , on the birthday of my daughter , katy , who was born 8-10 weeks prematurely , but still lives and blesses my life . 
when a soldier is captured or out on the battlefield wounded , many others often risk their lives to save the one . 
the truth is that this bill is not determining whether embryonic stem cell research will go on . 
private pharmaceutical and health care industries would be in pursuit knowing that if they find a cure , they will be the most profitable company on the face of the earth . 
embryonic stem cell research can go on and has gone on with billions of dollars from some states and from some private money . 
let those who feel so compelled , spend your own , but i would hope even then you would spend your own money on the lines with the most promise and not take life in the name of helping life . 
may god not only bless , but have mercy on us all . 
mr. speaker , i rise today in support of h.r. 2520 , as well as the stem cell research enhancement act , as both bills are part of today 's larger debate on stem cell research and the hope being offered with them . 
but to be effective , hope and optimism need to be based on a possibility . 
this is what we are talking about today , whether or not this country will close the door on hope on the unexplainable , on what is truly a miracle . 
mr. speaker , on wednesday , june 22 , 2005 , i was unable to cast my floor vote on rollcall no . 
the vote i missed was on agreeing to the watt of north carolina substitute amendment . 
had i been present for the vote , i would have voted `` yea '' on rollcall number 293 . 
the irony is that if this amendment becomes law more flags will be burned as psychos see this as their way to get on television . 
while i do understand the outrage that most of us feel towards those who make their points by trampling on our flag , the proposed constitutional amendment is unnecessary and counterproductive . 
on a serious note , we should not make changes to the bill of rights to deal with specific circumstances every time we are offended . 
we need to focus on doing our job here . 
mr. speaker , i would like to thank the chairman for his good work on the committee on the judiciary . 
after that day , the flag suddenly seemed to appear everywhere , overnight , across this land , any size of fabric , even those made by schoolchildren from construction paper , i suppose , flags stuck in flowerpots , pinned on lapels , decals posted on the back windows of our automobiles and trucks . 
i have seen the flag on a distant battlefield , and those , like me who have seen it there , see it perhaps from a different perspective . 
across the river from here is a memorial to the valiant efforts of our marines to raise that flag on iwo jima . 
it was not just a piece of cloth that appeared in the sky on that day so many years ago , just as it is not a piece of cloth that francis scott key saw over baltimore harbor centuries ago . 
as has been stated , we have had a number of hearings on this in the past . 
the interesting thing is when one holds these hearings or had we chosen to hold hearings again this time , i might add we had experts on both sides come and testify about this , there are allegations thrown at us , oh , here we go again , why are we holding these hearings once again ? 
i think those of us on this side tend to want to keep this debate on a very civil level and i would encourage my colleagues to do that . 
from the top of this very capitol building to porches all across our country , the flag is synonymous with the principles on which this country was founded and the principles on which we still stand . 
since 1994 , and i want to emphasize this , there have been 119 incidents of such flag desecration , ones like the one that our distinguished chairman just indicated where somebody literally defecated on the flag . 
h. j. res. 10 , which has passed the house in its current form on four separate occasions , would give congress the authority it needs to once again protect the flag . 
mr. speaker , i begin by thanking the gentleman from new york ( mr. nadler ) xz4002890 , my colleague , who is the ranking member on the subcommittee on the constitution and has served us so well across the years in this regard . 
i also want to commend the gentleman from florida ( mr. hastings ) xz4001702 , the minority member of the committee on rules , for conducting such a dispositive examination of the rule and the substance of the measure that is before us today . 
once we decide to limit freedom of speech , limitations on freedom of the press and freedom of religion may not be far behind . 
i want to tell my friends on the other side of the aisle , some will oppose this amendment . 
i would ask those individuals , if they still try this trickster debate , which of those items would you place on the casket of one of our fallen soldiers ; it is not the american flag . 
in my district we had a group of hispanics that were protesting over a bill that we passed on this floor years ago and it was on bilingual education , english first . 
it took him 5 years to knit an american flag on the inside of his shirt when he was held prisoner in vietnam . 
it may be that the words have never been changed , but the united states supreme court on many , many , many occasions has amended the first amendment and other provisions in the bill of rights by changing the meaning of those words . 
the physical desecration of the american flag constitutes an assault on the most deeply shared experiences of the american people . 
to burn a flag in front of a veteran or someone else who has put his or her life on the line for their country is an act not deserving protection . 
to burn a flag in front of a veteran or someone else who has put his or her life on the line for their country is a despicable act not deserving protection . 
our servicemen and women are courageously fighting the war on terrorism and putting their lives on the line every day to protect our nation and the freedoms that we enjoy . 
their strong feelings on this issue should neither be questioned nor underestimated . 
for all of us , this reverence begins early on , when as school children we are taught the pledge of allegiance and recite it each day with our classmates . 
former soldier and secretary of state colin powell , when asked for his views on this issue , said , `` the first amendment exists to ensure that freedom of speech and expression applies not just to that with which we agree or disagree , but also that which we find outrageous . 
not once during the 15 years i have voted on this amendment to the constitution has a crisis occurred with people burning flags . 
individual freedom and opportunity have built our nation into the strongest on earth where liberties are enshrined in our constitution . 
the fondest memory i think i have of being a mother is standing on the school yard of the elementary school with my children and joining with them and the other mothers as they saluted our flag . 
and who can forget on september 11 , 2001 , when firefighters in new york pulled our flag out of the rubble of the world trade center and hoisted it in defiance of terror ? 
it is a sign of our strength that , unlike so many repressive nations on earth , ours is a country that not only accommodates a wide-ranging public debate , but encourages it . 
mr. speaker , i yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from michigan ( mr. conyers ) xz4000800 , the distinguished ranking member of the committee on the judiciary . 
mr. speaker , i have heard a number of speakers invoke the rescuers and heroes and first responders at ground zero on september 11 and the few weeks after . 
that is to say , they are not burning the flag as an expression of disdain for our values , as an expression of their opinions on political issues of their disagreement with the administration or with the government in power . 
if ratified , i think there are more than a few people who will have to redesign their campaign materials to stay out of jail , except , of course , that probably no one will arrest them for that violation of the law because they will not be seen to be using it for dissident political speech , unless they are running on an unpopular platform , then maybe they will be . 
as if this assault on the bill of rights is not enough , the judiciary committee once again did not even bother holding a hearing on this very significant constitutional amendment . 
the subcommittee on the constitution did not bother to consider it , to debate it , or to vote on it . 
there is no excuse for doing something or attempting to do something so significant to start tearing up the bill of rights without even a hearing to hear opinions on it just because prior congresses may have held hearings . 
let us not cease to be a shining beacon on the hill . 
mr. speaker , i yield 6 minutes to the gentleman from virginia ( mr. scott ) xz4003641 , a distinguished member of the committee on the judiciary . 
mr. speaker , i yield 5 minutes to the distinguished gentlewoman from california ( ms. zoe lofgren ) xz4002450 , member of the committee on the judiciary . 
let me explain myself. '' he then goes on to talk about his experience in the pow camp . 
the officer was on his feet in an instant , his face purple with rage . 
after the one-man , one-vote decision in 1960 , whatever it was , where they said you had to reapportion based on population , there were amendments introduced . 
we should not make it easier at times of emotion in the future on issues we can not now foresee for unpopular minorities to be bullied . 
no one is divided on that in this chamber . 
the menorah , the koran , we saw that recently where false reports on desecration of the koran led to riots and hundreds of people dying . 
the symbolic meaning of the toppling of the statue of saddam hussein was not lost on the iraqi people or the other people around the world . 
many have died on the battlefield simply protecting the flag itself , keeping it from being captured or from even hitting the ground . 
so i urge my colleagues to support h.j. resolution 10 , which states , `` the congress shall have power to prohibit the physical desecration of the flag of the united states of america. '' mr. speaker , i thank the gentleman from wisconsin ( mr. sensenbrenner ) xz4003650 for his stand on this issue and for giving me this time to express my views . 
but there is another solution that our side has used and pretends to want to use on numerous occasions , and that is to get rid of the jurisdiction from the federal courts . 
we did it on the marriage issue ; we can do it right here . 
another point : the real problem that exists rountinely on the house floor is the daily trashing of the court by totally ignoring act i sec . 
8. we should spend a lot more time following the rule of law , as defined by our oath of office , and a lot less on unnecessary constitutional amendments that expands the role of the federal government while undermining that extension of the states . 
mr. speaker , let me summarize my views on this proposed amendment . 
mr. speaker , we have some misfits who on occasion burn the flag . 
it is assumed that many in the military support this amendment , but in fact there are veterans who have been great heroes in war on both sides of this issue . 
he said : our nation was not founded on devotion to symbolic idols , but on principles , beliefs and ideals expressed in the constitution and its bill of rights . 
when we see flag burning on television , it is usually not american citizens , but foreigners who have strong objections to what we do overseas , ( burning the flag. ) this is what i see on television and it is the conduct that most angers me . 
mr. speaker , this is ultimately an attack on private property . 
freedom of speech and freedom of expression depend on property . 
finally , mr. speaker , i wish to point out that by using the word `` desecration , '' which is traditionally reserved for religious symbols , the authors of this amendment are placing the symbol of the state on the same plane as the symbol of the church . 
i was interested because yesterday in my district the aclu , which holds itself as the arbiter of all freedom of speech in the nation and in the world , actually shut down all comments from their own local chapter because one person was speaking out on an issue that they did not want him to speak on with their name hooked onto it . 
they do not see things in the complex legal arguments on the floor of this house or in the supreme court . 
i also want to thank the distinguished chairman of the committee on the judiciary on which i have the privilege of serving . 
after surviving the bloodiest battle since gettysburg , a platoon of marines trudged up mount suribachi on sulfur island with a simple task : to raise an american flag above the devastation below . 
when the flag was raised by sergeant mike strank and his makeshift squad , history records that a thunderous cheer arose from our troops on land and sea , in foxholes and on stretchers , across iwo jima and its surrounding waters . 
mr. speaker , it was written long ago : `` without a vision , the people perish. '' that day , on mount suribachi , the flag was the vision that inspired and rallied our troops ; and that flag , mr. speaker , is still that vision for every american who cherishes those who stood ready , and this day stand ready , to make the sacrifices necessary to defend freedom . 
we will raise her above the decisions of a judiciary that was wrong on our law and our history and our traditions . 
so let us just see what we are doing this year on the health care budget for veterans . 
furthermore , mr. speaker , just before we went on memorial day break and gave speeches just a few weeks ago , colleagues voted down a measure that would have offered tricare health coverage to national guard members and reservists . 
how can we ask these young men and women to serve on the front line and not even provide for them the basic necessity of health care ? 
and so , mr. speaker , 25 million american veterans deserve respect and dignity and they deserve more than the debate on this constitutional amendment . 
the supreme court has frequently considered restrictions on speech that are permissible by our government . 
mr. speaker , i feel compelled to comment on suggestions that stealing and destroying somebody 's personal property is protected if that property happens to be a flag . 
the other examples , there are other criminal codes that people can be prosecuted on . 
contrary to what has been suggested on the floor , the underlying amendment does not regulate conduct . 
or if you are a member of a fringe political organization who burns his own flag on his own property , in private , can they be arrested if somebody finds out ? 
mr. speaker , i ask unanimous consent that all members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on h. j. res. 10 . 
in world war ii , it was carried onto normandy beach by soldiers who liberated a continent from darkness , and raised on iwo jima to steel the resolve of embattled marines . 
the sacred trust can be nowhere so safe as in the hands most interested in preserving it. '' all 50 state legislatures have passed resolutions calling on congress to pass a flag protection amendment , and polls demonstrate the overwhelming majority of americans have consistently supported a flag protection amendment . 
language identical to house joint resolution 10 has passed the house on four separate occasions . 
there has to be a line that is drawn on what is acceptable behavior and what is not acceptable behavior . 
i think one of the reasons why we are here today as a result of both the johnson and eichman decisions was exemplified by a decision of the supreme court of my home state of wisconsin on april 9 , 1998 , in the case of state of wisconsin v. matthew janssen . 
mr. janssen was prosecuted for flag desecration because he defecated on the american flag . 
mr. speaker , i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from ohio ( mr. chabot ) xz4000710 , the chairman of the subcommittee on the constitution . 
that was based on constitutional grounds , and congress proposed and the states ratified three amendments , the 13th , 14th and 15th amendment , to make sure that the mistake that was made by the dred scott decision would never be repeated again . 
and the supreme court also decided that levying income taxes violated the provision of the constitution on apportionment of taxes , and the 16th amendment was proposed and ratified to correct that problem . 
in addition , based on these precedents , any law that prohibits the physical desecration of the flag will be struck down as an unconstitutional suppression of free expression , thus defeating the goal of our efforts to provide protection for the flag . 
in the dred scott decision , chief justice taney claimed that the fifth amendment 's due process clause , which he interpreted to include a substantive right to the protection of property , prohibited restrictions on slave ownership . 
mr. speaker , on that i demand the yeas and nays . 
the constitution is not just a symbol , it is the very principles on which our nation was founded . 
these are stories of men and women from all walks of life who put their lives on hold to serve our nation . 
americans can stand on the steps of their own city hall or on the steps of our nation 's capitol to demonstrate their cause . 
we should condemn them and pity them instead. '' mr. speaker , my primary objection to this amendment is not the effect it will have on those who physically desecrate their flags , because the numbers of people who physically desecrate the american flag are so small . 
there was much excitement in the main dining room at rector 's last night following the playing of the `star spangled banner. ' frederick s. boyd , a former reporter on the new york call , a socialist newspaper , was dining with miss jessie ashley and miss may r. towle , both lawyers and suffragists . 
boyd was found guilty of disorderly conduct and was released on suspended sentence. '' another one from the new york times , july 2 , 1917 , headline : `` boston `peace ' parade mobbed . 
the ranks of the marchers were broken up by self-organized squads of uniformed soldiers and sailors , red flags and banners bearing socialist mottos were trampled on , and literature and furnishings in the socialist headquarters in park square were thrown into the street and burned . 
nearly 100 industrial workers of the world , all of whom admitted they are anarchists , knelt on the ground at dawn today near san onofre , a small settlement a short distance this side of the orange county boundary line . 
on the other side of the ledger , if this amendment becomes part of our constitution , in my opinion , it will become a constitutionally sanctioned tool for the majority to tyrannize the minority . 
i was standing a few booths down the way and watched as one of the volunteers sat on the table , oblivious to the fact he was sitting on our american flag . 
mr. speaker , i urge a `` no '' vote on this proposed amendment . 
this body could be focusing on providing health insurance to our nation 's 45 million uninsured , improving our public education system , addressing our swollen deficit , or any number of equally important issues . 
we could focus , instead , on providing them with enough bulletproof vests , ensuring veterans have access to the best possible health care , and sending our troops into war only as a last resort . 
mr. speaker , i ask unanimous consent , given the gravity of this motion , that the clerk read the motion again since , apparently , no one on this floor , other than i , know what is in it . 
the text of the original bill is to give the 50 states the legal authority to , on a state-by-state basis , prevent the desecration of the flag , a symbol of our country . 
there is something a heck of a lot more serious going on than the desecration of the flag : it is the desecration of our nation . 
mr. speaker , it is my understanding under the rule passed by the committee on rules that the minority is guaranteed a motion to recommit . 
the point of order is to my colleagues , if you think it is wrong to desecrate the flag , i would hope that you would think it is wrong to misspend money taken out of people 's wallets that we promised to spend on their social security and to protect that money in the constitution . 
mr. speaker , to the gentleman from wisconsin , you have , using the power of the majority , blocked the vote on a constitutional amendment to balance the budget and the constitutional amendment to vote to protect the social security trust fund . 
would it be your intention to object to that as well and prevent a vote on this house floor ? 
but if the gentleman is going to insist on not allowing a vote to protect the constitutional amendment to balance the budget , not allowing a vote to protect the social security trust fund , and not allowing a vote to protect the medicare trust fund , i see no further reason other than to point out that i really thought the republican majority meant it when they passed the contract with america , that they said they would balance the budget . 
on that point , i agree with the rocky mountain news that `` flag-burning is not really a problem , as actual incidents of it are rare . 
and defining desecration is tricky , especially given the widespread commercial and decorative use of the flag. '' and , in particular , i share that newspaper 's view that `` more importantly , tampering with the first amendment opens the way to those laws of the kind that less democratic governments impose to shield themselves from criticism. '' mr. speaker , every day , at home and abroad , our brave men and women in uniform are on guard to defend our country and our constitution from those who have no respect for either . 
it is the underlying values represented by the flag , not the cloth on which the stars and bars are sewn that our constitution protects . 
i started by saying that i used to resent this debate and i would tell you , mr. speaker , that i came to congress thinking that , i guess , i thought i had a monopoly on what the meaning of the constitution was . 
this is a difficult issue , and this is not about patriotism , and i have come to understand over the years of debate that we have had this amendment under consideration , i started out saying to people on the opposite side , people like the gentleman from california ( mr. cunningham ) xz4000910 and people who served their country , you are unpatriotic because you do not agree with me about my interpretation of the first amendment ; the first amendment was passed to protect the right of people to demonstrate and burn flags and you are unpatriotic because you do not agree with me . 
could it be that justice scalia and justice rehnquist , two conservative jurists , could be on opposite sides of this issue and it not be a difficult issue from a constitutional perspective ? 
they came down on opposite sides of the landmark case . 
if the supreme court changes its mind , the composition of the supreme court changes , and they decide that burning a flag is prohibited , is not protected under the first amendment , then that is going to be the last word on it . 
we do not have any way to go on that . 
mr. speaker , i am going to filibuster because i am waiting for some members who would like to speak on this . 
let me respond to the comments of the gentleman from virginia ( mr. goodlatte ) that the supreme court has amended the bill of rights on a number of occasions . 
on a number of those occasions i have been really unhappy about the way the supreme court ruled and took away a right that i thought i had . 
mr. speaker , i object to the vote on the ground that a quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not present . 
to us , desecrating our flag is not a demonstration of liberty ; it is an attack on liberty . 
mr. speaker , on rollcall no . 
we are aware that exports account for one-sixth of our economic growth , and that one in five american factory jobs and one in three american crop acres depend on customers in foreign markets and that many markets are still closed to our goods . 
we are aware that 1 million american jobs rely on research and development conducted by private businesses and through our world-class university system . 
we are aware that our economy is dangerously dependent on foreign sources of oil , and that it is overrun with frivolous lawsuits that abuse our legal system . 
the resolution states that energy is a major problem , yet the department of energy 's independent analysts have said that the provisions in the house energy bill will have a `` negligible '' impact on prices , production , consumption , and imports of energy . 
mr. speaker , i thank the gentleman from new york for his leadership in defense of our economy , workers ' rights , and our desire to build on an american economy that can provide opportunity for all . 
every state in the nation lost jobs due to nafta ; whereas , congress will soon be compounding the damage with consideration of cafta , which is modeled on nafta ; whereas , china 's seemingly endless supply of dollars to acquire ibm , maytag , and now unocal is supplied by america 's huge trade deficit with china . 
now , if congress was to take up legislation for the purpose of removing barriers to the competitiveness of the u.s. economy , it might read like this : whereas , america needs a new trade policy based on the principle that what the u.s. buys from a country should roughly match what it sells to that country ; whereas , the cost of private , for-profit health care is a serious impediment to competitiveness ; whereas , the u.s. paid $ 5 , 270 per capita for health care in 2002 , and two countries with the closest level of spending were germany at $ 2 , 820 and canada $ 2 , 930 , both of which provided universal health care ; whereas , the ceos of ford motor company of canada , gm canada , daimlerchrysler canada wrote in a 2002 letter that `` publicly-funded health care thus accounts for a significant portion of canada 's overall labor cost advantage in auto assembly versus the u.s. which in turn has been a significant factor in maintaining and attracting new auto investment to canada. '' the resolution that we need to hear would say : whereas , h.r. 676 , the u.s. national health insurance act , which has 50 cosponsors , would provide less expensive , high-quality , single-payer health care systems like many u.s. competitors ; whereas , the current course of u.s. economic and health policy is unsustainable , and a day of reckoning could involve the bursting of the housing price bubble , rise of interest rates , budget austerity and the shredding of the social safety net , mass unemployment , and a loss of economic sovereignty . 
therefore , be it resolved , congress has once again lost the opportunity to change the course , correct the trade imbalance , lift up living standards in the u.s. and the world , and set the country on a more sustainable economic course . 
vote `` no '' on h. res. 352 . 
as many know , i represent silicon valley , along with the gentlewoman from california ( ms. eshoo ) xz4001240 and the gentleman from california ( mr. honda ) xz4001850 , the most creative and innovative place on earth ; and if i were to bring your resolution back to the leaders of the silicon valley , the engineers , the techies , ph.d.s , venture capitalists , educators , ceos , i think i would be laughed all the way back to d.c . 
i suspect that you did not consult with any of the people in the tech industry because , if you did , we would have had something with a little meat on it that meant something . 
with an exploding deficit , reduced support for education of americans , a door shutting on nobel-level scientists from abroad , no energy policy that will lead to energy independence , this proposal is worse than nothing because the right wing will not take action on competitiveness and will probably say they did something if this stupid and meaningless resolution is permitted to pass . 
but unfortunately , our government , sometimes with very noble intentions , is putting up red lights , stoplights and dead ends on the road to opportunity . 
the regulatory burden on united states businesses is more than $ 850 billion each and every year . 
it is a hidden tax on our businesses and on our citizens . 
and make no mistake , our foreign competitors are capitalizing on it . 
we need to focus on eliminating some of the ones we have . 
they ignore what those people who are on the cutting edge of trying to improve america 's competitiveness , those companies that are on the cutting edge of competing in a world economy , their recommendations , one of the first of which is to fully fund no child left behind . 
they go on to say support research and development . 
the permanent , the permanent r & amp ; d tax credit , not the year-to-year funding that you provide , but the permanent , so companies can count on this , can make their economic decisions , can make their financial decisions . 
stop having the raids on the patent and trademark offices of the united states government to fund the general fund . 
the fact of the matter is that this provides nothing , provides nothing that the industries that are on the cutting edge identify as their most important objectives , their most important priorities , and that is to provide for a dramatic and sustained improved investment in education ; a dramatic and sustained improvement in the r & amp ; d of this country , nondefense related , basic r & amp ; d on a permanent basis , something you have not done in 6 years . 
this resolution so completely misses the mark that we wonder why we would spend an hour of our time on the floor dealing with this when there are such important items . 
a budget that does not even get close to funding no child left behind , as , again , the companies who are out there competing , not the political rhetoric on the floor , but what they have made after years of discussion . 
we continue to see them hijacked on a daily basis from the automotive industry , to the film industry , to the music industry , to the computer industry , and the effort has not yet been made . 
that is the report on what has happened over the last 4 or 5 years in this country . 
our industries have moved on a wholesale basis to china . 
whereas , despite spending $ 60 billion per year on training , 60 percent of the united states companies are prevented from upgrading technologically by the low education and technical skills level of their workforce . 
instead of having an aggressive policy on math and science education , the bush administration has underinvested in proven math and science instruction . 
instead of keeping the republican promise on education , president bush has already underfunded no child left behind , his own legislation , his own innovation , he has underfunded by more than $ 40 billion . 
instead of investing in research and development to keep the u.s. on the cutting edge of technological advancement , republicans have cut $ 877 million in federal science and technology funding . 
if we were serious , we would have a long discussion of these items before we move on and prepare some real legislation to deal with the shortcomings . 
mr. speaker , on that i demand the yeas and nays . 
repeatedly , throughout the debate , as democrats talked about spending more money on a variety of different items , the republican appropriators said , you know , this is the money we have , this is the best we can do with what we have . 
this development is not a temporary blip on the radar screen . 
it is the culmination of a generation of increased regulation , unsound tax policies , languishing emphasis on math and science education , unchecked health care costs , rampant lawsuit abuse , unfocused research and development funds and a weak trade policy enforcement . 
last year , we began the competitiveness legislative agenda on the floor , and over a period of 8 weeks , we discussed and voted on issues related to keeping and creating keeping jobs in america . 
we may disagree on the track , but i think it is important that we do move forward with an r & amp ; d tax credit that is permanent . 
one is the effect that china is having on our economy , and i think the point was made by the gentleman from new york that regulation is not holding them back . 
they have focused on technology . 
they are trying to run american businesses out of business so that they can have a corner on the market , and that is why we need to have enforceable trade policy , which is part of this resolution . 
they even allow professors and students to start businesses on their own . 
one example is in 1995 when the statute of repose was passed , which put commonsense limits on the manufacture of airplanes , and the following year 4 , 000 jobs were created in kansas alone , plus additional jobs all across the united states . 
what we need to do now is focus on math , science , engineering and technology . 
i look forward to working with the gentleman from new york ( mr. owens ) xz4003060 on issues like we addressed with sarbanes-oxley , corporate corruption , we had hearings . 
we had hearings ; we had legislation on the floor . 
i know we can agree on creating more jobs . 
mr. speaker , i thank the gentleman from louisiana ( mr. boustany ) xz4006360 for his leadership on the floor today and his help in these very important issues of making america more competitive tomorrow . 
mr. speaker , you know , when i listened to the debate today , i find that there are areas both republicans and democrats can agree on . 
we have heard that we do not spend enough money on r & amp ; d , that the tax credits are not permanent . 
and let me just tell you a little bit about why it is important that we take on these agencies and try to change the environment . 
why do you not come in on an announced basis , make a list of the violations , let the company have time to make the safe environment at the work area , and then come back and see how they are doing ? 
now , this environment here on the floor of the house is an adversarial environment . 
mr. speaker , i move to suspend the rules and agree to the resolution ( h. res. 352 ) providing that the house of representatives will focus on removing barriers to competitiveness of the united states economy . 
mr. speaker , i ask unanimous consent that all members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on h. res. 352 . 
health care , the gentleman from california ( mr. george miller ) xz4002780 brought up health care , and he very well knows that the committee on education and the workforce that he sits on as the ranking member is addressing health care . 
and yet i will say as a physician , as someone who has dealt with health care on a daily basis , universal government-run health care is not the answer . 
this will help get people who are uninsured back on to the rolls of being insured . 
these have already begun to help many americans , but we need to continue to work on this . 
so to say this is a nonbinding resolution , surely it makes a statement about some of the needs that we need to work on , but at the same time this congress is addressing all of those issues ; and we ask our colleagues across the aisle to join us to pass these bills so that we can help those americans in need and we can increase our competitiveness on the global market . 
i support this resolution , and i want to thank the gentleman from texas ( mr. delay ) xz4001040 and the gentleman from kansas ( mr. tiahrt ) xz4004050 for their tireless work to remove barriers on u.s. companies , to ensure that america can be competitive in the global economy . 
i mentioned , as a member of the committee on education and the workforce , that we are going to work on osha reform and ahps . 
gregg gothreaux heads up this organization and has strived to capitalize on an outstanding workforce to make lafayette a competitive force in the business world . 
and 3 months ago , entrepreneur magazine named lafayette one of the top technology centers in the south , based on its appeal and ability to attract high-tech companies . 
mr. speaker , i regret that i missed two votes on july 21 , 2005 . 
had i been present i would have voted `` no '' on rollcalls 401 and 402 . 
as the gentleman just mentioned , i was a member of the committee on the judiciary on september 11 , 2001 . 
i abstained in the committee on the judiciary this year because i was hoping that some of my concerns could be addressed through a rule that would allow some of these issues to be brought to the floor . 
but i am very disappointed to say that the rule that was adopted for this very important bill is designed to look like it is fair , because it allows a number of amendments , but those amendments are either so sweeping that they will never get anywhere near and should not get a majority of the house to vote for them , or they tinker on the edges of some critical issues . 
so people read about detentions of people without being indicted or without any deportation proceedings against them and wonder what is going on ; and he is right , many of the things we have read about have nothing whatsoever to do with the patriot act . 
but part of the reason why the chairman can say we had such rigorous oversight , 10 hearings on this subject , continued letters from the chair and the ranking member pushing for information from the justice department , is because of the sunsets . 
the failure of the rule to make the sunsets in order is a tremendous failure , not that all of them need to be reenacted , but on key sections at a time that is relevant for what the american people want , which is within the next 4 or 5 years there should be a chance to have those provisions sunsetted . 
you are allowing orders that are not based on criminal information to be issued by fisa courts , required to be issued by fisa courts , allowing any kind of tangible records to be seized , whether or not they are pertaining to a specific person , if it is connected with , or , in the case of the base bill here , relevant to a terrorist investigation . 
an amendment that the gentleman from massachusetts ( mr. delahunt ) xz4001020 and the gentlewoman from california ( ms. harman ) xz4001660 and i proposed the committee on rules did not allow to come into the rule which would have provided the proper balance . 
it would have dealt with the limitations that are imposed on law enforcement by too restrictive a standard and , at the same time , clarify that even if it has not yet been misused , it is wrong to provide such a broad standard that records can be swept up that have no connection whatsoever with any relevant target of any terrorist investigation . 
the senate committee on the judiciary this morning unanimously passed the standard that we see on this chart . 
why were we not allowed to vote on this ? 
why would the senate committee on the judiciary unanimously pass that sensible correction in the patriot act and this body not be even allowed to debate and vote on it ? 
for these reasons , i am going to be forced to vote `` no '' on this bill for the lack of opportunity to sunset key provisions like the lone-wolf provision , like the issue of national security letters to provide a forcing mechanism for oversight and for our failure to deal with the overly broad standard in the existing law and in the base bill . 
you want the focus on something specific , rather than all of the bank 's records of everybody who uses that bank . 
basically , this is an amendment supported , i am happy to say , by the chairman of the committee on the judiciary , that simply does one thing : it requires the attorney general to report to congress once a year on a survey that it seeks from other agencies of the federal government surveying data-mining technologies in use or in development at federal departments and agencies . 
the modification that i seek simply makes clear that , first of all , any classified information will be submitted in a classified annex and , secondly , that any information regarding data-mining technologies that deals with the sources , intelligence sources and methods , will be available only in the annex to the house permanent select committee on intelligence and the senate select committee on intelligence ; in other words , that to the extent this survey produces anything which should either be classified or deals with sources and methods , the traditional procedures for where that material goes will be maintained . 
the committee on armed services does not get this information . 
only the permanent select committee on intelligence gets this information . 
secondly , this imposes absolutely no burden on any other agency of government other than the attorney general and the justice department . 
it imposes no obligation on those agencies to respond . 
there is not one word in this bill that imposes a single mandate on any other federal agency . 
the only obligation on the attorney general is to seek this information from the other agencies . 
the need for this amendment is that we have wasted millions and millions of dollars on implementing database-mining activities which , when they became public , produced such an outrage they were canceled . 
mr. chairman , i yield 1 minute to the gentleman from wisconsin ( mr. sensenbrenner ) xz4003650 , chairman of the committee on the judiciary . 
mr. chairman , i yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from california ( ms. harman ) xz4001660 , ranking member of the permanent select committee on intelligence . 
i offered an amendment to ensure that sources and methods only go to the permanent select committee on intelligence , and a member of the committee on armed services objects , and then the chairman says we are not protecting sources and methods so he has to oppose it . 
luckily , there were a few sunset provisions that were intended to help keep people honest and evaluate the impacts on the public . 
we have now been fighting the war on terror longer than world war ii with no end in sight . 
it is important to keep these policies narrowly focused on items that are necessary for dealing with terrorism and today 's modern communication developments while not encroaching on american 's fundamental rights . 
mr. chairman , i appreciate the gentlewoman 's courtesy in permitting me to speak on this amendment . 
i am pleased with the efforts that are under way here on the floor to help try to deal with the shape of the patriot act . 
we have been fighting the war on terror longer than we fought world war ii , and it appears to be that this is going to be in the american landscape for as far into the future as we can see . 
this amendment helps get a handle on the sneak-and-peak provisions . 
in 2001 , just days after 9/11 , we rushed through a bill that simply cast aside the important by-products that were developed by the committee on the judiciary on a bipartisan basis . 
the conference report tries to appease both sides of the debate by extending sunsets on the two most controversial provisions , library records and `` roving '' wiretaps , while making 14 of the existing 16 provisions permanent thus limiting congress ' ability to exercise checks and balances . 
it puts the administration on too long of a leash and does not force congress to review and modify the act as needed . 
madam speaker , i thank the chairman for yielding and for the incredible hard work he has done to bring this bill to the floor , both to help create this legislation 4 years ago , to review it time after time after time for the last 4 years and to extend it into the future with the safeguards that have been discussed here on the floor today . 
in terms of the review process , i think the attorney general today in some information he put out suggested that there were at least 23 separate hearings last year of oversight , this is last year alone , of oversight on this act ; witness after witness after witness called to testify about what was happening with the act . 
i come to praise the chairman and his committee and to seek a `` yes '' vote on this bill today . 
last week as the ranking member of the subcommittee on human intelligence with the gentleman from california ( mr. cunningham ) xz4000910 as the chairman , i was able to include a reform so the patriot act ensures greater judicial oversight of government wiretaps . 
this will allow greater oversight of the wiretaps without impeding the government 's need to obtain information on potential terrorist plots quickly . 
if we focus on commonsense reforms , we can protect our communities from terrorists , and we can protect our civil liberties . 
it assures the foreign intelligence surveillance court , we often call it the fisa court , will receive information related to john doe roving wiretaps in a timely manner by removing any ambiguity associated with the term `` reasonable. '' it makes it clear to every fbi agent , doj lawyer and judge from the start , this is a 15-day limit on providing the court with information related to john doe roving wiretaps . 
mr. chairman , i thank the gentleman for yielding me this time and commend him on his previous eloquent statement . 
the secret search can be in almost any kind of investigation , and the notification to the & lt ; center & gt ; & lt ; pre & gt ; [ page : h6223 ] & lt ; /pre & gt ; & lt ; /center & gt ; but i am going to focus my remarks this afternoon on the two provisions of the original law which i think cause the deepest civil liberties invasion and which the measure before us does not , in my opinion , appropriately reform . 
in my view , the single most troubling provision confers on law enforcement the ability to use so-called national security letters . 
members of the majority have stressed today that the committee on the judiciary has held 12 patriot act hearings in recent months . 
mr. speaker , on that i demand the yeas and nays . 
i have no doubt that if 16 provisions of the original act were not scheduled to sunset at the end of this year , we would still have little information on how these new authorities were being used . 
moreover , the government is not required to name the target which allows wiretaps on phones of virtually anyone meeting the description of a john doe . 
madam speaker , i am pleased to yield 4 minutes to the distinguished ranking member of the house committee on intelligence , the gentlewoman from california ( ms. harman ) xz4001660 . 
this is not a matter about what the department of justice has done in the past , and i differ with the gentleman from wisconsin on this matter . 
mr. chairman , america faced a new kind of enemy on september 11 , one that mercilessly attacked civilians on our own shores . 
in response , the congress , i was not here at the time , passed the patriot act to give law enforcement agents appropriate tools to fight the new war on terror . 
today , we have a great opportunity to send a strong message of support for several provisions of this bill which would have expired on december 1. i specifically want to mention the library section . 
we can not afford to make libraries and bookstores havens for those bent on harming u.s. citizens . 
recently , some members on the other side have actually admitted that it has not been abused . 
for that reason , i fully support the reauthorization of the expiring patriot act , and i thank the gentleman from wisconsin ( chairman sensenbrenner ) for his work on this issue . 
and as we are deliberating on this bill as a whole and the purpose being to do everything we can to stop terrorism , this amendment speaks right to the point . 
and as the gentleman from wisconsin ( mr. sensenbrenner ) xz4003650 has said , all the modifications make sure that there is no impact on tribal sovereignty . 
mr. speaker , i thank my colleague on the rules committee for yielding me this time , and i would like to say this is a good debate not only that we are having right now but that we will have throughout the day on a very important act , that being the usa patriot act . 
i would like to say in discussion on what occurred in the rules committee , the minority asked that we extend the debate on the patriot act to 2 hours , and we are going to be seeing that later this afternoon . 
the amendment that i wish to address is extremely timely today , unfortunately , for those living in great britain in that it will reform the wrecking trains statute of 1940 to impose greater penalties for those who seek to terrorize individuals on mass transportation , particularly trains . 
but it sends shivers down the spine , i think , of every american knowing the pain and suffering that is going on in london as we speak . 
it is important in this amendment that i am going to be offering to realize that current legal practices are not punitive enough to be any kind of a deterrent to anybody who is considering a massive or a large attack on trains or mass transportation . 
threats and sabotage against railways also harm interstate commerce by causing delays on important transportation corridors . 
the amendment includes a 30-year minimum sentence for an attack on a train carrying high-level radioactive waste or spent nuclear fuel . 
the house passed this amendment on the 9/11 commission implementation act , but it was removed in conference with the senate . 
the tragic attacks on london on july 7 and another attack there earlier today have demonstrated again the dangers facing rail and transit systems in the u.s. and throughout the world . 
it passed on a voice vote last october . 
and i think by making standard criminal penalties , we are going a step in the right direction to use these penalties as a deterrence to terrorism on our mass transit and rail systems . 
while no penalties can deter some of these terrorists bent on causing death and destruction , these enhanced penalties on conspirators will hinder the efforts of terrorists to secure and finance their networks . 
the attacks on the rail systems in madrid and in the london underground have demonstrated the real threat that rail and mass transportation systems face . 
this bill also places restrictions on the sale of meth precursor chemicals that are similar to those that the west virginia legislature passed earlier this year and other legislatures throughout the country . 
provisions in this bill require that meth precursors be sold from behind the counter or from a locked cabinet and place better controls on mail order and internet sales . 
following the terrorist attacks on september 11 , 2001 , congress undertook a review of bush administration proposals to strengthen our laws relating to counterterrorism . 
many of the wiretapping and foreign intelligence amendments sunset on december 31 , 2005 . 
over the past few years i have continued to insist on greater oversight by congress of the justice department as it executes its new powers . 
i support h.r. 3199 but i hope as this legislation works its way through congress , we will include sunsets on the provisions we are reauthorizing , so that congress will continue to oversee the executive branch 's use of these new powers . 
the roving wiretaps provision , section 206 of the patriot act , provides that the fisa court may issue `` roving '' wiretaps to conduct surveillance on a foreign power or their agent when the target of surveillance has taken steps to thwart the investigation by changing accommodations , cell phones , internet accounts , or other forms of communications . 
the bill requires court orders for roving wiretaps to describe in detail the specific target in cases in which the target 's identity is unknown , higher burden than current law , and requires more detailed and timely reporting by the fbi to the courts and congress on the use of this authority . 
congress also requires the justice department to report to congress finally , the conference reports places some new restrictions on delayed notice search warrants , commonly called `` sneak and peek '' , under section 213 of the patriot act . 
the bill also requires new reporting to congress on the use of this provision . 
this legislation attempts to strike a balance as we seek to prevent another terrorist attack on u.s. soil , while protecting americans ' constitutional civil liberties . 
i have a unique perspective on the criminal justice system and i understand the importance of safety and the need for america to be tough on its criminals . 
it is unimaginable to think that a convicted terrorist responsible for american deaths could serve his sentence and be released back on the american streets free to act as he chooses . 
mr. chairman , i would remind my colleague from virginia that a legislative hearing was held before the subcommittee on june 30 , 2005 on which the justice department testified in favor of this bill . 
mr. chairman , i am pleased that the president of the united states on two occasions has stated that we need to give our law enforcement authorities all the tools necessary to fight terrorism , and he agreed that he strongly supported the signal of a death penalty to deter this criminal acts , these criminal acts that are imposed upon our society . 
when i decided to run for congress , it was in response to the 9/11 attack after serving for a long time on the judiciary . 
i thank the gentleman from wisconsin ( chairman sensenbrenner ) for allowing me to offer this amendment and for all the great work that he has done on this reenactment of the patriot act . 
to target what is needed to prevent this abuse now and in the future , we must first understand what causes it and then focus our efforts on overcoming those causes . 
and uniquely , it is up to our federal government to take the lead on the issue as it is the only entity with the resources and ability to coordinate the indispensable multi-pronged approach to stamping out drug abuse . 
the bill would also require information sharing from importers on the `` chain of custody '' from foreign manufacturer to u.s. shores of methamphetamine precursor chemicals . 
i look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle on initiatives to provide the federal resources and support we need in our fight against methamphetamine . 
when the house first considered the original patriot act , i was one of several on the judiciary committee who sought to include sunset provisions that would require congress to reauthorize the legislation after conducting vigorous oversight . 
and over a 4-month period , it received testimony from 35 witnesses during 12 hearings on the patriot act . 
as chairman of the subcommittee on the constitution , we have held patriot act oversight hearings in my subcommittee , and we remain committed to monitoring the implementation of this legislation through aggressive oversight . 
mr. chairman , i urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the reauthorization of the patriot act and to give our government the tools it needs to succeed in the war on terrorism . 
the subcommittee on crime , terrorism and homeland security hosted nine public hearings . 
the full house committee on the judiciary , furthermore , hosted three public hearings . 
the hearings indicated no abuse on the part of the federal government , the u.s. government , to protect us . 
the first point i want to emphasize is the assurance that the house committee on the judiciary and the crime , terrorism , and homeland security subcommittee did not give the patriot act a mere wink and a nod . 
i think we in the committee on the judiciary have done a thorough job of exhausting and deliberating a very , very important act , and i believe that one reason why we have not been attacked subsequently from 9/11 is because of the presence of the patriot act . 
the amendment that we are offering today will protect our seaports by controlling access to seaports on sensitive areas , providing additional authority to the coast guard to investigate vessels , prohibiting use of dangerous weapons or explosives on a passenger vessel , protecting coast guard navigational aides on waterways , prohibiting transportation of dangerous materials by potential terrorists , prohibiting destruction or interference with vessels or maritime facilities , increasing penalties for illegal foreign shipments on vessels , increasing penalties for noncompliance with manifest requirements , increasing criminal penalties for stowaways on vessels , and , finally , increasing penalties for bribery of port security authorities and officials . 
it would apply the ccta to smokeless tobacco as well , and impose reporting requirements on those engaging in delivery sales of more than 10 , 000 cigarettes , or 500 cans of packages of smokeless tobacco within a period of 1 month . 
mr. speaker , on 9/11 , evil terrorists , murderers , if you will , inspired and motivated by fanaticism and hatred attacked our country and nearly 3 , 000 innocent americans expired . 
the judiciary subcommittee on crime , terrorism and homeland security alone conducted nine hearings , coupled with two additional hearings before the full house judiciary committee . 
i spoke earlier on this floor , mr. speaker , of a constituent who urged me to lead an effort to repeal the patriot act . 
finally , mr. speaker , i am going to touch on a point that i think many americans have inadvertently ignored , and that is the fact that there are in excess of 360 ports in the united states and this bill provides basic and much-needed protection thereto . 
just last month , this body passed an amendment that would have barred funds from being spent on the controversial 215 orders against libraries and bookstores . 
i can not protest enough that we are not debating and voting on this amendment again . 
consider this : the american library association has confirmed that the government , under some authority , has gone to a library , and asked for a list of everyone who checked out a book on osama bin laden . 
clearly , in the wake of the september 11 attacks , many innocent people are checking out books on osama bin laden . 
we must demand that they show some wrong doing on behalf of library patrons before they dive into their personal habits . 
the american people deserve these improvements , but the majority party will not even let us vote on the issue . 
in light of today 's bombing incident in london , it is all the more objectionable that the majority would foreclose critical amendments for the patriot act reauthorization on the floor . 
in fact , in the first original patriot act , i helped write many of them in a version of the bill that passed the committee on the judiciary 36-0 , but a bill we never saw after it left the committee on the judiciary . 
it was replaced in the middle of the night in the committee on rules . 
in some sense this is not really about the patriot act , the debate that is going on here , or even most of the 16 provisions scheduled to sunset this year . 
the department of justice and the chairman of the committee on the judiciary say that this provision has never been used on libraries and bookstores . 
shame on an administration that keeps using it anyway . 
it was not in the bill originally reported by the committee on the judiciary and was slipped in by the department of justice or the administration when the bill was first written a few years back . 
if we have learned anything over the last 4 years , the only thing that makes the administration give us any information on oversight on the use of these new powers was the sunset provision . 
the lessons of september 11 and london , and even today in london , are that if we allow law enforcement to do their work free of political interference , give them adequate resources and modern technologies , we can protect our citizens without intruding on our liberties . 
i believe that the committee-passed legislation that is on the floor right now does not meet that test . 
mr. chairman , i yield 4 1/2 minutes to the gentleman from virginia ( mr. boucher ) xz4000430 , a distinguished member of the committee on the judiciary . 
abuse in sami al-hussayen case : a federal jury in idaho acquitted university of idaho graduate student al-hussayen on all charges of providing material support for a terrorist organization by running a website for the islamic assembly of north america . 
importantly , this group is not on the list of foreign terrorist organizations , and the links posted by al-hussayen were available on the government 's own website . 
section 505 places a prior restraint on free speech with its gag order , and it prevents due process by barring the recipient 's access to the courts . 
specifically , an internet service provider was unconstitutionally coerced to divulge information about e-mail activity and web surfing on its system , and the isp was then gagged from disclosing this abuse to the public . 
oddly , new york law enforcement has begun using the provision of the patriot act that protects against attacks on mass transit to forcefully kick homeless persons out of the new york train stations . 
mr. chairman , i yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from california ( ms. zoe lofgren ) xz4002450 , a distinguished member of the committee on the judiciary . 
mr. chairman , i am pleased to yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from california ( mr. berman ) xz4000250 , a senior member of the committee on the judiciary . 
mr. chairman , i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from massachusetts ( mr. delahunt ) xz4001020 , a former prosecutor and a member of the committee on the judiciary . 
mr. chairman , i yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from wisconsin ( ms. baldwin ) xz4000130 , a former member of the committee on the judiciary . 
well , maybe i should ask the author of the bill , if he is on the floor , why this has not had committee consideration . 
reclaiming my time , i am sorry i was not on the committee the day they had the hearing , but normally death penalty matters are not brought to the floor this way . 
normally i thought it was the jurisdiction of the subcommittee on criminal justice in the committee on the judiciary of the house that would be considering this matter . 
it is not clear , depending on what someone 's interpretation is . 
mr. chairman , i am glad that mr. coble offered language to mitigate concerns over his amendment 's impact on tribal sovereignty . 
i realize that there are other sections that may need to be fixed as well because there has not been much time to refine the entirety of the coble provision and that further refinements may be in order once we get to conference with the senate on this provision . 
it is like coming to a meeting and we have forgotten all the things that most of the members on my side of the aisle on the judiciary committee agreed with is wrong with the patriot act , but that we have ignored the fact that many other organizations are not for the patriot act . 
so , madam speaker , there are two pictures of what happened in the committee on the judiciary . 
madam speaker , i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from mississippi ( mr. thompson ) xz4004021 , the ranking member on homeland security . 
i am pleased this conference report includes 4-year sunsets on the most controversial provisions : 215 orders , 206 roving wiretaps , and the lone wolf provision . 
it says : `` dear mr. chairman , i am writing on behalf of the american library association to express our opposition to the conference report . 
and while adding an ability to challenge the secrecy of a national security letter on the one hand , it takes it away with the other by requiring the court to accept , as conclusive , the government 's assertion of harm to national security ... .. 
now , the senate bill also lacks a number of controversial and wholly unrelated provisions tacked on to the end of this bill . 
the chairman repeatedly admonished committee democrats that we were not permitted to consider matters falling outside of the 16 expiring provisions of the patriot act , but on the floor and in conference , this bill became a christmas tree for random drug laws , presidential succession amendments and federal employee benefit changes . 
no one on this side has signed the conference report . 
however , this bill crosses the reasonableness threshold by abrogating rights guaranteed under the constitution without a corresponding increase in the real tools law enforcement needs to fight the war on terrorism . 
i believe that we should focus on securing our homeland , not by infringing on civil liberties as outlined in the patriot act -- but , by securing our rail and transit systems , by securing our ports and waterways systems , by securing our airspace , and by refining our intelligence organizations for maximum outcomes , just to name a few . 
as the dissenting views to accompany h.r. 1399 reports , and i paraphrase , `` there are numerous provisions in both the expiring and other sections of the usa patriot act that have little to do with combating terrorism , that intrude on our privacy and civil liberties and that have been repeatedly abused and misused by both the justice department and the administration. '' these include , but are not limited to , the inadequate judicial oversight permitted by this bill and the roving wiretaps targeting innocent americans -- americans not involved in terrorism in any way . 
they are concerned that it has been used on innumerable occasions to obtain reading records from libraries and bookstores -- and that on at least 200 occasions has been used to solicit reader information from libraries . 
yet we never had a discourse on these issues . 
i listened to my colleagues on the committee , the gentlewoman from california ( ms. harman ) xz4001660 , the gentleman from massachusetts ( mr. delahunt ) xz4001020 , and also the gentleman from california ( mr. rohrabacher ) xz4003430 , and they have legitimate concerns . 
i do not think there is anybody in this body on either side of this issue that does not have concerns . 
they were concerned also about if they questioned this group that they would be taken to court on profiling . 
his roommate , the limitations that our agencies had on questioning him , he knew about the 9/11 bombings , is another reason why i think that we need this act . 
mr. chairman , as we learned here on 9/11 and in london today and on 7/7 , we must crack down on terrorism , and we must ensure that law enforcement officials have the tools they need to assess , detect and prevent future terrorist attacks . 
allow judicially approved wire-taps on cell phones and disposable cell phones , permit judicially approved seizure of voice mail and not make permanent the provision making it a federal crime to provide material support to terrorists , among other meritorious provisions . 
this provision is extraordinarily broad and intrusive and could apply to any tangible records on any and all americans whether or not they are suspected of a terrorist act . 
mr. mayfield was later exonerated of all charges related to the bombings because it was shown that the fbi based its investigation on incomplete and faulty information . 
i am disturbed that the bill extends many of these controversial provisions either permanently or up to 10 years , even though congress has not been properly provided information on the sue of many provisions of the act to date . 
however , the administration has refused to provide information on some of the most broad and intrusive powers under the act , and the bill should provide for adequate disclosure and proper oversight of these provisions , but it does n't . 
i am particularly concerned that the republican leadership refused to allow a vote on an amendment to remove library and bookstore records from sec . 
i also believe we could have reached an agreement on protections to address most of my concerns with the bill by providing for judicial review and shorter-sunset provisions . 
listeners should realize that truth is not required in debate on the floor of the house . 
we heard that when we passed the first patriot act , which no member of the house of representatives had read , at 10 o'clock in the morning with one copy available on each side of the aisle . 
come on . 
you are jamming this through on behalf of the white house and the attorney general . 
it threatens the civil liberties of americans , and i believe it will impinge on our investigation and finding of terrorists . 
then the most cynical thing about this bill is to take a meritorious bill that deals with methamphetamine precursors and trafficking , that passed separately in this house of representatives , which i supported , and they are going to include it as part of this legislation in a cynical ploy to somehow basically force , bully , or trick people into supporting the underlying legislation with its unwarranted attack on the bill of rights , the constitution of america , the foundation of our government , the gathering secretly of information about innocent americans , and the permanent retention of that information for no good purpose . 
mr. speaker , i was unavoidably absent from the vote today on h.r. 3199 , the `` usa patriot improvement and reauthorization act of 2005 '' due to a family medical emergency . 
had i been present and voting , i would have voted `` no '' on this bill as i have steadfastly opposed similar versions of the patriot act when they have come up in the past . 
limitations on instances in which delayed notice searches are allowed to remain broad . 
i do not know of anyone on either side . 
but i would also put forth that the reality of the sunsets were an encouragement on the part of the department of justice to ensure full compliance with the law as it was then written . 
if you will , one could argue that it served as a deterrence , that it encouraged good behavior ; and that is why some of us here on this side of the aisle are so passionate about the issue of sunsets . 
it is my understanding that this morning in the senate committee on the judiciary , there were a number of sunsets on various provisions that were approved , and they were full-year sunsets . 
my good friend and colleague on the committee , the gentleman from florida ( mr. feeney ) xz4001310 , talked about some using the library provision , if you will , as a red herring . 
i can remember when the chairman himself discussed issuing a subpoena to bring the former attorney general , mr. ashcroft , before the committee to provide us information on the so-called heavy guidelines . 
i have served on an invitation basis under chairman dan burton investigating the misconduct of the fbi in the boston office , and again , it required the threat of a contempt petition to gain information from the department of justice . 
in addition , it added a permanent nondisclosure requirement which , if violated , imposed severe sanctions on the recipient of the so-called national security letter . 
it also , i believe , strikes a more reasonable balance between privacy and freedom on the one hand and national security on the other with only a negligible burden imposed on the government , and so i urge passage . 
for example , they could implicate anti-abortion protesters who illegally block access to federal clinics , which could be interpreted by a liberal activist attorney general as endangering the lives of those seeking abortions , or environmental protesters who trespass on private land and climb trees to prevent logging , which could be interpreted by a conservative activist attorney general as endangering their own lives or the lives of the loggers . 
it also limits the definition to actions that are actually intended to influence government policy on a civilian population by coercion or intimidation , instead of the current standard that the actions `` appear to be intended '' to have that effect . 
i would conclude by reminding my colleagues on the committee on the judiciary that this amendment is drawn from the version of the patriot act that was unanimously approved by the committee on the judiciary in october of 2001 , and i urge its passage . 
we stumble on these things . 
the patriot act has been instrumental to our prosecution of the war on terror since 9/11 , and , specifically , instrumental to the prosecution of terrorists who have threatened our homeland . 
to date , 4 years after big brother supposedly imposed this draconian usurpation of liberty on the american people , no one has suggested a single instance of a single person 's civil liberties being violated . 
this point bears repeating : on one , not the justice department , not the aclu , not even moveon.org has produced evidence of a single , verifiable patriot act civil liberties abuse . 
we are winning the war on terror , and the patriot act is a big reason why . 
we should go back into conference and work on a bipartisan , balanced conference report . 
shame on us for not allowing a citizen to redress his grievances , and , shame on us for not ensuring that private information is destroyed once it is collected . 
as i , along with several of my colleagues , said in a letter to chairman sensenbrenner and chairman specter , there is nothing in this standard to stop the fbi from asking a library to turn over its circulation list of everyone who had checked out a book on islam since the september 11th attacks . 
shame on us for allowing this to remain in the final conference report . 
patriots demand accountability , restraint , and judicial review of encroachments on the freedoms that make our country unique . 
from its origin , this grossly misnamed patriot act has cloaked its weaknesses by implying that its opponents are `` un-patriots '' as in `` unpatriotic. '' this is all part of a troubling pattern : secret prisons , sneak and peek searches , gag orders , redefining torture to exclude cruel and degrading punishment , extraordinary rendition , combing through library records , and even attempting to misuse our military to spy on religious groups . 
obviously , what happened 2 weeks ago today in london made a big change for them and what is going on at this moment in london brought about a big change for them . 
we have made a commitment that , because of the fact that we are in the midst of a global war on terror , we need to do everything within our power to redouble our efforts to ensure that we win that global war on terror . 
at that time , i was very insistent on the need for sunset provisions . 
we had 47 amendments that were submitted to us in the committee on rules , and i am very proud of the fact that we were able to work with our colleagues addressing concerns that they raised . 
the primary committee of jurisdiction here is the committee on the judiciary . 
the permanent select committee on intelligence shares very important jurisdiction as well , and i understand that . 
i know there was concern that was raised last night in the committee on rules on the so-called `` lone wolf amendment '' that was addressed , a desire to have it sunsetted by the gentleman from florida ( mr. hastings ) xz4001702 . 
the committee on rules chose to comply with the request of the primary committee of jurisdiction , the committee on the judiciary , on this issue . 
so i believe that we have got a good balance on a very important critical issue that must be addressed . 
when this issue came to the forefront just a few weeks after september 11 , 2001 , the now director of the central intelligence agency , former chairman of the house intelligence committee and vice chairman of the rules committee , our very good friend , mr. goss , argued that he believed we should begin with permanence at that point , and i argued then that i thought it important that we focus on sunsetting provisions in the usa patriot act . 
because we were looking at this issue literally weeks after the worst attack on our soil . 
one of the reasons we did it is we wanted to see what kinds of civil liberties were being violated as we focused on our number one priority , that being our national security . 
and i am very happy to report that , as we look at what has transpired since implementation of the usa patriot act , it is the following : we have provided every opportunity for any american to raise concern , talk about violations of their civil liberties by going on the worldwide web , filing any kind of complaint . 
it is a delicate balancing act between our goal of recognizing the importance of our national security and at the same time focusing on civil liberties . 
and chairman sensenbrenner , who has done a phenomenal job on this , went through the litany of oversight hearings that have gone on between first implementation of the usa patriot act and today and will continue , will continue as we see this measure pass . 
every single american who travels today has made a sacrifice , because of the fact that we are in the midst of a global war on terror , by virtue of going through the security to get on an airplane . 
and we know that this is an ongoing global war on terror ; but we can not , as we pursue that war , move to undermine the great liberties and rights of the american people . 
and it is not on the abstract . 
i am somewhat taken aback as i listen to different parts of the debate on the floor . 
this bill tramples on the bill of rights in the name of patriotism . 
the democratic fabric of this country was founded on checks and balances but the patriot act contains neither . 
in 1775 , one of our nation 's true patriots , benjamin franklin , said `` they that can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety. '' this legislation tramples on the essential liberties that our founding fathers wanted to ensure . 
i can not with a clean conscience support this bill which gives government unnecessary access to the lives of innocent americans and tramples on their civil rights . 
madam speaker , i urge a `` no '' vote on this piece of legislation that flies in the face of our forefathers . 
i will tell my colleagues that over the last 8 months , we have had between 12 and 13 hearings in the committee on the judiciary and some 35 witnesses over an extended period of time ; and 50 members of the committee on the judiciary have had a chance to not just question those witnesses , but to go back in the secure intelligence records , which i have done , and review all the fisa reports and the other information that is very sensitive and an important part of our oversight . 
today we will be debating all day on the patriot act and into the evening . 
mr. chairman , i note that since the 9/11 attacks , in part we all know due to the patriot act , there have been no new attacks on america . 
we ought to be candid about the fact that we expect and are going to sit back as london-type bombings take place on our subways and bus systems . 
mr. speaker , i just want to say that i am often critical of this process and have been known to be critical of the committee on rules on particular bills that have come through , but i have to say with this process and with the committee on which i sit , the committee on the judiciary , we have seen a very transparent , open process . 
i believe there are four that have my name on it that have been approved for today . 
i in fact voted for his amendment on the floor the other day with regard to 215 and library and bookstore searches and sales . 
we will offer an amendment later , myself and the gentleman from california ( mr. schiff ) xz4003610 , that will require the director of the fbi to actually sign off on any request for documents from a bookstore or library . 
we have various other amendments that have been approved today , national security letters on the so-called delayed notification that have already been approved . 
i know it is a tough job the committee on rules has . 
i have worked , frankly , with a lot more democrats than i have with republicans on this issue over the past year . 
we formed the patriot act reform caucus , and a lot of us have worked very hard on these issues , and i am pleased to say that many of these amendments have been approved and will be offered today . 
having the director of the fbi sign off on the request , it also sends a signal to the library and bookstore owners that a request for information from the fbi is well thought out and comes from the highest level . 
this amendment compliments other amendments i have offered in the committee on the judiciary , two of which were accepted by the chairman and the committee . 
with these two amendments on 215 combined , i think we have provided strong protections for the contested section of the patriot act . 
mr. chairman , i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from indiana ( mr. pence ) xz4003150 , a valued member of the committee on the judiciary 
mr. chairman , i yield 1 minute to the gentleman from california ( mr. daniel e. lungren ) xz4006170 , another member of the committee on the judiciary . 
mr. chairman , i yield 1 minute to the gentleman from wisconsin ( mr. sensenbrenner ) xz4003650 , the chairman of the committee on the judiciary . 
mr. chairman , i yield 1 minute to the gentleman from california ( mr. issa ) xz4001960 , another member of the committee on the judiciary . 
let me just conclude by thanking the chairman of the committee on the judiciary , the gentleman from wisconsin ( mr. sensenbrenner ) xz4003650 , for running a fair and thorough process . 
i can tell my colleagues that over the past 12 months or so , we have had 12 hearings on this subject , 35 witnesses . 
on each of these sections that we are dealing with , we heard excellent testimony from the administration , from other witnesses , from experts in the field ; and that is why these amendments have been crafted . 
we have sought to protect the civil liberties of americans every bit as much as we can here , while offering effective tools for the war on terrorism , giving the administration the tools that they need to fight this war . 
we have teamed up on a few of those items . 
we are also teaming up with other members of the patriot act reform caucus , the gentleman from idaho ( mr. otter ) xz4003050 and the gentleman from new york ( mr. nadler ) xz4002890 , on this amendment . 
the amendment also contains penalties for individuals who violate the nondisclosure requirements of a national security letter and requires that reports on national security letters by federal agencies to congress must also be sent to the house and senate committees on the judiciary so we can exercise proper oversight . 
mr. chairman , i would like to thank again the gentleman from wisconsin ( mr. sensenbrenner ) xz4003650 and his staff in helping to write and to work with me on this amendment . 
mr. chairman , i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from california ( mr. daniel e. lungren ) xz4006170 , a member of the committee on the judiciary . 
mr. chairman , if the gentleman will continue to yield , there is a disagreement on what the court was actually ruling on , whether they were ruling on the access to counsel or , my understanding of it , whether or not the request itself was unconstitutional . 
let me just briefly thank the gentleman from massachusetts for working on this amendment . 
this amendment also requires on an annual basis that the administrative office of the courts must report to the house and senate judiciary committees on the number of search warrants granted and the number of delayed notices authorized . 
this important information will help improve congress ' oversight role on delayed notification for so-called sneak-and-peak searches in the future by providing members with this information on an annual basis . 
again , i want to thank the gentleman from wisconsin ( chairman sensenbrenner ) and his staff for once again working to address the concerns we had on delayed notification . 
we have also had many other amendments in committee , and here on the floor , that could be considered half a loaf . 
mr. speaker , i am probably the last person expected to speak on behalf of the committee or the leadership in general . 
but let me tell you , i have watched the process here in the committee on the judiciary over the past couple of years on this issue . 
i am very supportive of the sunset we have , the 10-year sunsets on the two controversial provisions . 
but i have learned on issues like this you do not get everything you want . 
and i should say it is not just the committee on the judiciary that has gone through this process . 
the permanent select committee on intelligence has had hearings as well . 
my own amendments , virtually every one of them , had democrats on them . 
i have worked with them and we have worked together on this . 
i urge a `` no '' vote on the motion to recommit and `` yes '' on the underlying bill . 
we had 12 hearings over a year on these provisions , and i want to point out what the chairman has already said , that we are not just dealing with those sections that are sunsetted but we are dealing with those that are not as well . 
this reform increases accountability in using nsls , and it clarifies that judicial review exists and challenges to both the nsl and the prohibition on disclosure are now allowed . 
it also , as the chairman mentioned , establishes additional reporting requirements to the house and senate judiciary and intelligence committees on the frequency and use of nsls . 
in addition to these safeguards on nsl authorities , the reauthorization also will add significant safeguards in a number of other areas , as the chairman mentioned . 
there are now strict time limits for those who are put on delayed notification as well as new reporting requirements to the house and senate judiciary committees . 
i also want to thank the gentleman from north carolina ( mr. coble ) xz4000760 , the chairman of the subcommittee on crime , terrorism , and homeland security , as well as the gentleman from california ( mr. schiff ) xz4003610 , for their important work on this amendment . 
mr. chairman , the edge of my district is only minutes from the port of norfolk , one of the busiest international ports on the east coast of the united states . 
more than $ 37 billion worth of goods pass through norfolk every year to travel on to all of the lower 48 states . 
the interagency commission on crime and security in u.s. seaports concluded in their report that significant criminal activity is taking place at most of the 12 seaports surveyed by the commission . 
if you have spent as much time on the waterways of our harbors as i have , you know there are often only seconds that separate a vessel occupied by terrorists and one of our commercial or naval vessels docked at a pier . 
you can not legally evade the police on our nation 's highways , and the same rule should apply to our nation 's waterways . 
the amendment we are offering today will further protect our seaports by prohibiting the use of dangerous weapons or explosives on a passenger vessel , prohibiting the transportation of dangerous materials and terrorists , and further increasing penalties for bribery affecting port security . 
mr. speaker , by direction of the committee on rules , i call up house resolution 369 and ask for its immediate consideration . 
mr. speaker , h. res. 369 is a structured rule that provides 2 hours of general debate ; 1 hour and 30 minutes is equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the committee on the judiciary and 30 minutes equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the permanent select committee on intelligence . 
further , it provides that in lieu of the amendments recommended by the committee on the judiciary and the permanent select committee on intelligence now printed in the bill , the amendment in the nature of a substitute printed in part a of the committee on rules report shall be considered as the original bill for the purpose of amendment and shall be considered as read . 
it waives all points of order against the amendment in the nature of a substitute printed in part a of the committee on rules report . 
it makes in order only those amendments printed in part b of the committee on rules report which may be offered only in the order printed in the report , may be offered only by a member designated in the report , shall be considered as read , shall be debatable for the time specified in the report equally divided and controlled by the proponent and an opponent , shall not be subject to amendment , and shall not be subject to a demand for division of the question in the house or in the committee of the whole . 
it waives all points of order against the amendments printed in part b of the committee on rules report , and it provides one motion to recommit with or without instructions . 
i would like to take this opportunity to thank the gentleman from wisconsin ( mr. sensenbrenner ) xz4003650 , the distinguished chairman of the committee on the judiciary and the author of h.r. 3199 , and , of course , the ranking member , the gentleman from michigan ( mr. conyers ) xz4000800 . 
i would also like to thank the chairman of the permanent select committee on intelligence , the gentleman from michigan ( mr. hoekstra ) xz4001820 , and the ranking member , the gentlewoman from california ( ms. harman ) xz4001660 , for their leadership on such an important piece of legislation . 
having performed these necessary reviews with substantial bipartisan involvement and testimony , both the committee on the judiciary and the permanent select committee on intelligence have produced a bill today that will strengthen our ability to fight the war on terrorism here at home . 
mr. speaker , terrorists are not relying on courier pigeons and rotary telephones to coordinate their acts of destruction . 
with respect to the usa patriot act he wrote : `` from my perspective as a prosecutor on the front lines of the fight against terrorism , it is difficult to overstate how important the usa patriot act has been to the government 's ability to preserve and protect our nation 's liberty in the face of continuing terrorist threats. '' his deputy u.s. attorney is my good friend , jim martin . 
mr. nahmias goes on to write how the provisions from this act aided in recovering a 13-year-old girl who had been lured and held captive by a man she met online . 
mr. speaker , like many of my colleagues , including the distinguished chairman of the committee on the judiciary , i am also concerned and in all honesty extremely hesitant to grant additional powers to the government . 
their efforts on this crucial issue are laudable , indeed , heroic , and they are to be commended . 
i remain confident that this congress will continue to stay on top of our security needs and continue to work for a stronger , freer america . 
59 that was made in order and that will be debated later on this afternoon , stating that the director of the fbi must personally approve any library or bookstore request for records by the fbi under section 215 . 
mr. speaker , i yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from west virginia ( mrs. capito ) xz4000610 , my colleague on the rules committee . 
mr. speaker , i am proud to yield 45 seconds to the gentleman from florida ( mr. feeney ) xz4001310 , a member of the committee on the judiciary . 
mr. speaker , i would point out to the gentleman that since his amendment passed on june 15 , great britain has been attacked twice , so circumstances have changed . 
mr. speaker , i yield back the balance of my time , and i move the previous question on the resolution . 
mr. speaker , by direction of the committee on rules , i call up house resolution 595 and ask for its immediate consideration . 
mr. speaker , i would first like to take this opportunity to thank chairmen sensenbrenner and king for all of their work in shepherding h.r. 3199 initially in the committee and then on the floor and now through the conference . 
with respect to the provisions of this legislation , mr. speaker , this conference report will make permanent many vital law enforcement tools made available for use against suspected terrorists by the usa patriot act while establishing 4-year sunsets on a few provisions such as section 206 , fisa , foreign intelligence surveillance act , multi-point wire taps , section 215 , fisa business record provisions and finally , the lone wolf provision . 
mr. speaker , terrorists are not reliant on two dixie cups and a piece of string to coordinate and plot terrorist attacks . 
additionally , this conference report , through section 215 , ensures that law enforcement will still have the ability , under thorough and extensive oversight , let me repeat , under thorough and extensive oversight , to seek out information on terrorists without tipping them off and thereby potentially compromising security and costing lives . 
mr. speaker , i yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from west virginia ( mrs. capito ) xz4000610 , my colleague on the rules committee . 
madam speaker , i will close this debate by again thanking chairmen sensenbrenner and king for their work on this important conference report . 
conservatives , liberals , moderates , democrats , republicans , independents , the aclu , the department of justice and various other organizations have all had the opportunity to voice their thoughts and concerns on the underlying bill . 
again , i want to encourage all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support both the rule and the underlying bill . 
madam speaker , i yield back the balance of my time , and i move the previous question on the resolution . 
a motion to reconsider was laid on the table . 
if a terrorist strikes on our soil we owe it to the victims of an attack to punish those responsible with the heaviest possible penalty , the death penalty . 
i was proud to work with the gentleman from texas ( mr. carter ) xz4000680 on this issue . 
if they can strike twice in the heart of london , a city on high alert , then just think what they might try to do in any city in america . 
the permanent select committee on intelligence tried to mend it , but the committee on rules did not make any of our amendments in order . 
nine of us offered responsible , common-sense amendments : to establish the traditional fisa standard for search warrants and trap and trace/pen register authorities , to ensure that the government can not seize your personal records unless they are related to a foreign power ; to tighten the ability of the fbi to conduct roving wiretaps , to ensure that only terror suspects and their enablers , not innocent americans , are wiretapped ; to re-sunset the key provisions in the act in another 4 years to assure accountability and effective congressional oversight , and specifically to sunset the lone wolf provision , enacted only 8 months ago , in 2010 ; finally , to prohibit the fbi from using the broad fisa powers to get bookstore or library documentary records , a provision which passed this house last month on a strong bipartisan vote . 
he accepted the amendment and it passed on a bipartisan vote . 
the gentleman from florida ( mr. hastings ) xz4001702 is a valued member of the committee on rules , but his own committee stripped out his amendment in the base bill and did not even allow him to offer it on the floor . 
the committee on rules should not be able to block the will of democrats and republicans on the permanent select committee on intelligence to improve the patriot act . 
the al qaeda organization that attacked us on 9/11 has changed . 
but new legal authorities , mr. chairman , on their own , will not protect us from terrorism . 
second , on the issue of reauthorizing the 16 provisions that are sunsetting , my view is `` mend it , do n't end it. '' the patriot act was passed 45 days after 9/11 , with little debate . 
we should reauthorize the patriot act , which modernized law enforcement tools , but we should clarify and tailor the authorities so that the government does not have a license to engage in fishing expeditions for your personal information or conduct fbi surveillance on innocent americans . 
the bill on the floor today is better than the original patriot act . 
but my colleagues on the permanent select committee on intelligence will describe in a moment amendments which we offered in committee and before the committee on rules . 
the good news is that the senate judiciary committee , on a bipartisan basis , has just reported a bill that includes many of them . 
so when we defend america , let us forget party labels and focus on what will provide security and liberty for the american people . 
mr. chairman , i yield 1 1/2 minutes to the gentleman from iowa ( mr. boswell ) xz4000420 , a valued member of the permanent select committee on intelligence and the only one of us successful enough to get his language adopted in the bill before us today . 
mr. chairman , i yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from california ( ms. eshoo ) xz4001240 , a member of the permanent select committee on intelligence . 
mr. chairman , as prior speakers on our side have made clear , we should be mending it , not ending it . 
mr. chairman , i yield the balance of my time to the gentlewoman from california ( ms. pelosi ) xz4003140 , minority leader and my predecessor as ranking member on the permanent select committee on intelligence . 
mr. chairman , i rise in support of this amendment on two grounds . 
i have said several times on this floor today about the patriot act that we should mend it , not end it . 
the gentleman from arizona ( mr. flake ) xz4001340 and the gentleman from california ( mr. schiff ) xz4003610 have worked on a bipartisan basis to craft something they could both support and to persuade the leadership of the committee on the judiciary and the committee on rules to embrace it . 
there is an even better way to amend section 215 , and that way has just been embraced unanimously , obviously on a bipartisan basis , by the senate committee on the judiciary , and that is to connect section 215 orders to specific facts which show the target is connected to an agent of a foreign power . 
as the chairman of the permanent select committee on intelligence just said , we did try to work out a unanimous consent request . 
the chairman of the committee on the judiciary is right . 
i agree with the chairman of the committee on the judiciary . 
madam speaker , this vote on the patriot act reauthorization is tough ; it is far from being the best bill it could be . 
first , four-year sunsets on the most controversial provisions -- section 215 orders ; section 206 roving wiretaps , and the lone wolf provision . 
second , dropping the 1-year criminal penalty on divulging that a national security letter has been received , even in a case where there is no intent to obstruct justice . 
but the `` conclusive '' presumption language makes it virtually impossible to challenge the `` gag '' order on recipients of nsls . 
to remedy this , several of us will introduce legislation to replace the `` conclusive '' presumption language with a `` rebuttable '' presumption , and to incorporate critical checks and balances on the `` front end '' of the nsl process . 
this legislation will also ensure congress is finally provided with meaningful , detailed reports on nsls , which are critical to effective oversight . 
this amendment builds on our current laws to address some of the shortfalls in our laws that we have learned about from our law enforcement since 9/11 . 
mr. chairman , i thank the gentleman for yielding me this time , and i just want to thank the chairman of the committee on the judiciary , who supports the amendment , and also the chairman of the committee on financial services , who certainly would have been concerned if the concern of the gentlewoman from california were a legitimate one regarding our language . 
this is a balanced reauthorization -- protecting civil liberties and extending the necessary provisions to help us fight the war on terror here at home . 
terrorist analysts often note that it is fairly inexpensive to carry out a single act of terror -- for example , it is estimated that the attack on the world trade center cost only $ 500 , 000 . 
the language in the conference report builds on our current laws , to address some of the shortfalls that we have learned about since september 11 . 
terrorists work to find the holes in our laws and we must make sure that we continue to be diligent to update them so that we can cut off terrorist funds and stop future attacks against us and our allies in the war on terror . 
mr. chairman , i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from michigan ( mr. rogers ) xz4003421 , the only former fbi member on the permanent select committee on intelligence . 
mr. chairman , i yield 1 minute to the gentleman from kansas ( mr. tiahrt ) xz4004050 , a member of the permanent select committee on intelligence . 
mr. chairman , as we close general debate on the u.s. patriot act , i yield 1 minute to the gentleman from wisconsin ( mr. sensenbrenner ) xz4003650 , the author of the bill , chairman of the committee on the judiciary . 
mr. chairman , i yield 1 minute to the gentleman from california ( mr. hunter ) xz4001910 , the chairman of the committee on armed services . 
mr. chairman , as i indicated earlier , the berman amendment would potentially undermine the intelligence community 's ability in the current form to collect information on terrorists by tipping the terrorists off to our sources and methods . 
the amendment would require disclosure of data mining sources and methods used to collect information on terrorists and contains no exemption for national security purposes . 
we are reminded on a daily basis around the world that those threats are real , serious , and continuing . 
i want to thank chairman sensenbrenner for his leadership in this conference and on this important legislation . 
we worked on this in the permanent select committee on intelligence . 
i am sorry to say that most of our reasonable amendments were voted down on a party-line basis . 
but to make matters worse , even those improvements made in the permanent select committee on intelligence did not find their way through the committee on rules to the floor . 
for generations , thousands upon thousands of people have come to america 's shores to be free of the oppressive hand of authorities in other countries , to be free of the fear of the knock on the door in the middle of the night , to be free of the humiliation and costs and stigma of inappropriate investigations . 
as the only member of congress from new jersey , a state which suffered great loss on september 11th , on the house permanent select committee on intelligence , i looked forward to working within the committee during our mark up of the patriot act to address a number of valid concerns that have arisen over the last few years about the sun-setting provisions . 
however , most of the important amendments that were offered were defeated on party lines . 
and what we did accomplish -- the improvements we made -- did not make it through the rules committee for consideration on the floor . 
these provisions and many others have a deep impact on the freedoms and civil liberties all americans . 
they alleged that his finger prints were found on a bag linked to the terrorist bombings in madrid , spain last year . 
i insisted on a sunset clause so that the law would expire after several years and congress would adjust the balance . 
it is for this reason that i urge my colleagues to vote `` no '' on the patriot act . 
these provisions and many others have a deep impact on the freedoms and civil liberties of all americans . 
they alleged that his fingerprints were found on a bag linked to the terrorist bombings in madrid , spain . 
mr. speaker , i rise today in strong opposition to this conference report on the patriot act . 
when this bill was on the house floor in july , i expressed grave concern about several provisions , including section 213 , which allows the so called `` sneak and peek '' searches in anyone 's home , as well as section 215 , which allows investigators broad access to any record without probable cause of a crime . 
if passed , this bill would , among other things : allow the `` sneak and peak '' searches to go on with no meaningful judicial review for at least 4 more years . 
allow the government to spy on your library book checkout habits and possibly your conversations with your attorney for at least 4 more years . 
how can any american feel `` secure in their persons , houses , papers , and effects , against unreasonable searches '' if the government is allowed to eavesdrop on a telephone conversation or secretly search a home or business and , in effect , fill in the names and locations on the search order later ? 
homeland security grant money should be distributed based on risk , not on politics . 
the conferees had a chance to correct this glaring weakness but they failed to do so , and if for no other reason , i urge my colleagues to vote no on this conference report . 
it was used against brandon mayfield , an innocent muslim american , to tap his phones , seize his property , copy his computer files , spy on his children , and take his dna , all without his knowledge . 
it has been used to deny , on account of his political beliefs , the admission to the united states of a swiss citizen and prominent muslim scholar to teach at notre dame university . 
it has been used to unconstitutionally coerce an internet service provider to divulge information about e-mail activity and web surfing on its system , and then to gag that provider from even disclosing the abuse to the public . 
it has been used to charge , detain and prosecute a muslim student in idaho for posting internet website links to objectionable materials , even though the same links were available on the u.s. government 's web site . 
because of gag restrictions , we will never know how many times it has been used to obtain reading records from libraries and bookstores , but we do know that libraries have been solicited by the department of justice -- voluntarily or under threat of the patriot act -- for reader information on more than 200 occasions since the 9/11 terrorist attacks . 
the patriot act originally had sunsets on some provisions so we could reexamine the extraordinary powers that were given to the executive branch , in a calmer atmosphere . 
by passing a bill that largely ignores the most serious abuses of the patriot act , that ignores the abuse of power by the bush administration , and which fails to give adequate resources and money to those on the `` front line '' in the fight against terrorism . 
madam speaker , i rise today in opposition to the conference report on h.r. 3199 , the usa patriot and terrorism prevention reauthorization act of 2005 . 
mr. speaker , i rise in opposition to this rule , but before i speak on the rule itself , let me say to our friends in great britain , one of our strongest allies in the fight against terrorism , we are with you . 
everybody on this floor views themselves and acts as a patriot on behalf of america , its values , and its people . 
i know that the members of this house on both sides of the aisle are united in that commitment . 
today , on this house floor the american people will see no division in our willingness to do what is necessary to fight terrorism . 
what they will see today , however , mr. speaker , is an abuse of power by the republican majority , which has deliberately and purposefully chosen to stifle a full debate on this critical legislation . 
a republican rule that has been offered today is nothing less , and i use my words carefully , than a craven failure of our congressional oversight responsibility on legislation that involves the government 's power to intrude on the lives of americans . 
why are you afraid to have a vote on the floor of the house of representatives on that provision ? 
why are you afraid to have another vote on the floor ? 
madam speaker , i thank my friend for yielding , and i urge my colleagues to vote for this important motion to instruct on the patriot act . 
i simply do not understand the reticence to include sunset provisions on a law that affects the civil liberties of every american citizen . 
because when it comes to the government 's power to intrude on the private lives of citizens , the united states congress should not give the government unchecked power to do so . 
madam speaker , this motion would recede to the senate and create a 4-year sunset on the most controversial provisions in the patriot act , orders by the secret foreign intelligence court , blank wiretap orders and the surveillance of agents of a foreign power who act alone . 
i want to join with the chairman of the permanent select committee on intelligence in opposing this amendment and just making the point that sources and methods are important . 
the committee on international relations recently held a hearing on afghanistan in which our well-informed drug enforcement administration conservatively estimated that nearly half of the formerly designated foreign terrorist organizations have links to illicit narcotics . 
in colombia , the revolutionary armed forces of colombia and the auc , which are two of these ftos , thrive on the drug trade , supporting and sustaining themselves with illicit proceeds . 
in afghanistan , most of the heroin from illicit drug production goes to europe , rather than here , and much of the profit then finances and supports anticoalition terrorists and attacks on our forces there . 
my provision will give us the tools to attack that drug-related support for terrorism and further protect america , our troops , and coalition forces on the ground in places like afghanistan . 
i have the distinction of being one of the few members on the committee on the judiciary who is not an attorney , and i got a little applause on that , i think . 
the one thing i know about what we are dealing with in terrorism is that if you leave an open window on an automobile , no amount of security will protect you . 
the recent bombings in london could have happened on american soil , and it is only through the vigilance of our many law enforcement entities that we can combat this occurrence . 
the current bill gives the issuing court blanket discretion on when law enforcement must report back on a roving wiretap . 
my amendment also requires law enforcement to report on the total number of electronic surveillances that have been conducted . 
mr. chairman , i thoroughly appreciate the opportunity to offer this amendment ; but i also want to comment that we have , as a committee , worked like never before on a bipartisan basis to dramatically improve a law when it came to civil liberties that already had good teeth when it came to the security of our people . 
i want to assure the gentlewoman from california that her concerns on electronic data and the fact that in an era of voip that we do have to look at that . 
i serve with the gentlewoman in california on many of the caucuses that deal with that . 
i look forward to both in judiciary and , quite candidly , in other committees of jurisdiction here in the congress to continue to work on properly identifying and modernizing how that is going to be interpreted . 
this was done on a bipartisan basis . 
over on the senate side there is a companion that is somewhat similar that has , i believe , a 7-day timeline , and undoubtedly we will work together in conference to reconcile those two . 
but the good work done on a bipartisan basis in the house has led to what i believe is the right compromise , although i certainly will work with the other body . 
mr. speaker , i rise to join many of my colleagues in strongly opposing the restrictive rule set forth on h.r. 3199 , the `` usa patriot and terrorism prevention reauthorization act of 2005. '' as you know , in light of the world we live in now , this is a very important piece of legislation . 
this amendment , which centers on rail and port security , should have been allowed in . 
both rail and port security are areas we as a country need to focus more attention on particularly after what took place in london 2 weeks ago and apparently another incident has taken place this morning . 
the legislation , as drafted , fails to deal with the current limitation on the ability to enforce civil judgments by victims and family members of victims of terrorist offenses . 
2. notwithstanding any other provision of this resolution the amendment specified in section 3 shall be in order as though printed after the amendment numbered 20 in the report of the committee on rules if offered by representative sanders of vermont or a designee . 
it should be commented on that this is not a definition of patriotism , of who is more patriotic than the next person , for the underlying bill exists . 
but there also should be some concerns about limiting overreach and overbroadness , with americans understanding one of the issues that we are debating today , and that is the very premise of civil liberties juxtaposed against the responsibility of fighting the war on terror . 
i would have hoped my colleagues could have fought the war on terror by enhancing and making sure that the agencies responsible for sharing intelligence are really doing that . 
then , i would have hoped my colleagues would have supported an increased funding , which has not been done by the majority , on rail security and port security and , of course , the idea of insuring our buses and other public transportation modes . 
so the question on debate today , i hope that we can center it around the question of restraint , but yet be vigorous in our fight for the war on terror . 
i hope that we will have that opportunity , and i hope as well that in the amendment that i offer that we will be able to say that if you are impacted by a terrorist act , that you can sue and enforce your civil judgement , and i hope to have mutual support on that . 
second , there are numerous provisions in both the expiring and other sections of the patriot act that have little to do with combating terrorism , intrude on our privacy and civil liberties , and have been subject to repeated abuse and misuse by the justice department . 
additionally , numerous groups ranging the political spectrum have come forward to oppose certain sections of the patriot act and to demand that congress conduct more oversight on its use , including the american civil liberties union , american conservative union , american immigration lawyers association , among these troubling provisions are those that : authorize the attorney general ( ag ) to arrest and detain non-citizens based on mere suspicion , and require that they remain in detention `` irrespective of any relief they may be eligible for or granted. '' ( in order to grant someone relief from deportation , an immigration judge must find that the person is not a terrorist , a criminal , or someone who has engaged in fraud or misrepresentation. ) when relief from deportation is granted , no person should be subject to continued detention based merely on the attorney general 's unproven suspicions . 
require the ag to bring charges against a person who has been arrested and detained as a `` certified '' terrorist suspect within 7 days , but the law does not require that those charges be based on terrorism-related offenses . 
restrictions on material support should be limited to those organizations that have officially been designated terrorist organizations . 
deny legal permanent residents readmission to the u.s. based solely on speech protected by the first amendment . 
the laws punish those who `` endorse , '' `` espouse , '' or `` persuade others to support terrorist activity or terrorist organizations. '' rather than prohibiting speech that includes violence or criminal activity , these new grounds of inadmissibility punish speech that `` undermines the united states ' efforts to reduce or eliminate terrorist activity. '' this language is unconstitutionally vague and overbroad , and will undeniably have a chilling effect on constitutionally protected speech . 
our laws should punish people who commit crimes , not punish people based on their beliefs or associations . 
while every step must be taken to protect the american public from further terrorist acts , our government must not trample on the constitution in the process and on those basic rights and protections that make american democracy so unique . 
my `` safe havens '' amendment that was made in order by the committee on rules relates to the civil forfeiture provision of 18 u.s.c . 
the legislation , h.r. 3199 , as drafted , fails to deal with the current limitation on the ability to enforce civil judgments by victims and family members of victims of terrorist offenses . 
it was used against brandon mayfield , an innocent muslim american , to tap his phones , seize his property , copy his computer , spy on his children , and take his dna , all without his knowledge . 
it 's been used to deny , on account of his political beliefs , the admission to the united states of a swiss citizen and prominent muslim scholar to teach at the notre dame university . 
it 's been used to unconstitutionally coerce an internet service provider to divulge information about e-mail activity and web surfing on its system , and then to gag the provider from even disclosing the abuse to the public . 
because of gag restrictions , we will never know how many times its been used to obtain reading records from library and book stores , but we do know that libraries have been solicited by the department of justice -- voluntarily or under threat of the patriot act -- for reader information on more than 200 occasions since september 11 . 
it 's been used to charge , detain and prosecute a muslim student in idaho for posting internet website links to objectionable materials , even though the same links were available on the u.s. government 's web site . 
mr. chairman , i yield 1 1/2 minutes to the gentleman from michigan ( mr. conyers ) xz4000800 , the distinguished ranking member of the committee on the judiciary , and thank him for his constant moral compass on civil liberties and civil rights for the american people . 
i do believe in conference we will have the opportunity to vet this and to work with all the parties concerned to finally bring some relief on this issue . 
mr. chairman , i have an amendment at the desk that has been made in order by the committee on rules , jackson-lee no . 
the legislation , h.r. 3199 , as drafted , fails to deal with the current limitation on the ability to enforce civil judgments by victims and family members of victims of terrorist offenses . 
in closing , mr. chairman , let me thank the chairman of the full committee and the ranking member and the ranking member of the subcommittee for their leadership on this whole entire issue of protecting americans against terrorism and including in that protection of their civil liberties . 
second , there are numerous provisions in both the expiring and other sections of the patriot act that have little to do with combating terrorism , intrude on our privacy and civil liberties , and have been subject to repeated abuse and misuse by the justice department . 
additionally , numerous groups ranging the political spectrum have come i sit as ranking democrat on the subcommittee on immigration , border security , and claims . 
among these troubling provisions are those that : authorize the attorney general , ag , to arrest and detain noncitizens based on mere suspicion , and require that they remain in detention `` irrespective of any relief they may be eligible for or granted. '' ( in order to grant someone relief from deportation , an immigration judge must find that the person is not a terrorist , a criminal , or someone who has engaged in fraud or misrepresentation . 
when relief from deportation is granted , no person should be subject to continued detention based merely on the attorney general 's unproven suspicions . 
require the ag to bring charges against a person who has been arrested and detained as a `` certified '' terrorist suspect within 7 days , but the law does not require that those charges be based on terrorism-related offenses . 
restrictions on material support should be limited to those organizations that have officially been designated terrorist organizations . 
deny legal permanent residents readmission to the u.s. based solely on speech protected by the first amendment . 
the laws punish those who `` endorse , '' `` espouse , '' or `` persuade others to support terrorist activity or terrorist organizations. '' rather than prohibiting speech that incites violence or criminal activity , these new grounds of inadmissibility punish speech that `` undermines the united states '' efforts to reduce or eliminate terrorist activity. '' this language is unconstitutionally vague and overbroad , and will undeniably have a chilling effect on constitutionally protected speech . 
our laws should punish people who commit crimes , not punish people based on their beliefs or associations . 
while every step must be taken to protect the american public from further terrorist acts , our government must not trample on the constitution in the process and on those basic rights and protections that make american democracy so unique .

these include : permitting large-scale investigation of americans for `` intelligence purposes. '' having minimal judicial supervision on wiretaps . 
america was built on the notion of strong protection for our privacy and civil liberties . 
mr. speaker , reauthorizing the patriot act before it expires on december 31 is literally a matter of life or death because it is helping us to win the war on terrorism . 
i urge my colleagues to vote yes on the patriot act and yes on the underlying rule . 
that 's why i created with a number of my colleagues the bipartisan congressional anti-terrorist financing task force , to bring focus on the multitude of policies , agencies and jurisdictions which have a bearing on our effort to combat terror finance . 
madam speaker , from keeping our children safe to winning the war on terrorism , we face many challenges , but few are like meth , which threatens lives , safety and health , at great cost to all of us . 
extending the provisions of the patriot act that are scheduled to expire on december 31 will allow law enforcement officers to monitor suspected terrorists ' communications and share critical intelligence information . 
this provision allows the fbi , based on the premise of conducting a terror investigation , to obtain any record , after receiving approval from a secret foreign intelligence surveillance act , fisa , court . 
this is a provision that allows for run-of-the-mill criminal investigations to be employed while conducting the war on terrorism . 
mr. chairman , i content that it is essential to protect the constitutional rights of american citizens as we engaged in the ongoing war on terrorism . 
mr. chairman , i sit here and listen to this debate , and i have been through a number of the 12-or-so hearings that we have had in the committee on the judiciary on the patriot act ; and i want to compliment this congress , this bipartisan congress , that met almost with a sense of urgency and almost a sense of emergency to write this patriot act just 3-plus years ago . 
it drops a senate provision supported by the chamber of commerce , conservatives , libraries , civil liberties organizations that set limits on secret court orders for library , medical , and other personal records . 
sunsets would make the bill better , but the rule does not permit us to vote on this important modification . 
madam speaker , today i rise in opposition to the conference report on h.r. 3199 , the usa patriot act reauthorization . 
while i do not advocate permitting many of these important terrorism-fighting tools to expire at the end of the year , the american people would be better served by a bill that strikes a more reasonable balance between protecting civil liberties and fighting the war on terrorism . 
last week , the 9/11 commission released a report card on the implementation of the group 's recommendations . 
the bill before us permits the government to go on fishing expeditions to look for information without probable cause . 
while 32 million americans use public transportation every day , we have spent only $ 250 million on transit since 9/11 , compared to the $ 18.2 billion we 've spent on aviation . 
unfortunately , the house majority has chosen to prohibit an open debate and consideration on the most sensitive and controversial issues surrounding this bill . 
this struggle will go on . 
protecting america from terrorism means inspecting cargo on passenger planes , inspecting cargo in our ports , securing 
but the underlying bill , mr. chairman , like the original patriot act , continues to trample on civil liberties . 
the bill before the house today concerns only the 16 provisions of the patriot act subject to sunset -- the provisions that have the most serious potential impact on the fundamental liberties of innocent americans if they are abused . 
because these provisions touch on the most basic liberties of citizens , we included sunsets so congress would the bill before the house takes away the sunset provisions for 14 of these sensitive provisions , and sets ineffectively long ten-year sunsets for the other two provisions . 
i had hoped that the serious shortcomings in this bill could be corrected on the floor today , but the majority has blocked a number of important amendments democrats sought to offer . 
there is also no question that the house and senate should not allow the patriot act to expire on december 31 . 
just last week , the bipartisan members of the former 9/11 commission awarded congress and the bush administration a grade of f for our failure to distribute homeland security funds on the basis of risk . 
mr. chairman , after 9/11 , i worked on the drafting of the patriot act in the committee and in the weekend drafting session , and i voted for the act on the floor . 
we have not had meaningful oversight , in my opinion , on this provision of the act . 
we need to prevent terrorism , we all agree on that ; but we also need to protect and defend the constitution that has served us so well . 
the fact is that americans are aware of this issue , and i believe this is having a chilling effect on first amendment rights in terms of reading and speaking . 
we spent nearly $ 25 billion on air security and a couple of hundred million on rail . 
as my colleague on the committee on the judiciary knows , i also serve on the committee on homeland security . 
on the other hand , i am aware that there are people in our country and in our congress who for religious reasons do not believe in the death penalty . 
i also want to say i am a member of the committee on the judiciary . 
as a member of the committee on homeland security , i am acutely aware , and we are on both sides of the aisle , i can tell you of the shortfallings that we have in our protection against terrorism . 
i do wish we could have heard from the financial services industry on this point because certainly it deserves some clarification . 
but i do want to raise that on behalf of the california banking industry that has really stepped up to avoid the fraud and crime that has occurred with remittances before they did . 
although the gentleman from texas ( mr. paul ) xz4003110 and i do not always vote together , i think he speaks wisdom this evening on the need to move beyond the narrow confines of this act . 
we are hopeful that , as this process moves forward , that the senate that has taken these issues of civil liberties more to heart on a bipartisan and i would add unanimous basis may in the end prevail so that those who are troubled by the failure to really deal with some of the constitutional issues will in the end be able to support a bill at least at the end of a conference process . 
the department of justice has stonewalled congress on telling us how they are using these powers . 
republicans met secretly and separately away from democrats on the conference committee . 
but this conference report on reauthorization of the usa patriot act fails in important ways . 
these are tens of thousands of letters , never reviewed by a judge , demanding information on countless people , the vast majority of whom may be americans innocent of any terrorist activity . 
there are no requirements for law enforcement to `` minimize '' its collection of nsls ; that is , there 's no requirement for doj to segregate the vast amount of information collected on innocent americans unconnected to any terrorist activity . 
an audit is provided which would allow doj to freely continue stockpiling information on americans without providing any standard . 
adoption of 4-year , rather than 7-year , sunsets on three provisions regarding business records searches , roving wiretaps , and so-called `` lone wolf '' terrorists acting as agents of foreign powers is positive . 
this provision would have allocated precious homeland security resources on the basis of risk . 
under the original patriot act , zero percent of formula grants are distributed on the basis of risk . 
this long overdue change has been approved by the house on three separate occasions , including in a stand-alone bill that passed by a vote of 409 to 10 in may . 
madam speaker , i rise in opposition to the conference report on h.r. 3199 , the so-called usa patriot act , because we have not taken meaningful steps to eliminate or correct the most egregious sections of this act . 
in fact , the board that we have right now has never even met and we are still waiting on confirmation of the chair and the vice chair . 
by agreeing to this conference report today , the house will effectively give up its oversight over sneak-and-peek searches , secret search orders , and surveillance authority provided by this bill given how little oversight we have had on these issues . 
while i applaud the efforts of the conferees to reduce the extension of two key provisions relating to roving wiretaps , which allows taps on multiple phones and computers of a suspect , and business and library records from 10 years to 4 years , this legislation is woefully inadequate . 
but this new provision is just the most glaring example of the lack of diligence that this congress appears to have on protecting our rights . 
i am incredibly disappointed that throughout the entire debate on this legislation , the leadership of this house has refused even to discuss the topic of civil liberties , the very issue that makes this legislation so divisive . 
madam speaker , i rise in strong opposition to the conference report on the usa patriot reauthorization act . 
i urge my colleagues to vote `` no '' on this conference report and support the democratic substitute offered by ranking member conyers , which strikes the proper balance between security and privacy . 
this morning 's incidents on the london subway only serve to heighten that anxiety . 
these time limits on certain provisions serve as critical checks on the executive branch . 
we must remember the wiretaps and secret surveillance on leaders in the civil rights and antiwar movements , and we must vow to never let those abuses happen again . 
moreover , the fbi has surreptitiously gathered information on tens of thousands of americans . 
they are maintaining databases on these citizens . 
and instead of deleting information on nsl recipients once an investigation is completed , the fbi is abusing this power and holding onto personal information of americans who have never been accused of any crime . 
as determined by a federal court judge on october 4 , 2005 , the nsl provision was ruled to be unconstitutional . 
shorter sunsets and minimal regulations imposed on the department of justice do not cure the serious problems with these provisions . 
this bill puts us on a dangerous path . 
there are over 150 provisions in this bill that are noncontroversial , that everybody agrees on , that will help track down terrorists and criminals ; but there are a few provisions that so cross the line that they threaten our privacy and our civil liberties and do not make us safer . 
with that , madam speaker , i urge my colleagues to vote `` no '' on this bill . 
democrats and republicans agreed on the need to update the tools necessary for law enforcement to address the threat of terrorism on american soil . 
section 206 's blanket , roving wiretaps , section 213 's sneak-and-peek searches , and section 215 's expansive power allowing the government to obtain any piece of information on any american are just three examples of how the patriot act is out of control . 
last week , the committee on the judiciary met to address these and other issues in an attempt to bring back some balance to the law enforcement power and civil liberties . 
democrats on the committee offered dozens of amendments in an attempt to control this bill and bring balance to it . 
virtually every single one of these amendments was rejected on a party-line vote . 
these changes that were enacted in response to the horrific terrorist attacks on our nation of september 11 , 2001 provided critical tools to our law enforcement in bringing the terrorists to justice and to stopping future attacks , and the result of this law can not be disputed . 
these tools have been critical in gathering knowledge on the activities and the targets of the terrorists . 
and while i care deeply about protecting the civil rights of law abiding americans , i do not care one iota about the civil rights of terrorists bent on destroying our way of life . 
mr. chairman , today we face a new type of enemy , an enemy who preys on the innocent , an enemy who lives in the shadows , an enemy whose tactics are the tactics of cowards . 
and as we saw in london on july 11 and as we are seeing again today , the terrorists are still out there targeting the murder of the innocent . 
and in fact i will predict that other countries will follow the lead of america and what we are doing on the floor of this house today as they enact similar protections for their citizens against these murderers . 
mr. chairman , on rollcall no . 
mr. chairman , an unforeseen consequence of these infringements on american citizens ' civil liberties is the erosion of our standing as the international leader of the rights of people . 
mr. chairman , war has been declared on this country by the islamic terrorists , and we must protect the citizens of this country . 
but before commenting on the specifics of the patriot act , i would be derelict if i did not mention that the majority party in this house and the bush administration have really been derelict by not dealing more directly with the threats that we face . 
and , two , the gag order , the nondisclosure provision , was ruled as a prior restraint on speech , the first amendment . 
it allows the recipient of a national security letter to ask that the gag order be set aside , and it sets limits on the gag order and says it has to be renewed after a certain time period and you have to apply to a court to extend it . 
so that is not really up to the judgment of the judge , and i do not think that would satisfy the court on the first amendment . 
sunsets have been the major check , albeit probably inadequate checks , on abuse of the patriot act . 
they mean that at least every 4 years congress is required to look at the law again , to revisit it , and has the opportunity to ask tough questions on the use or abuse of these powers , and most important , the administration can not stonewall these questions except for every 4 years . 
we should have to look into these burdens on our civil liberties at least one in four years and ask are these powers being abused , should they be fine tuned ? 
i call on all my colleagues , democrats and republicans , liberals and conservatives , to begin to safeguard the national security , not adequately , but to begin to safeguard the civil liberties of all americans by voting for this very , very skimpy motion to instruct . 
let me focus on two of them . 
we ought to have put some procedural safeguards on these powers such as our entire tradition demands . 
to pass this bill with no sunset of section 505 , with no procedural safeguards on these very intrusive provisions is to disregard our entire history of ordered liberty . 
if you do not pass the bill as is today , if it expires , there will be blood on your hands , because he and his side of the aisle will not allow a 3-month extension . 
well , if there is fault , if there is real danger by not extending the patriot act , it is on that side of the aisle by refusing a 3-month extension so that we can get it right . 
without a 3-month extension , there will be blood on your hands . 
the one thing that is needed to make methamphetamine is pseudoephedrine or ephedrine , and this is manufactured in only six or seven locations around the world : czechoslovakia , germany , china , southeast asia and so on . 
i want to thank chairman sensenbrenner and particularly chairman souder for their hard work on this bill , and i urge support of the underlying legislation . 
mr. speaker , i appreciate the leadership that we are getting on this . 
the interesting thing that was brought up earlier in the debate , as i watched it from my office on this rule , was that the very thing that the patriot act is supposed to give to this country , that the proponents of it say gives to this country , is being denied on this floor today , and it is being denied because i think people are afraid to be exposed to the truth . 
so i am embarrassed to be on this side of the aisle from this aspect today . 
certainly , i know that there are well-intended people on both sides , and i tried to work out a lot of things on both sides of this aisle on the patriot act . 
but i can tell my colleagues that with this rule and the lack of full and complete discussion , we have put a gag rule , the same gag rule that the fbi and the cia and the nsa or any other government agent can put on the folks at the library or down at your local business and say , i want all of those records , but you are not allowed to use them . 
but this is a very embarrassing moment when we are afraid to confront the truth and the full and unabashed debate on a subject that is so dear to us as this deserves . 
mr. chairman , anyone who was serving in congress on september 11 , 2001 , will never forget the day . 
my committee has held numerous oversight hearings on the implementation of the provisions since then . 
they should have our full support and every reasonable tool we can give them to help fight the global war on terror . 
i support the reauthorization of the patriot act and hope that we can continue to work on remaining issues -- including making the roving wiretap provision permanent . 
i am particularly concerned about the burdens the amendment would place on two law enforcement entities within the jurisdiction of committee on financial services . 
under this amendment , both the office of foreign assets control ( ofac ) and the financial crimes enforcement network ( fincen ) , which are components of the treasury department that are on the front lines of our country 's efforts to detect and combat terrorist financing , would be required to divert already scarce resources away from law enforcement in order to comply with the amendment 's overly broad and unrealistic reporting requirements . 
such regimes require careful balancing of personal privacy and law enforcement and national security priorities and can not be drafted on the fly without extensive consultation with all interested parties . 
within weeks after the horrendous terrorist attacks of 2001 , congress responded with the patriot act , providing our law enforcement and intelligence communities with much-needed tools to track down terrorists , sever their communications and funding networks , and prevent future attacks on our citizens . 
they should have our full support and every reasonable tool we can give them to help fight the global war on terror . 
its provisions are helping to put the fbi and cia on a more equal footing with terrorists , who use every available technology to plot with impunity . 
`` it is the sense of congress that the federal government should not investigate any american citizen for alleged criminal conduct solely on the basis of citizen 's membership in a nonviolent political organization or the fact that the citizen was engaging in other lawful political activity. '' it seems like this should go without saying . 
as far back as the civil war , world war i , and world war ii , very often speaking out on political issues were met with law enforcement officials actually charging them with crimes and even having individuals imprisoned . 
in the 1970s we know about the illegal wiretapping and other activities associated with watergate , and also in the 1990s we are aware of irs audits of a political and religious organization based only on the fact that they were religious and political . 
i appreciate the support for the amendment on both sides . 
we are aware of the fact that there are at least reports that federal officials have encouraged local police to actually monitor certain political groups , and we also are aware of the fact that , because of political activity , they have been placed on no-fly lists . 
as the people 's representatives , it is our responsibility to keep a close eye on the executive branch to ensure it does not abuse its power . 
in fact , a requirement that law enforcement demonstrate probable cause may help law enforcement focus their efforts on true threats , thus avoiding the problem of information overload that is handicapping the government 's efforts to identify sources of terrorists ' financing . 
mr. chairman , i thank the gentlewoman for yielding me this time , and i salute her for her extraordinary leadership on issues relating to the national security of our country , her excellent leadership as the ranking member on the permanent select committee on intelligence , and her important comments today . 
mr. chairman , as we close debate on this important bill , i want to thank again the gentleman from michigan ( mr. conyers ) xz4000800 , the gentlewoman from california ( ms. harman ) xz4001660 , and so many other colleagues on both sides of the aisle for their thoughtful consideration of this very important matter . 
and we can not , because of any negligence in terms of protecting the american people in terms of homeland security , take it out on their civil liberties . 
the war was fought on our shores and continued into the war of 1812 here . 
and today there is an attempt on the part of the republicans to eliminate the sunset of 14 of the 16 provisions and on the two remaining provisions to have a sunset of 10 years . 
in fact , the attorney general has admitted that the information on its use of the patriot act has not been forthcoming to congress in a timely manner . 
it is about whether broad surveillance powers that intrude on americans ' privacy rights contain safeguards and actually materially enhance security to target terrorists and those who wish to harm the united states , not needlessly intrude on the constitutional rights of innocent and law-abiding american citizens . 
perhaps they thought that these amendments would have been too appealing to the many members of this house on the republican side who are strong supporters of privacy rights for the american people and they did not want these amendments to pass . 
madam speaker , i thank the gentleman for yielding , and thank you , mr. conyers , our ranking member on the judiciary committee , for being such an outstanding leader in protecting our civil liberties and also the national security of our country . 
i also extend that to the democrats on the committee . 
first , let us be clear about what we are voting on today , madam speaker . 
what is before us on the floor today is the extension of certain provisions which are controversial and have the potential for abuse . 
as we have seen with this massive and unprecedented scope of national security letters , the implications of the republican failure of oversight are glaring and have a direct impact on every american . 
the list of failures goes on . 
mr. chairman , i thank the distinguished chairman for yielding me time , and especially i rise to thank the gentleman from wisconsin ( chairman sensenbrenner ) for his tireless efforts on behalf of the security and the liberty of the american people in developing this reauthorizing legislation . 
today in london we have seen yet again the work of terrorists on the soil of a freedom-loving people . 
the explosions in that city today , while less lethal than a few weeks ago , follow the deadly attacks that took place on july 7 , and the anguish in london is a vivid reminder of why we can not relent in taking the steps necessary to defend our homeland from a present terrorist threat . 
the patriot act is essential to our continued success in the war on terror here at home . 
for example , aided by provisions of the patriot act , law enforcement officials in ohio were able to arrest iyman faris , an ohio truck driver who authorities said plotted attacks on the brooklyn bridge and a central ohio shopping mall . 
the patriot act and the elements which we will reauthorize today are central to the ongoing victory in the war on terror , and i urge its adoption . 
president harry truman , i am told , had a plaque on his desk that simply read `` the buck stops here. '' it seems to me that the flake-schiff amendment is all about saying that when it comes to that sacred relationship that the american people feel between their local library and their local bookstore , that the fbi director himself or herself must be directly involved if that relationship is to be intruded upon in the name of an investigation into the war on terror . 
this amendment , as the gentleman from arizona ( mr. flake ) xz4001340 said earlier , will prevent section 215 from being abused or used in a fishing expedition intruding upon the privacy of ordinary americans in the name of the war on terror . 
again i quote president harry truman 's famous plaque or missive , `` the buck stops here. '' the flake-schiff amendment is simply about saying if the war on terror demands it , when it comes to intruding upon that sacred relationship between the american people and a bookstore or a library , we have to have those who are of the highest accountability in our political system to answer to that . 
mr. speaker , on rollcall no . 
as we all learned on september 11 , 2001 , terrorists will use any and all means available to them to attack the united states of america . 
unfortunately we have learned that mixed in with these friendly tourists are some who wish to inflict harm on our nation . 
i understand and appreciate the privacy concerns that have been expressed by many and will continue to protect civil rights and insist that the proper and regular oversight exists when possible infringements on americans ' civil rights are concerned . 
mr. chairman , i thank the gentlewoman for yielding me this time on this very important issue . 
i rise today , mr. chairman , to express my disappointment with this house for not allowing my fellow colleague on the permanent select committee on intelligence , the gentleman from florida ( mr. hastings ) xz4001702 , to offer an amendment which is important to h.r. 3199 , the usa patriot act reauthorization . 
mr. chairman , i thank the gentleman for yielding me this time and for his great work on this , and i want to thank my friends on the democrat side of the aisle for the work they have given for the patriot act . 
there was a case of a child pornographer who was producing child pornography tapes where we used the legal system , a legal instrument , through due process of law , to get records that we needed from businesses , from his home , from other places to make sure that we could find the entire network of distribution of criminals who were preying on our children . 
all we do in the patriot act is say , look , if we can go after child molesters sitting in the library and bombers who we need to sneak and peak on a warrant , we ought to be able to go after terrorists . 
mr. chairman , it is maddening to me that somebody in america and in england and around the world is getting up in the morning thinking , i am going to kill somebody in an act of terror , and that we somehow fiddle while rome is burning and argue should it be 10 years or 5 years on a renewal or a sunset . 
you should get up and argue against the criminal code every day on this floor , and you should put in bills to remove our ability as agents of the fbi to do that . 
in 2001 after an attack on the united states and the slaughter of innocent civilians , this congress passed the patriot act , which i supported at that time . 
it gave our investigative agencies a wide variety of special powers to fight terrorism and to win this war on terrorism . 
our country was founded on the idea of limited government and individual liberty . 
after 9/11 , the united states congress gave our investigative agencies a wide variety of special powers to fight a war on terrorism , an expansion of powers that we would have never approved in peacetime . 
our republic was founded on the idea that the powers of government should be limited . 
until now , the members of this body have been denied the ability to vote their conscience on the issue of sunsets . 
i support this war on terror and the war on radical islam . 
i was here yesterday fighting for a very important provision that put me against my friends on the other side of the aisle . 
but today i am asking all of my friends , on both sides of the aisle , let us be patriots . 
but , please , let us keep faith with those people who founded our country on limited government and the protection of civil liberties . 
vote `` yes '' on this provision . 
madam speaker , i rise in strong support of this motion to instruct conferees on the patriot act . 
let me note that i am one of several , if not many , members of congress who feel that it was an act of bad faith on the part of those in this body who turned the temporary sunsetted provisions of the patriot act into permanent law for the united states of america . 
on september 11 , our country was attacked and we saw 3 , 000 americans slaughtered before our eyes , and it totally justified the major expansion of the police and investigative powers of our government . 
i voted for the patriot act , as i just said , and i continue to support its provisions as a necessary expansion of police powers in order to prosecute this war on islamofacism . 
they declared war on us every bit as much as the japanese declared war on us on december 7 , 1941 . 
the expanded authority we are talking about in terms of eliminating these sunsets in the current bill , this has nothing to do with fighting the war or winning the war on terror . 
the special grants of police power that we have approved we believe should only last for the duration of the war , and we must demand at least a forced reexamination of these provisions to ensure that winning the war on terror does not result in a permanent change of our way of life . 
this should be reexamined before 10 years has lapsed if for no other reason than to just understand whether or not this tool is working for us in the war on terror . 
my colleagues on one side of the aisle say that this is an unconscionable invasion of privacy , never justified , even in wartime . 
we may have a justification to find out if someone who checked out a book on radical islam has also checked out books on how to make bombs . 
i ask my colleagues to vote on this motion to instruct conferees , and i would ask them to search their consciences about voting for a new patriot act at all that threatens to permanently change the american way of life . 
and i voted for that expansion of the police power , just as most of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle and all of my colleagues on this side of the aisle did , almost all of my colleagues on this side of the aisle voted . 
i would vote for the patriot act again because i think that these powers that were just described are needed at this moment , even the ones that were just described by my friends on the other side of the aisle . 
our founding fathers understood limitations on government is a guarantee of freedom . 
i support the war on radical islam . 
but my original support was based on the inclusion of 4-year sunsets in those sections of the patriot act , those sections that drastically expanded the police and investigative powers of the federal government . 
of the 16 sunset provisions , sections sunsetted in the original 2001 bill , the current conference committee report establishes 4-year sunsets on only two of those 16 . 
as the war on terrorism continues , i can support these expanded powers . 
however , this effort to use the war as a way to alter forever the balance of personal liberty and legitimate restraints on government power should be defeated . 
long after the war on terrorism is won , under permanent sneak-and-peek rules , american citizens will have their homes and businesses searched without court order and without legal notification for a month after that search is conducted . 
long after the threat of islamic extremism is over , under permanent secret search rules , americans will have their business records , phone records , credit records and computer files seized without a judge issuing a warrant based on probable cause . 
my central theme has always been based on the need for periodic review by congress of all those dramatic expansions of police power that we are giving our government now in order to win this war on terrorism . 
my objection , however , is that h.r. 3199 retains numerous objectionable provisions of the patriot act that intrude on our privacy and civil liberties , have been subject to repeated abuse and misuse by the justice department , and have little to do with combating terrorism . 
it was used against brandon mayfield , an innocent muslim american , to tap his phones , seize his property , copy his computer files , spy on his children , and take his dna , all without his knowledge . 
h.r. 3199 also extends or makes permanent 16 provisions of the patriot act concerning the government 's expanded surveillance authorities , which are otherwise scheduled to sunset on december 31 , 2005 . 
it is simply irresponsible to make these provisions permanent when there continues to be wide spread concern that these sections of the patriot act can lead to violations of individual civil liberties , as well as tread on our country 's professed support of basic civil rights for all individuals . 
the lessons of september 11 are that if we allow law enforcement to do their work free of political interference , if we give them adequate resources and modern technologies , we can protect our citizens without intruding on our liberties . 
as a member of the permanent select committee on intelligence , i hold this oversight responsibility as one , if not my most , important function . 
the house permanent select committee on intelligence held two open hearings for the patriot act . 
additional time is needed to assess many of these provisions ' effectiveness and impact on civil liberties , and that is why we need to call for sunsets . 
i rise in opposition not just because an important amendment that i offered , along with the gentleman from michigan ( mr. conyers ) xz4000800 , the gentleman from texas ( mr. paul ) xz4003110 , the gentleman from new york ( mr. nadler ) xz4002890 , the gentleman from new mexico ( mr. udall ) xz4004122 , and the gentlewoman from california ( ms. eshoo ) xz4001240 was not accepted by the committee on rules , but because this very same amendment has already been passed on the floor of this house by a 51-vote margin just a few weeks ago . 
on june 15 , by a vote of 238-187 , this body voted overwhelmingly for the exact same amendment which would stop the fbi and other government agencies from going into our libraries and book stores without probable cause . 
we voted on that by a 238-187 vote ; and now , a few weeks later , this provision is not included in the bill , and the republican leadership has refused to allow the members to even vote on it . 
in the 1960s , a president of the united states had a file on him , president kennedy , by the fbi . 
i urge a `` no '' vote on the rule . 
in that regard , i am happy to say that there has been a very strong coming together of members of congress and americans from very different political perspectives , people who usually agree on nothing but who have come together to protect the constitutional rights of the american people as we fight terrorism . 
we should be very proud that , on this issue , such diverse groups as the aclu , the american conservative union , the gun owners of america , the u.s. chamber of commerce , the american library association and the american book sellers association have come together to say to congress , please support the senate version . 
please vote no on this conference report . 
it is burdensome upon each of the departments that it requires this disclosure to be brought forward , and as a matter of fact , the explanation that the gentleman just gave saying that makes it only available to hpsci and ssci , the two intelligence committees , does not include the committee on armed services , which has great responsibility for military defense intelligence . 
this amendment is substantially similar to one i offered in the committee on the judiciary with the gentlewoman from california ( ms. waters ) xz4004220 , but one i agreed to withdraw in order to work with the gentleman from arizona ( mr. flake ) xz4001340 in a bipartisan fashion on a proposal for consideration on the house floor . 
even if possibly based on misplaced fears , some of the public are now apprehensive about going to their local library or bookstore . 
during the committee on the judiciary markup last week , i offered an additional amendment to section 215 that would have lifted the prohibition on disclosure when a united states citizen was impacted and when the investigation had concluded if there was no good cause to continue to prohibit the disclosure . 
unfortunately , this amendment was rejected on party lines . 
while i am appreciative that the committee on rules made the flake-schiff amendment in order , i am disappointed that the sanders amendment was not also made in order . 
i believe that this house and the american people are better served if all proposals are duly and fairly considered on the house floor . 
mr. chairman , i yield 30 seconds to the distinguished ranking member of the subcommittee on crime , the gentleman from virginia ( mr. scott ) xz4003641 . 
i want to conclude by thanking my colleague , the gentleman from arizona ( mr. flake ) xz4001340 for his work on this issue . 
the fact that the library provision has not been used as of the last public disclosure does not affect the fact that many americans are concerned about their expectation of privacy when they go to the library , when they check out books on family matters , on health matters , on other matters . 
and because this has an impact on the behavior of americans , on the freedom to use libraries , it is an important issue , merely that fear . 
mr. chairman , earlier this year i introduced the reducing crime and terrorism at america 's seaports act of 2005 along with my colleague the gentleman from north carolina ( mr. coble ) xz4000760 , chairman of the committee on the judiciary subcommittee on crime , terrorism , and homeland security . 
today , i offer the text of this important legislation as an amendment to the patriot reauthorization bill , joined by my colleague the gentleman from north carolina ( chairman coble ) of the committee on the judiciary , as well as the gentleman from virginia ( mr. forbes ) xz4001370 , another colleague on the committee on the judiciary . 
this amendment makes common sense changes to our criminal laws to deter and prevent terrorist attacks on our ports , our sea vessels , and cracks down on the theft and smuggling of cargo . 
mr. chairman , i am happy to yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from virginia ( mr. scott ) xz4003641 , the ranking member of the subcommittee on crime , terrorism , and homeland security . 
when i offered this originally as stand-alone legislation in connection with another bill as an amendment , the chairman offered to work with me on this further down the line ; and every bit true to his word , he has been a great partner to work with on this . 
millions of truck-sized cargo containers are offloaded on to u.s. docks . 
as a part of the homeland security authorization bill , the house took some important steps to improve the screening of cargo by expanding the container security initiative and refocusing it based on risk . 
we considered a bill on the same day of the second bombing in great britain with no money for port security , no money to secure our rails or bus transportation , no money for first responders . 
the major check on any abuse in the act has been the sunset provisions . 
during our deliberations , we got a lot of cooperation on those provisions that are sunsetting . 
when asked information on those , we got the information . 
mr. chairman , we need to defeat this bill , go back to the committee on the judiciary and establish a much better piece of legislation that will protect our privacy and ensure our safety . 
1992 and 1993 , which involve wrecking trains and attacks on mass transportation systems . 
mr. chairman , if we are going to deal with attacks on mass transit , it would be helpful if we would put the money into port security and rail security and bus security and fund those resources . 
mr. chairman , i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from michigan ( mr. conyers ) xz4000800 , the ranking member of the committee on the judiciary . 
we could have got the definition straight , and we could have considered it in a more deliberative process rather than trying to deal with it here on the floor where we have some constitutional questions such as the death penalty for conspiracy . 
it has death penalties , some of which push the envelope on constitutionality , because some can be imposed even if there is no intent to kill ; they are broad enough to even include deaths which result from violating the stowaway statute . 
as to the other parts of the bill , i would like to thank the gentleman from california ( mr. schiff ) xz4003610 and the other cosponsors for their hard work in focusing us on port security , which is desperately needed . 
we have not had the opportunity to hear critical testimony on controversial aspects of this bill such as the provision to apply the death penalty to offenses where no death results , the change in alternative jury rules and peremptory challenge rules , another change of the number of jurors needed to impose the death penalty and other changes which could constitute constitutional problems . 
i would remind him that the hearing was a hearing on habeas corpus , also the same hearing we heard the issue of the question of whether the death penalty deters murder or other crimes , and this bill . 
so to suggest that that was a fair hearing , i think , does not do justice to actually what happened on that day and the consideration of this bill . 
mr. chairman , this amendment emphasizes a point that we are trying to do this on the floor without a mark-up , and it may have many unintended consequences . 
i mean , a senior citizen who has traveled to cuba on a bicycle excursion or a clergy attempting to send humanitarian services or supplies to cuba could get caught up in this . 
the current house bill provisions for 10 year sunsets on the 215 and 206 roving wiretap powers is not much better than no sunset at all . 
for most of the 4-year period leading up to the sunsets , the justice department refused any meaningful oversight of their patriot act powers and other war on terror authorities . 
perhaps some of the pending lawsuits will finally reveal what has been going on in this area . 
the problem with a 10-year sunset is that it will have no impact on the current administration , or the next one and only have an impact in the last year of the 3rd administration from now . 
accordingly , we should accede to the senate sunset provisions which call for 4-year sunsets on the three most controversial and worrisome patriot powers -- secret acquisition of library and other business records , roving wiretaps , and the `` lone wolf '' provision for terrorism investigations , which allows a single individual to fall under the extraordinary , secretly administered foreign surveillance powers otherwise reserved for use against agents of foreign governments or organizations . 
on that day , foreign terrorists maliciously and without provocation attacked the united states , murdered thousands of our citizens , and destroyed symbols of our freedom in a failed effort to break the spirit and resolve of the american people . 
while the patriot act and other anti-terrorism initiatives have helped avert additional attacks on our soil , that threat has not receded . 
when the house committee on the judiciary reported the patriot act in october 2001 , i pledged to rigorously examine its implementation and the conduct of the war against terrorism . 
since april of this year alone , the committee has received testimony from 35 witnesses during 12 hearings on the patriot act . 
the legislation also explicitly clarifies that a section 215 order will issue only `` if the judge finds that the requirements have been met , '' and provides the committee on the judiciary last week conducted a nearly 12-hour markup of this legislation , at which 43 amendments were offered and debated . 
the reported version of this legislation extends for 10 years the sunset on sections 206 and 215 of the patriot act . 
this sunset provision was approved by the committee by an overwhelming bipartisan vote of 26 to 2. however , while the legislation sets expiration dates on certain provisions of the patriot act , congressional oversight of the entire patriot act must be perpetual . 
i would urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this vital legislation . 
mr. chairman , reclaiming my time , i am pleased that this bill and the usa patriot act will continue to protect civil liberties , while also providing law enforcement the tools they need to fight terrorists intent on harming americans . 
now , the gentleman from california ( mr. rohrabacher ) xz4003430 is the chairman of an oversight subcommittee on the committee on international relations . 
i do not see any sunsets coming on bills coming out of the committee on international relations because i have faith in the gentleman from california 's ( mr. rohrabacher ) xz4003430 being able to do effective oversight . 
the committee on the judiciary has done a huge amount of oversight . 
there has been more process and more hearings and more witnesses on more sides of the issue on the patriot act than practically any other piece of legislation that i have faced in my 26-plus years as a member of congress . 
i wish i had brought all of the paper that has come about as a result of the committee on the judiciary 's oversight , because it would stack this high off the table here in the house chamber .

oversight : house judiciary committee oversight of the usa patriot act & lt ; p & gt ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; oversight through letters to the department of justice house judiciary committee sent the attorney general , john ashcroft , a letter on june 13 , 2002 , with 50 detailed questions on the implementation of the usa patriot act . 
assistant attorney general , daniel bryant , responded to chairman sensenbrenner and ranking member mr. conyers xz4000800 on july 26 , 2002 , providing lengthy responses to 28 out of the 50 questions submitted . 
on august 26 , 2002 , mr. bryant sent the responses to the remaining questions , after sending responses to six of the questions to the house permanent select committee on intelligence . 
then , on september 20 , 2002 , mr. bryant sent the minority additional information regarding the department of justice 's responses to these questions . 
on april 1 , 2003 , chairman sensenbrenner and ranking member mr. conyers xz4000800 sent a second letter to the department of justice with additional questions regarding the use of pre-existing authorities and the new authorities conferred by the usa patriot act . 
on june 13 , 2003 , the assistant secretary for legislative affairs at the department of homeland security , pamela j. turner , sent responses to the forwarded questions . 
on november 20 , 2003 , chairman sensenbrenner and congressman hostettler , chairman of the subcommittee on immigration , border security , and claims , sent a letter to the comptroller general of the government accountability office ( gao ) requesting a gao study of the implementation of the usa patriot act anti-money laundering provisions . 
this report was released on june 6 , 2005 . 
on may 20 , 2003 , the committee 's subcommittee on the constitution held an oversight hearing entitled , `` anti-terrorism investigations and the fourth amendment after september 11th : where and when can government go to prevent terrorist attacks. '' on june 5 , 2003 , the attorney general testified before the full committee on the judiciary at an oversight hearing on the united states department of justice . 
both the hearing on may 20 and the hearing on june 5 discussed oversight aspects of the usa patriot act . 
the subcommittee on crime , terrorism , and homeland security of this committee requested that officials from the department of justice appear and answer questions regarding the implementation of the usa patriot act . 
in response to our request , the department of justice gave two separate briefings to members , counsel , and staff : during the briefing held on august 7 , 2003 , department officials covered the long-standing authority for law enforcement to conduct delayed searches and collect business records , as well as the effect of the usa patriot act on those authorities . 
during the second briefing , held on february 3 , 2004 , the department of justice discussed its views of s. 1709 , the `` security and freedom ensured ( safe ) act of 2003 '' and h.r. 3352 , the house companion bill , as both bills proposed changes to the usa patriot act . 
the department of justice has also provided three classified briefings on the use of the foreign intelligence surveillance act ( fisa ) under the usa patriot act for members of the judiciary committee : on june 10 , 2003 , october 29 , 2003 , and june 7 , 2005 the justice department provided these briefings . 
the department also provided a law enforcement sensitive briefing on fisa to the house judiciary committee members and staff on march 22 , 2005 . 
mr. chairman , we have heard another attack on delayed notification or sneak-and-peek warrants . 
a u.s. district judge in washington state executed or authorized a delayed-notification warrant to look into a building on the u.s. side of the northern border . 
using a delayed-notice search warrant , the dea and other agents entered the home on july 2 to examine the tunnel . 
these bags were loaded into a van on the u.s. side and driven south for delivery . 
she has not looked at the oversight that the committee on the judiciary has done over the last 3 1/2 years . 
mr. chairman , i believe this amendment is a good one because it centralizes responsibility in the hands of the director of the fbi in signing off on 215 applications for bookstore and library records . 
and let me say first that the amendment that was made by the patriot act to allow a federal judge , and only a federal judge , to authorize a roving wiretap simply brought the law up to where the technology has gone because before the patriot act was passed you could not get an effective wiretap order on a cell phone . 
so the terrorists and the drug smugglers and the racketeers simply conducted their business on cell phones because you could not determine whether or not the cell phone was actually being used within the district in which the federal court that issued the roving wiretap order sat . 
that , frankly , insults what both democrats and republicans have done on oversight of the patriot act on a bipartisan basis . 
right here is the result of the oversight that the judiciary committee has done in the last 3 1/2 years on this law . 
i doubt that any other committee of congress has done as much oversight on a single law as my committee has done on the patriot act . 
and if john doe is really involved in criminal or terrorist activities , that is going to be a tip-off that the feds are on the heels of john and maybe he ought to flee the country or do other things to eliminate the evidence that would be used to convict that person of the crime that he has either committed or a crime that he is in a conspiracy with others to commit . 
mr. chairman , i would like to give members today a very vivid pictorial example on how these warrants work . 
using a delayed notification search warrant , the dea and other federal agents entered a home along the border between washington state and canada on july 2 , 2005 , because there was information that the first-ever tunnel under the border between canada and the united states has being used for drug trafficking . 
this is a picture of the u.s. entrance to the tunnel on our side of the border , very close to canada . 
but on the canadian side of the border the entrance to the tunnel was in a building . 
all it does is require a report to congress on data mining by agencies . 
i grant the members that the amendment probably is not properly drafted and we can fix this in conference , and i appreciate the commitment of the chairman of the permanent select committee on intelligence to do that , but i do not think we should turn it down and send a message to the agencies that they can data mine all they want and we are not going to do anything about it . 
what this amendment does is simply add the following predicates to allow law enforcement to go to a judge to seek a wiretap order : crimes of terrorism such as arson , plastic explosives , attacks on a federal facility with firearms , and conspiracy to harm persons or property overseas . 
let me say that this amendment has a direct impact on the war against terrorism . 
when he was testifying on the reauthorization of the patriot act , deputy attorney general james kolbe testified that the first material support for a terrorism case to be tried before a jury involved a group of hezbollah operatives who had been operating a massive interstate cigarette smuggling scheme . 
an aircraft that is brought down by a laser will kill people just as dead if they have passengers on it or if it is a cargo plane or general aviation aircraft or a government plane . 
as a result , in the last congress the committee on the judiciary and the select committee on homeland security worked out an agreement where the formula would be modified , where there would be certain floors for states , a lot of the money would be threat-based and the types of grants were consolidated so that there would be a simpler application process . 
the committee on the judiciary has spent a lot of time overseeing the justice department , with oversight letters , questions that the gentleman from michigan ( mr. conyers ) xz4000800 and i have sent jointly to the justice department , inspector general reports , and this is the result of it : almost two feet of responses . 
now , we have had 12 hearings on the patriot act , the 16 sunsetted provisions . 
so i think it is appropriate to have a sunset on the lone wolf provision simply because we do not have the experience of being able to examine what the justice department has done with this new and expanded authority . 
on the other hand , let me say that we are negotiating with the senate at the present time on what the length of the sunset is , and i think that the sunset on this provision will be longer than 4 years , and the sunset on the other two provisions that were contained in the house-passed bill will be shorter than the 10 years that the house of representatives placed in the bill , which was passed and sent over to the other body . 
we have been kind of like tough school marms with the department of justice because when they were late and when they were nonresponsive to the questions , we required the department of justice to come up with responsive answers , and those responsive answers we placed on the committee 's web site so that anybody with internet access could be able to find out what the questions were and what the answers were , with the exception of responses that were classified and which were sent to the intelligence committee rather than to the judiciary committee . 
we have received those reports by the inspector general of the department of justice on a regular and on a timely basis , and the answer to how many civil liberties violations have been proven is none . 
further , i resisted a premature repeal or extension of the sunset prior to this congress because i felt it was important that the oversight be done for as long a time as possible so that the congress will be able to look over the shoulder of the department of justice and find out whether or not they were doing it the right way or whether or not they needed a tap on the shoulder from capitol hill for improvements in their methods of operation . 
the house committee on the judiciary had 12 separate hearings on the patriot act 's sunset provisions . 
and as long as i am the chairman of the committee , there will be vigorous oversight of the department of justice , not only on how they are handling the patriot act but how they are handling all of the other laws that the committee has oversight jurisdiction over . 
madam speaker , i am really disappointed that the gentleman from california ( mr. rohrabacher ) xz4003430 , whom i consider to be my friend , has said that the extensive oversight and the 12 hearings that the judiciary committee has done on a bipartisan basis is irrelevant . 
and when we had the hearings before the judiciary committee subcommittee on crime , the minority had at least one and , in some cases , two witnesses that could come in and present any information that they wanted to present . 
but what has been declared unconstitutional was a provision on national security letters that was put in the patriot act as a renumbering , but which was enacted as a result of a bill that originated in the other body in 1986 . 
and i have , i am looking at the federal criminal code and the national security letters that have been complained of by people on the other side of the aisle ; they are not sunsetted . 
mr. speaker , i ask unanimous consent that all members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the motion to instruct currently pending . 
mr. speaker , we have had a pretty extensive debate on this motion to instruct . 
on the other hand , after listening to the debate that has been going on here for the last 40 or 45 minutes or so , what we have heard from the people who have complained about the patriot act is the potential for abuse rather than abuse itself . 
and where there has to be a greater scrutiny on it , such as the two provisions in the house-passed bill and the lone wolf provision that are being talked about , we can talk about future sunsets ; and i support the concept of doing that . 
but simply going around and painting with a broad brush the justice department for the potential of abuse which has not happened , i think , is unfair and does not go to the debate of whether the patriot act has actually served to protect the people of the united states without trampling on their civil liberties . 
madam speaker , pursuant to house resolution 595 , i call up the conference report on the bill ( h.r. 3199 ) to extend and modify authorities needed to combat terrorism , and for other purposes . 
madam speaker , i ask unanimous consent that all members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the conference report to accompany h.r. 3199 currently under consideration . 
madam speaker , my staff has prepared for me an opening statement on this bill , and i am going to put the opening statement in the record and not read it , because after listening to the debate on the rule that was just concluded , the amount of misinformation and misleading information that has been placed in the & lt ; /em & gt ; & lt ; em & gt ; congressional record relating to the usa patriot act is just absolutely astounding . 
first of all , let me say that when the original patriot act was enacted in october of 2001 , there were expanded powers that were given to law enforcement in 16 sections , and i was the person that insisted upon a 4-year sunset being placed on each and every one of the powers of law enforcement that were expanded . 
i have heard allegations that have been made on the other side of the aisle that there has been no oversight by the judiciary committee and that we were lacking and that we were negligent in doing the oversight . 
i would submit that there has been no other provision of current law that has been subjected to as extensive oversight as the judiciary committee has done on a bipartisan basis on the usa patriot act . 
the judiciary committee and its subcommittee on crime , terrorism and homeland security has done oversight through briefings . 
and i said that , when the time came to do the reauthorization , the judiciary committee would deal with the reauthorization on a section-by-section basis . 
and this conference report , even though the national security letters provisions were not contained in the patriot act , put restrictions on national security letters so that there would be increased disclosure and a potential judicial review process . 
if it is voted down , all of these protections for civil liberties will go down with this conference report , and we will be back to the existing patriot act under the proposal that has been advocated by my distinguished ranking member from michigan ( mr. conyers ) xz4000800 and members on the other side of the capitol building . 
and if there is one thing the 9/11 commission said repeatedly , it is that the stovepiping of intelligence information between various agencies of the federal government prevented our government from being able to try to connect the dots to see what the terrorists were doing before 3 , 000 people were killed on september 11 , 2001 . 
and anybody who has a lot of discretion , whether it is the attorney general of the united states or the cop on the beat , has the potential of abusing the discretion . 
the inspector general 's reports to congress on abuses of the patriot act that are required by the original law have said that there are none . 
since its enactment , u.s. law enforcement and intelligence authorities have utilized these tools to gain critical knowledge of the intentions of foreign-based terrorists while preempting terrorist threats on our own soil . 
without congressional passage of this conference report , key provisions of the patriot act will no longer be available to our law enforcement on january 1 , 2006 -- two weeks away . 
passing these anti-methamphetamine provisions is vital , and i congratulate the gentleman from indiana , mr. souder , for his leadership on this issue . 
h.r. 3199 , which passed the house by a wide margin on july 21 , 2005 , reflected bipartisan congressional consideration consisting of legislative and oversight hearings , inspector general reports , briefings , and committee correspondence . 
the conference report establishes additional requirements on the utilization of national security letters , including congressional disclosure of the frequency of their use , and enhances congressional oversight of electronic and other types of surveillance . 
many of these changes were requested by minority conferees , and the absence of any of their signatures on this vital conference report is disappointing . 
i wish to recognize the important contributions of the following staff who spent much of the last several months working on this historic legislation . 
from the house committee on the judiciary : philip kiko ; sean mclaughlin ; beth sokul ; mindy barry ; mike volkov ; and robert tracci .

it requires the attorney general and the director of national intelligence to submit to congress a report on the feasibility of applying minimization procedures to nsl to ensure the protection of constitutional rights of united states persons , and it requires an annual public reporting on national security letters , including the aggregate number of requests made by the justice department for information concerning different u.s. persons . 
madam speaker , i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from ohio ( mr. chabot ) xz4000710 , the distinguished chairman of the subcommittee on the constitution . 
the conference report on the delayed notification search warrant limits initial delayed notification to only 30 days unless the facts justify a later date . 
and it has new reporting requirements on the use of delayed notification warrants . 
it is limitations on how long a magistrate judge , a judicial officer , can delay notification of the warrants . 
madam speaker , the gentleman from michigan talked about the conclusive presumption provisions on national security letters that are contained in the conference report as well as the requirements that have been changed relative to section 215 , which is the business records or library provisions . 
listening to the litany that has come from the gentleman from michigan and folks on the other side of the aisle , you would think that halloween is tomorrow , because there is an attempt to scare the american public . 
the brandon mayfield case which has been cited by others on the other side of the aisle was relating not to the patriot act but a mistake in fingerprint identification . 
madam speaker , on that i demand the yeas and nays . 
i offer a thanks to the gentleman from wisconsin ( mr. sensenbrenner ) xz4003650 , chairman of the committee on the judiciary , and the gentleman from california ( mr. dreier ) xz4001150 , chairman of the committee on rules , who made in order my request for an amendment . 
on two separate occasions , an individual directed a laser beam at the cockpit of a small passenger airplane and at a port authority police department helicopter . 
it is our duty to give law enforcement the tools it needs to protect pilots , passengers , and civilians on the ground . 
additionally , this amendment would ensure the protection of everyone engaged in the operation of an aircraft from those in the air to those navigating on the ground . 
i am very proud of this product that we are working on . 
the strategy that we used to have of containment , react and mutually assured destruction went out the window on 9/11 . 
madam speaker , the patriot act has been an important law enforcement tool in the years following the dastardly terrorist attacks on our country , and taken as a whole , the bill has enhanced our national security . 
and , it creates several new federal crimes , such as laws outlawing terrorists ' attacks on mass transit and increases penalties for many other violations of the law . 
this drug epidemic has been especially hard on rural areas . 
it is ironic that on consideration of a bill which seeks to protect our freedoms , our freedom to debate and amend the legislation has been strictly curtailed , as is too often the case in this body . 
by party line votes , the republicans on the committee on rules at the direction of the leadership refused to allow consideration of critical amendments that address these issues , and there are four particular issues i want to discuss this morning , reforms which democrats believe are critical . 
second is the fact that the important work of the permanent select committee on intelligence was cast aside by the house leadership . 
the version of the bill voted out of the committee on a near unanimous vote in that committee included a provision which allowed for a sunset review of the lone wolf provision of this bill , which was not included in the final version . 
the chairman of the committee on the judiciary stated last night in the committee on rules that sunset review is not necessary in the future because he and his staff are providing all the oversight needed of the justice department , the fbi , and the patriot act . 
also , agencies have proven to be more responsive to congressional oversight when a sunset review is looming on the horizon . 
mr. speaker , i yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from california ( ms. harman ) xz4001660 , the ranking member of the permanent select committee on intelligence . 
mr. speaker , i am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from mississippi ( mr. thompson ) xz4004021 , the ranking member of the committee on homeland security . 
mr. speaker , i am going to ask for a `` no '' vote on the previous question so that i can amend the rule and allow the house to consider the sanders amendment that was rejected in the committee on rules last night on a straight party-line vote . 
i might also add that the extraordinarily important otter amendment on the egregious sneak-and-peak law was voted down on a 9 to 4 vote last night . 
it is clear that the patriot act 's provisions on the search of library and bookstore records are overly broad and undermine our basic constitutional rights . 
please vote `` no '' on the previous question . 
mr. speaker , i ask unanimous consent to print the text of the amendment immediately prior to the vote on the previous question . 
mr. speaker , i object to the vote on the ground that a quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not present . 
the patriot act was a long-overdue measure that enhanced our ability to collect crucial intelligence information on the global terrorist network . 
mr. chairman , our success in preventing another attack on the american homeland would have been much less likely without the patriot act . 
that lesson was learned on september 11 , 2001 . 
the original patriot act was a long overdue measure that enhanced our ability to gather crucial intelligence information on the global terrorist network . 
this conference report renews many of those provisions and improves on the original legislation . 
also , i am placing in the record an op-ed that appeared in the washington times on december 13 , titled `` preserving the patriot act. '' preserving the patriot act the proverbial rubber is about to meet the road . 
that would be particularly true if the patriot act 's most vociferous critics on the left and their less numerous ( and most unlikely ) bedfellows on the right get their way . 
they tend to characterize the act as an assault on the basic freedoms enshrined in the bill of rights and have sought far-reaching changes in the tools it provides law enforcement to detect and prevent terrorist plots inside the united states . 
this has not had any noticeable effect on americans ' reading habits . 
the patriot act only made business records ( including those of libraries ) available on roughly the same terms in national security cases as they have long been in criminal cases . 
on both the business records and delayed notification sections of the patriot act ( among others ) , the stance of the american civil liberties union and like-minded critics seems to have an ulterior motive . 
they appear intent on reopening settled case law on use of these authorities on crimes unrelated to terror . 
the original patriot act as a whole infringed only modestly on our civil liberties and did not meaningfully intrude on the privacy rights of law-abiding americans . 
mr. chairman , i thank the distinguished chairman of the committee on international relations for yielding me this time and for his continued leadership on narcotics issues as we tackle these questions at the international level . 
as far as mandatory minimums , i hope there are mandatory minimums on people funding direct terrorist attacks on the united states . 
as they start to interconnect , we need laws that can address this , and i commend the chairman from the committee on international relations with trying to address this rapidly growing threat in all regions of the world . 
this is certainly the biggest , and last night we passed chairman boehlert and congressman gordon 's environmental meth bill , but this is the biggest comprehensive bill on meth that we have ever had in front of the united states congress , and it is important that we pass this . 
in particular , i would like to thank representatives mark kennedy , darlene hooley of oregon , dave reichert and john peterson , because they provided much of the content of this comprehensive bill and their consistently strong leadership on the house floor . 
congressman tom osborne has crusaded on this house floor and across the country on behalf of anti-meth legislation , as has congressmen baird , wamp , boozman , king , gordon and so many others . 
in particular , i 'd like to thank representative mark kennedy , representative darlene hooley , representative dave reichert , and representative john peterson for providing much of the content of this bill , and for their consistently strong leadership on the house floor on meth issues . 
as chairman of the government reform committee 's subcommittee on criminal justice , drug policy and human resources , i have held 11 hearings on the meth epidemic since 2001 , not only in washington , dc , but in places as diverse as rural arkansas , ohio , oregon , and indiana , suburban minnesota , island of hawaii , and urban detroit . 
there are regional and local variations on the problem , of course , but one thing remains constant everywhere : this is a drug almost unique in its combination of cheapness , ease of manufacture , and devastating impact on the user and his or her community . 
second , the damage this drug causes is not confined to the addict alone ; it has terrible effects on everyone around the user , particularly children . 
of all the many members of congress who worked on this legislation , no one got everything he or she wanted . 
it has searched homes without warrants and listened in on phone conversations without any reasonable justification . 
the cargo that rides aboard almost every commercial flight remains unsecured , but a new jersey man faces up to 20 years in prison under the patriot act for looking at star 's with his seven year old daughter because he shone a laser beam on an airplane . 
mr. chairman , searching my constituents ' homes and not telling them , collecting information about what they read , and tracking their e-mail and web usage is a war on liberty to create a false sense of security . 
for example , the formerly bedrock principle that government can not spy on you unless it provides strong evidence of wrongdoing to a judge no longer exists in america . 
while no amount of success in the war on terror could justify the patriot act , it is especially tragic that we have little to show for 5 years of police-state tactics . 
most were convicted on technicalities having nothing to do with the patriot act . 
in other words , the war on terrorism is just an irrelevant excuse for the expanded power of government to find out what books you buy , send undercover agents to your community group meetings , or search your home without a warrant . 
the patriot act is a war on liberty to create a false sense of security . 
so i am very pleased that the committee on the judiciary incorporated that provision and also raised criminal penalties for cargo theft , which is included in this bill . 
as it now stands , mr. chairman , punishment for cargo theft is a relative slap on the wrist . 
mr. chairman , this is a commonsense cargo theft provision , along with efforts to strengthen our seaport security , vitally effective tools in our war on terrorism . 
as it now stands , mr. chairman , punishment for cargo theft is a relative slap on the wrist . 
these common-sense cargo theft provisions , along with the efforts to strengthen our seaport security , will be vital and effective tools in our war on terror . 
mr. chairman , i thank my colleagues on the judiciary committee for including this language , and i urge this house to pass this amendment and the underlying bill . 
we have worked on a number of things , including this , for quite some time . 
the gentlewoman from new york ( mrs. lowey ) xz4002460 and i have worked on this now for a number of years , and i am thrilled we are offering it here . 
frederick douglass once said , `` the life of a nation is secure only while the nation is honest , truthful and virtuous. '' i have heard a lot of comments the last few weeks from folks saying this bill is needed for the war on terrorism . 
as the ranking member on the committee on homeland security and someone who has seen firsthand what our government is and is not doing to keep us safe at home , i am here to set the record straight . 
how good of a terrorism fighting tool is it if it has not been part of our war on terror yet ? 
i am disappointed that our colleagues on the other side of the aisle refused to allow an amendment offered to extend the sunsets for a few years . 
the attack on london 2 weeks ago was a wake-up call , yet the administration did not expand our own nation 's efforts to protect our transit system . 
i am probably one of a few members of congress who has been spied on by his own government . 
during the civil rights movement , an agency in the mississippi state government called the state sovereignty commission kept files on me and countless other people working for change . 
from this experience , i have known that , when government has the authority to spy on its own people , it is almost always and will misuse that power . 
i am also opposed to the conference report because it fails to include the provision in the house bill that would allocate more homeland security funds based on risk . 
the 9/11 commission explicitly recommended that homeland security funds be allocated based on risk . 
the ?9/11 commission members recently said that if the house funding measures were passed , congress would have received an a grade instead of an f on fulfilling its recommendation . 
we must focus our scarce homeland security resources on areas that are most at risk of terrorist attack . 
the challenge we have in the war on terrorism is looking around for those pieces that matter and trying to fit them together . 
maybe there are some protections that we can come up with that help address the concerns of the chairman of the committee on the judiciary , but i think to simply add more reporting requirements and have these people filling out more paperwork when they really ought to be figuring out who the terrorists are and what they are up to is a misuse of their time . 
mr. chairman , i thank the gentleman for his leadership on this action as well as others that involve the permanent select committee on intelligence . 
we have heard comments about how there is no judicial oversight for what is going on . 
mr. chairman , almost four years ago , our country was traumatized by the vicious attacks on september 11 , 2001 . 
in the years since , we have seen these senseless attacks continue on our allies across the world . 
the gravity of the situation is not lost on me , or any of my colleagues in this chamber . 
on october 24 , 2001 , a justified sense of urgency resulted in an unjustifiably rushed vote on the patriot act . 
i have received over 3 , 000 letters and emails from constituents on this issue , and i have met with hundreds of constituents in my district to discuss the patriot act in town hall meetings . 
all amendments brought to the rules committee that would have shortened the sunset period , so that congress could continue to conduct important oversight and review of this legislation , were not allowed a vote on the floor . 
why , then , does the majority insist on giving this section a blanket renewal for 10 years ? 
i think that if we were allowed a vote on an amendment to section 215 , for example , a majority of members would probably support it . 
in their final report , the 9/11 commissioners brilliantly stated , `` the choice between security and liberty is a false choice , '' and that `` if our liberties are curtailed , we lose the values that we are struggling to defend. '' we must continue to encourage debate on this law , the events leading up to its passage , and the long-term implications . 
on october 24 , 2001 , a justified sense of urgency resulted in an unjustifiably rushed vote on the patriot act . 
the senate version contained greater restrictions on the government 's power and required higher standards for record demands . 
madam speaker , i rise to explain my decision to vote against the conference report on the patriot act . 
let me focus on 2 of these issues -- the inadequate checks on the national security letters and the foreign intelligence surveillance act court orders . 
`` foreign intelligence surveillance act '' ( fisa ) court orders for tangible things ( section 215 ) : ( 1 ) unlike the senate bill , the conference report allows the government to obtain personal information on a mere showing of `` relevance '' , thereby striking the safeguard contained in the senate passed bill that required a 3-part test . 
it is important that any policy that is advanced to enhance our nation 's security always maintains appropriate `` sunshine '' and checks and balances on those law enforcement and intelligence agencies that are empowered to promote national security . 
the conference report on the patriot act that is before us today fails to strike the proper balance . 
so we are not just attacking the problem , but we are dealing with the aftermath of this deadly plague on america called methamphetamine production . 
a second on the patriot act . 
the patriot act is misleading american citizens and causing them to forfeit their civil liberties in the interest of what has become a political war on terrorism . 
at the same time , the president 's war on terrorism fails to fund protection for our transportation systems , our ports and , still today , uninspected cargo is being placed in the belly of the airplanes of all of our airlines . 
furthermore , this section contains an automatic permanent gag order on the recipient of a national security letter , not even allowing the recipient to consult with an attorney . 
the judge found that the government seizure of these records constituted an unreasonable search and seizure under the fourth amendment , and found the broad gag provision to be an unconstitutional prior restraint on free speech . 
not only do they believe it , but they are selling it to you based on fear and intimidation . 
there are those on the other side of the aisle who have gotten up today and said i talked to a constituent who complained about the patriot act and i said to that constituent how have you been harmed , and the constituent could not explain it . 
i stand here in the congress of the united states questioning the wisdom of my colleagues on the patriot act , and i dare anyone to say i am unpatriotic because i do it . 
because i do not believe that , i dare to question those on the other side of the aisle and those on this side of the aisle . 
i dare those who would wish to stand up and challenge me and charge me with not being patriotic because i do so to get up here and debate me now on patriotism . 
i hope that somewhere in america , in some fourth and fifth grade out there , there are teachers who are watching the debate on the patriot act . 
i hope that the teachers are able to say watch the debate on the floor of the congress of the united states so that you can understand that there are some intrusions that are taking place today with the patriot act that fly in the face of the constitution . 
and so when we passed the patriot act originally , our effort was to try to find a new security balance for people here in our country , and we thought we had done a tremendous job of doing that in the judiciary committee , only to find that the rules committee , which did not even have any jurisdiction over the matter or had any hearings about the matter , took the bill , rewrote it , brought it to the floor and struck a completely different balance between the rights of government on one hand and law enforcement and the rights of individuals on the other hand . 
but the truth of the matter is that depends on how you define an abuse . 
if we wait on something outrageous to happen , then we will react back in the opposite direction of against government and law enforcement in unreasonable ways , just as we are reacting in favor of law enforcement now . 
in a letter to the gentleman from virginia ( mr. scott ) xz4003641 , the department of justice said on july 5 , 2005 that that section had been used 153 times as of january 2005 . 
mr. chairman , i thank the gentleman for yielding me this time and for his leadership on this issue . 
over the last several months , the committee on the judiciary has had numerous oversight hearings , as has the house permanent select committee on intelligence , to look at the patriot act and see where we need to improve it and what we need to do to extend the expiring provisions . 
my colleague from southern california said that we should have sunsets on this because once we have peace we should not have these provisions . 
it appears now that its authors were always interested in a permanent clampdown on civil liberties . 
mr. speaker , the president and his administration continue its rhetoric that anyone calling for a withdrawal of troops or questioning the intelligence that led us into the iraq war is unpatriotic , while , on the other hand , using this war as an excuse , a patriot act was passed that recklessly violates our civil liberties and attacks the very freedoms our troops in iraq are told that they are fighting to protect . 
this administration and the leadership in this very house we are standing in has tried every trick in the book to spread the blame , pass the buck on this misguided war . 
though they did not seem to care one bit about the facts before 9/11 , they now believe the united states will benefit from hoarding insignificant and ill-gotten information on innocent americans . 
the real patriots have been those who stand up and question the misleading intelligence and dishonest tactics that got us into this war , those who have challenged the patriot act and its impact on the civil rights and civil liberties of every american . 
vote `` no '' on this patriot act . 
nearly four years ago and shortly after terrorists maliciously killed thousands of americans on september 11 , 2001 , congress passed the patriot act . 
as a member of the committee and the subcommittee of jurisdiction , the subcommittee on crime of the committee on the judiciary , i have spent countless hours going over the records , including looking at top secret reports that are lodged with this congress , and i will state for the record i can find no evidence of a violation of civil liberties . 
i authored the amendment in the committee on the judiciary to require two sunsets of the two most controversial provisions in this bill , but i did not do that based on any suggestion there is any record of a violation of civil liberties . 
in the committee on the judiciary , with respect to this bill , the bill was available on a friday . 
we marked it up on a wednesday . 
i can recall being a member of that committee when i was in the minority when we received the bill on the midnight before we were supposed to consider things . 
mr. speaker , we considered over 50 amendments in the committee on the judiciary . 
we on the majority side were willing to stay there for several more days . 
it was the minority who made the motion to call the previous question and withdrew consideration of more amendments on their side . 
this is a structured bill that has something on the order of 20 amendments available , covering many of the issues that people are concerned about . 
this is an important day for us today , not just because of the explosions that have taken place in london today or those that took place several weeks ago , but rather because of 9/11 and our response to that wake-up call of the war on terrorism . 
while it is important to avoid hyperbole on such a serious matter , the very nature of american life and the traditional regard for liberty could itself be threatened . 
rather , they must be applied to the facts which confront us in the war on terrorism . 
the 12 oversight hearings conducted by the committee on the judiciary produced no evidence of abuse relating to the act itself . 
i hope other members have taken the time to go to the permanent select committee on intelligence , as i have , to review the documents that are filed pursuant to the patriot act by the justice department , to see for themselves whether or not they have found any evidence of abuse . 
and i have heard on the floor people reciting : well , the ig for the justice department has not found them , we have not found them , but we know they are there . 
the provisions contained in the chairman 's bill and the amendments adopted by the committee on the judiciary provide additional protections against any possible abuse in the future . 
on these and other parts of this bill , we have done the work in the committee to deal with the problems that have been suggested . 
therefore , i hope they would not object to the gentleman 's amendment , because this is going to be used very , very seldom , based on past history . 
so i would hope that we would have strong support for this amendment , recognizing that this , along with the other changes that we have added to section 215 , will allow us to have this still be utilized and utilized in a way that is not undone , as i thought the amendment that we had on the floor just a few weeks ago would have done so . 
accordingly , the committee rose ; and the speaker pro tempore ( mr. putnam ) xz4003280 having assumed the chair , mr. hastings xz4001702 of washington , acting chairman of the committee of the whole house on the state of the union , reported that that committee , having had under consideration the bill ( h.r. 3199 ) to extend and modify authorities needed to combat terrorism , and for other purposes , had come to no resolution thereon . 
that is illegal drugs that end up on the streets of our cities , the cities of our allies , poisoning the fabric of their society and our society . 
the fact of the matter is , many of the complaints registered by my friends on the other side of the aisle are taken care of in this conference report . 
if you vote down the conference report , those sections that are not subject to sunset will continue on without any of the changes that the chairman has articulated . 
the distinction that must be drawn is that , in the war on terrorism , it is not good enough to collect the evidence after a terrorist attack to try and bring people to justice . 
while it is important to avoid hyperbole on such a serious matter , the very nature of american life -- and the traditional regard for liberty -- could itself be threatened . 
this was evidenced by the fact that opponents of the act resorted to attacks on the circumstances at guantanamo , and the creppy memo -- issues related to the wider war on terrorism but unrelated to the patriot act itself . 
if the documents sought pertain to sensitive categories of records -- such as library , bookstore , tax returns , firearms sales , educational and medical records -- the fbi director , deputy director , or the official in charge of intelligence must personally sign off on the application before it can be submitted to the court . 
section 108 of the conference report imposes several additional safeguards on the use of roving surveillance : the conference report requires that the order describe the specific target in detail when authorizing a roving wiretap for a target whose identity is not known . 
the conference report specifies that the fisa court must find that the possibility of the target thwarting surveillance is based on specific facts in the application . 
the conference report places a limit of 30 days on an initial request or on a later date certain if the facts justify such a delay . 
i ran on a platform of freedom like most people did in this congress . 
if they were , under the patriot act 's intrusive infringement on america 's book purchases and library records , when the most recent episode in the harry potter book series was released last friday , we would have had hundreds of thousands of children `` burned at the stake. '' and i know this analogy might seem a bit extreme , but that is just how extreme things can become without proper checks and balances when restricting our civil liberties and freedoms , which is why we should support the paul amendment , because true freedom of expression is an important thing to preserve . 
mr. speaker , in the entire realm of human history there exists periods of time when evil people bent on destroying good , wholesome , wonderful ways of life get enough power to try to do that and to create chaos and to literally try to send us into a dark age . 
we have taken each other on . 
we have got sunsets on the two most controversial provisions . 
but i am grateful , i am glad for the amendments we were able to inject on providing for an attorney and allowing for appeal under 215 . 
mr. chairman , i want to thank the gentleman from wisconsin ( mr. sensenbrenner ) xz4003650 for his leadership on this important legislation , and i rise today in support of this bill . 
i worked with the joint terrorism task forces fighting this war on terror in the trenches . 
i know firsthand that this patriot act provides the necessary tools to win this war on terror at home . 
but the patriot act provides many other tools for law enforcement in this war on terrorism . 
we owe it to the citizens of this country to reauthorize the patriot act , for if we do not and another terrorist attack occurs on our shores we will surely all be held accountable . 
mr. speaker , the patriot act was passed in october 2001 in response to the horrendous terrorist attacks on our country . 
the surest way to ensure this oversight is to place sunsets on those provisions of the legislation that can be abused . 
unfortunately , this bill places sunsets on only two of the original 16 provisions , making the rest permanent . 
mr. speaker , the civil liberties of the american people are too important and the potential for abuse too great for us not to place sunsets on all of the 16 provisions . 
as representatives , we are elected by the american people , and it is our duty to ensure that the numerous federal agencies of which we have oversight and that we fund on an annual basis serve the taxpayers efficiently and effectively , and i think from the images that we have seen and from the reports from that area of the country , we have had serious problems . 
to those who are critical of the makeup of this committee , i say to them , the united states congress has responded in similar fashion 41 times , most recently with the formation of the select committee on homeland security in 2002 and 2003 . 
mr. speaker , we must form this bipartisan committee quickly so that the members from both sides of the aisle can begin the vital task of finding the problems that plagued the response to hurricane katrina on the local , state and federal levels . 
mr. speaker , the minority objects to house resolution 437 on the basis that the bipartisan committee it creates will be inherently unbalanced and unfair . 
one suspects they believe it will be unfair largely because while they will have full rights of representation on the committee in question , they will inevitably be the minority on any panel that fairly represents the composition of both the house of representatives and the other body . 
as the minority in this house for 11 years , i fear my friends on the other side of the aisle have lost their faith in the american people , because of the choices they have made at the ballot box in recent years . 
having served as a member of a seemingly permanent minority in the oklahoma state senate earlier in my career , i understand the frustration on which that sentiment is based . 
my colleagues on the other side of the aisle often complain there is insufficient congressional oversight . 
there were , in fact , many investigations in this congress about the tragedy that took place on 9/11 , the permanent select committee on intelligence amongst them . 
i also would suspect that the situation between a deliberate attack on the united states and a natural disaster are very different . 
mr. speaker , time and time again here on the floor of the house i hear speeches : `` we will never forget 9/11 ; we will better prepare and defend america. '' but the most basic lesson of september 11 , where we tragically lost so many first responders in the collapse of the towers , was that they lacked secure interoperable communications . 
well , hurricane katrina was not a terrorist attack , but the federal response was worse and degraded from the capabilities that we had on 9/11 . 
on that day , fema was a high-functioning , independent , professionally run agency . 
today , it is subsumed into this gigantic morass of the homeland security bureaucracy , downgraded to subagency level with a political hack as its director , and most of the professional staff has resigned and gone on to run state management agencies around the country . 
we had a vote on the floor to restore its independent agency status . 
will the other side of the aisle fess up , like the white house never does , that they were wrong to follow the lead of the white house to downgrade this agency , to politicize it , subsume it in a huge bureaucracy , and that we are less capable than we were on 9/11 to respond to these types of disasters ? 
that would be greatly preferable to this coverup that is going to go on here . 
mr. speaker , by direction of the committee on rules , i call up house resolution 439 and ask for its immediate consideration . 
our initial focus has been on restoring hope and rebuilding community on the gulf coast . 
critical personnel are still on the ground and actively involved in a time-sensitive , decision-making process . 
mr. speaker , i am happy to yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from charleston , west virginia ( mrs. capito ) xz4000610 , my very good friend and hardworking member of the committee on rules . 
once again , i think it is important to note , as my colleague and friend from west virginia said , that we are the elected representatives of the american people and this is our constitutionally mandated responsibility which we should not pass on to someone else . 
mr. speaker , i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from oklahoma ( mr. cole ) xz4000770 , a hard-working member of the committee on rules . 
mr. speaker , i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from marietta , georgia ( mr. gingrey ) xz4001510 , a hard-working member of the committee on rules . 
mr. speaker , as we deal with this great challenge , one can not help but think back to the days following one of the most tragic events in our nation 's history , that being , of course , the attacks on the world trade center , flight 93 going down in pennsylvania and , of course , the plane hitting the pentagon . 
they came together committed to ensuring that we would never see the kind of terrorist threat that happened on september 11 hit the united states or our allies or anyone in the world again . 
and that really embarked us upon this massive global war on terror , and that has been the focus of the federal government . 
we know that the top priority on september 11 , 2001 , became this bipartisan goal of trying to deal with the global war on terror . 
mr. speaker , i am very proud of the democrats in this house who have come together in a bipartisan way to work with republicans in our shared goal of winning the global war on terror . 
it is an important struggle , and it is one which many say will last beyond our lifetimes , but i am convinced that democrats and republicans will continue to work together to ensure that we win that global war on terror . 
it was a natural disaster that hit our fellow americans , our fellow citizens , on the gulf coast . 
we in california deal with the threat of fires on a regular basis . 
in california , one of the most prominent was the northridge earthquake on january 16 of 1994 . 
speaker hastert has just called for members of the committee on appropriations to go to the gulf coast to look at this situation and to report back to us , because the very important responsibility of oversight right now that the committee on appropriations has over the $ 60 billion-plus that we , in a bipartisan way , have appropriated to deal with this , needs to be addressed . 
i know that is not a popular thing to say ; but i serve on the committee on rules , and by virtue of that , i think it makes me an institutionalist . 
now , i will acknowledge that , on occasion , the committee on rules can be a very partisan place ; but on occasion we also can be very bipartisan . 
we just reported out a rule that enjoyed strong bipartisan support dealing with coast guard reauthorization , and passage of rules like that are noncontroversial , they do not get attention , and those are things that we have worked on . 
in fact , i would argue that we do more things coming out of even the committee on rules in a bipartisan way than we do the things that we do that are very , very strident and partisan . 
but if you look at other committees around this place , mr. speaker , such as the committee on transportation , the committee on energy and commerce , the committee on financial services , you can go right down the line , democrats and republicans come together to address major public policy concerns that are out there . 
we have seen tremendous loss from people like the gentleman from louisiana ( mr. jindal ) xz4006340 on our side . 
because article i , section 8 of the u.s. constitution makes it very clear that we have the responsibility for congressional oversight , oversight of the executive branch ; and this bipartisan select committee , mr. speaker , will focus not just on the federal government . 
it will focus on state government , on local governments , on even private entities that have been involved in this process . 
the reason that i believe that it is important for us to move quickly is that , as i said , hurricane ophelia is at this moment posing a threat to the carolinas , and there are other disasters on the horizon . 
the previous question shall be considered as ordered on the bill to final passage without intervening motion except : ( 1 ) one hour equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the committee on rules ; and ( 2 ) one motion to recommit. '' mr. speaker , i yield back the balance of my time , and i move the previous question on the resolution . 
i want to point out to my friends on the other side of the aisle that we are still in the hurricane season . 
i point out we were not focusing just on the federal aspects of this , as they would like us to do , but we are also focusing on the local and state aspects of this . 
my colleagues on the other side of the aisle know that is true . 
we have the staff within this congress on both sides of the aisle , both in the majority and on the minority , and hopefully we would not spend more than $ 500 , 000 to get this work done and get it done in a bipartisan fashion . 
mr. speaker , i thank the gentlewoman from new york ( ms. slaughter ) xz4003780 , the distinguished ranking democratic member on the house committee on rules , for yielding me this time . 
i hope the irony is not lost on the house that the gentlewoman , a new york member , is being lectured to about homeland security issues and why there is no need for an independent katrina commission . 
new yorkers were told 3 and 4 years ago that there was no need for an independent commission on 9/11 . 
i note peripherally that the distinguished chairman of the committee on rules has other business and has left the floor ; but i was prepared to ask him , and perhaps his replacement in the chair for the majority can answer for me , what did the house of representatives do in the last 3 years with reference to the tragedy of 9/11 ? 
the chairman pontificates that we should exercise our constitutional mandate ; and so does his replacement , my friend and colleague on the committee on rules , say what our constitutional duty is . 
we saw that a once-reliable agency had been placed on the back burner as an afterthought in the department of homeland security . 
our delegation literally begged the committees of jurisdiction to hold hearings on what we saw in florida . 
i even introduced bipartisan legislation in march with our colleague on the majority side , the gentleman from florida ( mr. shaw ) xz4003690 , to address what we perceived to be fema 's largest problems . 
yet every time we took our concerns to the committees , we were told it is not a big enough problem to consider on its own . 
in stark contrast to the 9/11 commission , republicans outnumber democrats on the majority 's partisan katrina commission . 
shamefully , the house will not have an opportunity to vote on the hastings-menendez independent katrina commission legislation , because republicans have blocked us from offering it . 
mr. speaker , i beg to differ with the gentleman about what the permanent select committee on intelligence did . 
i serve on the permanent select committee on intelligence . 
the senate permanent select committee on intelligence conducted an investigation ; the house did nothing . 
there has been no meaningful oversight , no tough investigations on anything . 
mr. speaker , for so many reasons my colleagues on this side of the aisle have articulated , this resolution should be rejected . 
the committee on appropriations chairmen of both houses , the leadership , the republican leadership of both houses , are they going to investigate that themselves ? 
that is why , when they are asked on this question , 75 percent of the american people want a 9/11 commission . 
mr. speaker , i thank the ranking member , the gentlewoman from new york ( ms. slaughter ) xz4003780 , for yielding me this time and commend the members of the committee on rules for their important work on this subject , particularly the gentleman from florida ( mr. hastings ) xz4001701 who is the author of the legislation , along with the gentleman from new jersey ( mr. menendez ) xz4002720 , the chairman of our caucus , on legislation which will bring truth to this situation , an independent commission , modeled after 9/11 , respected by the american people . 
so on behalf of the people in the region , i plead with my colleagues in this body to reject any sham committee . 
so the choice on the floor today , we have heard all of this discussion over and over . 
instead , we are wasting the public 's time on a subject that is unworthy of this tragedy , and it did not have to be . 
at the time , i intended it just to be on the positive side , and that was early , when katrina was just hitting , and then when we saw things go wrong , we added the charge that we would see what went wrong . 
sometimes it is really important , as we try to find our common ground , we stand our ground where we can not find that common ground , but we always have to come down in favor of the people , to yield on points . 
the gentleman from mississippi ( mr. taylor ) xz4003992 spoke with such eloquence on the floor yesterday . 
senator landrieu , in the senate last week , brought the nation to tears with her presentation on what she saw in her beloved state of louisiana . 
the gentleman from mississippi ( mr. thompson ) xz4004021 , our ranking member on the committee on homeland security , spoke from authority in standing on the committee but experience as a mississippian . 
we can find the truth with the gentleman from florida ( mr. hastings ) xz4001701 , the gentleman from new jersey 's ( mr. menendez ) xz4002720 commission , senator i stand open and welcome to any cooperation with the republicans when the speaker is ready to cooperate on true bipartisanship , true openness , and true accountability to the american people . 
mr. speaker , on tuesday , president bush said that he took responsibility for the recent failure of the federal government to fulfill its ultimate duty of saving the lives of its own people within its own borders . 
they tell us that the structure of the committee is based on precedent and cite the bipartisan commission which investigated the iran-contra affair as evidence of this . 
last night , in the committee on rules , they told us , rather incredibly , that nobody is better to evaluate in this body than its own members . 
mr. speaker , i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from massachusetts ( mr. mcgovern ) xz4002630 , a member of the committee on rules . 
mr. speaker , i am pleased to yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from california ( ms. matsui ) xz4006631 , a member of the committee on rules . 
mr. speaker , i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from mississippi ( mr. thompson ) xz4004021 , the ranking member on the committee on homeland security . 
i ask for a `` no '' vote on the previous question so i can amend the rule and allow the house , instead of h. res. 437 , to consider h.r. 3764 , which creates an independent 9/11-like commission to investigate the events involving hurricane katrina . 
i offered this amendment in the committee on rules last night , but , sadly , it was rejected . 
please vote `` no '' on the previous question so we can authorize an independent commission that will not be influenced by partisan politics instead of a republican-controlled committee investigating the failings of a republican-controlled administration . 
mr. speaker , i ask unanimous consent that the text of the amendment be printed in the record immediately prior to the vote on the previous question . 
mr. speaker , i object to the vote on the ground that a quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not present . 
in my role as ranking member of the committee on homeland security , i have looked for answers and have tried to put together a timeline of events . 
on september 20 , they sent the largest contingent ever to travel to new york city to view the devastation of the world trade center and console the families of the victims . 
indeed , i have twice requested the committee on homeland security to travel to the area and was refused . 
mr. speaker , on rollcall no . 
we were also eyewitnesses to the tragedy of hundreds of thousands of people who had escaped the wrath of the terrible storm only to then be stranded in the superdome , the convention center , or trapped on the roofs , surrounded by rising flood waters with little in the way of food , water , or medical care . 
if we find ourselves in dire circumstances , can my constituents be assured that they can count on prompt federal government response ? 
landowners have little incentive to conserve species on their property . 
buried in this manager 's amendment in dry language is a contest between florida developers on the one hand and florida manatees on the other . 
after losing in court , some boaters and marine contractors have come to congress asking for special favors so they can continue their development without addressing the impacts on the endangered manatee . 
by way of background , this section would allow those applying for dock permits to simply prove that their activities would not , quote-unquote , jeopardize , would not jeopardize the continued existence of endangered and threatened marine mammal species as mandated by the endangered species act , section 7. today , under existing law they must prove that their activities would have only a negligible impact on these species as mandated by the marine mammal protection act , section 101 . 
they lost a lawsuit on july 13 , 2005 , against the fish and wildlife service in which the court found that the marine mammal protection act does in fact apply to dock-building activities that would lead to incidental take of marine mammals , and specifically manatees in florida 's inland waters . 
this amendment , therefore , is rushed into this particular bill , just part of the manager 's amendment ; it would undermine the process that has gone on for several years that the state of florida and the fish and wildlife service have engaged in to recover manatees in florida . 
finally , the minority and majority have already reached agreements and passed a version of the marine mammal protection act out of the committee on resources , and this amendment flies directly in the face of that process . 
this legislation modernizes the endangered species act , or esa , to allow for more scientific review , better conservation plans , and to focus on a recovery process that is based on collaboration and not conflict . 
you have got to watch every step that you take because you are afraid you are going to step on an endangered species . 
it has even been suggested that traffic be slowed down on interstate 10 . 
so people are suggesting when we travel on that freeway that you should reduce your speed limit from 65 to 25 miles an hour because we might endanger this fly and hit this fly . 
can my colleagues imagine the traffic congestion in the area , the impact it would have in that area , on the flow of goods and others that would not be able to be moved ? 
the esa is related to the development that led the city to default on bonds . 
on that levee they found 43 bushes . 
the bushes were not part of the endangered species act , but a beetle who could potentially live in those bushes was , even though no beetle was found in those 43 bushes that grew up on that levee after it was built . 
as it was brought to the committee on rules last night , i noticed that it has been consistently called the `` bipartisan substitute. '' it does have eight cosponsors that are bipartisan . 
but i would note that the actual bill itself has 95 co-sponsors and it has four times as many democrats on the bill itself as the so-called `` bipartisan substitute. '' so i would like to speak a bit about the bipartisan bill that is actually before us as well . 
i have one of my good constituents , mr. child , who bought 500 acres of land and found an endangered species on it . 
the problem is not that the snail was on it . 
the problem is that 90 percent of the habitat for endangered species is on private property . 
in my district , hardworking families are struggling to absorb the high costs of fuel into their budget while putting food on their tables and sending their children to college . 
the original project designs were developed based on the equivalent of what is now called a fast-moving category 3 hurricane that might strike the coastal louisiana region once in 200-300 years . 
the other body is not exactly about to rush to judgment with a measure on the floor . 
this is a bad idea on philosophical and legal grounds , but this is an especially bad time to expose taxpayers to such a burden . 
both the bill and the substitute eliminate the current requirements for setting aside critical habitat and rely instead on recovery plans to save endangered and threatened species . 
what we could not accept was language weakening the act by , for example , making recovery plans unenforceable , sit on a shelf , gather dust or making it too easy for the federal government to take actions that would harm species . 
mr. chairman , i yield 3 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from maryland ( mr. gilchrest ) xz4001490 , a valued member from the committee on resources . 
mr. chairman , i yield 3 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from new jersey ( mr. saxton ) xz4003590 , an informed and valued member of the committee on resources . 
the developer then could request permission to build , say , a hotel on the property without doing much more than outlining the proposal on the back of an envelope . 
then the developer could propose to build a landfill on the same site and go through the same process again and get money from the government again . 
then the developer could propose to build a store on the same site and get money from the government again because the store could not be built . 
in the meantime , the developer could proceed with the same project on other portions of the property , make substantial profits on his property , and never have that affect the steady stream of payments coming from the government from what was always known to be a problematic site . 
that is why the same concerns that we have expressed to our colleagues on the floor today have been expressed by the administration in the statement of administration policy , which is otherwise supportive of the bill , in part because of the provisions that we also have in our substitute . 
the committee on resources has put a lot of hard work into and has come up with a product that , in many respects , is just wonderful , necessary . 
but section 13 is absolutely , totally unacceptable for a whole lot of very good reasons , and it is unacceptable to the taxpayers of america because , boy , does this impose a burden on them . 
mr. chairman , in washington everything looks perfect on paper and people hate to admit they made a mistake ; but the truth of the matter is how it works in real life is completely different , and we have a responsibility to make those changes . 
i believe that the gentleman from california ( chairman pombo ) and other members of the house committee on resources have worked very hard to come up with a piece of legislation that protects property owners ' rights and improves the way that we protect and rehabilitate endangered species , and i am proud to be an original cosponsor of this legislation . 
i visited a country back during the spring that no citizen in that country could own property or they could lease it for 25 years or 99 years ; and , mr. chairman , i do not believe america wants to return to that fundamental time where we could not own property , we could just live on property owned by somebody else . 
i encourage my colleagues to vote `` no '' on the miller substitute amendment and `` yes '' on the final passage of h.r. 3824 . 
i would like to congratulate the gentleman from california ( mr. pombo ) xz4003220 on many , many years of hard work on this issue . 
on the other hand , the underlying bill is a good bill . 
i am put in the unenviable position today , as a lifelong democrat , to have to stand and oppose the democratic position on this rule . 
as i have sat here and listened to the debate on the rule , i simply do not feel that some of the statements by my colleagues are accurately reflecting what is in the bill as it currently is written . 
it is simply untrue that this bill allows skyscrapers to be built on the prairie to endanger species . 
we had a vote recently on this floor of over 400 members who said exactly that in one of the eminent domain cases that was recently challenged , when the supreme court took someone 's property . 
those in support of the substitute have been distributing a handout , and in the substitute it says virtually everything that the gentleman from california ( mr. pombo ) xz4003220 and i and others have written and coordinated on . 
there is 10 percent disagreement on this bill , and virtually what that 10 percent disagreement is , is whether or not people are going to be compensated when their land is taken and the fact that there has been a new focus , according to some of my colleagues , of putting the onus of this bill mainly on to public lands . 
well , the reality is most of the endangered species , in fact , 90 percent of the endangered species , are on private lands . 
at that time , it was clearly understood that the ultimate goal of the act was to focus federal resources on listed species so that , in time , they could be returned to a healthy state and be removed from the list . 
i am in full support of the threatened and endangered species recovery act that we are hearing today because i think it is an innovative and creative approach to ending the long-running conflict between protecting species and enforcing conservation actions on private land . 
one must wonder , if it can be found on 4 million acres , then is it truly endangered ; or , on the flip side , are all 4 million acres truly critical habitat ? 
now we are here battling it out on the floor against one another , and another opportunity could be lost for us to move the ball forward together . 
i am proud of this bill , and i am proud of the work that chairman pombo and his staff have done to create a document that is truly a compromise , and it is a real shame we could not agree on these last few things . 
mr. chairman , i believe it is critical for us to make sure we do not change the regulatory landscape on property owners regulated under existing law . 
based on that premise , i believe the threatened and endangered species recovery act should include a grandfather clause to cover any esa permits or approvals issued prior to the date of enactment of this bill , not just habitat conservation plans . 
i want to conclude by saying i thank the gentleman from west virginia ( mr. rahall ) xz4003310 for his offering of working on this piece of legislation , and we do so in the spirit of cooperation . 
it establishes recovery plans based on biology . 
it establishes recovery habitat based on those recovery plans . 
this provision is crucial , especially to the little guy who does not have millions and millions of dollars to higher lawyers , biologists and surveyors needed to take on the service . 
the fact that the substitute includes the same repeal of critical habit speaks volumes for the overall consensus that this act needs to be changed and updated to reflect the evolving circumstances on the ground that have impeded the accurate critical habit designations . 
he only gets compensated for what he was currently doing on the property , and that is just simply an erroneous statement to say anything else . 
the first clarification is that when the fish and wildlife service compensates an owner for a restriction on his property , it is done through a deed restriction or a fee title . 
i would ask my colleagues to cast an `` aye '' vote on the underlying bill and oppose the substitute . 
mr. chairman , i thank the gentleman for yielding me this time and for his tremendous work on this legislation . 
while there have been successes in species recovery since enactment of the 32-year-old endangered species act , most would agree that it is in need of real reform to make it more effective in species recovery , less demanding on some landowners , and less prone to lawsuits and bureaucracy . 
this bipartisan substitute is a more pragmatic solution , and i urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support it . 
mr. chairman , would the chairman of the committee on resources agree to enter into a colloquy ? 
these modifications can be based not only on species that are threatened or endangered , but also on species that are proposed to be listed , candidate species , and distinct population segments . 
is the intent of the legislation to broaden the scope of the esa by allowing the government to regulate species that are not yet threatened or endangered by imposing new potential regulatory requirements , withholding of permits and licenses , or requiring special stipulations on federal leases ? 
that was the way that i read the bill too , and i wanted the congressional intent to be on the record . 
i think there is some fair consensus on that . 
there are some serious problems with the bill that was unveiled last week , hastily pushed through the committee on resources , and further changed last evening by a manager 's amendment which few have seen . 
if you ranch and you can not graze the cattle , you get paid the value of the area on which you can not graze your cattle . 
if people across america thought that this was going to become law as written , which it will not , it will be changed dramatically after the senate acts , if they do act , they would be out right now purchasing , on a speculative basis , or getting options on property that in any way was restricted by the endangered species act . 
because they could say , well , it is true that was a tree farm , but actually i was going to build a destination resort on that tree farm . 
come on , only $ 5 million to $ 10 million a year ? 
so taxpayers are going to be obligated to borrow money for speculative , possible potential future profits , and maybe even a little on top of that because the secretary can not compensate less than the fair market value . 
it is binding only on the secretary as i understand in the new manager 's amendment . 
so the taxpayers are on the hook ; but if the property owner says my speculative value was $ 2 million profit a year for the next 30 years , then that person could go to court . 
but the government could not go to court to say wait a minute , this is crazy , you really were not going to make $ 2 million a year on a destination resort on that tree farm . 
it is a perfect bill , and no amendment should be allowed here on the floor , but we are going to put the taxpayers on the hook for billions of dollars . 
take a piece of remote farm land , propose a huge development on it ; it does not have to be proven to be economically viable . 
you proposed it ; you were going to build 5 , 000 houses ; you were going to make $ 1 , 000 , $ 2 , 000 , $ 5 , 000 on each house . 
they sell it to the guy down the street , they can make the same claim , on and on and on . 
the legislation before us today turns back the clock on 35 years of progress in responsible environmental stewardship by gutting the current endangered species act and replacing it with little to preserve endangered wildlife for future generations . 
as such , this legislation would eliminate conservation measures on tens of millions of acres of land around the country , the `` critical habitat '' of endangered species , and prevent such conservation activities in the future . 
instead , this bill would allow the secretary of the interior to make a determination about whether a species is endangered based on `` all available information '' -- that is to say , information that opens the door for phony science supporting special interests . 
this is simply the continuation of a decade-long assault by the majority on our clean air , our clean water and our environment . 
according to the fish and wildlife service , 99 percent of the species ever listed under the endangered species act remain on the planet today . 
another provision of this bill is one offered by my friend from oregon , but the idea that we are not any longer going to have epa consult on pesticides is a tragic mistake . 
mr. chairman , i want to thank my dear friend , the gentleman from west virginia ( mr. rahall ) xz4003310 , not only for his friendship , but for all the good things he has done on the matter of endangered species and other matters on nature and conservation of natural resources . 
i would note that the president has expressed concerns in his statement of the administrative policy on september 29 and he says , `` requirements related to species recovery agreements , new statutory deadlines , new conservation and programs for private property owners provide little discretion to federal agencies and could result in a significant budgetary impact. '' so if you want fiscally and financially responsible legislation , legislation which , in fact , protects the species , which is fair to all , which makes progress and which is close to the area of the legislation but which has broad citizen support , conservation support , and does move the process forward , i would urge my colleagues to support the substitute which will be offered by my colleagues , the gentleman from california ( mr. george miller ) xz4002780 , and the gentleman from new york ( mr. boehlert ) xz4000350 . 
science is the core principle of esa and we direct the secretary to issue , and regularly revise , guidance on the acceptable scientific measures . 
the substitute is going to provide a helping hand to landowners ; dedicated funding for technical assistance to private property owners ; a conservation grants program for landowners who help conserve the species on or near their property ; assurances that private citizens can get timely answers from the fish and wildlife service ; and reporting requirements so that we know how many applications are really going unanswered , and most importantly , why . 
the substitute directs the federal government to work with the states on a far broader and more cooperative manner than either current law or the committee on resources bill . 
the substitute directs the secretary to first determine whether public lands are sufficient to protect and save the species ; if we could protect the species , and save the species in our public lands , in our national forests , our national blm lands , and in our parks and wildlife refuges , we should do so without placing the burden on private landowners . 
mr. chairman , this amendment represents a broad bipartisan and fiscally responsible effort to move this process forward in a manner that can not only get an overwhelming vote of support in the house , but which can move on to the president 's desk for signature in the same manner as the original act . 
i just say to you that the cbo , which makes the estimates on everything we do around here , the official word for the congress to act , projects that the cost would be small over the 5 years . 
it is like a cloud on your title and it is not easily resolved . 
the pombo legislation eliminates this terrible burden we place on small property owners . 
please vote `` no '' on the miller-boehlert amendment and `` yes '' for final passage on the pombo legislation . 
mr. speaker , i thank my friend for yielding me this time , and i thank him for his very important work on this vital piece of legislation . 
i rise to support the rule and the underlying legislation and to begin by praising the gentleman from california ( mr. pombo ) xz4003220 , the very distinguished chairman , for all of the effort that he has put in to assembling a bipartisan compromise on this . 
when i think about the long struggle which the gentleman from california ( mr. pombo ) xz4003220 has been involved in for a decade to try to bring about reform of the endangered species act , i think back to one of the challenges that we have in southern california , and the gentleman from california ( mr. calvert ) xz4000570 , who has worked long and hard on this , represents part of riverside county , and i recounted up in the committee on rules yesterday the fact that dealing with the stephens ' kangaroo rat , an endangered species , we had conflicting directives that came from government . 
we right now in southern california are dealing with tremendous fire problems in that area ; and , frankly , i do believe that the kind of reform that is going to be assembled in a bipartisan way on the endangered species act will go a long way toward preserving property and to make sure that we diminish the kind of threat that does exist out there . 
i congratulate , again , the gentleman from california ( mr. pombo ) xz4003220 ; and i know the gentleman from california ( mr. cardoza ) xz4000650 has been working very hard on this , obviously , because he has had a lot of impact , as he just outlined . 
i thank again my friend for his efforts on this . 
the latest figures i have show that my home state of tennessee has one of the highest numbers of listings on the endangered species list . 
it is a simple fact that the existing law hits the hardest on the small- and medium-size farmers and ranchers and landowners , and these are the people least able to fight it . 
this bill turns its back on our posterity . 
when this legislation was first passed , many species in this country were on the brink of extinction , and many more were in severe decline . 
the substitute helps small landowners by dedicating funding for technical assistance for private property owners , and it provides conservation grants for landowners who help conserve endangered species on their property . 
finally , it provides assurances that private citizens will get timely answers from the fish & amp ; wildlife service regarding the status of endangered species requirements on their land . 
i have grave concerns about provisions in the bill that give political appointees the power to remove species from the endangered list based on political decisions rather than on sound science . 
the endangered species act needs an update , but we must not reverse course on significant progress and results for endangered species . 
i would like to thank chairman pombo for all his hard work on crafting this important piece of legislation , and i am very appreciative of his efforts to include this provision in his manager 's amendment . 
that critical habitat has made us a lot of money on what is watchable wildlife . 
this bill undermines the greatest economic asset we have , which is our natural things by creating a new issue on takings . 
i am on the committee on appropriations , and in 2003 the fish and wildlife service said it needed approximately $ 153 million to address the critical backlog of listings of critical habitat ; yet the president only asked for $ 18 million . 
it is an attack on america 's greatest heritage . 
my home on the central coast in the 17th district has more habitat where both endangered plants and animals have lived with commercial farming and ranching . 
as one of the pillars of environmental law , it has brought public attention to the impact of human activities on our nation 's wildlife that contributes so much beauty and delight to life as well as growing economic development in environmental tourism . 
but it also goes beyond that to declare the preservation of such species as the american bald eagle and the california condor , that glide on the thermals along the big sur coastline , a national priority . 
while opponents of the law complain that it has restored healthy populations of only 16 of the more than 1 , 800 species on its endangered list , dozens of other species have dramatically increased their populations because of the law 's protection . 
mr. chairman , it is fitting that congress is moving to reauthorize esa on sea otter awareness week since the sea otters are a success story in my district . 
studies show sea otters draw tourists to my district where they spend money on lodging , restaurants and other merchandise . 
any law that has been on the books for as long as the endangered species act will have issues -- some of these issues deal with inadequate funding , and some with the law itself . 
taking esa responsibilities from noaa will split jurisdiction on marine animals , creating a management nightmare and further fracturing our marine management . 
as the pew and us commissions on ocean policy recommended , we need to consolidate our ocean management under one roof , specifically the national oceanic and atmospheric administration in the department of commerce , to be effective . 
mr. chairman , i thank the gentleman for yielding me this time , and i appreciate the chairman 's efforts to reach across the aisle and produce a true bipartisan bill , and i thank the gentleman from california ( mr. cardoza ) xz4000650 for working on this . 
if any of my colleagues have served on the committee on resources , as i have , you know that this is a truly bipartisan bill . 
many times , those who manage water resources have been tied up with regulation that has required them to spend money on that rather than the recovery of species . 
i also want to compliment the chairman of the committee on resources . 
he has worked very hard on the things that he believes in . 
most people who are concerned about the endangered species act either are concerned because , like the chairman here from the committee on rules stated this morning , if you see a dam and it creates deep water and you can get your barges down with your grain , you appreciate the fact that the dam is there . 
we create a scientifically acceptable procedure , look on page 2 of the substitute , methods , practices and procedures that are acceptable science . 
the recovery plan has a number of significant and important elements : a time frame for that recovery plan ; objective measurable criteria ; a description of where the site should be , and the emphasis is on federal land and not private land ; and an estimate of the cost and time it will take to recover that species . 
look on page 20 . 
there are a number of changes that we have made here to the gentleman from california ( mr. pombo ) xz4003220 which i think improves on the bill . 
the present esa , maybe it is because we are on the east coast , the present esa bill is working fine . 
what species should be determined endangered , there are five criteria laid out on page 4 of the substitute . 
we have repealed the critical habitat designations , but we have replaced it with recovery plans found on page 20 of the substitute . 
the emphasis is on public land ; but whenever you go on private land , there should be some restitution , some sharing of federal dollars with those private landowners ; and 10 percent of the appropriated amount on an annual basis of this substitute will go for that very specific purpose . 
do you deal with farmers that have a problem with reintroduced species on the property eating their sheep or their cows ? 
all these things have to be taken into consideration so that we create a policy that protects private property rights , that brings individuals on those farms and that landscape into the process and helps pay for their contribution to the process , that brings federal agencies in so they can view the landscape , not from just one small little fly or tiger beetle or some other particular species , but upon which the landscape that supports that species , supports clean water , supports clean air , supports the whole ecosystem including human beings , including us as a species . 
so how do we clarify all these different perspectives and views based on different things that happen in our districts ? 
i would tell my colleagues that i feel strongly this is the best policy change , the best reauthorization plan that we can use to deal with the endangered species act that will deal with nature 's design and man 's impact on nature 's design , which includes private property rights , which includes reimbursements for helping to preserve endangered species , and by the way , in this substitute is a provision to pay those private property individuals . 
i urge an `` aye '' vote on the substitute . 
i congratulate the gentleman from california ( mr. pombo ) xz4003220 and the gentleman from california ( mr. cardoza ) xz4000650 for their outstanding work on this legislation . 
since the gentleman from california ( mr. pombo ) xz4003220 introduced this bill , we have heard groups on both sides of the issue recite statistics with the intent of proving or disproving the effectiveness of the law . 
well , i do not believe i can change many minds simply by pointing out that over 99 percent of the species placed on the list are still on it . 
under the current law , the u.s. fish and wildlife service has the power to halt lawful landowner activities if an endangered species is identified on their property and it is determined their actions would take that species . 
private property rights are fundamental rights embodied in the constitution , and congress periodically needs to take steps to ensure that government is protecting them , not trampling on them . 
in my own committee , the committee on agriculture , we have recently examined another example of the infringement of property rights through the use of eminent domain . 
the bill also makes other important changes , such as doing away with the act 's emphasis on designating critical habitat by placing emphasis instead on functional recovery plans . 
mr. chairman , i thank the chairman for yielding me this time to speak on an issue that is very important to me and my constituents . 
i thought the intent of the esa was to recover species and not leave them on the list indefinitely . 
also , landowners seem to be getting cheated when species are identified on their property resulting in lower property values , less production and limited use . 
as part of the farming community , i have heard stories of farmers afraid to report an endangered species on their land because of the implication it would have on their property and their farming operation . 
`` shoot , shovel , and shut up '' was often the case when a species was identified on their property . 
my point is that the esa was more of a burden on landowners , and without the cooperation of landowners , species recovery , i do not think , will ever be successful . 
another reason why i chose to get involved in this debate is because of the implication this act has on the management of the missouri river . 
again , i commend the chairman on his efforts and look forward to working with him on this bill and getting it passed this afternoon . 
in the 1960s , rachel carson 's book `` silent spring '' documented the harmful effects of ddt and other pesticides on songbirds . 
this prompted a ban on ddt and the passage of the original endangered species act . 
the ban on ddt , which the epa said posed unacceptable risks to the environment and human health , saved the bald eagle and countless other species from going extinct . 
h.r. 3824 contains a provision allowing epa to consult with itself in determining the potential impacts of pesticide registration on endangered wildlife and fish , instead of consulting with the fish and wildlife service or the national marine fisheries service , which are the expert agencies whose mission is either in whole or in part to conserve species . 
without existing checks and balances on pesticide use , the effect on wildlife could be devastating . 
the endangered species act , on the other hand , recognizes what almost all americans believe , that no dollar amount can be placed on the extension of our nation 's treasured wildlife or on the human health of people who work in those fields . 
it would leave in place current safeguards by requiring an analysis based on the health of wildlife , not the company 's bottom line . 
for this reason and many others , i urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this controversial bill and voting `` yes '' on the miller substitute . 
mr. speaker , by direction of the committee on rules , i call up house resolution 470 and ask for its immediate consideration . 
the rule provides for 90 minutes of debate equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the committee on resources and waives all points of order against consideration of the bill . 
house resolution 470 provides that , in lieu of the amendment recommended by the committee on resources now printed in the bill , the amendment in the nature of a substitute consisting of the text of the committee on resources print dated september 26 shall be considered as an original bill for the purpose of amendment and shall be considered as read . 
house resolution 470 makes in order only those amendments printed in the committee on rules report accompanying the resolution . 
mr. speaker , the threatened and endangered species recovery act is one of the most important bills we will consider on species recovery and property rights this year . 
i commend the gentleman from california ( chairman pombo ) and other members of the committee on resources and their staffs who have worked hard to bring this legislation to this point . 
each year , federal agencies are spending more on paperwork , process , court cases , and lawyers and less on real on-the-ground recovery efforts . 
the threatened and endangered species recovery act puts the priority where it should be , on recovery . 
the esa is currently written with its emphasis on punitive measures and regulation serves as a disincentive for any private property owner to provide habitat for a listed species . 
after all , species recovery is a national goal that benefits all americans , and the cost of that effort should not fall solely on the shoulders of land holders . 
this legislation puts the emphasis on objectively quantifiable and peer-reviewed science . 
stronger science and esa information will result in our limited federal resources going to where they will do the most good , while reducing instances of drastic federal actions being taken on poor or limited data . 
i again commend my colleagues for their hard work on this legislation , and i urge my colleagues to support both the rule , house resolution 470 , and the underlying bill . 
mr. speaker , i yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from utah ( mr. bishop ) xz4000291 , a valued member of the committee on rules . 
mr. speaker , i would advise the gentleman from oregon that his amendment during the markup in the rules committee was not offered by either side to be voted on . 
mr. speaker , i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from new york ( mr. boehlert ) xz4000350 , chairman of the committee on science . 
mr. speaker , for clarification , i acknowledge that the gentleman from oregon sent his amendment to the committee on rules . 
my point was during the markup of the rule , there was no attempt on the other side to amend the rule to make his amendment in order . 
mr. speaker , i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from maryland ( mr. gilchrest ) xz4001490 , a member of the committee on resources . 
mr. speaker , i yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from california ( mr. dreier ) xz4001150 , distinguished chairman of the committee on rules . 
mr. speaker , i am pleased to yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from california ( mr. pombo ) xz4003220 , the chairman of the committee on resources , the author of this bill , and somebody who has worked extremely hard on this for at least 12 years . 
mr. speaker , there has been a lot of rhetoric thus far on the rule , and i suspect there will be a lot of rhetoric when we debate the bill ; but there is one underlying thread here that needs to be mentioned . 
but now we hear today that there is 90 percent agreement on the need to change the endangered species act , but there is violent 10 percent disagreement on what those means should be . 
mr. speaker , i yield back the balance of my time , and i move the previous question on the resolution . 
the states , counties and cities have other things they could spend their tax dollars on . 
i commend the gentleman from california ( mr. pombo ) xz4003220 on his good work and urge my colleagues to support it . 
mr. chairman , would the chairman of the committee on resources agree to enter into a colloquy ? 
i just want to focus on one aspect of this legislation which i think would be amusing in some sense if it were not for the fact that it is an example of a kind of cynical hypocrisy in those people who call themselves fiscally conservative . 
instead of working towards a true compromise , we are considering legislation that is based on the fallacious premise that environmental protection requires a trade-off with private interests . 
it ignores the long term damage catering to these private interests will have on our future . 
mr. speaker , the endangered species act is a safety net for wildlife , plants and fish that are on the brink of extinction . 
finally , i believe that while vigilant congressional oversight is critical to the success of any law , putting an arbitrary expiration date on the endangered species act would place the protection of species at the mercy of the legislative calendar . 
unless substantial amendments to address this and other shortcomings are passed on the floor today , i will not support h.r. 3824 . 
mr. speaker , i would like to address my comments to the members who do have serious concerns about the endangered species act who have had frustrations from their citizens about its application , but still believe that we ought to have a workable act , and i want to suggest that voting for this bipartisan substitute and `` no '' on the pombo bill will really satisfy their needs for five reasons . 
but we then need to vote `` no '' on the underlying bill for these two reasons : first , the underlying bill is a massive entitlement program that could be subject to massive fraud because the language is so loose and so speculative , we would be expecting the american taxpayers to shell out literally millions of dollars on highly speculative developments . 
`` bring out every kind of living creature that is with you , the birds , the animals , and all the creatures that move along the ground , so that they can multiply on the earth and be fruitful and increase in number upon it. '' are we acting in the spirit of noah when we purport to vote , some may vote , for a bill that would prevent protecting the bald eagle from pesticides , when ddt almost removed it from the treasure-trove of american icons ? 
and under the bill , as written , the maps will hang on the walls of these agencies in beautiful pink and blue , and the cub scouts and the girl scout troops can come through and look at the beautiful maps . 
she told me about the thrill of seeing the salmon going up the stream on miller bay , and they do that because we have an enforceable mechanism to protect habitat . 
among other things , the substitute protects habitat for species recovery by maintaining habitat protections and puts the primary obligation for recovery on federal agencies by clearly defining `` jeopardy. '' it also makes clear that any federal agency action that impairs species recovery will jeopardize the continued existence of the species and , therefore , is prohibited . 
additionally , it ensures that all newly listed species have recovery plans within 3 years and species already on the list have recovery plans within 10 years . 
and while there is wide agreement here on the house floor that it should be amended and tweaked and improved on in light of past experience and modern times , we need to do it responsibly ; and i believe that responsible approach is better reflected in the substitute that is being offered here today . 
the karner blue butterfly , on the verge of extinction in wisconsin , due to the endangered species act and the recovery plan that was in place , is making a healthy comeback . 
they are on the verge of being delisted because of their success story . 
mr. chairman , the endangered species act remains an enduring testament to the importance the american people place on preserving plant and animal species for future generations . 
that sentiment was reflected in president richard nixon 's words during his signing of the act on december 28 , 1973 when he said , `` nothing is more priceless and more worthy of preservation than the rich array of animal life with which our country has been blessed . 
i mention these successes because many of the comments made on the floor today cast esa as an unmitigated failure . 
i do n't believe that is the case at all ; and the scientific journal , ecology letters , recently published a study of the status of threatened and endangered species that showed more than half on the list for 5 years or more have either stabilized or are improving . 
but it adds crucial language requiring the secretary to identify -- during a 3-year recovery planning process -- lands that are necessary for the conservation of the species -- first on public lands and then , if necessary , on private lands . 
more than two-thirds of threatened and endangered species reside on private lands where the endangered species act is least effective . 
for me , i would quote from the house republican majority committee on the budget that warned that the underlying legislation `` creates a new entitlement program. '' this spring , moderates of the republican tuesday group and conservatives of the republican study committee worked together to put forward budget reforms to end deficit spending . 
let us focus on this for a moment . 
we would not spray pesticides on a bald eagle , would we ? 
i also find it extremely disturbing that my colleagues are so intent on establishing an entirely new entitlement program to pay landowners for compliance at the taxpayers ' expense at the same time they are working so hard to privatize entitlement programs like medicare and social security . 
now is not the time to turn back the clock on wildlife protection . 
on one side , we have this bill , the threatened and endangered species act , facing off on the other side against sound , science-based environmental policy . 
for many who now sit on the committee on resources , including the distinguished chairman , eliminating the endangered species act was almost a singular campaign issue . 
in fact , just months ago , legislation was drafted and subsequently circulated by the chair of the committee on resources that would have completely eliminated endangered species protections over the next 10 years . 
according to the u.s. fish and wildlife service , 99 percent of the species ever listed under the endangered species act remain on the planet today . 
imagine the impact the bill before us could have on local economies that depend on recreation and ecotourism for jobs and tax revenues . 
i hope that my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will take a close look at this legislation and recognize it is not our only option . 
on a smaller scale , a similar approach has been overwhelmingly successful in my home state of massachusetts . 
in the process of designating 1 , 370 species eligible for protection , the act also has generated court battles by opponents who chafed at restrictions on commercial development of essential habitat . 
environmentalists charge that pombo 's bill eliminates any provision to help species recover from near extinction and effectively forbids the designation of critical habitats on virtually all federal land . 
mr. speaker , i appreciate the comments of my colleague on the committee on rules , the gentleman from utah , but he uses statistics very selectively . 
i will also provide for the record an article that appeared in the salt lake tribune by ben long , who is a contributor to the writers on the range , a service of high country news , who has written a great article about how the endangered species act succeeds with flying colors . 
then , environmental laws such as the endangered species act and a federal ban on the pesticide ddt kicked in . 
by 2005 , the number of bald eagle nests in montana multiplied to 300 nests -- 25 times the number before the bird was included on the endangered species list . 
bald eagle congregations have been tourist attractions at places like canyon ferry and libby dams , where they feed on fish in the winter . 
no matter how many times i see a bald eagle on the wing , i am taken aback by its beauty -- and thankful for the endangered species act . 
he will grow up also watching bald eagles , some perching on a snag close to our backyard . 
when i was a kid , the only eagle i ever saw was on the back of a quarter . 
mr. speaker , just for the record , i want to make it clear that the gentleman from oregon did offer his amendment before the committee on rules . 
mr. speaker , i would again urge my colleagues to , first of all , vote `` no '' on the rule , and i would also urge them to vote `` no '' on the underlying bill . 
it is what our colleague from illinois ( mr. kirk ) xz4002220 who testified yesterday on behalf of the republican study committee and the republican tuesday group said last night in the committee on rules , that this bill creates an expensive new federal entitlement program . 
i would urge my colleagues to vote `` no '' on the rule and the bill . 
mr. speaker , on that i demand the yeas and nays . 
there are a number of reasons why we need to focus our resources on protecting endangered species . 
nationally , sportsmen and wildlife enthusiasts spend an estimated $ 100 billion each year on outdoor activities . 
the substitute amendment being offered by mr. miller , mr. boehlert , and others is a considerable improvement on the underlying bill . 
nothing has been taken , only the suggestion in the proposal on a plan . 
the endangered species act is a litmus test on the degree to which we are willing to conserve our livable environment . 
but this bill turns that principle on its head , and in so doing it creates a very dangerous precedent that this body should not knowingly adopt . 
mr. chairman , as a member of the interior , environment , and related agencies subcommittee of the committee on appropriations , i know that there are some problems with the implementation of this act . 
currently , a landowner with an endangered species on his land often sees the species as a threat to his survival . 
bonneville power 's rates have risen 46 percent since 2001 , due in main part to the endangered species act 's impact on the columbia/snake hydropower system . 
the agency spends an average of $ 500 million per year on esa compliance . 
to whom are these costs passed on to ? 
i get a bill once a month from the power company that includes all sorts of information about tips on conserving energy and warnings on how to keep me from electrocuting myself , but nowhere does it detail what i am paying for . 
noaa fisheries and the fish and wildlife service have differing processes for handling and permitting thousands of activities that must undergo federal conciliation under the esa and competing science on how best to manage the species . 
consolidation of agencies managing the esa will eliminate duplication and allow scarce federal resources to be focused on achieving the true objective of the endangered species act , the recovery of species through science-based management . 
i encourage members to support the rule , the manger 's amendment , and the bill and oppose the miller-boehlert substitute that lacks all the property rights protection that the committee on resources has worked so hard to restore . 
i thank the chairman for his leadership on this issue , and i look forward to the passage of this bill . 
in a hearing we had on endangered species last year , she described california as being the greenest state , santa barbara as being the greenest of the cities in california , and she as being the greenest of the green . 
we also are affecting the outcome for our private property owners , and so i thank the gentleman for his hard work on this and i support the bill . 
mr. chairman , i thank the gentleman for yielding me this time , and i thank him for his extraordinary leadership on behalf of the american people in terms of the air they breathe , the water they drink , in protecting god 's beautiful gift to us , this beautiful legacy that we have in our environment , and i commend the ranking member , the gentleman from west virginia ( mr. rahall ) xz4003310 , for his leadership as well . 
today 's bill of course in this debate points out what value we place on that . 
the endangered species act is a safety net for wildlife , fish and plants that are on the brink of extinction . 
on the floor of the house , week after week , month after month , the republican leadership pushes through legislation shredding the safety net for children , for veterans , for the elderly , for the poor , for the sick and the disabled , so it comes as no surprise today that they bring a bill that will shred the safety net for the endangered plants and animals . 
it establishes an extraordinarily new entitlement program for developers and speculators that requires taxpayers to pay them unlimited amounts of money , and the list goes on and on . 
that is why my colleague , the gentleman from california ( mr. george miller ) xz4002780 , joined by a group of members and also the gentleman from new york ( mr. boehlert ) xz4000350 , taking the lead on the republican side , have developed a substitute to this bill that gives landowners assistance and incentives to protect endangered species , strengthens the science behind the endangered species act , and requires improved coordination with the states . 
i also would like to thank the gentleman from west virginia ( mr. rahall ) xz4003310 , the ranking member on the committee , for all of the work that he put in , and that his staff put in , particularly jim zoia , who did yeoman 's work in putting this bill together . 
this debate over endangered species has been raging across this country for years , and our effort was to throw away everything that we had tried to do in the past and put it aside and try to start again and say how do we sit down as members of the committee on resources and come to a solution that we can all agree with . 
it is kind of ironic this morning to hear people come to the floor and talk about how radical the bill is and how quickly we moved on it . 
we have held over 50 hearings on the endangered species act . 
from what i see , all of these folks are going to vote `` no '' on the bill and they are going to vote `` no '' on the substitute , because the substitute claims to be the same thing . 
and on and on and on . 
that became a big problem , and it is something that we began to work on , to try to have some kind of property rights protections in the law . 
but when the law is not working , we have to respond to that and step in and reauthorize the bill , put the focus on recovery and protect private property owners . 
in the end , there were a few issues that we just disagreed on , there were issues we could not come to a conclusion on , but the vast majority of what is in the underlying bill was an agreement that we were able to work out and that i stand by . 
accordingly , the committee rose ; and the speaker pro tempore ( mr. goodlatte ) xz4001540 having assumed the chair , mr. sweeney , chairman of the committee of the whole house on the state of the union , reported that that committee , having had under consideration the bill ( h.r. 3824 ) to amend and reauthorize the endangered species act of 1973 to provide greater results conserving and recovering listed species , and for other purposes , had come to no resolution thereon . 
mr. chairman , i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from virginia ( mr. goodlatte ) xz4001540 , the chairman of the committee on agriculture . 
i look forward to the gentleman 's opposition to the highway bill and any new purchases of land , to the wildlife refuge system , to the park system , or any other thing that we spend money on , because he sees it as a big giveaway , a big government giveaway system . 
and all of you ran down on the floor and said you were all in support of that . 
you guys talk big about wanting to protect habitat and protect species , but 90 percent of the habitat for endangered species is on private property . 
you are wrong on this one . 
i know that there are issues in the underlying bill that we disagree on , and we probably always will . 
mr. chairman , i yield for the purpose of a unanimous consent request to the gentleman from california ( mr. gallegly ) xz4001440 , a member of the committee on resources . 
we have come a long ways , because , as you know , i have been working on this since i got here , and when i first started , all i heard was there is nothing wrong with the act that a little bit more money would not solve . 
so we have come a long ways , and i am being attacked for spending more money under the act on the reauthorization . 
first of all , i wanted to respond to your comments on jeopardy . 
when it comes to providing incentives for landowners , both bills contain identical language , and on and on and on , about how much alike the bills are ; and yet they gut , eviscerate , euthanize , and they are unreasonable . 
i remember 10 years ago , i introduced a bill on endangered species , and one of the major provisions in that bill was to utilize public lands , and i got ripped over it because 90 percent of the species have their habitat on private land . 
you can not just put the focus on public lands . 
but if it is going to work , if we are truly going to put the focus on recovery , if we are truly going to try to bring these species back from the brink and do the responsible thing , private property owners have to be part of the solution . 
but once land has that restriction on it , whoever buys it can not come back again and say they want something else , because they know it is restricted . 
vote against the substitute , support the base bill , and let us move on with some decent legislation . 
mr. chairman , the gentleman from california and i have been working together for the last several months to try to find common ground on the amendments to the endangered species act . 
the survival standard is akin to keeping a patient on life support without any chance of recovery . 
not only was fiscal responsibility thrown to the wind in this process , but we have turned back the clock to an era in which ddt was commonly known as `` drop dead twice. '' h.r. 3824 includes a provision adopted in the committee on resources that would repeal the endangered species act provisions that protect threatened and endangered species from the harmful impact of pesticides . 
however , i have worked , as i said in the beginning , well with the gentleman from california on this bill ; and i do salute his tenaciousness , his patience , and his courage in bringing this bill to the floor . 
mr. chairman , i yield 5 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from michigan ( mr. dingell ) xz4001100 , the dean of the house as well as the father of the endangered species act , the ranking member on the house committee on energy and commerce . 
there are a number of important medicines , including possibly the next effective treatment of cancer , aids , or heart disease that can come from species that we are trying to protect and save on this world . 
mr. chairman , i yield 3 1/2 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from washington ( mr. dicks ) xz4001090 , ranking member on the subcommittee on interior , environment , and related agencies of the committee on appropriations and a member of my class . 
mr. chairman , i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from washington ( mr. inslee ) xz4001930 , a very valued member of our committee on resources . 
mr. chairman , i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from wisconsin ( mr. kind ) xz4002180 , a valued member of the committee on resources . 
when you send your spirit , they are created and you renew the earth. '' such is the appropriate biblical quote , i say to my colleagues , that should guide our deliberations today on this particular legislation . 
but this particular legislation , as we have heard throughout the debate on this general debate and we will hear more during the amendment process , is an expensive proposition . 
that means appropriations from this body 's committee on appropriations , at a time when we are finding tremendous costs being imposed upon the taxpayers that was unexpected 2 or 3 months ago . 
all have the same breath. '' mr. chairman , at the appropriate time , i will be speaking on the manager 's amendment and i will also be speaking in support of the substitute amendment that will be offered . 
but at the same time , in the manager 's amendment that will be coming up , there were changes made in literally the last minute that came very close to violating the good-faith negotiations that were ongoing on this legislation . 
but i will say at this point that this legislation needs to be defeated , the substitute that will be offered needs to be supported , and we need to look very seriously at how we can enforce better the endangered species laws on the books today rather than the overhaul that exists in the pending legislation , and i urge defeat of the legislation . 
mr. chairman , the manager 's amendment makes significant changes in the bill as it was reported from the committee on resources . 
one of the points that we had reached agreement on was that there was to be a recovery-based standard of determining when federal agency actions jeopardize the continued existence of a species . 
while i was willing to eliminate critical habitat , it was only on the condition that we ensure that there were adequate provisions in place to encourage recovery . 
it eliminates the bill 's requirement that appraisals determining the market value of foregone use of property are binding on both the secretary and the property owner . 
instead , the appraisal is binding only on the secretary , and the property owner may then go to court to seek additional compensation . 
maybe we can still work on this bill together ; i hope we can . 
it will significantly improve the species recovery which is an important part of our negotiating process that led us up to this bill on the floor today . 
mr. chairman , i want to thank the gentleman from california for keeping this issue on the front burner . 
the gentleman from alaska ( mr. young ) xz4004392 of the committee on resources put me on the study group to talk about the endangered species act , to try and finally get it off the dime . 
our amendment provides a creative , workable solution that promises better results for recovering endangered species and reducing burdens on landowners . 
by contrast , our substitute provides a better way of protecting habitat necessary for recovery , with a true focus on recovering species . 
over 90 percent of endangered plant and animal species are found on private property . 
the republican majority has already dismantled nearly every government program for people , and now it appears they 're moving on to other species . 
the republicans want us to believe that this bill represents a fair and balanced way to protect endangered species without infringing on property rights . 
this bill is nothing more than an assault on our environment . 
i urge my colleagues to join me , and every environmental organization on god 's green earth , in opposing this bill . 
our substitute gives private property owners the opportunity to protect species on our own land while ensuring they will not face additional regulatory burden . 
the substitute says if we can protect a species on public land , we should . 
i support putting more emphasis on recovery plans and on steps to provide incentives for landowners and other private parties to help with recovering species . 
mr. speaker , i thank the gentleman from massachusetts for yielding me time , and i also thank him for his excellent presentation on the rule . 
this bill was put on a rocket docket so that no one knows what is in it . 
unveiled on monday , and did not see it until tuesday , democrats and republicans not knowing what is in the bill . 
on wednesday , we had hearings , 2 short days later . 
we only had four witnesses and several hours of hearings ; and the crucial witness in this case , the administration witness , would not even take a position on the bill . 
well , last night in the committee on rules , there were major changes to the bill again in the manager 's amendment . 
mr. speaker , the gentleman from california tries to make the substitute and the bill that is on the floor sound the same ; but there are major differences , and we should recognize that . 
it creates a program where the burden is on the government to disprove . 
the substitute reforms the endangered species act , while protecting the core provisions of that magnificent environmental law that has been on the books for 30 years . 
at the end of this , we have not respected this institution by the way we brought the bill before the floor , the way we have worked in committee to put it on a rocket docket and speed it through , speed it through this process . 
as a senior member of both the small business committee and the resources committee , i think i have an important perspective on this issue . 
ninety-six years after he created that refuge , this federal government made a decision to shut the water off to 1 , 200 farm families in that basin based on the endangered species act and interpreted by the government scientists without peer review , without peer review . 
when the national academy of sciences reviewed the decisions , they said the agency made mistakes in the outcome under the endangered species act ; and further they went on to say that those decisions put in jeopardy potentially those very species , the sucker fish in the upper klamath lake and the coho salmon in the klamath river . 
this section says you can not come back and get a second bite at the same apple , so you have to follow state and local zoning ordinances and laws , you have to prove you are financially capable of undertaking the activity , and the government has to give you an answer when you propose to do something on your private , private , property here . 
according to the united states fish and wildlife service , nearly half of the species that had been on the list more than 7 years were stable or improving , and those are the facts . 
the board had recently become aggressive about slowing development on the flood plains . 
protecting our endangered species is never easy , but if we do not do it right , if we do not depend on sound science , if instead we yield to greed and politics , there is no second chance . 
mr. chairman , i thank the gentleman from california for yielding me this time , and i wish to engage the chairman of the committee on resources in a colloquy . 
to relay an anecdotal story of which there have been many here today , in 1995 , we had a chinese immigrant farmer who , believe it or not , was jailed and prosecuted due to an accidental taking of a species on his land that he had farmed for years . 
we must continue to work on efforts that i think are included in this legislation , realizing that we are going to have to revisit them in future years . 
mr. chairman , i would like to enter into a colloquy with the chairman of the committee on resources . 
local governments , we know , often have the best on-the-ground information on the status of communities of plants and animals that are in the area . 
this bill would formally recognize the local governments ' rights to comment on the listing process and the acquisition of the best available scientific data . 
first of all , the definition as it relates to property rights i think is lacking and needs to be worked on in an important way . 
on the one hand , you have a philosophy that says private property ownership rights are important and on the other says king george , before we had the revolution , did not have such a bad system . 
the congress assembled on behalf of the american people , and this administration will borrow $ 1.3 billion a day every day for those 30 days . 
the president has this bizarre idea that we should borrow a trillion dollars , one thousand billion dollars to go to mars while we can not meet the needs of people here on earth , here in the united states of america . 
no , personally , i would like to have an up or down vote on borrowing $ 100 billion to go back to the moon . 
well , maybe we could visit that issue on the floor . 
of course , those same oil company execs , of course they were not under oath , i have got to admit that , said that that money , the head of exxon said it is nothing , it is chump change , and it has no effect on our operations . 
so maybe we could take back that $ 19 billion and spend it on lunch for hungry kids or maybe we could put the money back into the student loan program that you want to cut out in the reconciliation bill . 
mr. speaker , reclaiming my time , i would schedule some up-or-down votes on these sorts of major cuts in a much expanded reconciliation under an open rule . 
what we are talking about is congress going on vacation , congress going away for 2 weeks , have thanksgiving at home , while we are taking food out of the mouths of kids and depriving students of loans through the reconciliation bill , borrowing $ 1.3 billion a day on behalf of the american taxpayers and getting them by another $ 39 billion . 
on the reconciliation vote , if you would bring the reconciliation bill up as an open rule , you know that is a closed rule , too . 
the second biggest cut in the bill is medicaid ; dump those problems on the states and deprive people of needed health care . 
i would stay here through next week and have debate day after day and go through a series of amendments up or down on bringing some fiscal responsibility to this congress . 
congress has only had since january 3 of this year to complete work on the 12 annual appropriations bills , the so-called `` must pass bills '' that congress works on every year . 
but in the real world where salaries and promotion are based on accomplishments and contributions , getting done 30 percent of what you are supposed to get done is absolutely abysmal . 
so i ask , what in the world have the majority members been doing over the last month and a half that they can not get these constitutionally-mandated appropriations bills done on time ? 
so forgive me , mr. speaker , if i feel it unnecessary to grant republicans another 30 days to fix a problem that they , one , created on their own , and two , have shown zero ability that they are capable of leading our country in a responsibly fiscal manner . 
the suggestion that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle should have completed their work by september 30 is mandated by our responsibilities here in the house of representatives . 
when you argue that we are going to have time to do this , when we take the budget deficit matter up , what you are talking about is 1 hour on the rule , 1 hour on general debate , you say 2 hours , i will accept that , on general debate , 10 minutes in the motion to recommit , and that then is what 435 members and five delegates have that they can deal with in terms of time . 
mr. speaker , on that i demand the yeas and nays . 
mr. speaker , i will not take very long on this bill either , but i do think it is important to take note of a few facts . 
at the beginning of this year , it was made quite clear by the majority that they desired to finish all appropriations bills on time and that there be no omnibus appropriations bill lumping all kinds of disassociated items into the same package . 
we on the minority side of the aisle have provided procedural cooperation at virtually every step of the way . 
we have provided time limits on debate on virtually every bill that we were asked to provide them . 
we provided unanimous consent so that the scheduling of legislation could be accelerated on numerous occasions . 
it is certainly not because of any failure on the part of the appropriations committee . 
and yet we are here with so much unfinished business on the appropriations side of the ledger . 
their desire to do that has led them to a willingness to borrow whatever it takes in order to put the money in those pockets and then use the resulting deficit as a reason to cut back on a number of other bills . 
it could be avoided if the majority had chosen to be a little less ideological , if they had chosen to pull the rubber band just a little less tightly , and if they had chosen to cross the aisle and work in a bipartisan fashion on taxes , on spending , and on other items that affect the shape and nature of the budget . 
mr. speaker , by direction of the committee on rules , i call up house resolution 558 and ask for its immediate consideration . 
i look forward to an abbreviated debate on this . 
the rule provides for 1 hour of debate in the house equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the committee on appropriations . 
this is something that unfortunately has become a routine part of our end-of-the-year appropriations process and chairman lewis under tremendous leadership with a great committee behind him has managed to avoid that this year , in fact , setting almost a record by completing all of the house 's work on the appropriations process before july 4. the committee has practiced due diligence and is working to pass each of these bills individually rather than having them attached as a train at the end of the year . 
this continuing resolution is necessary because our friends on the other side of the rotunda are a little bit further behind in their appropriations process and we are working through the conference report stage . 
i urge members to support the rules and the underlying continuing resolution so we can finish the appropriations process in regular order and continue on our way toward responsibly funding the needs of america . 
we will do the eighth in a couple of hours here on this floor today , which leaves three remaining waiting to be returned from their conference work with the senate . 
and when it comes to the enemy of time and being at the end of the legislative calendar , that , unfortunately , is the case with the appropriations process that we are waiting on regular order , the conference committees with the house and the senate to finish their work on those three remaining bills . 
there are no speakers on either side for this . 
would the gentleman have the cr expire on thanksgiving day when no one will be in this chamber to act to fund the operations of the government so that national parks remain open and social security checks continue to go out ? 
what would the amendments be that the gentleman would offer if december 17 is an inadequate solution to funding the operations of government until we finish the three remaining conference reports on appropriations ? 
the gentleman knows as well as i do that they tend to bog down in the oratory and slow down on the action . 
mr. speaker , the gentleman clearly has come to the floor a little bit early , because all of these things are going to be eligible for debate here in another several hours when we move forward on our deficit reduction package , and the gentleman will have an opportunity to exercise through his vote that savings process , that deficit reduction process . 
the gentleman is passionate about his concern for the fiscal well-being , but he is clearly misdirected in the sense that he will have an opportunity to vote on a number of these deficit reduction measures , a number of these savings , a number of these government reform mechanisms ; and he will have the opportunity to present all of the things that he talked about in his own recommittal motion , which is a right that has been granted to the minority party . 
the point is that we are here today debating the rule on the continuing resolution of the government because we have three regular order appropriations bills yet to move , because i believe , to our credit and to this chamber 's credit , to the credit of the entire house , we are not moving a last minute omnibus choo-choo train that all of us have to go home and then discover something in that that we are not real terribly proud of . 
i think it is a credit to the appropriators on both sides of the aisle and a credit , frankly , to both chambers , and as the gentleman from florida has pointed out , under republican leadership , that are bringing us 11 individual appropriations bills that can be voted on up or down . 
you have an opportunity to make your position publicly known on each of those bills , rather than having things stuffed into a last-minute train , which all of us object to and which diminishes the status of the house . 
we know that it is going to be a long day as we approach the debate over the labor , health and human services appropriations bill , the ongoing debate over the continuing resolution to fund our government , and later today the deficit reduction package , which i dare say will not take food from any child in america 's mouth , despite the overheated rhetoric of the gentleman from oregon , respectfully the gentleman from florida and a number of others on that side of the aisle who it would appear from their media statements discuss in the salons and parlors of the beltway whether republicans hate children or old people more . 
i dare say that as we bring up this deficit reduction act , which finally for the first time since 1997 puts us back on a serious track to finding savings not just in the discretionary side of our spending but in the mandatory side which makes up over half of federal spending today and which slows the rate of growth in government , again , one of those washington , d.c.-style cuts , where budgets grow 7 percent instead of 7.3 percent or they grow 6 percent instead of 6.3 percent , and we find $ 50 billion worth of savings in a $ 2.5 trillion per year budget . 
i believe that as we move through this debate it is important for us to be responsible in our rhetoric and keep our eyes on the ball , which is the looming fiscal crisis that is out there if congress does not have the courage to get its arms around mandatory spending , which is consuming federal spending , making up over 50 percent of it today and two-thirds of federal spending . 
mr. speaker , i yield back the balance of my time , and i move the previous question on the resolution . 
mr. speaker , on that i demand the yeas and nays .
