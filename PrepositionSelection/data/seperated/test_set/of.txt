i am opposed to this bill because it reflects a misunderstanding of the proper way to build a successful career and a gross misinterpretation of our constitutional tradition . 
with respect to its misunderstanding of the best way to build a career , i think that these personal retraining accounts , although clearly well intentioned , have exactly the wrong effect on an unemployed person . 
the purpose of workforce investment is not to move a person from a position of unemployment to a position of employment for a while . 
the purpose of the workforce investment is to move a person from dependency to opportunity and eventually to prosperity . 
the great dividing line in the american economy is whether one has 2 years of college or not . 
people with more than 2 years of college tend to have stable jobs and high and rising incomes . 
but , more importantly , from the public 's point of view , it may be a temporary job . 
it will move the person from a period of unemployment to a brief period of reemployment to another period of unemployment . 
it is an abrogation of our constitutional traditions to enshrine that in the law , and that is what this bill does . 
but that liberty does not extend to the power to use someone else 's money to subsidize the practice of one 's religion . 
that is the establishment of a religion which is specifically precluded by the first amendment of the constitution . 
it would be wholly consistent with the religious principles of this country to adopt it . 
this bill fails to improve the workforce investment act and falls short of the promises our government made to provide training and career opportunities for the unemployed . 
it eliminates various worker-training programs , rolls back protection against religious discrimination , and potentially damages the stability of important social programs . 
we can not neglect the unemployed , underemployed and dislocated workers of america who need ample and widespread funding for federal job training services . 
despite a suffering economy and high unemployment , this bill undercuts the ability of our government to provide for these vital workers and erodes congressional authority and accountability over workforce funds . 
under the provisions of h.r. 27 , funding will be shifted from wia partner programs to pay for the wia infrastructure and core services costs . 
why would we threaten these vital social programs by passing a flawed bill that does not even assure more training would result from the transfer of funds ? 
by repealing long-standing civil rights protections that were signed into law by president reagan , this bill allows job-training providers to discriminate on the basis of religion . 
we can not allow this gross inequity to tear at the fabric of a fundamental american principle -- the inalienable right to fair and equal treatment under the law . 
mr. chairman , i rise today in support of h.r. 27 , the job training improvement act . 
through local and state workforce investment boards , this legislation will strengthen job training programs to meet the needs of local businesses , many of which rely heavily on information technology , it . 
in the span of just two decades , information technology has become a commonplace part of our lives and has also created nearly 10 million jobs in the united states . 
information technology is a factor in the productivity and success of many different sectors of our economy . 
it is for this reason , mr. chairman , that the committee report encourages states to examine whether providers of training offer the opportunity to obtain an industry-developed and maintained certification or credential . 
through certification , individuals receive validation of a level of expertise . 
employers also benefit when certification assures a level of skill that an individual could bring to a job . 
the success of wia in expanding the computer skills of americans -- through training and certification -- will improve the productivity of every sector of our economy . 
mr. speaker , by direction of the committee on rules , i call up house resolution 126 and ask for its immediate consideration . 
mr. speaker , for the purpose of debate only , i yield the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from massachusetts ( mr. mcgovern ) xz4002630 , pending which i yield myself such time as i may consume . 
during consideration of this resolution , all time yielded is for the purposes of debate only . 
mr. speaker , house resolution 126 is a structured rule providing for 1 hour of general debate equally divided between the chairman and ranking minority member of the committee on education and the workforce . 
mr. speaker , i am pleased to stand before the house today in strong support of this rule and support of the underlying resolution legislation , h.r. 27 , the job training improvement act of 2005 . 
the gentleman from ohio ( chairman boehner ) and the gentleman from california ( subcommittee chairman mckeon ) and the committee members from both sides of the aisle are to be commended for their diligence and hard work in putting together a comprehensive measure reauthorizing vital job training programs while , at the same time , providing for improvements of those programs aimed at providing greater flexibility , accountability , targeting federal dollars where they will be most effective and where there is the highest demonstrated need . 
mr. speaker , my favorite movie of all time has always been `` inherit the wind. '' i still think it is spencer tracy 's greatest role . 
but in that he , playing the character of henry drummond , talks about the other main character , matthew harrison brady , who was a well intentioned , yet flawed , character . 
and in talking about his death , drummond says of brady , a giant once lived in that body . 
we are well intentioned , the greatest of desire to serve ; but we oftentimes get lost and allow too many people to fall through cracks and harm people because we try to solve problems from too high up and administer programs from too far away . 
last wednesday in my district at a town meeting , i met a young lady by the name of micaela , who offered me also this five-page letter of her efforts and her concerns . 
she is in need of vocational rehabilitation services , but does not quite fit our standards we have designed . 
in her letter she said in her years of trying to receive services that she was told she had too many disabilities , too few disabilities . 
she was too young , too old , and too rare of a circumstance . 
the federal government 's only advantage is that of uniformity . 
but if we truly believe that people are each individuals , that they have a spark of divinity , that individual needs are there that require individualized help , then we do not need uniformity . 
what we need is creativity , efficiency , and caring ; and that can only be done effectively on the state levels , which is why this particular bill has gone from several years ago , 63 programs , has now taken three funding streams and tried to bring it into one so they could help individual people by trying to apply 70 percent of the funding that has been given to students to those who have been unserved and out of school , to create a demonstration project for personal reemployment accounts to meet individual needs prior to coming to congress , i had the opportunity , like many of you , of serving in the state legislature , and i was a teacher for a long time . 
in that position , or those positions , i witnessed firsthand the years of oftentimes federal programs and mandates shoved on states , on local school districts , on local units of governments with this one-size-fits-all uniform approach . 
a uniform federal approach stifles innovation with the heavy hand of federal regulations and professionalism . 
the philosophy behind h.r. 27 , therefore , is to give governors as the chief political officer of the states the flexibility over job training programs to promote economic development and jobs based upon local needs , and that way , the states become responsive to employment and to job markets . 
and i was amazed at the benefits i saw of partnerships with local private industry , government contractors , and local employers coming together . 
in their diesel program , to find the kinds of materials that were provided by the industry , they have to get hands-on experience for first-rate technicians . 
and in program after program in that particular college , i saw , through innovation and hard work , the community college has been able to leverage the state and federal dollars and to attract private contributions for equipment and training that met the need of training qualified workers in the high-tech future . 
they are encouraged under this legislation , which is vital in helping provide workers for the competition of the 21st century . 
h.r. 27 is strongly supported by a coalition of community colleges which authorizes $ 250 million for community-based job training grants to strengthen the role of those communities ' colleges and to promote the united states ' full workforce potential . 
i further support h.r. 27 because it targets federal funds to groups of youths who are presently underserved , because it provides for individual self-help efforts . 
i would like to point out also that h.r. 27 builds upon legislation passed in the 108th congress , namely h.r. 1261 , the workforce reinvestment and adult education act of 2003 , which was passed by this house . 
there may be some who would oppose this bill because it respects both the letter and the spirit of existing law . 
let us not , in the debate over the rule or the bill , lose focus and lose sight of our goal , which is to help the micaelas of this nation who need services , which are and will continue to be distributed fairly without precondition . 
it is significant that we not confuse services rendered with the desire of some to sanitize and regulate legally diverse practices , reaffirmed in a rare moment of sanity by the courts , which do not impact the rendering of those employment services . 
others beside sanctioned-government programs care and help and are effective , and we ought to forget the old pattern of confrontation and pointless attacks on groups that we see as different ; we should join for the common goal of helping people . 
the rule allows for three specific amendments to focus discussion on key elements of the proposal . 
i am looking forward to riveting debate on this bill , with the realization our goal is to help the micaelas of this world who have been hurt because there have been programs which are too high , too far away , and forgot our purpose of helping real people . 
i urge adoption of the rule . 
mr. speaker , i reserve the balance of my time . 
mr. speaker , i reserve the balance of my time . 
the programs that we already have in place , specifically the disabled veterans ' outreach program , the local veterans employment representative program , the vocational rehabilitation program , already are required to contribute to the infrastructure of these one-stop career center programs . 
any money that would come to the one-stop center would be coming out of their administrative funds , not from the money going directly to the training of veterans . 
mr. speaker , i reserve the balance of my time . 
they have a right to do so and i expect it will be warmly discussed in the ensuing discussion of the bill itself . 
i believe strongly in the ability of our states , governors , local boards , workforce boards , to be creative and innovative . 
people can think for themselves in other parts of this country . 
and the essence of our government demands that we give them the opportunity to succeed without the benevolent help of the federal government . 
our job , might i remind my colleagues , is to make sure the micaelas of the world never slip through the cracks . 
i believe , and i have confidence in the ability of local governments to be creative and effective , and i think so does h.r. 27 . 
what we have today is a confusing patchwork of employment , training services . 
the duplication of those reduces the amount of money we get to use to help micaelas . 
a lot of other amendments were heard in the committee . 
our goal should be to try to join hands to help all the micaelas in the world solve the problem of employment , retraining , and servicing , not to try to change our friends in other particular ways but to join together on a common front , in a common effort , to help people , not to harm people . 
mr. speaker , in closing , i urge adoption of the rule and the underlying legislation . 
mr. speaker , i yield back the balance of my time , and i move the previous question on the resolution . 
mr. speaker , we are going to talk about economic competitiveness in the economy tonight , but before we start on that topic , i just want to draw attention to a couple of things that have appeared in the newspaper and talk about iraq and the middle east . 
this is from baghdad : more than 2 , 000 people demonstrated tuesday at the site of a car bombing south of baghdad that killed 125 people chanting no to terrorism . 
mr. speaker , our hearts go out to those individuals and their families , those that have lost their lives , and certainly our hearts continue to go out to the families of each and every man and woman in our military service . 
i think we join with every one of them , all of our military families and with all of these iraqis who love freedom and are loving having the opportunity to grasp on to freedom , and we join them in saying no to terrorism and standing strong for freedom . 
another article that i saw today from newsday , mr. speaker , some arabs see beginning of a new era , and i think this is very important that we pay attention to this . 
one of my colleagues was talking about the headlines that we do not see on some of the national media , some of the leftist media , and i think this one is worthy of a mention . 
it was a scene the arab world 's autocratic regimes have dreaded , and through the power of satellite tv , it could catch on as fast as the latest music video . 
what happened in lebanon this week , analysts say , is the beginning of a new era in the middle east , one in which popular demand pushes the momentum for democracy and people 's will can no longer be disregarded . 
repeatedly , he talks about how in the heart of every man and woman is the desire to be free and to seek that freedom and to have hope and to have opportunity . 
it is so appropriate that we acknowledge that freedom , that we appreciate the sacrifice that is there for that freedom because it is through the expansion of that freedom that we enjoy the fruits and the benefits of a free society . 
one of those is the opportunity to dream big dreams and have great adventure , have great successes and to see that lived out in our lives . 
and it is clear that after battling the recession of 2001 , weathering a terrorist attack cost us billions . 
there are even estimates that the cost to the american economy of september 11 and the travesty that took place there was $ 2 trillion , a full quarter of our nation 's productivity for a year . 
after fighting an expensive global war on terrorism , being in the middle of that fight , we have faced significant challenges and we have made some very wise decisions . 
over the past couple of years , despite very heavy criticism from some of our colleagues and from the tax-and-spend liberals , we , as a congress , have made tax cuts , have reduced the tax burden that the american people are paying . 
mr. speaker , it is certainly something that i know , as millions of americans tonight are sitting down at their kitchen tables with pencil and paper and beginning to look at those forms , filling out their federal income tax filings , that they are noticing the difference that the tax cuts we have passed are making in their lives . 
they have opposed making some of these cuts and reductions . 
this past week we found the economy grew faster than expected in the last few months of 2004 . 
and for a lot of folks who are economic news junkies , they know that 3.8 is a pretty good rate . 
for those that are casual listeners , that is something we can be proud of , and we can talk about that . 
in february , we had the twenty-first consecutive month , that is twenty-first consecutive months , of increased economic activity in the manufacturing sector . 
i want to be certain everybody hears and understands that : twenty-first months of consecutive increases in economic activity in the manufacturing sector . 
that is nearly 2 years of growth . 
for some of the tool and die manufacturers that are in my district , from some of the manufacturers that we see of various component parts , of items that are being created , how exciting that they are seeing growth ; that they are seeing growth in their jobs that they have right there in these local communities . 
and that is not all of it . 
that is more than 3 years of solid economic expansion . 
that got revised up for the last quarter of 2004 . 
we have had twenty-first consecutive months of increases in productivity in the manufacturing sector . 
we have had 40 consecutive months of overall economic growth . 
the people that are running the companies , the people that are deciding whether to expand , whether to make capital investments , whether to create new jobs , they have a great deal of confidence . 
you never would have thought that was happening if you were listening to some of our friends across the aisle . 
they do not want to talk about 21 straight months of manufacturing gains , 4-0 , 40 consecutive months of overall economic growth . 
here is one that describes the results as `` extremely positive '' ; another one , talking about capital investments by business , `` are the best indicators of growth at this stage of recovery , '' and that this bodes well for the economy . 
so we are seeing it with our small businesses , and we are seeing it with some of our new companies . 
and it does not matter if you are a big or small company , it does not matter if you are an entrepreneur , it does not matter if you are new or some of our wonderful companies that have been there for 100 years . 
we have to get rid of some of the obstacles . 
and though some of our folks do not like to talk about rolling back taxes , rolling back those taxes is removing an obstacle . 
another obstacle is the high cost of compliance with those taxes . 
another obstacle is onerous regulation that comes from some of our federal agencies . 
get the government out of the way , and you are going to see free enterprise go do what they are geared up to do , do what they are best at doing , do what they dream about doing , what they spend their lives trying to figure out how to do : how to create jobs , how to build a better mousetrap , how to get out there and sell that better mousetrap to people that are ready to buy improved products . 
the way this economy works is something to get excited about , and i am thrilled that we have had the opportunity to see this kind of economic growth . 
mr. speaker , i am joined here on the floor tonight by one of my colleagues , a gentleman from the freshman class i served in in the 108th congress , the gentleman from iowa ( mr. king ) xz4002201 . 
he is a small businessman , a farmer , and he does a lot of thinking when he gets out there on that tractor , and he brings a lot of wisdom to this chamber . 
as i said earlier , we have had 40 consecutive months of economic growth . 
a lot of times women do not look forward to that 40th birthday , but when we talk about the 40th month of economic growth , that is certainly a date that we want to celebrate . 
the gentleman from iowa ( mr. king ) mentioned tax reform and the cost of 22 cents of every dollar of manufactured good in this nation being eaten up by compliance , and the importance of us having a wonderful debate about how we lower that cost so that every sector of our economy is going to see greater productivity and is going to see growth . 
over the past 2 years , as the gentleman from iowa ( mr. king ) said , we created about 2.7 million new jobs , and that will soon in a couple of months be 1.5 million new jobs per year . 
there are a couple of industries that have seen good growth in the past couple of months : apparel , textiles , transportation and equipment , electronic components and equipment , chemicals , industrial and commercial equipment and computers , instruments , photographic equipment , metals , food , wood and wood products . 
virtually every state in the union can claim at least one of these industrial sectors . 
in fact , one of the things that we have seen about job creation is that in 48 of our 50 states we have seen jobs growth . 
over the past year , 48 of our 50 states have seen jobs growth . 
that is why we are beginning to see this 40 months of overall economic growth , 21 straight months where we are seeing increases in the manufacturing sector , and we know all of this means jobs . 
we know that there is a lot of work ahead that we need to do to be certain that this economy keeps growing . 
mr. speaker , much of our focus this session is going to be on economic growth , economic competitiveness , doing the things that encourage , that create the right environment . 
and much of her focus , even though her ph.d . 
is in education , she understands the importance of an educated workforce and lifelong learning and developing the skills that are so necessary to be productive in your job , to be satisfied in your job . 
i thank the gentlewoman for bringing her perspective to the debate and for celebrating , allowing us to celebrate with the good people of forsythe county , north carolina , as they welcome 700 new jobs to their area . 
as a matter of fact , we have a program in montgomery county , tennessee , that is really attuned to the needs of our veterans and to our military spouses and our military retirees . 
and they are going to be honored later this week for their excellent work that they are doing for jobs retraining , helping people focus on the importance of developing and having that career . 
they are very important components of our economic competitiveness , just as tax reform , just as tort reform and the other things that we have discussed this evening . 
mr. speaker , at this time i would like to recognize a member of the freshman class , new to us , but with a tremendous amount of experience in his home state of texas where he has been a part of the business community , has served as a judge , and is a skilled legislator . 
the gentleman from texas ( mr. gohmert ) xz4006510 is going to speak with us for a few moments about some of the things that are happening in texas as in the process with our economic competitiveness issues . 
you know , mr. speaker , one of the things we are hearing from business schools all across the country , one of the things we are hearing from high schools , from tech schools is that more and more people are saying , i want to be an entrepreneur . 
i want to see if i can grab on to that american dream of owning my own company , starting a company , having an idea , watching that idea come to fruition in the form of a company that creates jobs . 
construction spending rose a strong seven-tenths of a percent in january , a month when generally they are not going to see that kind of increase . 
this pushed total construction activity to a record high of just over $ 1 trillion at a seasonally adjusted annual rate and followed an even larger 1.2 percent rise in december . 
what we are seeing is confidence and belief and the fact that people believe in the strength of this economy . 
he is with us for just a few moments to talk about some of the good things that are happening in his state . 
mr. speaker , one of the things that i do a lot and that i had the opportunity to do over the break is to visit with small business owners . 
unfortunately , i have a lot of colleagues who are not listening to these small business owners . 
i think it is important to note , small businesses in america represent over 90 percent of all employers and employ half of all private sector employees . 
they pay 44.3 percent of the total u.s. private payroll . 
that is our small businesses and entrepreneurs that we have talked about today , the people that are starting businesses , that are creating so many of these jobs . 
small businesses generate 60 to 80 percent of the net new jobs growth annually . 
republicans have passed legislation to stem the tide of frivolous lawsuits , and we are continuing to do more on the tort reform issues . 
we want to harness more of our domestic energy . 
we believe excessive government growth in spending crowds businesses out of the marketplace . 
we know that the growth of government needs to be curtailed so that less of the taxpayers ' money is being required to pay for the government , so that taxpayers keep that money in their pocket . 
reducing the size of government is what we have talked about over the past couple of weeks as we have talked about rooting out waste , fraud , and abuse and reducing the size of the federal government . 
we have had 40 months of overall economic growth . 
we would like to see another 40 months of economic growth and job creation for americans . 
we have had 2.7 million jobs created in just under the past couple of years . 
we had our last quarter of 2004 with 3.8 percent economic growth . 
and all of our small business owners , myself included , we know the cost that regulation imposes and the importance of rolling back regulation . 
among the top complaints that we receive from small business owners has to do with the federal tax code , the cost of compliance . 
twenty-two cents of every single dollar of manufactured goods in this nation is spent in compliance . 
that is an obstacle that we need to get rid of , and we are committed to working on that . 
we know this tax code is overly complicated , it is time-consuming , and it is incredibly frustrating for millions of small business owners in this nation . 
mr. speaker , i congratulate the gentleman from utah ( mr. bishop ) xz4000291 as a new member of the committee on rules for his work today on his first rule that he is bringing to the floor of the house . 
today we are considering a rule that would allow for consideration of the reauthorization of the workforce investment act . 
they are intended to be able to provide training and retraining for american workers who are out of work or workers who simply want to improve their skills so they can move up the economic ladder . 
we want to ensure that more of the funding that is available for this act goes down to the local county boards , or , in some cases , multiple county jurisdictions . 
in this bill , we also renew the vocational programs for those who have disabilities , an important part of our workforce . 
i think all of us know if we are going to be successful in the 21st century , that america has to do a better job of training and retraining our workforce . 
the days of going to work for one employer and being there for most of your career are , by and large , over . 
people are going to change jobs multiple times during their career , and we have to have available to them the kinds of services where they can improve their skills to take that new job of tomorrow . 
there is one amendment that we will debate that we have had considerable debate on over the last several years in this congress and considered in the committee twice during the markup of this bill . 
the 1964 civil rights act , the landmark legislation which prevented discrimination in america , allowed for one exception in hiring and that exception was granted to religious organizations where we grant them an exemption if they wished to only hire people of their own faith . 
we believe that faith-based providers who may want to offer services , job training services or retraining services , ought not to be denied their rights under the 1964 civil rights act just because they want to help the neediest of the needy and help the poor improve their skills and get a job . 
some believe , and it is certainly their right to have a different opinion , believe that faith-based organizations , even though they have this right , ought to be forced to give it up in order to take federal funds to help the poorest of the poor . 
the backbone of a strong economy is a well-trained and highly skilled workforce , and it is absolutely critical for workers to have the education and skills necessary to adapt to new opportunities and to move into higher wages . 
the chairman said , `` we need to increase our efforts to ensure that as many of our citizens as possible have the opportunity to capture the benefits of the changing economy . 
one critical element in creating that opportunity is the provision of rigorous education and ongoing training to all members of our society. '' chairman greenspan this morning testified before congress and talked about the need to do a better job with our education system and better training and retraining of american workers . 
in 1998 , congress established a system of one-stop career centers aimed at providing one convenient central location to offer job training and related employment services . 
our bill includes a number of reforms aimed at strengthening our job training system and better engaging the business community to improve job training services . 
our bill includes a number of reforms . 
in addition , it targets 70 percent of the youth grant funds to out-of-school youth , an underserved population that faces significant challenges in finding meaningful employment . 
the bill includes a proposal passed by the house last year introduced by the gentleman from nevada ( mr. porter ) xz4003240 to create personal reemployment accounts of up to $ 3 , 000 to help unemployed americans purchase job training and other employment-related services , such as child care , transportation services and housing assistance , giving them the flexibility they need in order to gain meaningful employment . 
our nation 's faith-based institutions have a proven track record in meeting the training and counseling needs of our citizens . 
president bush repeated this call to empower faith-based providers both during his state of the union address and again yesterday . 
i can think of no better place to start than to protect the rights of faith-based groups who are willing to lend a helping hand in providing job training and other critical social services to the most needy of our citizens . 
i want to thank the gentleman from california ( mr. mckeon ) xz4002670 for his work in putting this bill together , a bill that is supported by a broad and diverse coalition of groups , including the u.s. chamber of commerce , the national association of counties , the national association of workforce boards , the national workforce association , the coalition to preserve religious freedom and the salvation army , amongst others . 
we are part of a dynamic economy that is constantly creating new and different types of jobs , so the knowledge and skills of each job seeker is absolutely critical in determining their success or failure . 
unfortunately , the only plan that my colleagues on the other side have put forward to address the needs of american workers is the status quo . 
their plan fails to reduce duplication and inefficiency , it fails to give states and local communities more flexibility , and it fails to take advantage of the positive role that faith-based institutions play in our communities and the success they have in providing critical social services to those most in need . 
mr. chairman , i reserve the balance of my time . 
mr. chairman , i am pleased to yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from california ( mr. mckeon ) xz4002670 , the author of the bill , the chairman of the subcommittee on 21st century competitiveness . 
i will continue to work with him and the department to ensure that we have the necessary information to carefully monitor the participation of high school-aged students in adult education programs . 
i want to thank the chairman on the committee for adopting two amendments i have introduced to enhance further employability of the limited english proficient calculation by providing necessary skills , training and english language instruction . 
i believe that the backbone of a strong economy and a strong society is a well-trained and highly-skilled workforce . 
this bill includes a number of reforms aimed at strengthening our nation 's job training system and better engaging the business community to improve job training services . 
the bill reauthorizes the rehabilitation act of 1993 , the primary federal program designed to assist individuals with disabilities to prepare for , obtain and retain employment to live independently ; and furthermore , it includes transition services for students with disabilities moving from secondary education into post-secondary activities that can only be determined as a possible alternative to address the needs of those in special needs . 
i pledge to work with her and other interested members of the new york delegation during conference on this legislation to identify and remedy any governance problems which new york may have under this bill . 
so my goal is to ensure that the mandatory partners contribute to the cost of the one-stop infrastructure without causing constitutional problems for states . 
mr. chairman , i reserve the balance of my time . 
mr. chairman , i yield myself the balance of my time . 
mr. chairman , what we have before us is the reauthorization of the workforce investment act . 
these one-stop centers that have been created all over the country to help the people gain skills and to increase their skills are a critical part of what we need to do if we are going to have a successful economy over the next 10 , 20 and even 50 years . 
we believe that by consolidating the three separate funding streams , three different sets of employees , three different sets of books , we can gain more flexibility for the local workforce boards and thereby freeing up more dollars to be used to actually train workers . 
we believe strongly that the youth services money here ought to be directed for the most part to out of school youth , a population that is vastly underserved and we do that in this bill . 
we also believe that faith-based providers , especially in large urban centers , can provide a very necessary outreach to help those who are really needy have an opportunity to get the kind of training and retraining they need to become productive members of our society . 
and while my friends on the other side of the aisle have some disagreement , i think all of us understand that by and large , this is a good program , that the bill before us is worth the support of my colleagues and i would ask them to do that . 
mr. chairman , i yield back the balance of my time . 
mr. chairman , the amendment that is being offered by my friend , the gentleman from michigan ( mr. kildee ) xz4002160 , would strike all of the positive reforms for youth that are included in h.r. 27 . 
in the white house , the disadvantaged youth task force has proposed targeted federal youth training funds to serve the most in need and to reduce the duplication of services amongst federal programs . 
there are a large number of programs today designed to deal with in-school , at-risk children , and there is really only one program in wia that is targeted at out-of-school youth . 
what we tried to do in this bill was to strike a balance by requiring that 70 percent of the youth program funds go to out-of-school youth , a population that is by and large ignored and that i think these funds ought to be targeted to . 
we do allow the local workforce boards to use up to 30 percent of their programs for in-school youth ; but there are other programs , a half a dozen other programs , targeted at these at-risk children who are in school . 
so as a way of trying to bring more synergy to an effort to help out-of-school youth , i think the language we have in the bill strikes the right balance . 
mr. chairman , i reserve the balance of my time . 
as a matter of fact , the targeting of funds to the local workforce boards in this bill is more structured than it is today under current law , so that at least 75 percent of the funds available back to the states must go to the local workforce investment boards . 
now , if people want to disagree with title vii of the 1964 civil rights act , they certainly have that right . 
mr. chairman , i am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from georgia ( mr. price ) xz4006261 , a member of the committee ) . 
mr. chairman , i yield 30 seconds , the balance of my time , to my friend , the gentleman from massachusetts ( mr. tierney ) xz4004070 , who i know has been pressed for time . 
mr. chairman , i reserve the balance of my time . 
title vii of the 1964 civil rights act explicitly says that religious organizations in their hiring can hire people of their own faith . 
it says that a religious organization can take religion into account in terms of their hiring . 
mr. chairman , i reserve the balance of my time . 
mr. chairman , i yield myself the balance of my time . 
mr. chairman , so the debate here boils down to one of two issues , you believe that if these faith-based organizations want to participate in these programs that they have to give up their rights under the 1964 civil rights act . 
we believe and the majority of this house has believed on a number of occasions as we have had this vote , that faith-based organizations who want to help the neediest of the needy should in fact be able to have their rights under the 1964 civil rights act . 
there is no reason why that they can not partner with the federal government to help us in our effort to help the neediest of the needy , and to help improve the prospects for job training and retraining to help all americans participate in the 21st century economy and give them a chance to succeed at the american dream . 
mr. chairman , i yield back the balance of my time . 
what the gentleman from michigan proposes here is a brand new program similar to a trade adjustment program that provides up to 2 years of unemployment-type benefits and provides unlimited access to training . 
the gentleman creates a new preference here above other types of people who may have lost their jobs . 
we all know it will probably take 2 to 5 years for this type of program to be implemented . 
the fact is i think it is a cruel hoax on those who may be unemployed , who may fall into one of these categories to think that they are going to be eligible for unemployment-type assistance or be eligible for unlimited training when , in fact , there is no appropriation and the fact is the program will take years to implement . 
mr. speaker , i yield back the balance of my time . 
mr. chairman , i rise in support of h.r. 27 , the job training improvement act , which will reauthorize the workforce investment act ( wia ) -- programs which provide job training for youths , veterans , and seasonal and migrant workers . 
for example , in delaware all of our centers are fully equipped with : internet ready computers , interactive cd-rom tutorials , fax machine to send resume and cover letters to perspective employers , copy machine , telephone resource center with career manuals including reference books . 
delaware also runs an internet site where applicants can post resumes , as well as to search a comprehensive database of job openings . 
the purpose of highlighting the program in delaware is to provide a real life example of useful it is to have services in one central place . 
the bill before us today builds on the efficiency of the `` one-stop delivery '' model by streamlining unnecessary bureaucracy , eliminating duplication , strengthening resource allocation , and improving accountability . 
i am pleased that we are able to make reforms that build upon successes , and that will ultimately enhance the ability of adults to access services that lead to employment . 
under this legislation youth between the ages of 16 and 24 are eligible for a variety of services geared toward graduating high school or gaining the skills necessary for employment . 
the importance of these services can not be overstated to these young adults . 
mr. speaker , the outsourcing of good-paying american jobs to other countries is a crisis that touches every community in the united states . 
this at a time when there are 8 million americans out of work . 
americans now understand that outsourcing negatively impacts every segment of our economy . 
not only have 2.7 million jobs been lost in our once-vibrant manufacturing sector since the beginning of this administration but white collar jobs are being offshored as well . 
according to one report , 181 , 000 computer jobs will be moved offshore by the end of 2005 . 
last year , state and local governments outsourced $ 10 billion of public projects . 
what we are witnessing today is a full-scale erosion of the american workforce , with millions seeking skills to improve their current employment situation . 
this motion seeks to provide assistance to veterans , provide workers who lost their jobs to outsourcing with job training assistance , allowances to relocate to where they can find work and other forms of income support . 
this bill destroys the functioning elements of our job training system . 
it does not , quote , improve our delivery of these vital services for unemployed americans . 
i think the vast majority of americans would answer that question , absolutely not . 
should the gentleman from ohio ( mr. boehner ) xz4000360 , who is the author of this bill , have to come to me if i get a $ 5 million job computer training grant from the federal government under this bill , should the gentleman from ohio ( mr. boehner ) xz4000360 have to come to me and answer a 20-point religious questionnaire ? 
should the gentleman from ohio ( mr. boehner ) xz4000360 have to say whether or not he believes in jesus christ , whether or not he believes in evolution , whether or not he believes in the literal interpretation of the new testament ? 
i do not think the gentleman from ohio ( mr. boehner ) xz4000360 should have to answer those kinds of questions to me as a recipient of a $ 5 million job training grant . 
what the opponents of the scott amendment are saying is that the members of a white church who received a $ 1 million job training grant can say to an african american applicant , you do not belong to our church . 
it is unbelievable that on the very day american soldiers are risking their lives in iraq , and perhaps some have given their lives today in iraq to give the iraqis religious freedom , we are debating a bill on the floor of this house that would say an american citizen can be denied a federally funded , tax-funded job for simply one reason , the exercise of your religious faith . 
it is the first freedom enunciated in the bill of rights . 
the founding fathers thought so much about that freedom , about religious freedom , they put in the first 16 words of the first amendment these words : `` congress shall pass no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof. '' if saying that someone has to lose a job to support his or her family because they are exercising their own deeply-felt religious faith , if that is not prohibiting the free exercise of religion , what is ? 
if saying we are going to take away your ability to put food on the table for your children and a job that is paid for by taxpayers , to say that you can not have that job because you do not pass my private religious test , if that is not prohibiting the free exercise of religion , what is ? 
yet repeatedly i have heard on this floor those say on this side of the floor that supporters of the scott amendment are opposed to faith-based groups being involved in providing social services . 
i hope the members of this house will respect the founding fathers and the first amendment and the views of the vast majority of american citizens and say , no , you should not be denied a tax-funded job because of the exercise of your religious faith . 
i urge members on both sides of the aisle to put partisanship and politics aside . 
i will be addressing just one particular topic which has been controversial in committee discussions and will be the subject of an amendment later on , and that is turning the clock back on the civil rights act of 1964 and changing what it says . 
those who are opposed to this bill on that ground believe that somehow it is wrong to allow religious institutions to receive federal funds for programs that benefit the public at large , are not restricted to people of particular faith but are operated by organizations that are religiously based . 
i have yet to understand precisely what the objections are , but it seems that opponents are afraid of two things : one , that this provision in the bill somehow will allow these organizations to discriminate on other grounds in their hiring , which is , first , contrary to the civil rights act , and second , i would say religious organizations are the least likely to discriminate on the basis of race or any of the other forbidden categories . 
in fact , we spent 3 months trying out different churches , looking , trying to find a certain something : we wanted a church in the inner city because we wanted to be able to contribute to solving the problems of the city of grand rapids , particularly in the inner city . 
and so we joined eastern avenue christian reformed church because of its location and because of the attitude of its people . 
it was on the top story of a ramshackle building which housed a small convenience store in the lower floor . 
today it is a large community center , one of the best , if not the best , in the city . 
we did have and still largely do have religious restrictions on the hiring of individuals , but the facility serves all people in that community . 
it has brought in medical care workers of all faiths to work and provide medical care and dental care for the recipients in that community . 
iccf , the inner city christian federation , developed housing programs , and they had built many houses before habitat for humanity started in our community ; but iccf has built and remodeled more houses than almost any organization within the city that i am aware of . 
the employees are hired partially on the basis of their faith and their commitment to serving in the inner city and often work for less pay than they could get elsewhere . 
our church , not our individual congregation , but our denomination started a mental health institution , pine rest , years ago because the people of our church and of our community were not getting adequate mental care . 
today it is one of the largest mental health hospitals in our nation . 
it serves many people of different faiths and of no faith , but it is a faith-based institution because their treatment modalities are based , to a large extent , on our beliefs about the nature of people and their interaction with each other . 
it has received millions upon millions of dollars of aid from the federal government , from the state through community mental health funds and from the local community . 
every saturday , i wish you could visit our church ; you would see people of all races , all colors , all faiths walking in the church basement which we have stocked with food that we have collected from different stores , warehouses and so forth : produce , baked goods , and many different types of perishable food . 
and saturday morning anyone from that city can walk in with no test of their faith , no means test , they can just walk in and say , i need some groceries , and they go through the line . 
we charge them roughly 10 cents on the dollar because we think it is a good thing for them to feel they have bought something ; but a family of four can buy a week 's worth of groceries for about $ 10 . 
there is one other factor here as well , and that is every church that i am aware of does not have a surplus of money . 
those individuals not only operate programs such as the food program , or getting community centers started , but they also have duties within the church and by necessity , and clearly within the intent of the civil rights act , they are performing religious duties . 
you have to be multifaceted to be on the staff of a church , and that is precisely what we have in our church . 
for these reasons , and many others i could enumerate , i urge the congress to pass this rule and this bill , and to defeat the scott amendment , so that churches and faith-based organizations of other sorts can continue to do their good work for the people of this country without fear of their programs being damaged because they would have to hire additional personnel who do not have a faith compatible with the organization . 
the liberty that is being asked , frankly i am disappointed to hear this asserted , and i think the greatest denigration of religious organizations coming forward here are those who are saying this : there are religious groups in this country who are eager to help people in need , but if they get federal tax dollars to help people in need and they are forced to associate with heathens and unbelievers and infidels , then they will be driven away . 
but if you want all of those people in brooklyn who paid federal taxes , if you want a share of their federal taxes to run a program to help them , god forbid , i guess you mean this literally , god forbid you should have to hire one of them . 
martin luther king said , and it is sadly still true , that one of the most segregated times in america is the hour of worship . 
you may not think much of them , but you should not be discriminating against them , but they can not ever get a job . 
what we are going to be saying if you win here in the house of representatives is , attention all shiites , do not hire sunnis . 
apparently , we are going to be encouraging the people in iraq with iraqi government money or american government money , a lot of it is going to iraq , do you really think you want to send that message to the shiites that when they try to rebuild their country they should not hire sunnis ? 
that there is something somehow so corrosive about associating with someone of a different religion that it disables you from doing good ? 
what kind of motivation do you impute to these people ? 
you want to do good , but you should not have to associate with one of those people . 
by the way , even you acknowledge that the people being served have to be of all religions . 
is it really the case that religious organizations , that they are somehow so angry towards outsiders , that they feel so unclean that they can not help people in need if they have to associate with people who are otherwise perfectly qualified , who believe in the mission of this entity , but they do not share the same religion ? 
i hope we will not so characterize religious people as being so narrow and so biased towards people not of their own religion that they can not even work with them in this common cause to which you say they are committed . 
fortunately , there are many organizations in those communities that want to help , and they offer unique and innovative solutions to some of our most challenging needs . 
it is essential that we recognize the importance of government working with faith-based providers to help society . 
these organizations are a central part of the fabric of communities across america and we need to ensure that we are removing any obstacles that stand in the way of their ability to help . 
congress has an opportunity to take the reauthorization of the workforce investment act and address the needs of millions of unemployed americans . 
instead , we are presented with a proposal that reduces the impact of job training programs by cutting funding to traditional job training providers such as the veteran 's employment programs and perkins vocational education programs . 
however , i do not feel it is the place of the federal government or anyone receiving federal funds to question a job candidate about their religious beliefs . 
the houston area continues to have an unemployment rate higher than the national average , as does the state of texas . 
this bill will slow down the ability of those who need workforce training from getting it , and right now this economy needs all the help it can get . 
mr. chairman , i rise today in support of the gentleman from virginia 's ( mr. scott ) xz4003641 amendment to h.r. 27 . 
it established a commonsense clause prohibiting job discrimination on the basis of religion . 
h.r. 27 would allow faith-based organizations to discriminate not just on the basis of a person 's religious affiliation , but also on how closely they follow the tenets of that religion . 
or if a faith-based organization frowned upon women working outside the home , they could deny a woman a job just because of her gender or even deny it to her husband for allowing such a breach . 
h.r. 27 would remove these important protections , allowing faith-based organizations to discriminate on the basis of religion , even regarding the secular social services they provide . 
this bill contains the first ever major rollback of civil rights protections that were established over 40 years ago , and many of us , including myself , have profited from those protections and from those rights granted to us 40 years ago . 
this is an unconscionable change of federal law , and i can not support a bill with such provisions . 
mr. chairman , i urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the scott amendment and voting `` no '' on the final passage of this bill that endorses a federal rollback of decades-old civil rights and privacy protections . 
as a continuation of those efforts , we must not let these people fall through the cracks that we have in our employment laws . 
mr. speaker , i yield back the balance of my time . 
mr. chairman , i rise to engage the gentleman from ohio ( chairman boehner ) of the committee on education and the workforce in a colloquy . 
during our full committee consideration of h.r. 27 , i offered and withdrew an amendment to ensure that data on high school-aged students participating in adult education programs is publicly available and reported to our committee . 
we already know that 30 percent of our high school students fail to earn diplomas with their peers . 
many of our adult education providers report that high school-aged students are flooding their programs . 
at full committee , the gentleman offered to work with me to ensure that these concerns are addressed in the reports that our committee received from the department of education . 
it is simply a matter of clearly communicating to the department that we would like to see focused information on high school-aged students in adult education reported by race , ethnicity , language proficiency , and program enrollment . 
the gentleman from ohio , the chairman of the committee on which i serve , is correct . 
there was an amendment that would have struck the provisions to consolidate the funding of adult , dislocated worker and employment service ; and an amendment that i would like to address at this moment that i offered that would have increased the authorization by $ 750 million for job training programs under the workforce investment act . 
between fiscal year 2002 and fiscal year 2006 , mr. speaker , funding for the workforce investment act has been reduced by three-quarters of a billion dollars . 
he said : when senator paul wellstone walked off the floor arm in arm with senator mike dewine of ohio , bipartisan i should point out , paul wellstone said , `` mike , this may not be the lead story on the network news , but it 's a good piece of work. '' well , indeed it was not the lead story on the network news . 
david broder reports , it was hard to find a trace of their bill . 
but as says broder , in communities less consumed by scandal than washington , the impact of the measure that dewine and wellstone and others had fashioned may be felt in real lives long after the memories of the scandals have faded . 
in a dynamic economy where technological changes and market shifts are forcing layoffs of some people even as other jobs are being created , the key is to equip workers with needed skills and then link them efficiently to the vacancies . 
said broder back then , the workers will never know the names of the legislators , but they are in their debt . 
unfortunately , the workers who do not get to take advantage of this program because it is underfunded will never know what they have missed , and we have let them down . 
mr. chairman , i rise in opposition to h.r. 27 , the reauthorization of the workforce investment act . 
the workforce investment act was one of these pieces of legislation that actually helps people . 
it really would roll back 40 years of civil rights laws and decades of job training laws as we have heard here today . 
this is , i repeat , the kind of legislation that could actually help people . 
but this legislation does not provide adequate authorized funding for them and it changes many of the good features that have been part of the workforce investment act . 
mr. speaker , i rise in opposition to the structured rule that has been reported out of the committee on rules for this debate . 
the party-line vote of 220-204 that we saw in the 108th congress on the debate of the then h.r. 1261 should evidence the need for the most open debate over the issues . 
as representatives of the united states congress , we all have a duty to fully debate the issues on behalf of our constituents . 
nevertheless , i am pleased that the amendments of my colleagues from massachusetts , new york , and virginia respectively have been ruled in order . 
passage of these three important amendments will bring h.r. 27 one step closer to providing more jobs and better opportunities for american workers to receive training for these jobs . 
we must address the needs of our unemployed now and in a manner that respects the rights of individuals regardless of their faith , while they are struggling to pay their mortgages and to put food on the table for their families . 
mr. chairman , i rise in support of the amendment offered by my colleague the ranking member of the judiciary subcommittee on crime , mr. scott xz4003641 along with ms. woolsey , mr. van hollen , mr. frank , mr. edwards , and mr. nadler , to the base bill , h.r. 27 . 
as i stated with respect to the rule , h. res. 126 , the party-line vote of 220-204 that we saw in the 108th congress on the debate of the then h.r. 1261 should evidence the need for the most open debate over the deficiencies that lie within the provisions on the floor . 
as representatives of the united states congress , we all have a duty to fully debate the issues on behalf of our constituents . 
in fact , there is no place for religious discrimination in american law just as there should be no place in america for that kind of backwards thinking . 
presently , under our country 's existing laws , in title vii of the civil rights act , employing institutions using private funds were exempt from employment discrimination protections . 
however , wia programs are federally funded and as such do not fall under the jurisdiction of the title vii statute . 
each of my colleagues should understand that without this important amendment , we are advocating the notion that one 's ability to provide employment to those who are in need is contingent on the religious institution to which the individual belongs . 
as should all language that does not add to the well being of job-seekers or employment services . 
the founding fathers of this country found it necessary to say that no one should be unfairly judged or discriminated against on the basis of their religion . 
we should not encourage discrimination of any kind , religious or otherwise . 
surely , this country prides itself on its diversity and its willingness to open its doors to people of different religions , races , and ethnic backgrounds . 
yet on the floor of the people 's house we are faced with an attempt by the republicans to create a monolithic sub-culture within our employment training programs . 
despite the rhetoric on the other side of the aisle , h.r. 27 as it currently reads will not only result in the loss of jobs for applicants who do not identify with their prospective employer 's religious beliefs but more importantly it will cause the loss of quality workers . 
this amendment simply retains their freedom of religious choice and their freedom not to be discriminated against due to their religion . 
without the addition of this proposal , however , the body elected to serve all of the people of this country will have endorsed employment discrimination with federal dollars . 
we must do everything we can to preserve the fundamentals of head start . 
i urge my colleagues to vote to ensure that our job programs are not muddied and degraded by the promotion of religious discrimination . 
therefore , i stand in full support of this amendment and i urge my colleagues to do the same . 
particularly when we talk about these programs , what comes to mind , and i heard the gentleman from michigan ( mr. kildee ) xz4002160 be so eloquent in the committee on rules about the effectiveness and the importance of a training program , number one , for the new jobs of the 21st century . 
i am reminded of the fact that i spent a good part of my time as a locally elected official on the houston city council promoting the job training programs of our community that came down through the workforce board commissions in texas . 
when you eliminate summer jobs , you are literally undermining the opportunities for inner-city and rural youth to move to the next level of opportunity . 
you go into these youth training programs and you look at the smiles on the faces of individuals who have come from experiences where there was no work , where their families are unemployed , and where there is no hope and opportunity . 
i am very disappointed , in addition , to the cut in youth programs , and the fact that we are now getting rid of the veterans ' preference for job training , actually cutting funds . 
with a million people having served in afghanistan and iraq ; with the devastation of the impact of those returning veterans , with their emotional problems and injuries , and now we are suggesting to them that they are not worthy of a job preference . 
my last point is that i might beg to differ with the chairman of this particular distinguished committee . 
a program that is based upon religion and allows someone to deny you the opportunity for a job or a training position under the auspices of being a particular faith and being in charge of that particular program is discrimination under title vii in the 1964 civil rights bill or under any discrimination law that has been passed in america and that exists today . 
frankly , i believe this bill , even in its presence on the floor of the house , should go no further than this house ; and i ask my colleagues to support the tierney amendment , but to oppose the underlying bill . 
this legislation fails to increase the amount of actual training services that will be provided to unemployed , dislocated , and underemployed workers . 
instead , this legislation focuses on moving around and changing the bureaucratic elements of wia without focusing on getting more resources to the consumers of these programs . 
there he met a woman in her late 50s who is a mother of three children . 
is this the attitude of this administration when it comes to the challenges of working adults and families ? 
it will go down in history with marie antoinette 's famous quote : `` let them eat cake. '' mr. chairman , this bill is not going to help this mother of three or the millions of americans seeking job training . 
termination of the employment service will translate into higher unemployment and less jobs . 
the elimination of the employment service and wagner-peyser marks another example of the republican majority terminating a new deal program . 
wagner-peyser was first enacted in june of 1933 in the first term of president franklin delano roosevelt . 
in my hometown of flint , michigan , we had two parts of the unemployment office , one where you applied for the unemployment benefits and the other where you went in and were seeking a job and they would put the unemployed and an employer together . 
instead of helping vulnerable and needy individuals , these resources would fund infrastructure costs of the one-stop centers . 
many of these individuals have nowhere else to turn to receive help , and this bill would exacerbate this problem . 
we should provide a separate source of funding for these one-stop centers . 
the bill turns back the clock on decades of civil rights protections in our job training programs . 
focus hope in detroit , michigan , is one of the best , if not the best , job training program in the state of michigan . 
focus hope was run until his death by father william cunningham , a classmate of mine in the seminary . 
he trained thousands of people in inner-city detroit as a catholic priest assigned by his bishop there , and he did not care whether those who were training people to run a lathe , to do engineering or whatever it was , he did not care whether they were catholic , whether they were protestant , whether they were morman , muslim or had no faith at all . 
research on similar schemes have proven that pras are not an effective means of providing job training . 
mr. chairman , this bill does not respond to the needs of underemployed and unemployed individuals . 
i urge members to join me in opposing passage of this legislation . 
mr. chairman , i reserve the balance of my time . 
in 1998 , the gentleman from california ( mr. mckeon ) xz4002670 who is a very good friend of mine , we will always remain friends , we have great respect for one another , we wrote a very good bill in 1998 , wia , and i hope we would do likewise this time ; but i find myself unable to support this bill . 
mr. chairman , i yield back the balance of my time . 
nothing in the act prevents states from spending all of youth funds on out-of-school youths . 
the majority of states are challenged by current out-of-school requirements . 
mr. chairman , i reserve the balance of my time . 
mr. chairman , i yield the balance of my time to the gentlewoman from texas ( ms. jackson-lee ) xz4001990 . 
mr. chairman , i yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from massachusetts ( mr. tierney ) xz4004070 , the author of the amendment . 
the administration has turned a deaf ear to the needs of these workers . 
mr. speaker , i yield back the balance of my time . 
mr. chairman , i rise in support of the amendment offered by the gentleman from virginia , mr. scott . 
the president and i have our disagreements , but the one concern we do share is that sunday is generally regarded as the most segregated day of the week . 
i support the work of our religious institutions in sponsoring federal programs and delivering vital social and employment programs to our communities . 
i first sought elected office by the grace of our god and at the urging of my church . 
but supporters of this bill contend if you do not allow religious organizations to hire members of their own faith , we are denying religious institutions from participating in federal programs that deliver needed services to our local communities . 
in fact , i would suggest that this movement is reminiscent of the days of school desegregation when many parents withdrew their children from public school so they could attend so-called christian academies for the purpose learning . 
why does the federal government want to encourage that kind of action ? 
before getting to the economy , i want to add some remarks to those of the gentlewoman from tennessee 's discussion with regard to the middle east . 
i would like to paint this image in the mind of the people in the country . 
and that is that as we see people demonstrating in the streets of lebanon , when they have made the pledge that they are not leaving the public arena until they are a government governed by themselves and that they are a free people , that magnificent display that is going on in lebanon today , as i watched that , i looked back through my mind 's eye and i asked myself where i have experienced anything like that before ; where i have seen anything like that in history . 
that miracle of freedom that echoed across eastern europe in that time was not something anyone predicted . 
yet our president stood just outside this capitol building on january 20 and gave his second inaugural address , and even the liberal news media understood there was a bush doctrine , and that was the doctrine of freedom . 
when that day comes , we will no longer see the habitat that breeds terror , and we will be able to actually stand here today and define a victory in the war on terror , and that is the absence of the habitat that breeds terrorists . 
i characterize it a couple of ways and add to the gentlewoman 's discussion , and that is that our jobs growth in this country has been going on at such a torrid pace that we will soon , within the next 3 months , reach the level of over the last 2 years having had job growth of 1.5 million jobs a year . 
that is an amazingly fast growth , 3.8 percent growth as the gentlewoman said , but that in the face of the trial lawyers skimming 3 percent off the top . 
if we want to grow at 3 1/2 percent , just to sustain the growth we need in our infrastructure and to meet the needs of a growing population , then we have to make up for that 3 percent that goes off the top because of the litigation in this country that is rampant . 
we took steps in this congress to rein some of that in . 
we sent it over to the senate , where this year they heard us and sent it to the president , and he signed the litigation reform legislation , which will make a difference and make it easier to sustain that kind of growth . 
seven out of ten people you meet on the street live in a home they own or are making payments on . 
and what that does for sending the roots down into our economy and society and keeping our children at home , all of those things are a plus that show up in the bottom line . 
that is so much in the last year that it scares me a little bit , being a 28-year employer ; thinking that if personal income is up 8.6 percent , then i would have to be giving my employees a raise of 8.6 percent every year , which is a pretty torrid pace as well to keep up with employment . 
earlier we heard on the floor some remarks that we have a lot of problems with the trade imbalance , and i will not deny we have a trade imbalance . 
so that is about a 20 percent increase in the negative balance of trade that we have . 
some of those things work out good for our consumers . 
so we need to work this thing back to correct the balance of trade , but it is not something that will be done with a policy that says , well , we are concerned about sweat shop labor in el salvador or those kinds of issues that are essentially out of control . 
now , we have done good things with the jobs and growth act , and they were the right decisions to bring us back from the bursting of the dot-com bubble that happened about 7 or 8 months before the president was inaugurated the first time ; and then , of course , the september 11 attacks . 
i will argue that those two blows to our economy , coupled together , were the greatest blows , the most severe blows ever to the economy of this country ; yet we have recovered . 
mr. speaker , we can do better because there is another level , another destiny for the united states of america . 
today , today every day when people go to work and punch the time clock or make the sales calls or throw that bale of hay , uncle sam stands there with his hand out with the first lien on everyone 's labor , on the productivity of america , on your investment interest and on your labor . 
ronald reagan once said what you tax you get less of . 
so us , in our wisdom , we tax productivity in america instead of consumption . 
i suggest we eliminate the irs , the tax code that goes with it , and transfer all of this over to a national sales tax , a consumption tax , a fair tax , h.r. 5 and tax consumption , take all tax off of production and get uncle sam out of the way , standing there at the time clock getting his first and the worker getting his later , and change this whole attitude . 
the irs right now is a trillion dollar drag on an $ 11 trillion economy when we add the cost of funding them , enforcing them , and the disincentives that are in place that people decide i am not going to make that sales call , i am not going to do that extra overtime , i am not going to make that investment in that farm or industrial factory because the tax burden is too high . 
take-home pay goes up 56 percent under a national sales tax , and items on the shelf , their price goes down by an average of 22 percent because there is an imputed cost in everything that is sold . 
businesses that provide goods for sales have to impute the cost of the federal tax in that item . 
that is an average of 22 percent . 
so , for example , if there is a japanese-made mazda that is imported from japan sitting on the dealer 's lot at $ 30 , 000 , and pick your american brand sitting on the other side of the street with a $ 30 , 000 sticker price , we remove the federal tax that is imputed into the american made because it is imputed in the japanese made overseas . 
we have approximately a $ 9 , 000 advantage on those two vehicles of equivalent value that were selling competitively at $ 30 , 000 each . 
we change the tax policy , and competition drives the price out of the american made and now we have an advantage to market american goods . 
mr. speaker , that is one of the ways that we can address this imbalance of trade because we will build more products here . 
if we sell more of our products here , that means the jobs that produce them are here . 
we can repair this balance of trade with a national sales tax , a fair tax . 
we can change this $ 617.7 billion of red ink to a plus number , and while we are doing that , we remove the penalty for savings and investment . 
so the capital investment the gentlewoman talked about that really is a great indicator of where our economy is going , capital investment will not be punished . 
form the capital , and we will see capital go into technology , research and development , higher ed , all of the things that improve the productivity of the american worker . 
by the way , we must improve the productivity of the american worker . 
we can do that with technology and a national sales tax , and fix this balance of trade . 
we have positioned ourselves well to take america to its next level of destiny , and i am looking forward to the 109th congress for being a part of that . 
mr. chairman , i rise to join the chairman of the committee on education and the workforce , the gentleman from ohio ( mr. boehner ) xz4000360 , in a colloquy on how certain provisions in this legislation might affect the governance of wia funding in new york state . 
this legislation provides governors the authority to take a portion of funds provided through the authorizing statutes of mandatory partner programs to cover the infrastructure costs of one-stop centers . 
i am concerned that this may create a constitutional conflict between the governor of new york and the board of regents . 
mr. chairman , i want to thank the chairman for agreeing to work with us on this issue of importance to new york . 
times , '' recently reported that the volatility of income for the working poor has doubled in recent years . 
i represent the 7th district of washington , seattle , where the economy is driven by manufacturing as well as by innovation and the service industry . 
instead of economic independence , this bill produces economic surrender . 
the question again , mr. chairman , is when will you tell your chairman to start taking these responsibilities seriously rather than playing politics , as we are here today , putting the same bill before us that we have put here before , we know it is not going anywhere , it is a waste of time , and it does nothing for the workers ? 
`` they are a different kind of people , '' he declared . 
the 36-year-old salvadoran-born dishwasher and her partner , warehouse worker jose maldanado , make barely enough to stay above the official poverty line -- $ 18 , 810 last year for a family of four . 
their two young daughters receive health coverage through medi-cal but get many of their clothes at robinsons-may . 
the family struggles to meet its monthly bills but has taken on a mountain of credit card debt . 
some see circumstances like rojas ' as testament to the economic strides that america has made over the last generation , rather than a reflection of its failures . 
in many ways , rojas is the new face of the working poor , suffering not so much from a dearth of possessions as from a cavalcade of chaos -- pay cuts and eviction notices , car troubles and medical crises -- that rattles her finances and nudges her family toward the economic brink . 
indeed , today 's working poor are experiencing an extreme version of the economic turbulence that is rocking families across the income spectrum . 
and the cause , no matter people 's means , is the same : a quarter- century-long shift of economic risk by business and government onto working families . 
protections that americans , especially poor ones , once relied on to buffer them from economic setbacks -- affordable housing , stable jobs with good benefits , union membership and the backstop of cash welfare -- have shriveled or been eliminated . 
these losses have been only partially offset by an expansion of programs such as the earned-income tax credit for the working poor and publicly provided healthcare . 
during the early 1970s , the inflation-adjusted incomes of most families in the bottom fifth of the economy bounced up and down no more than 25 % a year . 
by the beginning of this decade , those annual fluctuations had doubled to as much as 50 % , according to statistics generated by the los angeles times in conjunction with moffitt and researchers at several other major universities . 
for a family with an income at the 20th percentile -- or roughly $ 23 , 000 a year in inflation-adjusted terms -- that has meant recent annual swings of as much as $ 12 , 000 . 
the times ' figures are based on the panel study of income dynamics , a database funded by the national science foundation and run by the university of michigan . 
in contrast to most economic indicators , which involve taking random samples of different americans at different times and comparing the results , the panel study has followed the same 5 , 000 nationally representative families and their offshoots for nearly 40 years . 
in a nutshell , the times has found that behind the upward march of most economic averages are increasingly frequent instances of financial setback and hardship for a large swath of the population . 
but for the country 's 20 million working-poor families , the findings are particularly sobering : they now run the risk of seeing their incomes slashed by half in any given year . 
that 's almost double the volatility experienced by families in the middle of the economic spectrum , the newspaper 's findings show . 
`` the only way to improve your life if you 're poor is to be very prudent and make very , very few mistakes like getting fired or splurging and ending up with a lot of debt , '' said christopher jencks , a harvard university authority on poverty . 
`` most people are n't that prudent. '' elvira rojas headed for the u.s. at age 21 in search of two things that were in short supply in her native ei salvador : peace and prosperity . 
combatants in that country 's bloody civil war engaged in firefights outside her family 's home in acajutla , and maldanado had received death threats because of his role as a former military man . 
she quickly found work cleaning houses with two of maldanado 's aunts . 
but with the average rent on a one-bedroom apartment in the city then running about $ 600 , they could not afford a first foothold in their new country -- a place of their own to live . 
`` i wanted to go home. '' with nowhere else to turn , they moved in with one of maldanado 's aunts , her five children and four cousins in a two-bedroom house on firmona avenue in hawthorne . 
as the couple began to make more money , they moved into a succession of other apartments . 
rojas , for one , took no chances ; she never applied for housing assistance -- or almost any other kind of aid -- although it appears from her social security records and tax returns that she would have qualified . 
by the mid-1990s , the state and federal governments were winding down most of a six-decade-long drive to help poor families meet their housing needs . 
`` i see one-third of a nation ill-housed , ill-clad , ill-nourished , '' he said in 1937 . 
and a combination of financial market innovations and federal power applied through a battery of agencies -- the veterans administration , the federal housing administration , fannie mae and freddie mac -- greatly expanded home ownership , especially among the middle class . 
but that still left what to do for poor families , most of whom could afford only to rent . 
instead of putting up buildings itself , the government would subsidize private developers to construct housing and give poor families vouchers to rent apartments in the open market . 
in all , the amount of money that congress and the president have authorized to be spent on housing assistance has plunged by nearly two-thirds in the last 25 years , from an inflation-adjusted $ 82 billion in 1978 to $ 29 billion last year . 
washington 's latest answer has been more laissez-faire : offer tax breaks for the creation of low-income housing but otherwise leave it to the marketplace to decide how much gets built . 
`` we 've produced tens of thousands of units recently , but the well 's been dry for so long we should have been producing hundreds of thousands , '' said jan breidenbach , executive director of the southern california assn . 
of non-profit housing , which represents many of the region 's developers of low-income housing . 
in the absence of substantial government help -- and with housing prices soaring beyond the reach of even the middle class -- most working-poor families have been left to fend for themselves . 
in the fall of that year , the couple , with another of maldanado 's aunts and her children , moved into a white stucco bungalow on burin avenue in inglewood , not far from los angeles international airport . 
although the house sagged in the middle and had drainage problems , it featured two kitchens and two living rooms , plenty of space for each family . 
that was more than 30 % of their earnings , a level the government considers the outer limit of affordable , but it was still something they could bear . 
the bungalow `` felt good because there were not so many of us , '' rojas said . 
he came from cleveland , where his family was a pillar of the african american community . 
he opened a barbershop , founded a youth marching band called b.j. 's raiders and became a kingmaker of sorts in cleveland politics . 
albert 's uncle , walter dicks , ran the municipal workers union and helped the younger grimes find a job right out of high school on a city sanitation truck . 
but albert was laid off during one of cleveland 's periodic fiscal crises . 
in 1985 , at the age of 29 , he left home and headed west . 
he had no trouble finding work with one of los angeles ' big employers . 
for most of the postwar era , working americans could count on big business even more than big government to provide safeguards against economic risk . 
in a reverse of the current passion for temps , outsourcing and lean workforces , corporate america felt it had a civic duty to offer full-time jobs with good wages and solid benefits , even to those like grimes with no college education . 
`` steady , year-round employment is so right from the standpoint of the employer , so right from the standpoint of the workers and so right for the country as a whole ... .. 
as the decades passed , los angeles became the hub of the nation 's aerospace industry ; a second home to u.s. automakers , after detroit ; and a major financial center . 
county workplace had nearly 30 % more employees than the u.s. average , according to government statistics -- a situation that translated into a high level of economic security . 
`` big firms underwrote the creation of america 's -- and southern california 's -- blue-collar middle class. '' as for grimes , he found his way to sears , roebuck & amp ; co. 's massive warehouse at olympic boulevard and soto street , where he was hired as a merchandise handler represented by the teamsters . 
on top of that , his health care was covered . 
but in 1992 , sears stumbled , the result of a failed strategy to sell everything from socks to stocks . 
grimes , then on leave with a bad back , soon found himself out of a job . 
the combination of recession and steep cuts in defense spending , brought on by the end of the cold war , walloped southern california . 
by the time the region bounced back , the nature of employment had changed . 
gone were many of the corporate giants that had delivered a generation of blue-collar security . 
in their place were tens of thousands of relatively small employers whose job-generating capacity is now regularly praised by the nation 's leaders but whose instability , often-low wages and meager benefits are less remarked upon . 
government figures show that the average size of a workplace shrank by 18 % nationally between its late-1970s peak and last year . 
county , with the average size of a workplace plunging 50 % to 10 workers . 
this trend , according to jacoby , `` is one of the most important and least appreciated reasons why so many people are having a tough time making a go of it today. '' for several years , grimes all but vanished from the regular economy . 
he , his chronically ill girlfriend and the couple 's young son lived off a mix of workers ' compensation , disability payments and her welfare checks . 
with the help of a friend , grimes persuaded a string of businesses in a run-down neighborhood along bixel street near downtown to hire him . 
then in 1998 , he found out how risky the life of an entrepreneur can be : the city bought up the properties along bixel street to make way for the staples center . 
she was still shuttling between her jobs at the airline laundry service and as a packer of sundries when one of maldanado 's cousins told her that the dishwashing department at the wyndham hotel on century boulevard near lax was hiring for the 4-to-midnight shift . 
by 1998 , as rojas and maldanado 's income more than doubled to $ 26 , 000 ( $ 30 , 500 in today 's dollars ) , the couple began assembling the pieces of a middle-class life . 
`` we had more money to spend. '' when the first of the couple 's two daughters was born the following year , rojas was so eager for her to be part of the fabric of america that she resisted entreaties to name her maria after five of maldanado 's aunts , and instead gave her the name katherine . 
she would make a similar choice when their second child was born last may , rejecting maldanado 's suggestion of elvira in favor of melane . 
the new job let rojas dream about owning a house where , she said , `` my daughters can have their own rooms '' and `` maybe one day i can take care of my grandchildren if i have some. '' meanwhile , any thought of returning to central america faded away . 
`` here , '' said rojas , `` my family will go a lot farther than in el salvador. '' in the summer of 2000 , the wyndham 's owners announced that they were closing the hotel for renovations . 
rojas remembers hearing ominous rumblings that more would change than the color of the lobby -- something about the parking attendants ' jobs being contracted out . 
so too was the union -- part of a broader trend sweeping corporate america for more than two decades . 
unions , which represented 17 percent of the nation 's private-sector workforce in the early 1980s , counted only 8 percent as members by last year . 
but instead of $ 8.89 an hour , her top wage at the wyndham , she said , she 'd be pulling down only $ 7.50 at the radisson , with no employer-paid family health insurance . 
for the poor , the most dramatic of all the safety-net cuts that the government has engineered in the last 25 years came in 1996 . 
in doing so , it essentially reversed the poverty-fighting strategy that washington had pursued since the 1960s in which poor americans were promised a certain minimal standard of living . 
advocates have hailed the measure as a spectacular success , saying it has increased the incomes of many poor people while triggering a steep drop in poverty among black children . 
but grimes , in the meantime , has been staggered by another , lesser-known element of the 1996 act -- a significant toughening of child-support enforcement rules . 
this part of the law built on other efforts undertaken since the 1970s to go after absentee parents and compel them to help finance their kids ' upbringings . 
nine years later , when the elder grimes applied for custody of a nephew , the los angeles county district attorney 's office sued him for child support for albert jr . 
grimes said he thought that he had to go along with the support order to obtain custody of his nephew and to ensure that harvey would continue receiving publicly funded healthcare . 
it 's also unclear whether counting grimes as a parent in the house would have jeopardized the size of harvey 's welfare checks . 
most of that money , moreover , is earmarked for state coffers -- not for the children who need support . 
`` the system was largely about welfare-cost recovery , not helping families , '' said curtis l. child , who stepped down recently as head of the state department of child support services , which was created in 2000 to remove enforcement power from county district attorneys and restructure the system . 
in one great clap , the 9/11 terrorists brought down the twin towers in new york , shattered americans ' sense of security and shoved elvira rojas down the economic ladder . 
it took her five days to reach burger king after the police and military sealed off the airport in the wake of the september 2001 attacks . 
within a couple of weeks , she was laid off . 
so she and maldanado turned to what has become one of the few reliable safety nets left for many poor americans : their credit cards . 
this time , with only minimal health insurance from the hotel , she said she had to put $ 2 , 000 of her $ 4 , 000 medical bill onto her mastercard . 
as the credit card industry emerged in the late 1950s and '60s , some expressed concern that even well-provisioned middle-class families would be unable to resist the lure of instant credit . 
federal reserve figures show that among families in the bottom fifth of the economy , the percentage of households with credit cards has soared from 11 % in the late 1970s to almost 40 % . 
some analysts applaud the greater availability of credit . 
gregory elliehausen , of the credit research center at georgetown university , said the spread of cards and other kinds of lending was part of a sweeping `` democratization of finance '' that has allowed poor families to operate more efficiently by , for example , buying decent cars to get to work . 
economists dirk krueger of the university of pennsylvania and fabrizio perri , a new york university professor now on sabbatical at the federal reserve bank of minneapolis , say families of all incomes increasingly rely on loans , rather than on business and government safety nets , in times of trouble . 
some of the items purchased on rojas ' and maldanado 's credit cards can seem frivolous or extravagant -- the tvs , for example , or a $ 150 set of sepia-toned studio photographs of katherine and her mom dressed in feather boas and gowns . 
but most of the charges appear to fit the definition of safety-net spending . 
there was $ 300 at the start of september to cover rent and a $ 1 , 000 cash advance that rojas said went to help a brother bring his wife to the u.s. from el salvador . 
although the stated interest on the couple 's most heavily used cards , a pair of direct merchants bank mastercards , ranges from 20.49 % to 31.99 % , a review of recent bills indicates that they are consistently charged close to the higher amount . 
in the spring of 2000 , two years after grimes ' bixel street business failed , he found a job as a security guard five blocks away at ernst & amp ; young plaza . 
he was promoted to `` lobby ambassador , '' a sort of informal emissary to the building , and then to lobby supervisor . 
his annual earnings climbed back above $ 20 , 000 , and he began to imagine himself becoming a director of security . 
`` my goal was to have a facility of my own , '' grimes said . 
`` i thought i should have a situation where i 'm in control. '' but for most of the last year , grimes has been anything but in control . 
he and harvey eventually rented a two-room hollywood walk-up for $ 875 a month , or more than 40 % of their combined income . 
after a series of clashes with his boss , grimes was ordered out of the ernst & amp ; young tower and told he would be reassigned . 
grimes is determined to recover from the latest round of reverses . 
`` i 'm trying , '' grimes said , `` to get back to what he had. '' a month after grimes was forced out of the ernst & amp ; young tower , rojas and her family were evicted from the burin avenue bungalow where they had lived for seven years . 
the family 's new apartment is so small that the bedroom is a single mass of mattresses and cribs . 
and the cabinets in the kitchenette are so stuffed that rojas must store her supply of infant formula in her car trunk . 
she now owns two plots at the cemetery 's mausoleum of the golden west , and recently signed papers to pay $ 82.79 a month for the next five years to buy two more . 
`` i wo n't leave my family with a financial burden. '' the source of the statistics and how they were analyzed the times used the panel study of income dynamics for its analysis of family income volatility . 
the panel study has followed a nationally representative sample of about 5 , 000 families and their offshoots for nearly 40 years and is the most comprehensive publicly available income and earnings database in the world . 
it is run by the university of michigan and principally underwritten by the national science foundation . 
the times employed techniques for gauging income volatility that were developed by economists robert a. moffitt of johns hopkins university and peter gottschalk of boston college . 
the times also consulted with yale university political scientist jacob s. hacker , who has conducted his own analysis of income volatility among households in the panel study and has published results linking it to economic risk . 
based on the panel-study sample , the times estimated the annual income swings , up or down , for 68 % of all u.s. families -- those who did not have the most extreme fluctuations . 
it then concentrated on those in the bottom one-fifth of income earners and especially those right at the 20th percentile . 
the average annual income of panel-study families at the 20th percentile is close to the government 's official poverty line for a family of four most years . 
the analysis looked at pretax income of all family members from all sources , including workplace earnings ; investments ; public transfers such as jobless benefits , food stamps and cash welfare ; and private transfers such as inheritances . 
none of these rules , not a single one , has been open . 
it is an abysmal record and just continues to prove how out of touch with america , and with the democratic process , this leadership really is . 
they seem to think jobs are popping out of the woodwork , but it is clear our workers need job training assistance in order to compete in the 21st century workplace . 
when we think that the republican leadership can not be any more out of touch with the challenges facing working americans , they bring the job training improvement act of 2005 to the floor today . 
and not only are millions of american workers looking for jobs , but the long-term unemployment rate , workers who have been jobless for 6 months or more , is the highest in more than 20 years . 
this bill will do nothing to create new jobs , reduce the number of unemployed people in this country , or sufficiently training workers for jobs . 
specifically , h.r. 27 would eliminate the employment services system , a program which provides critical job assistance to those unemployed workers hardest hit with the job loss of recent years . 
in my home state of massachusetts , this program provides services to nearly 165 , 000 jobseekers each year , and it has successfully helped 75 percent of them retain employment in less than 6 months . 
the result of this provision will be more bureaucracy and less training for the disabled and veterans . 
given all of the rhetoric that we hear about supporting our troops and providing for our veterans , we should find this provision particularly disturbing . 
we should be doing everything we can to help veterans find employment instead of slashing the disability and veteran employment and adult learning programs . 
it caps at 30 percent the use of funds for services targeting low-income youth , those considered most likely to drop out of school . 
if that were not bad enough , this bill also abandons a core principle of our constitution by repealing civil rights protections written into current law . 
but let me be clear , the right of churches , synagogues , mosques and other religious organizations to remain free from government intervention has long been protected under the law , and i am sure my colleagues join me in support of this protection . 
faith-based institutions should be required , like all other recipients of federal funds , to adhere to basic civil rights laws , and i can not even begin to count the number of institutions that have contacted my office in the last few days asking to be held to those same standards . 
last night in the committee on rules , i heard my colleagues , the gentleman from virginia ( mr. scott ) xz4003641 and the gentleman from florida ( mr. hastings ) xz4001701 talk about a return to discrimination practices that forced these men and millions of other african americans to drink from separate drinking fountains and eat at separate lunch counters from white americans . 
how can anyone justify abandoning one of our nation 's most fundamental principles ? 
mr. speaker , i reserve the balance of my time . 
mr. speaker , i include for printing in the record a letter opposing this bill signed by 67 religious organizations and civil rights organizations that have great concerns not only with the provision on religious-based employment discrimination but on a whole series of other provisions . 
dear representative : the undersigned organizations are writing to urge you to vote against h.r. 27 , the job training improvement act , unless it is modified to address the concerns outlined in this letter ; and to oppose any effort to expand the block grant authority in the bill along the lines of the administration 's `` wia plus '' proposal . 
h.r. 27 fails to make meaningful improvements to the workforce investment act ( wia ) that would enhance the training and career opportunities of unemployed workers . 
instead , the legislation would eliminate the dislocated worker training program , undermine state rapid response systems , end the federal-state labor exchange system , roll back protections against religious discrimination in hiring by job training providers , and potentially undermine the stability of other important programs . 
in doing so , it will eliminate job training assistance specifically targeted to workers dislocated by off shoring and other economic changes , pit different types of workers against each other , and lead to future funding reductions . 
the block grant also eliminates the statewide job service , which provides a uniform statewide system for matching employers and jobseekers , replacing it with a multiplicity of localized programs that would have no incentive or ability to cooperate and function as a comprehensive labor exchange system . 
eliminating the employment a principal criticism of wia has been the substantial decline in actual training compared to its predecessor , the job training partnership act . 
while there are various reasons for the reduction in training , including the sequence of services requirement in current law , the use of wia resources by local boards and operators to build new one-stop facilities and bureaucracies , without any limitation , has contributed substantially to the decline in training . 
these programs include the vocational rehabilitation program , veterans employment programs , adult education , the perkins post secondary career and technical education programs , unemployment insurance , trade adjustment assistance , temporary assistance for needy families ( tanf ) , and , if they are partners , employment and training programs under the food stamp and housing programs , programs for individuals with disabilities carried out by state agencies , the infrastructure and related provisions start the commingling of funds from these non-wia programs . 
in doing so , they transform the original one-stop idea of a better-coordinated workforce system into a mechanism for reducing resources for and block granting these programs in the future . 
a more effective and simple solution to ensuring adequate training services would be to require that a certain percentage of wia funds be used for training as provided in previous job training programs and to create a separate wia funding stream for one-stop operations , if necessary . 
h.r. 27 includes permanent and unlimited authority for the secretary to conduct `` personal reemployment account '' ( pra ) demonstratious even though the department of labor recently initiated a pra demonstration without strong interest among the states . 
since this demonstration already is in process , we see no justification for this provision and can only surmise that it is an attempt to implement pras more broadly , despite a lack of congressional support for a full-scale program in the past . 
unlike current wia training programs , the pras would limit the cost of training that an unemployment insurance recipient can receive and would bar that individual from wia training services for a year after the pra account is established . 
this rollback of civil rights protections is especially incongruous in a program designed to provide employment and career opportunities in an evenhanded manner and should be rejected . 
these individuals would have to compete with each other for a declining share of resources without the protections and requirements under current law . 
furthermore , the in summary , h.r. 27 strays far from the appropriate mission for federal job training programs of enhancing training opportunities for workers and providing skilled workers for employers .

what we object to , quite frankly , is the use of taxpayers ' money to basically subsidize discrimination . 
it is not just a concern that those of us who are speaking here have ; i submitted a list of close to 70 civil rights and religious organizations that have objections to this provision , including the african american ministers in action ; american jewish committee ; the american jewish congress ; americans for religious liberty ; the anti-defamation league ; the baptist joint committee ; central conference of american rabbis ; episcopal church , usa ; the general board of church and society of the united methodist church ; the national advocacy center of the sisters of the good shepherd ; national council of jewish women ; network , mr. speaker , i yield 6 minutes to the gentleman from virginia ( mr. scott ) xz4003641 . 
mr. chairman , i rise in strong support of h.r. 27 and thank the gentleman from ohio for his leadership in bringing this bill to the floor , the job training improvement act of 2005 , which i introduced to strengthen and reauthorize the nation 's job training system as well as adult education and vocational rehabilitation programs . 
job training programs must be responsive to the needs of the workforce and improving them is critical . 
one of the hallmarks of wia is that in order to encourage the development of comprehensive systems that improve services to both employers and job seekers , local services are provided through a one-stop delivery system . 
at the one-stop centers , assistance ranges from core services such as job search and placement assistance , access to job listings and an initial assessment of skills and needs , to intensive services such as comprehensive assessments and case management and , if needed , occupational skills training . 
while the workforce investment act of 1998 made dramatic reforms to the nation 's workforce system , i learned that further refinements were necessary to ensure state and local officials have the flexibility they need to effectively target resources toward the unique needs of their communities . 
the bill also ensures the financial contribution of the mandatory partners in the one-stop centers while at the same time it increases the service integration among the partner programs . 
mr. chairman , i had a couple of my good friends , constituents in my district , that lost their jobs in the defense industry . 
one of them went on to become a school teacher , one a worker in the computer industry . 
mr. chairman , i yield 2 1/2 minutes to the gentleman from nebraska ( mr. osborne ) xz4003030 , a member of the committee . 
mr. chairman , i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from nevada ( mr. porter ) xz4003240 , a member of the committee , vice chairman of the subcommittee . 
mr. chairman , i am happy to yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from georgia ( mr. price ) xz4006261 , a new member of the committee . 
mr. chairman , i ask unanimous consent to reclaim the balance of my time . 
mr. chairman , i rise in strong support of his amendment , and i find it just incredible that all of a sudden discrimination becomes the core of religious organizations , for those of us who have spent almost 40 years working with faith-based organizations in our communities involved in all kinds of public service endeavors , all kinds of delivery of services to people in need , to help members of our community in almost everything , from education to child care to job training to substance abuse to a whole range of activities that are absolutely essential to binding our community together . 
nobody said that discrimination was a fundamental part of this operation all through the sixties and seventies , the eighties or the nineties . 
none of these organizations ever said they were unable to deliver these services , unwilling to deliver these services , unwilling to help these people whom they have chosen to extend the services of their organization to ; when they took federal money said they could not do this because they needed to discriminate . 
but all of a sudden now the suggestion is that the basic tenet is that you must be able to discriminate . 
what does it also say about the use of the taxpayers ' dollars ? 
if the best person to provide the substance abuse counseling , if the best person to provide the child development , if the best person to provide the job training is not of the same religion , is the taxpayer getting a fair shake when they hire somebody else that does not have those qualifications ? 
you can not maintain your religious character , you can not maintain the religious character of your organization unless you can discriminate in hiring ? 
this measure consolidates the adult , dislocated worker and employment service programs and funding into a block grant , while also repealing the wagner peyser act and removing many of the federal performance and accountability measurements that make the workforce investment act such an important investment in our nation 's workforce . 
this will go against the true intent of the workforce investment act , which is to invest in our workforce . 
even more troubling is the fact that h.r. 27 reduces preventive in-school youth training programs which keep students from dropping out of school . 
they strive to meet the increasing demands placed upon them in an environment of increasingly inadequate resources . 
finally , the workforce reinvestment and adult education act would eliminate the civil rights protections of americans , by exempting religious organizations from anti-discrimination requirements . 
the message that we are sending to the millions of americans who are unemployed , who are veterans and those who are in need of economic assistance is that we do not care about keeping them from falling further into an economic crisis . 
this bill fails as a reinvestment in our workforce and fails to aid the millions of jobless americans who need it the most . 
i urge all my colleagues to vote in favor of the scott amendment which will protect current civil rights protections for employees and job applicants of faith-based organizations . 
mr. chairman , since the presidency of franklin roosevelt , our nation has moved inexorably toward the elimination of all forms of discrimination in government contracting and in the private sector . 
this bill rolls back that commitment that would enshrine the principle of religious discrimination in one of our most important job training programs at a time when many americans are losing their jobs and need the help these programs offer . 
members on the other sides of the aisle say that this would roll back the ability of churches and synagogues to discriminate on the basis of religion now . 
no one tells the catholic church or any other church or synagogue they have to hire a janitor of a different religion . 
president reagan , who signed the original version of this legislation 23 years ago , did not think it was necessary to allow employment discrimination with federal funds . 
is there a single member of this house who has not held secure government funds for such programs ? 
the federation of protestant welfare agencies ? 
the only thing required of these organizations is that they play by the same rules as everyone else . 
they can not make professing religious faith a precondition of receiving social services paid for with the taxpayers ' dollars , and they can not discriminate in employment when those jobs are paid for with taxpayers ' dollars . 
people of every faith pay their taxes , and we have no right to deny them employment paid for by those taxes . 
these are the armies of compassion . 
first of all , it consolidates programs and creates efficiencies . 
faith-based organizations are by law allowed to hire employees to provide services which conform to the mission of the faith-based organization . 
this right was affirmed by the 1964 civil rights act and the 1987 supreme court decision , corporation of the presiding bishop versus amos . 
the 1964 civil rights act explicitly protects the rights of religious organizations to take religion into account in their hiring practices . 
in fact , the civil rights act made clear that when faith-based organizations hire employees on a religious basis , it is an exercise of the organization 's civil liberties and does not constitute discrimination under federal law . 
the writers of that legislation understood that a church , a synagogue , a mosque all operate as distinctly religious organizations . 
they are , therefore , protected under the first amendment 's right to the free exercise of religion . 
why are we being asked today , then , to approve an amendment that revokes the constitutional right of faith-based communities to practice their religions freely ? 
this amendment would revoke the constitutionally protected right of faith-based groups to maintain their religious nature and character through those they hire . 
by denying the rights of religious organizations to hire according to their principles , this amendment declares war between the government and faith-based organizations , it cuts services for people in need , it eliminates the role of faith-based organizations in our government efforts to help . 
why then are we being asked to call it discriminatory when a christian or muslim charity wants to consider the beliefs of potential employees before hiring them ? 
faith-based providers can not be expected to sustain their religious missions without the ability to employ individuals who share the tenets and practices of their faith . 
the success of any organization is having everyone on board with its essential principles and vision . 
mr. chairman , i rise today in strong support of h.r. 27 , the job training improvement act of 2005 , and i certainly applaud the gentleman from california ( chairman mckeon ) and the gentleman from ohio ( chairman boehner ) for their tireless efforts in bringing this important legislation to the floor today . 
as an original cosponsor of this legislation , there are many provisions that will increase the ability of our nation 's workers to achieve greater stability in our ever-changing workforce . 
i would like to mention one aspect of the bill which i am particularly proud of , the inclusion of personal reemployment accounts as an allowable usage of funds under the pilot and demonstration projects of the greater workforce investment act . 
as my community of southern nevada experienced in the wake of september 11 , our economy proved to be very vulnerable . 
as my community rebounded from this blow , nevadans sought help in adjusting to the realities of the workforce . 
those nevadans who suffered the woes of unemployment sought additional training and support as they sought to increase their career opportunities . 
individuals are able to retain the remainder of their account after they return to the workforce . 
as americans return to work , they continue to face hardships until the benefits of employment become manifest . 
mr. chairman , i will include for the record a letter from deputy secretary of labor steven law demonstrating the administration 's continued support of the pra program . 
mr. chairman , i urge all of my colleagues to support this important legislation . 
as our workforce continues to engage the ever-changing economy which we are part of , this reauthorization will provide american workers with the tools they need and deserve to improve their career opportunities . 
i recommend final passage of the job training improvement act of 2005 . 
mr. chairman , i include for the record the letter referred to earlier from steven j. law , deputy secretary of labor . 
department of labor , deputy secretary of labor , washington , dc , march 2 , 2005 . 
dear congressman porter : i would like to thank you for your invaluable and effective advocacy of personal reemployment accounts ( pras ) . 
like you we believe that pras will provide thousands of americans seeking reemployment with a new and more flexible means to seek customized training that leads quickly to expanded career opportunities . 
we are enthusiastic about the launch of pra demonstration projects in seven states . 
we are confident that this important pilot program will prove the value of pras and , with enactment of your legislation , even more americans will have access to pras . 
mr. chairman , i rise in strong support of h.r. 27 , the job training improvement act of 2005 . 
for example , my constituent , jeff ring , who after 24 years of employment as a steelworker , was laid off . 
he is a father of three children , eight and younger . 
every day , every day , hard-working people like jeff and tiffany walk through the doors of one-stop across the country seeking assistance . 
current law prohibits sponsors of job training programs from discriminating based on race or religion , and that policy goes back decades . 
the civil rights act passed in 1964 , and it prohibited discrimination ; but it included an exception for religious organizations , but that exception was limited to the context of the religious organizations using their own money . 
as the current law stands , and my amendment would keep that law intact , catholic , jewish , lutheran , baptist , and other religious organizations already get hundreds of millions dollars today to run job training and other federally funded programs . 
mr. speaker , for 40 years , if an employer had a problem hiring the best qualified applicant because of discrimination based on race or religion , that employer had a problem because the weight of the federal government was behind the victim of discrimination . 
the underlying , without my amendment , proposes to shift the weight of the federal government from supporting the victim of discrimination to supporting some so-called right to discriminate with federal funds . 
if anything is being restored , it is the ugly practice of discrimination that existed before the 1960s . 
the dear colleague went on to say that congress needs to `` continue to uphold the basic civil right of america 's religious organizations to hire the staff they judge to be best qualified to carry out their programs and missions when they provide job training assistance. '' mr. speaker , the language fails to say that they can hire whoever they want to promote their religious missions with the church money . 
as a representative said during the debate on the civil rights act of 1964 , he said , `` stop the discrimination , get the money ; continue the discrimination , do not get the money. '' employment discrimination is ugly . 
mr. chairman , i yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from california ( ms. woolsey ) xz4004360 , a cosponsor of the amendment . 
mr. chairman , i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from maryland ( mr. van hollen ) xz4004150 , a cosponsor of the amendment . 
mr. chairman , i yield 3 1/2 minutes to the gentleman from massachusetts ( mr. frank ) xz4001400 , a cosponsor of the amendment . 
mr. chairman , i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from california ( mr. george miller ) xz4002780 , the ranking member of the committee on education and the workforce . 
mr. chairman , i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from new york ( mr. nadler ) xz4002890 , a cosponsor of the amendment . 
mr. chairman , we keep hearing that we are discriminating against religious organizations in terms of participation in government contracts . 
in the 1960s , mr. chairman , we passed civil rights laws to respond to our sorry history of bigotry , and we designated specific protected classes where you could not discriminate in employment , race , color , creed , national origin and sex ; and you can not discriminate against those protected classes . 
mr. chairman , i yield myself the balance of my time . 
mr. chairman , i have a point of order . 
finding that the exemption did not violate the establishment clause , the supreme court has made it clear that it is `` a permissible legislative purpose to alleviate significant governmental interference with the ability of religious organizations to define and carry out their religious missions. '' even where the content of their activities is secular , in the sense that activities do not include religious teaching , proselytizing , or worship , and it is very important for everybody to understand , we all agree you can not have prayer , you can not proselytize , you can not use government funds for anything but a secular purpose in job training , justice brennan , hardly a conservative , said that even if a religious organization is providing job training , which would be a secular thing , it is likely to be infused with a religious purpose . 
in other words , the motivation of the individuals probably is religious . 
he also recognized that churches and other religious entities `` often regard the provision of such services as a means of fulfilling religious duty and of providing an example of the way of life a church seeks to foster. '' he is perhaps one of the greatest liberal justices of all time . 
and then he recognized that preserving the title vii protections when religious organizations engage in social services is a necessary element of religious freedom . 
furthermore , as we take the logical extension of this which we are dealing with in whether we provide buses and computers to private schools and which will certainly come up in education bills in front of our committee , one of the questions is , if those funds run through the bishop 's office , does in fact the reach of the funds that go for buses and for computers , which the court has ruled a computer does not do the proselytizing , the software does the proselytizing , will this reach back in because the governance of catholic charities ultimately comes back to the bishop 's office ? 
court rulings are increasingly tilting that direction because we have falsely interpreted what is religious liberty in the united states and that we have to make it clear in these bills which , as the chairman has pointed out , have passed this house multiple times , the president of the united states in many of these was not president bush pushing a faith-based initiative , but president clinton . 
and as the member from maryland has pointed out , he did not enthusiastically say this was going to be upheld ; but the fact is over the objections of many on his side , he supported it . 
it means that if you are an orthodox jewish group and you are going to serve everybody in your community , that you get to be an orthodox jewish group ; if you are an evangelical group that believes in the resurrection of jesus christ , that people who represent your organization should share that belief ; if you are a muslim group , that people who represent that group should share that . 
the fundamental question here is , and through my subcommittee on criminal justice and human services we held eight hearings across the united states and we had a great debate in every region of the country , but many organizations came forth , whether they were muslim , jewish or christian in some form , and said , we can not compromise the nature of our faith if you are going to make us change our hiring practices . 
so what we are saying , by trying to take away their religious liberty , if they want to provide secular services , that we are discriminating and changing policy contrary to what president clinton has supported , contrary to what president bush has supported , contrary to the different nominees of both parties ; and it will be a sad day if this congress after bipartisan efforts for the last 5 to 8 years to push this type of legislation to allow these faith-based groups at the table would go backwards and say , you are no longer welcome , you are not invited to help anymore , you are off the table . 
i believe that the members , and i know one argument is that we had these debates in the middle of the night , i believe members actually looked at those bills and they knew what they were voting for , and i hope they will not flip-flop today . 
mr. chairman , i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from georgia ( mr. price ) xz4006261 , a member of the committee on education and the workforce . 
mr. chairman , i rise today in opposition to h.r. 27 , the so-called job training improvement act of 2005 . 
inflation is still growing faster than the average earnings of workers -- a fact that is particularly true for low-skilled and low-income workers . 
yet , much worse , it forces unemployed workers and welfare recipients to fight it out for a share of these limited funds . 
they even allow religious organizations to engage in hiring discrimination in an unholy attempt to turn back a half-century of progress in preventing workplace discrimination . 
throughout its 23-year history , this civil rights provision has not been an obstacle to the participation of religiously affiliated organizations in federal job training programs . 
but suddenly , under the leadership of the white house , we are being asked to forget the principle of equal opportunity on which our country was founded . 
just in response to the gentleman 's comments a second ago and earlier , the reason for this amendment is that current law takes care of any state that wants to put a higher proportion of funds towards out-of-school youth . 
the others already can , in fact , serve as many of the people they want out of school . 
with respect to this money that is a duplication for it because there are other funds going , none of those other programs have money left over for job training . 
most of them are underfunded : safe and drug-free schools being slashed by the president . 
this is an example of the collegiality of our committee on education and the workforce . 
and the fact of the matter is that having a mandate that every state put all their money toward out-of-school youth does not help those states that have an in-school youth issue . 
it also deprives a lot of programs that are working with our business community and in-school youth to get them better equipped to not only support themselves but their families to have them be more self-sufficient when they get out of school . 
catholic charities , jewish federation , and a whole variety of protestant denominations currently receive federal dollars to provide services in our community and around the world . 
indeed , many of them receive money today to provide job training services , and they do a good job . 
and guess what , today they are doing it under current law which says when they receive those federal tax dollars , they may not discriminate in who they hire based on religion , and not one of those organizations has come to me and said we could do a better job in providing job training services if only you would let us discriminate based on religion . 
the civil rights act of 1964 does not say in any way that religious organizations can take taxpayer dollars and then discriminate in their hiring based on religion when they are providing services based on those dollars . 
taxes are paid by christians , by jews , by muslims , by people of all denominations . 
but the lack of access to capital prevents many entrepreneurs from starting their own business . 
the small business administration 's 7 ( a ) loan program is a critical source of capital for small businesses , providing 30 percent of all long-term loans to u.s. entrepreneurs . 
despite the success of the 7 ( a ) loan program , the bush administration has repeatedly underfunded it , implemented a series of caps , imposed burdensome restrictions , and shut down the entire program . 
these new up-front fees are limiting the number of small businesses that can afford 7 ( a ) loans . 
for a loan of $ 150 , 000 , an entrepreneur must now pay nearly $ 3 , 000 in up-front fees , a significant cost for someone trying to start a company . 
these higher costs have significantly reduced small business use of the 7 ( a ) program , as loan volume has decreased by $ 500 million since the new fees were implemented . 
this amendment acknowledges the shortsightedness of that decision . 
it affirms that new fees on 7 ( a ) loans are hurting small businesses and demonstrates congressional support for using federal funding to cover the cost of these fees . 
i have serious reservations about personal reemployment accounts , as they will place severe limits on the amount of training an unemployed worker can receive . 
unemployed workers should be allowed to use these funds in their accounts to pay for the cost of the 7 ( a ) loan fees , and that is exactly what my amendment will do . 
we need a revival of entrepreneurship in this country that will spur more job creation and grow our economy . 
to do this , we must take advantage of every opportunity to ensure that capital is accessible and affordable for all start-up small business owners , and we must make it clear that president bush is failing our nation 's entrepreneurs . 
this amendment is one of those opportunities , and i urge my colleagues to support it . 
mr. chairman , i reserve the balance of my time . 
mr. chairman , i yield myself the balance of my time . 
by doubling the fees on 7-a loans , the bush administration has severely limited access to critical source of capital for our nation 's small businesses . 
this amendment sends a message that congress is not willing to accept the recent policy decisions of the bush administration to further burden u.s. entrepreneurs . 
while this amendment will not change the fee structure , it will help entrepreneurs afford this vital source of capital . 
mr. chairman , once again my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are claiming they want to help workers in this nation . 
instead of increasing funding in the bill to address infrastructure needs separately , this bill forces governors to choose between workers and updating facilities , all from the same pot of money . 
limiting this pool of funding will deny workers quality services for reemployment and adult education programs , and that is just plain and simple true . 
this bill also sets up a voucher system that will actually decrease the amount of services available to job seekers . 
this bill also changes the way in which the government will evaluate the success of wia programs . 
now workers will be judged on how they serve the company they work for rather than on the quality of services they received under wia . 
the worst part of this bill , however , is that it will write discrimination into the law . 
first , it would not keep faith-based organizations from hiring members of their own religion with their own funds in the exercise of their faith . 
but sadly , the supporters of h.r. 27 would allow federally-funded job training programs to judge job applicants by their religion , not by their results . 
when people who desperately need a job seek help , they do not care about the religion of the person helping them , they do care that the person helping them was hired because he or she was the best qualified person , and they do care that the person helping them is not concerned about their religion . 
but when the people providing help are hired because of their own religion , it is naive to think that religion will not permeate the help that they provide , no matter what h.r. 27 says . 
the proof of this slippery slope is in the president 's words . 
no , this amendment does not discriminate against religion , it protects people from discrimination because of their religion . 
a wide range of faith-based organizations support this amendment because they recognize that it is not an attack on american religious freedoms , but a defense of those freedoms . 
mr. speaker , we have asked literally hundreds of thousands of our best and brightest , many of them national guard and reservists from south dakota , to serve overseas in operations iraqi freedom and enduring freedom . 
additionally , too many of the brave men and women who are serving in the national guard and reserve forces have returned home to find their jobs gone and their families struggling to make ends meet . 
this motion to recommit would provide unemployed veterans of iraq and afghanistan with income support and intensive employment training and job relocation assistance so that they can successfully transition back into civilian life . 
this bill , this bill , will enhance employment ; it will increase employment and job retention , plus increase the overall skill level of our labor force . 
greater flexibility in the delivery of core , intensive , and training services allows individuals to receive the most appropriate services specifically for them . 
getting more resources to those most in need when they are out of school helps those without other opportunities , and that is a good thing . 
faith-based language in this bill is identical , identical , to four separate pieces of legislation passed during the clinton administration . 
there is no discrimination on the provision of services . 
mr. chairman , i appreciate the opportunity to speak again on this , and i am astounded , frankly , at the level of misinformation that is coming from the other side . 
the definition of youth has changed . 
what that means is that we have more individuals out of school , out of school , who require assistance . 
and that is one of the reasons the provision is in the bill to change it , so that more individuals out of school will have greater opportunity to access those monies . 
it is also important to appreciate this is a department of labor program . 
the department of education has a phenomenal number of programs eligible for in-school youth that really dwarfs the amount of money for the out-of-school individuals , 15 to 1 by my count . 
some of those programs are title i grants to improve education for the disadvantaged , neglected and delinquent grants to local educational agencies , 21st century learning centers , safe and drug-free schools and community state grants , bilingual education instructional services , dropout prevention grants , and on and on and on , striving readers grant and vocational technical education . 
in summary , no one , no one is decreasing the amount of money to in-school youth for the concerns and the issues that they have . 
the misunderstandings and confusion and frankly the hyperbole is phenomenal coming out of the other side . 
we have had a lot of reference to title vii of the civil rights acts of 1964 . 
what it says specifically is `` this subchapter shall not apply to an employer with respect to the employment of , '' et cetera . 
it does not say anything about the source of the money . 
there is no mention of the source . 
there has been some discussion about previous language that many members on the other side of the aisle have adopted in previous bills , four pieces of legislation under the clinton administration . 
where are the examples of discrimination under those bills that have exactly the same language as this bill that we are promoting here ? 
i urge my colleagues to oppose this and to be certain , to be certain , there is no intent or desire on anybody on this side of the aisle to encourage discrimination by faith-based institutions . 
mr. speaker , i am impressed with the fact that america is a land of vision and opportunity . 
i think the exciting thing of the values of this nation is the people who have come here from every ethnic background , from every nation on this earth . 
the great diversity has one thing in common , that is , a unity of vision , of opportunity , of purpose that can be accomplished when we are part of something bigger than ourselves . 
when i look at the numbers right now in this nation from an unemployment standpoint , we stand at 5.2 percent , which is one of the lowest unemployments in the industrialized world , particularly in light of the fact that we are involved in a war that was forced upon us by global terrorists . 
more than that , when i look to my own district , to the fourth district of kentucky , and the tremendous steps forward that have been made in the manufacturing economy , that have been made in technology and in the creation of jobs and in the development of industry and health sciences , i am excited about our future . 
i think one of the great things that we see a need for right now is to continue to remove the burden of regulations , to remove the burdensome tax code , to remove the impediments to individuals at every level of our economy , from starting their own businesses , from creating jobs in our communities , that will stay in our communities , to keep capital investment in those communities . 
i believe that the tax cuts that were enacted in the last congress need to be made permanent so that people can keep more of what they earn . 
if they see the opportunity in a good year to take advantage of capital investment to improve their competitiveness , to increase jobs in the local community or protect the jobs that they have , they should have that flexibility ; and i would like to see the ability to expense capital investment made permanent rather than renewing it as we have been doing over the past 18 years . 
i met recently with a new division of northern kentucky university , a pioneer in the university of kentucky system . 
they have their own school of entrepreneurship now to encourage this creation of jobs in the local economy , to show people how they can start a business , how they can add value , how they can help people create a nest egg and a job that will last for the long term and create other jobs that will strengthen our community . 
the reason for this , working with public-private partnerships , working closely with our local communities from the federal government is to assure that we are staying on the cutting edge of technology innovation , looking for opportunity for the long term . 
small businesses need to have the ability to band together and form associations to reduce the cost of health care . 
we need to encourage these small businesses and enact regulations that will allow them to cover more of their employees , more of our employees in the long term . 
in addition to that , we need to bring about meaningful medical liability reform as part of this health care reform . 
the reason for that is , first of all , to stop driving our doctors out of practice in many states . 
for example , in kentucky we have lost one-third of our ob-gyn doctors in the last 5 years due to medical liability costs . 
but at a small business and job creation level , it will be a job creator if we have some meaningful liability reforms , not only to keep our doctors but to keep the cost of health care provision low so that we could cover more of our employees and also be more competitive in the long term . 
in the end , there are a variety of steps that we can take . 
i am very excited about the potential of the american people . 
we have shown in a time of national adversity now that we can compete , that we can have a strong economy , that we can create jobs ; and when i look at one of the largest employers in northeastern kentucky , a very prominent steel mill that is creating jobs , that is hiring , that is competing effectively in the world economy now , i know that we are going to be successful . 
just this week , a court in my home state of louisiana ruled that school boards were prohibited from having voluntary school board member-led prayers to begin their meetings . 
in my home state of louisiana , faith-based groups have done a wonderful thing . 
if you extend the logic of this amendment , what might be next might be those catholic hospitals not being able to accept medicare patients . 
let us build on that bipartisan precedent of opening the doors and allowing faith-based groups to participate as equal partners . 
people of faith pay taxes as well in this country . 
four different times president clinton signed into law four different measures designed to protect the interests and rights of faith-based groups . 
so i think we need to stop closing the door to people of faith . 
if we want to see a good world , we want to see people have all of the rights and privileges , we are going to see freedom throughout the world and we are going to see growing economies . 
as again the gentlewoman from tennessee ( mrs. blackburn ) xz4000320 said , job creation was up in 48 of the 50 states last year , and unemployment was down in all regions . 
the committee on education and the workforce has passed it out of our committee after a great deal of debate . 
while those reforms have provided workers with resources and tools necessary to rejoin the workforce or retrain for better jobs , there were still areas of inefficiency and duplication that were remaining . 
last week we talked a lot about inefficiency and waste , and this is another one of the ways that we are going to do that . 
the bill eliminates arbitrary provisions of current law that prevent someone from accessing training immediately if appropriate to meet his or her employment goals . 
the bill is also going to protect the rights of faith-based groups to help train and retrain workers . 
the bill protects the rights of faith-based groups willing to participate in the nation 's job training system . 
former president clinton signed a number of major laws upholding this right . 
the bill includes a number of provisions designed to strengthen the 1973 rehabilitation act in a continuing effort to help individuals with disabilities become employable and achieve full integration . 
workers are going to assemble two of dell 's desktop models , the dimension and the optiplex , in the new plant . 
the jobs there are going to pay an average of $ 27 , 000 . 
we are about 2 weeks away from the start of a process where people can express interest in being hired for the first 200-250 jobs , then dell will hire another 500 people . 
most of these will be people from the fifth congressional district . 
again , i think this is an indication that the policies of this president and the policies of this congress are working in terms of reducing taxes and making our south a very good place to bring new jobs . 
i am frankly appalled at the scale of the rhetoric being presented by the minority party on this issue . 
this debate is about whether a religious organization should have the ability to select employees who share common values and sense of purpose . 
this is not saying that they will not hire people of other religions but we will not force them to do so . 
a secular group , such as planned parenthood or the sierra club , that receives government money , is currently free to hire based on their ideology and mission but still use federal funds in accordance with the terms of the program . 
religious organizations should be allowed to apply for the same amount of government money for services they provide that nonreligious organizations do . 
if we deny them these protections , many of them would have to compromise their missions or not apply at all for assistance in implementing these services . 
nowhere in the civil rights act of 1964 does it state that a faith-based organization loses its rights if it accepts federal funds . 
for us to forget that and to place restrictions of this sort on our churches is contrary to the very foundation of this great nation . 
i implore each and every one of my colleagues to take a long hard work at what message we would be sending to oppressed people across the globe if we do not include these important protections for religious organizations . 
if we approve this amendment , we could be seriously damaging the integrity and mission of these faith-based institutions that only seek to serve our communities . 
one of the things that is not , of course , is social security . 
but the rest of the economy , where a free market is being allowed to thrive and grow , is helping to create jobs . 
but what a great time of hope . 
we were having hearings a couple of weeks ago and finding that one of the drains on the medical economy is the fact that 70 percent of all the massive number of physicians who are sued are dropped without any finding of fault and without paying anything in settlement . 
well , that is an area we are working on to help reform , to help eliminate ; 70 percent of the physicians that are sued having to be sued and providing a carrot and a stick to correct that form where abuse has occurred . 
students of history , and i was talking with some students and teachers from grace high school in tyler , texas , and they have been studying a number of aspects of this . 
you know the pilgrims , as you probably know , congresswoman , they tried a communist form of government . 
and i am excited about the potential this government has and to be a part of this congress with you because i think we have more potential to get this country on the right road than any congress since the 1930 new deal congress . 
we can fix social security so young people today can have the benefits of the free market economy instead of struggling in poverty with what little bit social security pays . 
this president , this house , this senate have such potential and i consider it an honor to be part of it . 
as it says above the speaker 's head , `` in god we trust. '' and we need to make use of the trust that god has given us . 
and i thank you for the trust with some of your time . 
american workers need access to job-training in order that they may obtain the skills to perform the jobs of the 21st century . 
of particular importance to me and my colleagues who support this plan is provision i proposed that is reflected in the bill we 're voting on today . 
the men and women of our armed forces who have given of themselves should not only be honored , but aided as much as possible in starting life again upon their return . 
mr. speaker , about 50 percent of americans or so are employed in small businesses , and obviously if something is employing almost half of americans that are working , that should be a priority . 
and the head of the bank was inquiring of the guy that is the accountant that handles our books that i have to do as a congressman . 
and it particularly seemed out of place with this guy with his old rusty holes in his pickup truck . 
i had heard stories like that before , but there it was right in front of me . 
what we want to do is make those jobs available , and we want to get rid of this death tax . 
this bill helps big credit card companies at the expense of working families in crisis . 
a harvard university study reports that more than forty-five percent of all bankruptcies are filed because of a health emergency . 
approximately ninety percent of all bankruptcies are due to a health care debt , job loss , or a divorce . 
mr. speaker , i rise today against the pomeroy substitute and in full support of h.r. 8 , the death tax repeal permanency act of 2005 . 
today , the top rate is 47 percent , and these are unbelievably high tax rates , especially when the tax is imposed after a lifetime of hard work . 
resources that could be used to expand businesses and hire new employees are instead used inefficiently to plan for the impact of the death tax . 
the joint economic committee noted that the death tax reduces the stock in the economy , listen to this now , approximately one-half of $ 1 trillion . 
mr. speaker , the permanent repeal of the death tax will not only ensure that small businesses and family farms are not subject to these unfair rates of taxation , but also simplify the tax law and facilitate long-term financial planning . 
enactment of the death tax repeal permanency act promotes fairness and simplification by giving taxpayers the certainty they deserve . 
mr. speaker , i strongly support h.r. 8 , the death tax repeal permanency act of 2005 , and i urge my colleagues to vote `` no '' on the pomeroy substitute amendment . 
there are many reasons to support this bankruptcy reform bill , but i want to focus on one that is important to many of my colleagues , to me , and to the american people . 
financial literacy goes hand in hand with helping our citizens of all ages and walks of life to negotiate the complex world of personal finance . 
we pass many laws that require the disclosure of the terms and conditions of the rich mix of financial products and services that are available to consumers . 
unfortunately for too many americans , knowing the terms and conditions of financial products and services is challenging enough . 
recognizing this fact , congress included provisions in the fair and accurate credit transactions act to address the issue of financial literacy . 
last week we passed house resolution 148 , a bill that supports the goals and ideals of financial literacy month , which is this month , april 2005 . 
h. res. 148 was co-sponsored by 82 members of this body , and 409 members of this body voted for it . 
mr. speaker , the number of bankruptcies remain at a historic high , over 1.6 million bankruptcy cases were filed in federal courts in 2004 . 
there are many reasons to support this bankruptcy reform bill , but i want to focus on one that is important to many of my colleagues , to me and to the american people . 
financial literacy goes hand-in-hand with helping our citizens of all ages and walks of life to negotiate the complex world of personal finance . 
we have passed many laws that require the disclosure of the terms and conditions of the rich mix of financial products and services that are available to consumers . 
unfortunately , for too many americans , knowing the terms and conditions of financial products and services is challenging enough . 
recognizing this fact , congress included provisions in the fair and accurate credit transactions act to address the issue of financial literacy . 
before the house considers s. 256 , i want to highlight , for my colleagues , some of the bill 's important financial literacy provisions : first : the bill will facilitate educating future generations . 
it expresses the `` sense of the congress '' that personal finance curricula be developed for elementary and secondary education programs . 
if we teach our children , early-on , how to manage money , credit , and debt , they can become responsible workers , and heads of households and keep their parents out of bankruptcy court . 
the counseling must include a budget analysis and disclosures regarding the possible impact of bankruptcy on a debtor 's credit report . 
finally , the bill requires the director of the executive office for u.s. trustees to : ( 1 ) develop a financial management training curriculum and materials to educate individual debtors on how to better manage their finances ; and ( 2 ) evaluate and report to the congress on the curriculum 's efficacy . 
this will ensure that congress can evaluate the effectiveness of these financial literacy provisions in the long-term . 
last week , we passed house resolution 148 , a bill that supports the goals and ideals of financial literacy month , which is this month , april 2005 . 
h. res. 148 was co-sponsored by 82 members of this body and 409 members of this body voted for it . 
mr. speaker , the number of bankruptcies remains at a historic high -- over 1.6 million bankruptcy cases were filed in federal courts in 2004 . 
with that in mind and in the spirit of financial literacy month , i urge my colleagues to pass s. 256 , the bankruptcy abuse prevention and consumer protection act , which contains important financial literacy provisions that will provide americans with the skills needed to successfully navigate the world of personal finance . 
mr. speaker , i rise today to recognize the hard-working people of america who play by the rules and have paid their fair share . 
decent , law-abiding , tax-paying americans are the backbone of this country , and they are the salt of the earth . 
they are the farmers of southwest georgia and the family business owners who provide the jobs that keep small rural communities alive and flourishing . 
the death tax represents all that is unfair and unjust about the tax structure in america because it undermines the life work and the life savings of americans who want only to pass on to their children and grandchildren the fruits of their labor and the realization of their american dream . 
in my state of georgia , farmers , many of whom are widow women , are faced with losing their family farms because of this death tax . 
employees of family businesses , many of whom are minorities , are at risk of losing their jobs because their employers are forced to pay the unfair and exorbitant death taxes levied on them . 
let us vote today to finally eliminate the death tax and return to the american people and their progeny the hard-earned fruits of their labor . 
mr. speaker , i want to rise in support of the rule that will allow us to consider the permanent repeal of the death tax . 
mr. speaker , i think it is so appropriate , so very appropriate that this week , as millions of american taxpayers are finalizing their federal income tax filings that we are looking at what is one of the most egregious taxes and most unfair taxes to our small business community . 
i am one of those that fully believes that the death tax is the triple tax , because americans pay tax when they earn their income . 
then they turn around , they buy an asset , and they spend their money , and they are paying a tax on every bit of that . 
i have found it very curious that some of my colleagues across the aisle continue to say it only affects the rich . 
well , in my district , do my colleagues know that it affects thousands of farmers , thousands of small business owners who are very upset about the death tax ? 
families everywhere would benefit from the repeal of this tax . 
when 70 percent of family businesses do not make it to the second generation , there is a problem ; and we know we can fix part of that problem , because it is the death tax . 
for too long the death tax has been a major factor in the failure of family businesses . 
the tax not only forces american families to hand over their hard work to the government ; family businesses spend millions of dollars every year trying to comply with these regulations . 
in addition , it discourages savings and investment , and it is costing our economy hundreds of thousands of new jobs . 
mr. speaker , 89 percent of americans want death taxes repealed . 
mr. speaker , i urge my colleagues to join the leadership and to support this rule in favor of h.r. 8 . 
there is today , and there has been throughout these 9 years , a consensus to make adjustments to the inheritance tax , to make it less steeply graduated , to raise the exemptions , to be able to do fine-tuning , to deal with the legitimate problems of small , closely held businesses and farms . 
and if the republican majority would have permitted a fair and honest debate on this floor of the inheritance tax , we would have enacted significant permanent adjustments that would have solved the vast majority of the problems for 99.9 percent , i dare say . 
our republican friends have been involved with a roller coaster of a 10-year phase-out , and then insanely reinstating it in its entirety . 
my friend from missouri says , well , on the one hand , it is only 1.5 percent of federal revenues ; but that is half of the problem of social security that has driven some people into a frenzy . 
it is not an insignificant number , in the neighborhood of $ 1.5 to $ 2 trillion over the period of time we are talking about . 
but my republican friends do not want to allow the legislative process to work , and have a permanent solution that will stop the ambiguity and that will solve the problem for closely held businesses and yet , not allow vast amounts of wealth , wealth that is so significant that bill gates 's own father does not think that it should eliminate the inheritance tax and has even written a book about it . 
the gentleman from missouri ( mr. hulshof ) xz4001900 found out that his parents , like 99 percent of the people , are not subjected to the inheritance tax . 
the pomeroy amendment would immediately raise that threshold to $ 6 million , with further adjustments to $ 7 million in 4 or 5 years from now , i forget the exact period of time ; he will correct me , i am sure . 
this brings it up so that 99.7 percent of the american public are exempt , and it does it today . 
i think this is so important as i think of the millions of americans today that are struggling with the 1040 form , the 2.9 million americans subjected to the alternative minimum tax , soon to be 16 million families next year . 
not enough money , not enough time to solve that yet we are going to be involved with this cynical game of the inheritance tax . 
i strongly urge the adoption of the pomeroy substitute , which will solve the problem once and for all for the vast majority of the family farms , the small businesses , and , in fact , a number of people of significant wealth ; and it will provide resources so that we can solve problems like social security and the alternative minimum tax and be about our business . 
my first vote in favor of bankruptcy reform was cast with reservations because some of the provisions of the bill seemed unduly harsh , but i had hoped that the legislative process would ultimately improve the product . 
one of my deep concerns has been credit card mills , which send out millions of credit cards to people who are not creditworthy . 
bait-and-switch techniques have been employed that change the terms and raise the interest rates of cardholders who have never missed a payment . 
s. 256 maintains a homestead exemption that allows people with lots of money to shield their assets by purchasing multimillion dollar homes in certain states . 
o.j. simpson was able to shield many of his assets by doing this in florida . 
there are even sophisticated trust arrangements that enable people with substantial sums of money to be protected from the provisions of this bankruptcy bill . 
the senate , however , was unwilling to compromise and approve any of these provisions and the house leadership has prevented any of these proposals from even being debated on the floor . 
perhaps the most glaring example of the majority 's unwillingness to compromise is the rejection of an amendment that would protect soldiers injured in iraq and afghanistan from the unfair i have had meetings over the years with individuals who represent all sides of this issue : the bankruptcy trustees , judges , and lawyers who represent the debtors , and the people who extend credit to businesses large and small and to individuals rich and poor . 
as a result of these meetings , it is clear that the loopholes do remain and that the abuses of lending practices are not being reigned in . 
the bill provides a mandate for unnecessary and burdensome paperwork and the most extreme requirements , including personal certification of the facts by the attorneys assisting the debtor that are not found anyplace else under any other legal provisions . 
this legislation is going to put an unnecessary burden on the vast majority of unfortunate people and still allow too many of the unscrupulous to avoid their responsibilities . 
i rise in support of the bill that would repeal this tax . 
the alternatives that the other side of the aisle have discovered during the hard work to achieve the goal of this bill are certainly a long way from where they were a few years ago . 
more than 70 percent of family businesses do not survive the second generation , and 87 percent do not make it to the third generation because of the estate tax . 
the idea that you give your son $ 2 million overlooks the vast numbers of family members in this country who actually are working side by side with their son or daughter . 
it is hard to tell who made the money and who did not , but on the day that the original member of the family passes away , suddenly the side-by-side partner has a big problem . 
add in the value of farm equipment and business inventory , suddenly there is a lot more money than you thought you could accumulate . 
when we started this debate a few years ago , i saw some statistics that the highest percentage of estates paying at that time were estates that were only slightly above the estate tax amount , but i am sure none of the principals involved had any idea that they had accumulated over their lifetime an estate that would be taxed as a taxable estate . 
on friday of this week , i am going to visit with mark and kim larson who own a family farm right outside of joplin in my district . 
mark tells me he and his family spend a lot of money , money which would otherwise go into continuing to grow their family business , simply trying to comply with a tax code that says if somebody dies in 2010 , your family deals with one set of circumstances ; but if they die the next year , you are impacted by the return of the death tax . 
medium-to-large farms like the larsons ' produce more than 80 percent of agricultural products in america . 
let us put some certainty in the future for those kinds of families . 
mr. speaker , i rise in strong support of h.r. 8 , legislation that would permanently repeal the death tax , a tax that haunts millions of small business owners and farmers nationwide . 
cutting taxes is one of my highest priorities . 
i remain convinced that letting americans keep more of what they earn will help stimulate the economy and create more jobs . 
the key to growing our economy is simple -- allow americans to keep more of their own money to spend , save , and invest . 
mr. speaker , the reform of the nation 's bankruptcy laws which our actions today will accomplish is well justified . 
this reform is strongly in the interests of consumers . 
it will significantly reduce the annual hidden tax of approximately $ 400 that the typical consumer pays because others are misusing the bankruptcy laws . 
that amount represents the increased cost of credit and the increased price of goods and services caused by bankruptcy law misuse . 
the reform also helps consumers by requiring clearer disclosures of the cost of credit on credit card statements , and the reform will be a major benefit to single parents who receive alimony or child support . 
that person today is fifth in priority for the receipt of payment under the bankruptcy laws . 
this reform proceeds from the basic premise that people who can afford to repay a substantial portion of what they owe should do so . 
the bill requires that repayment while allowing a discharge in bankruptcy of the debts that can not be repaid . 
in so doing , it responds to the broad misuse of chapter 7 's complete liquidation provisions that we have observed in recent years . 
the reform measure sets a threshold for the use of chapter 7. debtors who can make little or no repayment can use its provisions and discharge all of their debts . 
debtors whose annual income is below the national mean of about $ 50 , 000 per year are untouched by this reform . 
they can make full use of chapter 7 and discharge all of their debts , whether or not they can afford to make repayments . 
this reform imposes a modest measure of personal responsibility that is well justified , and i urge its approval by the house . 
many of them talk about protecting veterans and making sure that veterans have the support they need when they return from protecting this country 's freedom in iraq . 
today the house passed h.r. 8 to make permanent the repeal of the estate tax . 
this bill gives a tax break to the wealthiest three-tenths of 1 percent of estates , while imposing a new capital gains tax on most of us , including small business owners and farmers . 
clearly , the republicans are attempting to balance the budget on the backs of the veterans . 
many of our servicemembers , especially the citizen soldiers of the guard and the reserve forces , face terrible financial problems because they do not qualify for a narrow protection of debt incurred while on duty if s. 256 becomes law . 
hundreds of thousands of reservists and national guardsmen are currently activated in support of the ongoing military operations . 
according to the national guard , four out of 10 members of the national guard and reservist forces lose income when they leave their civilian jobs for active duty . 
the people of this country need to see what policies the republicans actually vote for . 
we need to make sure that our money follows all of this rhetoric we have on the floor constantly about how we support the veterans . 
mr. speaker , i rise in support of senate bill 256 and urge its adoption by the house . 
whether or not we have a cost of $ 400 per household or some other cost , i think it is clear to all americans that we pay a cost if we have excessive bankruptcies in america . 
for more than 7 years now , almost as long as i have been in congress , we have struggled with the rising tide of bankruptcy abuse which threatens the delicate balance in this country between creditors and debtors . 
as chairman of the subcommittee on commercial and administrative law , i take considerable satisfaction that , through collective effort , we would be able to achieve what many said would never happen . 
this bill is a rare achievement of reducing disparity in the bankruptcy system . 
it strengthens the integrity of the bankruptcy process . 
it deals with the continuing wave of bankruptcy filings and abuse of state homestead exemptions . 
it improves the administration of the bankruptcy process . 
and , finally , it restores a measure of personal responsibility to the bankruptcy system that is spiraling out of control . 
additional judgeships are sorely needed in a number of districts across the country , including my state of utah . 
i was heartened by the assurance of the chairman of the committee on the judiciary during the markup of senate 256 that this matter will be considered later this year . 
in that regard , i would like to thank the gentleman from georgia ( mr. kingston ) xz4002210 who has worked tirelessly on the issue of expanding the number of bankruptcy judges we have to meet this need . 
during the course of the senate judiciary committee 's consideration of s. 256 , a provision was added to deal with excessive retention bonuses , severance payments and other forms of inducements paid by a debtor to retain key personnel or otherwise induce a debtor 's management to remain with the debtor . 
this provision addresses serious conserns and i support the intent of its drafters . 
it is very important that a chapter 11 debtor be able to retain management that is dedicated to maintaining the company 's value for the benefit of its creditors , investors , employees , and other stakeholders . 
accordingly , section 331 of s. 256 should not be applied to invalidate such programs where there is no evidence of insider negligence , mismanagement , or fraudulent conduct contributed to a company 's insolvency -- in whole or in part . 
given the possibility that the intent of the congress with respect to this provision and the interpretation of section 331 's text may not be consistent , legislation clarifying language may be necessary . 
i ask that a letter from the association of insolvency and restructuring advisors be printed at this point in the record . 
association of insolvency , and restructuring advisors , medford , or , march 1 , 2005 . 
chairman : the undersigned are financial and legal professionals who serve as the board of directors of the association of insolvency and restructuring advisors ( aira ) . 
as board members we work to further the aira 's goal of increasing industry awareness of the organization as an important educational and technical resource for professionals in business turnaround , restructuring , and bankruptcy practice , and of the certified insolvency and restructuring advisor ( cira ) designation as an assurance of expertise in this area . 
we write to make you aware of serious concerns we have regarding a provision contained in s. 256 , the `` bankruptcy abuse prevention and consumer protection act of 2005. '' the provision in question effectively prohibits the use of key employee retention plans in chapter 11 reorganizations . 
it was added during the judiciary committee mark-up of the bill and elicited little attention at the time . 
however , we believe this provision will cause considerable harm to a number of companies that will become subject to bankruptcy proceedings , and , most importantly , to their employees , customers , and creditors . 
when a company is operating in chapter 11 , a primary responsibility of management is to maintain and grow the company 's value for the benefit of all of its stakeholders . 
a company that is well-managed through its restructuring benefits its creditors , employees , retirees , unions and the local communities of which the company is a part . 
managers of chapter 11 companies are faced with intense scrutiny , stress , insecurity , and an enormously complex process . 
compensation and incentive tools used by non-bankrupt companies such as equity compensation programs are not available to assist with attracting and retaining the type of management talent necessary to bring the company successfully through the chapter 11 process -- this is because the pre-petition equity is almost always without value . 
if a kerp is not appropriate or if it is not in the best interest of the company 's creditors , the judge can refuse to approve it . 
in the last few years , there has been a trend , with which we agree , towards stricter judicial scrutiny of proposed kerps by bankruptcy judges . 
such a trend seems appropriate in the wake of numerous high profile bankruptcy filings where management 's misconduct or mismanagement has led to the chapter 11 filing . 
unfortunately , s. 256 as reported by the senate judiciary committee includes an amendment authored by senator edward m. kennedy xz4002142 ( the kennedy amendment ) that places significant limits on retention bonuses and severance payments to employees of companies in chapter 11 . 
it would prohibit a bankruptcy judge from approving retention bonuses in every chapter 11 case unless he or she finds that the company in question has proven that the employee has a bona fide job offer at the same or greater rate of compensation ; was prepared to accept the job offer ; and the services of that employee are `` essential to the survival of the business. '' the amendment also places significant caps on the amount of such bonus and payments . 
the kennedy amendment appears to be motivated by a desire to combat kerps in chapter 11 cases where employee-related fraud substantially contributed to the bankruptcy of the company . 
it is apparent that the kennedy amendment is designed to prevent abuses of the system , where creditors ' , employees ' and retirees ' monies are unnecessarily expended for the enrichment of management . 
whether there currently is or is not sufficient judicial scrutiny of kerps is a valid question , insofar as the overall bankruptcy system allows debtors a fair amount of flexibility in exercising reasonable judgment -- but there must be an approach better than handcuffing the judiciary and stakeholders in bankruptcy cases by essentially precluding all use kerps . 
the proper use of kerps requires an analysis of all facts and circumstances of the case , and not what is essentially a blanket proscription of these tools . 
similarly , if the retention of an employee would not enhance a company 's value for its stakeholders , they should not be paid a bonus to stay . 
still , if the congress wishes to improve the operation of current law while still safeguarding the ability of the courts to approve legitimate kerps , we would welcome a discussion on how best to achieve that end . 
unfortunately , s. 256 , as reported by the committee , goes too far and should be amended so as not to unnecessarily limit the bankruptcy court 's ability to determine what is in the best interest of each individual bankruptcy estate . 
we would be pleased to address any questions you or other members of the committee on the judiciary may have . 
sincerely , the members of the board and management of the association of insolvency and restructuring advisors . 
mr. speaker , i urge again the adoption of s. 256 . 
mr. speaker , i rise today in support of the permanent repeal of the death tax . 
it is wrong to levy hefty taxes against families of thriving small business owners just because their parents were successful . 
it is wrong to stifle economic growth by forcing small businesses to close because of an overbearing tax bill delivered by a greedy uncle sam . 
when businesses have to raise the cost of their products due to unpaid liabilities , that cost is passed unfairly to all of us . 
this legislation will modernize the system and make it more difficult to hide behind the protections of filing for bankruptcy . 
with this bill we will lessen the impact of the unpaid debt that is a hindrance to thousands of businesses and hurts our ability to create jobs . 
mr. speaker , i rise today in strong support of the rule and the underlying legislation . 
i am proud to be a cosponsor of h.r. 8 and thank the gentleman from missouri for his leadership in offering this bill . 
as a result , thousands of jobs were saved and second and third generations were able to take charge of their family 's business . 
if we do not act now to permanently eliminate the death tax , it will be revived at the stroke of midnight on january 1 , 2011 . 
bringing back the death tax will drive the final nail in the coffin for america 's next generation of small business owners . 
in the absence of the death tax , these small businesses become a legacy for one generation to pass on to the next . 
as a result , jobs are lost and generations of family toil are plundered by the government . 
the wall street journal wrote in 1999 that 60 percent of small businesses would add jobs if death taxes were not on the books . 
the very threat of a revived death tax has a negative impact on small business . 
the house today has an opportunity to rid the nation of this tax that kicks families when they are down , takes away a lifetime of hard work , and stifles job growth . 
we talk about being fiscally responsible , we talk about trying to balance the federal budget and say we have a problem with social security as far as long-term solvency of 75 years ; but let me point out that the revenue loss of this bill equals the 75-year amount to provide long-term solvency for social security . 
if we have a choice to provide for the long-term strength of social security or the passage of this bill , my vote is for the long-term solvency of social security . 
the second issue i would like to point out is the predictability of the current estate tax situation . 
it is not very predictable , and the passage of this bill will do nothing to assure people when they do their estate plans that they can rely upon the schedule congress has passed . 
we have a chance with the pomeroy substitute to bring certainty to estate taxes with a reasonable exemption of $ 3.5 million , $ 7 million per couple , and reducing permanently the tax by 10 percent . 
so if members are fiscal conservatives and are concerned about the cost of this bill on our children and seniors and if members want predictability in the estate tax , this legislation does not give it to us . 
we will have that opportunity with the fiscally responsible substitute so we can deal with the budget problems of this country . 
they deserve a congress that will be fiscally responsible , and the passage of this bill just does not do it . 
mr. speaker , i support equitable reform of our nation 's bankruptcy laws . 
i recognize that there has been abuse of our bankruptcy system , and that reform is needed . 
those debtors who charge thousands of dollars on luxury items prior to declaring bankruptcy , should be held accountable . 
their actions are not fair to the vast majority of americans who work hard to pay their debts in full , and congress should act to limit irresponsible use of our bankruptcy system . 
regardless of the circumstances that led the individual to seek bankruptcy , the court is not permitted to waive the means test . 
in other words , `` one strike , you 're out. '' i am disappointed that we did not add some reasonable flexibility measures to the `` means test. '' the stated purpose of the bill 's means test is to prevent consumers who can afford to repay some of their debts from abusing the system by filing for chapter 7 bankruptcy . 
`` harvard law school recently researched bankruptcies and found that nine out of ten persons filing bankruptcy have faced job loss , severe health problems , divorce or separation . 
illness or medical bills drove nearly half of these filings . 
i am disappointed that here in the house , the judiciary committee failed to close a popular loophole used by the very wealthy to shield millions of dollars by setting up asset protection trusts . 
the judiciary committee also failed to rein in some of the practices of credit card companies that are in part responsible for the rise in bankruptcy filings . 
why not help consumers understand the consequences of their financial decisions , such as making only the minimum payment each month , so that they can avoid some of the missteps that can lead to higher debt ? 
we do need bankruptcy reform , and i wish that we had an opportunity to address many of these valid concerns . 
i want to address the concerns of elderly americans . 
the number of senior citizens in bankruptcy tripled from 1992 to 2001 , representing the largest increase of any group of americans . 
according to the baltimore city department of aging , bankruptcies among elderly city residents have increased by nearly 50 percent over the past year . 
their costs of living are increasing steadily , including their rent , food , and heating costs . 
many of them routinely use credit cards to cover their daily expenses . 
an amendment in the other body that would have required companies that dropped retiree health benefits to reimburse each affected retiree for 18 months of cobra coverage upon reemerging from bankruptcy was defeated . 
i am disappointed that the victims of identity theft can not seek relief under this bill . 
we have just learned that between choicepoint and lexis-nexis , thousands of individuals have been the victims of identity theft . 
this year , i am again an original cosponsor of this bill , but it is not yet law , and so virtually every american remains at great risk for identity theft . 
unfortunately , our vote on the previous question -- to allow bankruptcy judges to take into consideration the fact that persons are forced into bankruptcy because of identity theft -- was defeated . 
so many americans have been driven into bankruptcy not from a desire to game the system , but because of circumstances beyond their control . 
it is because of them that i must vote against this bill . 
mr. speaker , i rise today in strong support of s. 256 , the bankruptcy abuse and consumer prevention act . 
those who believe credit card companies , mortgage lenders and other financial institutions are bearing the cost of consumers filing for bankruptcy do not understand how business works . 
this legislation balances the consumer 's challenge of debt repayment with the needs of businesses that collect money rightfully owed to them . 
in an effort to better educate consumers and improve financial literacy , the legislation requires many filers of bankruptcy to attend financial counseling . 
this change coupled with congressional encouragement for schools to incorporate personal finance curricula in elementary and secondary education programs are both useful methods of curbing future debt . 
as chairman of the subcommittee on education reform , which has jurisdiction over k through 12 , i feel strongly that educating future spenders can prevent debts incurred as adults . 
again , mr. speaker , i want to thank chairman sensenbrenner for his years of strong and tenacious support for this legislation and thank him for not giving up on these important , common-sense changes to our bankruptcy system . 
mr. speaker , i am submitting for the record the following remarks from mr. arkadi kuhlmann , ceo of ing direct , in opposition to the bankruptcy reform legislation under consideration . 
i remain a strong supporter of s. 256 ; however , i believe mr. kuhlmann 's statement should be made part of the record . 
statement of arkadi kuhlmann , ceo , ing direct mr. speaker , i am arkadi kuhlmann , ceo of ing direct , a federally chartered thrift headquartered in wilmington , delaware . 
ing direct has since expanded its product line to include the orange mortgage , the orange home equity line of credit , orange cds and the orange investment account . 
one significant oversight is the bill 's failure to consider one of the biggest problems we face in business today : identity theft . 
the bankruptcy bill must address the possibility that identity theft could lead to financial devastation through no fault of the person 's own . 
in addition to overlooking the problem of identity theft , this proposal had additional shortcomings . 
it actually encourages further bad lending decisions by removing an important market discipline -- the possibility of a clean bankruptcy . 
without important changes , millions of consumers , who might otherwise be savers , will be encouraged into debt by aggressive credit card and other lending . 
we believe it is crucial that a serious study of the connection between credit card marketing and personal bankruptcy be completed . 
we challenge the congress to take a very hard look at the results of the study and consider further legislation , if necessary . 
another important issue is the bill 's creation of a `` means test. '' by giving disparate treatment to secured versus unsecured debt , the law would treat secured creditors even more favorably than under current rules . 
we at ing direct believe this country is still willing to give working americans -- the engine of our economy -- a second chance when debt overwhelms them . 
mr. speaker , i rise today in strong support of s. 256 , the `` bankruptcy abuse and consumer prevention act of 2005. '' it has been seven years since we made our first attempt to reform the bankruptcy system in the 105th congress and thanks to the tireless efforts of chairman sensenbrenner 's committee , we can see a real chance for passing a full and comprehensive bill this year . 
those who believe credit card companies , mortgage lenders and other financial institutions are bearing the costs of consumer 's filing for bankruptcy do n't understand how business works . 
this legislation balances the consumer 's challenge of debt repayment with the needs of businesses to collect money rightfully owed to them . 
in an effort to better educate consumers and improve financial literacy , the legislation requires many filers of bankruptcy to attend financial counseling . 
this change , coupled with congressional encouragement for schools to incorporate personal finance curricula in elementary and secondary education programs , are both useful methods of curbing future debt . 
as chairman of the education reform subcommittee , which has jurisdiction over all k-12 programs , i feel strongly that educating future spenders can prevent debts incurred as adults . 
i also support the new requirement for lending institutions , which will now have to take additional steps to ensure consumers fully understand the ramifications of credit spending . 
credit card billing statements will now reflect the actual time it would take to repay a full balance at a specified interest rate ; contain warnings to alert consumers that paying only the minimum will increase the amount of interest ; and list a toll-free number for consumer 's to call for an estimate of the time it would take to repay the balance if only the minimum is paid . 
with these steps , lending institutions can improve their chances of repayment while pro-actively educating consumers of true costs associated with borrowing . 
a means test would be used to determine a debtor 's eligibility for chapter 7 bankruptcy relief , where the majority of debt is excused , or chapter 13 , where a significant portion of debt must be repaid . 
importantly , disabled veterans would be exempt from the means test if their debts occurred primarily as a result of being called to active duty or for homeland defense operations . 
the delaware district tends to have the largest chapter 11 business cases , often referred to as the `` mega '' chapter 11 cases which are `` those involving extremely large assets , unusual public interest , a high level of creditor involvement , complex debt , a significant amount of related litigation , or a combination of such factors. '' these are again , mr. speaker , i want to thank chairman sensenbrenner for his years of strong and tenacious support for this legislation and thank him for not giving up on these important , common-sense changes to our bankruptcy system . 
i want to thank the chairman of the committee on the judiciary , the gentleman from wisconsin ( mr. sensenbrenner ) xz4003650 , for his leadership and his efforts in making this bill a reality . 
it represent years of work , compromise and what i believe to be necessary reforms . 
in 1915 the supreme court wrote that our bankruptcy laws were intended to give honest debtors a chance to `` start afresh , free from obligations and responsibilities consequent upon business misfortunes. '' this view was later reaffirmed in the 1934 case , local loan company v. hunt , in which the court wrote that `` the purpose of the act has been again and again emphasized by the courts in that it gives to the honest but unfortunate debtor a new opportunity in life and a clear field for future effort , unhampered by the pressure and discouragement of preexisting debt. '' over the last several decades , bankruptcy protections have expanded to cover basically anyone and everyone , not just those who truly need it . 
increasingly , this protection is being sought for the consumer debt that has skyrocketed out of control as a result of the misuse of credit cards and other credit options . 
personal bankruptcy filing cost businesses and our economy tens of billions of dollars every year . 
h.r. 685 the bankruptcy abuse and consumer protection act of 2005 , the bill that is here before us today , strikes a balance . 
it requires those who have the means to repay debts to do so while protecting those who truly need the assistance provided by chapter 7 , such as those with serious medical conditions , the men and women of our armed services who are on active duty , as well as those disabled veterans who served in years past . 
decisions to seek the protection of bankruptcy should be taken seriously . 
the consequences of filing are not just personal but impact our economy and society as a whole . 
it massively tilts the playing field in favor of banks and credit card companies and against working people and their families . 
i have never , ever faced such a piece of legislation . 
mr. speaker , all i want to say as we open this debate is that to those who assert that this bill cracks down on creditor abuse , i would ask them to realize that this bill does absolutely nothing to discourage abusive , underage lending ; nothing to discourage reckless lending to the developmentally disabled ; nothing to regulate the practice of sub-prime lending to persons with no means or little ability to repay their debts ; nothing to crack down on the sharks , the lenders , that charge members of the armed forces up to 500 percent interest per year or more . 
this bill is opposed by every consumer group , by all the bankruptcy judges , the trustees , law professors , by all of organized labor , by the military groups , by the civil rights organizations , and by every major group concerned about seniors , women , and children . 
please , if we do not do anything else in the 109th congress , let us not let this bill get out of the house of representatives . 
mr. speaker , i reserve the balance of my time . 
mr. speaker , i am pleased to yield 2 1/2 minutes to the gentleman from massachusetts ( mr. delahunt ) xz4001020 , a distinguished member of the committee . 
mr. speaker , i am pleased to yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from north carolina ( mr. watt ) xz4004240 , the ranking member of the subcommittee on commercial and administrative law . 
mr. speaker , i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from new york ( mr. nadler ) xz4002890 , the former ranking member of the subcommittee on commercial and administrative law . 
this is an 8-year-old bill , and the gentleman has been foremost in this process for all of those years . 
mr. speaker , i yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from houston , texas ( ms. jackson-lee ) xz4001990 , a member of the committee . 
mr. speaker , i yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from california ( ms. zoe lofgren ) xz4002450 , a distinguished member of the committee . 
mr. speaker , i am now pleased to break the line of members of the committee . 
i yield 1 minute and 15 seconds to a distinguished friend of mine , the gentleman from new jersey ( mr. pascrell ) xz4003090 . 
mr. speaker , i am pleased to yield 2 minutes to my friend , the gentleman from massachusetts ( mr. meehan ) xz4002690 , an excellent member of the committee . 
mr. speaker , i am now pleased to yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from california ( ms. linda t. snchez ) , who is an able member of the committee . 
mr. speaker , i yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from los angeles , california ( ms. waters ) xz4004220 , a member of the committee . 
we should all be embarrassed that instead of repealing the biggest loophole in the bankruptcy code , we have had 8 years to study it , the homestead exemption , the bill places only weak obstacles in its path . 
instead of protecting women and health care providers from those who would terrorize abortion clinics , we lay out a blueprint for them to avoid their debts . 
instead of helping individuals who have lost their job or faced a health care emergency , we deny them the chance for a fresh start . 
mr. speaker , i yield the remainder of my time to the gentlewoman from california ( ms. pelosi ) xz4003140 , the distinguished minority leader . 
mr. speaker , i rise in support of this rule and the bill authored by the gentleman from missouri ( mr. hulshof ) xz4001900 and commend him for his great work on behalf of america 's job creators . 
i just heard the democratic member say that only a tiny fraction of the people who die in america and their families have to pay this death tax . 
how many of us right now are trying to deal with form 1040 ? 
what we are trying to get rid of is the complexity of the tax code and the $ 20 billion a year that the death tax consumes from the american economy that does not go to the treasury but , rather , goes to tax lawyers and accountants and life insurance sales and keyman policies and so on , all of this estate planning which is economic waste . 
eighty-eight pages of the internal revenue code , 88 pages of law , are devoted to trying to close the loopholes that have erupted over the 20th century as our experiment with the death tax has shown that it actually costs the government and costs the american people money to maintain it . 
much as we would like to be able to tax the super-rich , they get out of the tax with trusts and loopholes and so on , as will the rich after we do what the democrats want , which is to create some complicated new definitions to try and cabin off this tax so it only affects a few people . 
the only people who will actually be hurt by the burden of these new complex rules and laws will be people who we do not want to pay the tax in the first place . 
if at the time that one of one 's loved ones dies , just to file the return , not pay the tax , they are going to have to plow through all of these helpful instructions that are in such small print that even a high school student might need reading glasses to get through some of these 40 pages . 
but here is the kind of helpful thing one will find when a loved one dies : `` generally , you may list on schedule m all property interests that pass from the decedent to the surviving spouse and are included in the gross estate . 
`` for the rules on common disaster and survival for a limited period , see section 2056 ( b ) ( 3 ) . '' this is just one little paragraph out of 40 pages of this . 
we are trying to eliminate the complexity of this law which hurts every single person who works for a small business in america . 
when that small business is liquidated in order to pay the death tax because it is a tax on property of small businesses , people lose their jobs , and that is where the burden and the incidence of this tax falls . 
if his amendment got rid of any aspect of carryover basis in death tax i would vote for it . 
i wish we could get rid of the carryover basis . 
now you have to ask yourself , in advance of your death , do you know what the assets and inventory of your business is going to be 10 years , 20 years , 30 years down the road ? 
of course not . 
tax compliance , the cost of actual accountants and lawyers and life insurance and all the other things that you have to do to deal with the death tax year in and year out is $ 20 billion a year . 
but the authors of this amendment still want to pry lots of cash out of the cold dead fingers of america 's deceased entrepreneurs . 
so they rewrite the language of the tax code so we can keep all 88 pages of complexity of the death tax and all the thousands of pages of regulation and the hundreds of thousands of pages of case law that go with it . 
this is the most complex part of one of the most complex tax systems in the world , and it is time to drive a stake through its heart . 
and that is why we must vote against this amendment and in favor of the total repeal of the death tax . 
because the federal government has decided that the family businesses can grow without the destructive burden of the death tax but only until some irs bureaucrat decides that these businesses are worth $ 3.5 million dollars . 
you will not know until it is too late whether you are on one side or the other side of that threshold . 
i have to tell you , it sounds like $ 3 million is a lot of money . 
and if you are trying to employ some people , you have 10 , 11 , 12 people that work for that business , what are you going to say to them when they lose their jobs because the family business has to be liquidated on the death of the entrepreneur in order to come up with the actual cash to pay for it ? 
the irs is not going to accept shares of stock in the family business in payment of the death tax . 
to the supporters of this amendment i say we agree with you that the death tax destroys family farms and businesses . 
mr. speaker , i think a number of important points have been made today , but i rise today in strong support of this bill and in opposition to the estate tax . 
some of the previous speakers on this side of the aisle have made reference to the fact that a number of us on the democratic side have worked over this issue since actually the early nineties . 
i know the gentleman 's predecessor jennifer dunn and i and a number of people from this side of the aisle had worked hard together to look for a commonsense way that we could end this burden which , in my opinion , is an extreme burden on the small business community and on the farm community . 
in north alabama where i come from , we have some of the most productive farm families of any district in the country . 
but the reality is that if we do not permanently repeal the death tax , you have almost got to time your death for the benefit of your family . 
according to the congressional research service , estates that included farm or business assets represented 42.5 percent of the 30 , 000 plus taxable estate tax returns filed in 2003 . 
it is not fair to say that this is just a rich person 's issue , that the estate tax only affects the wealthy , because , according to that same congressional research service , estates over $ 5 million accounted for only 6.8 percent of taxable estates . 
for the benefit of those farmers , for those small manufacturers , for the local car dealers , the independent car dealers , the realtors , the funeral directors , the grocers , the family restaurant owners , the florists , the convenience store owners and many others , let us end this unfair tax burden . 
mr. speaker , after eight years of consideration , we are now poised to enact bankruptcy legislation that is deeply flawed . 
like so many of the policy priorities pursued by this congress and the administration , this bill hurts the most vulnerable among our citizens . 
many of my colleagues have already discussed the terrible provisions that the legislation now before the house would implement . 
it would remove critical automatic stay provisions that currently prevent the eviction of those who are seeking to clear arrearages in their rent . 
s. 256 also would reduce the amount of personal property that those filing for bankruptcy can retain . 
however , rather than highlight the numerous other misguided provisions of s. 256 , i want to look for a moment at the economic policies of which this legislation is just one more disappointing part . 
the sponsors of s. 256 claim that the rising number of people filing bankruptcies in our nation is evidence that there is widespread abuse of our current bankruptcy protections . 
in the economic report of the president delivered to congress in february of this year , the administration wrote that the `` president 's policies are designed to foster rising living standards at home , while encouraging other nations to follow our lead. '' the president 's policies are not worthy of emulation in other nations -- and they are not worthy of continuation in our nation . 
perhaps not surprisingly , the congressional research service found that in 2001 , 27 percent of families in the lowest one-fifth of household income distributions had debt obligations that exceeded 40 percent of their incomes . 
a recent harvard study published earlier this year found that nearly half of all bankruptcy filings involve some major medical expense . 
as recently as 1981 , medical expenses accounted for less than 10 percent of bankruptcy filings . 
more than 38 percent of those who filed bankruptcy for medical reasons were found to have experienced some type of lapse in their insurance coverage during the two years preceding their filing . 
in fact , 90 percent of the bankruptcies filed are by those who have been injured , are sick , have been laid off , and/or are going through a divorce . 
laid-off workers are the fastest growing group of people filing bankruptcy . 
all the while , credit card company abuses are mounting in the form of deceptive marketing practices , irresponsible accounting practices and other predatory practices . 
these practices are designed to give the debtor a false sense of financial health while incurring more debt . 
the minute a tragedy strikes and a debtor falls behind in one payment , debtors are often swarmed upon by all of their credit card companies -- who want to collect immediately . 
mr. speaker , i rise today in strong support of the pomeroy substitute to house resolution 8. and i argue that anyone in this body who is currently concerned about our ballooning national debt should vote in favor of the substitute . 
it is clear from the debate today that the majority of members in this body believe that our farmers and small businessmen and -women need relief from the estate tax , and i will do all i can to ensure that these hardworking americans get their due tax relief . 
additionally , from 2009 forward , the tax exemption level would be $ 3.5 & lt ; center & gt ; & lt ; pre & gt ; [ page : h1939 ] & lt ; /pre & gt ; & lt ; /center & gt ; i know my friends on the other side of the aisle desperately want to make sure that the paris hiltons of america are fully covered , but they have done pretty good the last 100 years ; and i am sure under the pomeroy bill in the future they will continue to do pretty good . 
by using the stepped-up basis to calculate the value on an estate at a time of death , the substitute bill is actually making the tax code simpler and less cumbersome . 
it is important to the president , and it is important to many of us in congress . 
i truly believe we have got to stop this liberal policy of borrowing and spending . 
you had a chance in 2002 to increase the benefits by giving the tax relief to the estates of all americans . 
the figure of $ 400 is a mythical figure . 
anyone familiar with the history of this bill knows that it was written by and for the credit card industry , and they spent north of $ 40 million to make sure that they got what they wanted . 
the american people are the losers here , unless you happen to be a senior executive of a credit card company or an investor in credit card companies , because they are going to make a good score here today , but the american taxpayer is going to pay for it . 
the bill is nothing more than a public subsidy for one of the most profitable businesses in our economy . 
the credit card industry said , no ; and , of course , their supporters defeated our amendment ; and this amendment is not before us today . 
maybe this bill should be renamed as the loan sharking decriminalization act of 2000 . 
we hear the term personal responsibility , but when it comes to the concept of corporate responsibility , silence . 
last year , more than a million-and-a-half families resorted to declaring bankruptcy -- a full half of which occurred not because of any irresponsible behavior but because of unexpected medical expenses brought on by an illness or death in the family . 
if there is any `` crisis , '' it is the skyrocketing cost of health care , which has left more than 14 million americans spending more than a quarter of their every paycheck on medical costs -- that mr. speaker , is what i call a crisis . 
and as with previous incarnations of this legislation , there is virtually nothing in the bill that would require creditors to curb their outrageous predatory lending practices that mislead even the most educated consumers into debt . 
the bill also allows perpetrators of violence against women at health centers to escape liability for their actions through the bankruptcy courts . 
mr. speaker , this bill is yet another product of an administration and majority that taxes work and rewards wealth . 
it appeals to the worst in all of us , painting honest middle-class families who are working hard and taking personal responsibility for their actions as liars , cheaters and spendthrifts . 
i can hardly imagine a more unfair piece of legislation less concerned with promoting the common good , and i urge my colleagues to oppose it . 
at a time of apparently unending war and the largest budget deficits in american history , our republican colleagues are intent on solving a crisis that does not exist . 
as the president wastes millions of our taxpayer dollars crisscrossing this country to declare that there is no social security trust fund and questioning the full faith and credit of the federal government , his republican allies here seem intent on actually making his dire and inaccurate statements a self-fulfilling prophecy . 
today , what they propose is to borrow from the social security trust fund and to borrow from the medicare trust fund in order to give more tax breaks to the richest one-tenth of 1 percent of the people in this country . 
it is taking from the hard-working employees and employers who are paying their social security money and transferring that wealth over to the richest one-tenth of 1 percent . 
if they keep pursuing bills like this , it will be the death of social security and medicare , as sure as i am standing here . 
like most democrats , i have voted not once but a number of times to repeal the estate tax for most americans and to see that it is done right away , now , not postponing it for years as the republicans propose to do . 
there is another democratic substitute coming out today that is going to exempt 99.7 percent of all estates from this tax , and only cover the richest .3 percent of the wealthiest estates in this country . 
that means you are not going to have a small business in east austin or west mcallen or a family farm in karnes county that is covered if they are even covered now , which the vast majority of them are not . 
they keep talking about the little family business that with good reason wants to be able to pass that enterprise on to the next generation of that hard-working family . 
the family of enrons ken lay , not quite as sympathetic . 
their goal is to ensure that the richest of the rich are rewarded , as if they have not rewarded them enough for the last few years that they have controlled this congress . 
it was back almost a century ago when a republican , a fellow named teddy roosevelt , said that `` inherited economic power is as inconsistent with the ideals of this generation as inherited political power was inconsistent with the ideals of the generation which established our government. '' it is still inconsistent . 
mr. speaker , i rise in opposition to h.r. 8 , which continues , in my view , the policies by the majority of three tax cuts , in 4 years , with four straight record-breaking deficits that have added $ 2 trillion in 4 years to the nation 's debt . 
and here again the majority offers $ 850 billion of tax cuts to the wealthiest families in this country . 
we have a tax code that rewards and initiates a culture of cheating and penalizes those who abide by the rules . 
with all the economic challenges we are facing today in the area of health care , energy , education , eliminating the estate tax , fully eliminating , should be the last of our priorities . 
instead of helping the wealthy avoid taxes , we should be helping middle-class families save for their retirement . 
millions of families are financially unprepared for retirement . 
given this reality , why are we debating the elimination of the estate tax instead of real tax reform and a savings agenda for the middle class . 
are holding the interests of the wealthy and special interests above the hopes and dreams of the middle-class families the kind of values we want our tax code to reflect ? 
as late former supreme court justice louis brandeis once said , `` we can have democracy in this country or we can have great wealth concentrated in the hands of a few , but we can not have both. '' mr. speaker , there is no doubt which one this bill will achieve . 
throughout my service in the u.s. house , i have been a strong supporter of estate tax relief for family farmers and small business owners . 
the first bill i introduced as a member of congress was a bill to raise the inheritance tax exemption from $ 600 , 000 to $ 1.5 million and for the first time indexed it to inflation . 
the unfortunate reality of our situation is that we have witnessed the most dramatic fiscal reversal in our nation 's history . 
instead of adopting a bill that would increase the burden on our children and grandchildren , we need a common-sense solution that would exempt the vast majority of americans from an estate tax while maintaining a degree of fiscal integrity . 
this substitute provides an estate tax exemption of $ 3 million for individuals and $ 6 million for couples beginning in 2006 , and the exemption would increase to $ 3.5 million and $ 7 million respectively in 2009 . 
furthermore , this plan would instantly repeal the estate tax on a vast majority of farms and small businesses , as well as shield heirs from dramatic capital gains tax liabilities that are part of the republican plan . 
the u.s. department of agriculture has estimated that more farm estates would have an increased tax liability from the republican plan 's carry-over basis rules than would ever benefit from the repeal of the estate tax . 
i support estate tax relief , but not at the expense of our senior citizens who benefit from social security and medicare . 
the only way to pay for the republican bill is by taking more money out of the social security an medicare trust funds and replacing it with ious . 
h.r. 8 will compound the fiscal mistakes congress has made the last 2 years with its policy of tax cuts at any cost , including our children 's education and our nation 's future . 
the people of north carolina 's second district elected me to help chart a common-sense , fiscally prudent course for the country . 
it hurts middle-class consumers in a variety of ways : the bill would allow landlords to evict battered women without bankruptcy court approval , even if the eviction poses a threat to the women 's physical well-being ; and , it permits credit card companies to reclaim common households goods which are of little value to them , but very important to the debtor 's family . 
it is very important to note that the bill does absolutely nothing to discourage abusive underage lending , nothing to discourage reckless lending to the developmentally disabled and nothing to crack down on unscrupulous pay-day lenders that prey on members of the armed forces . 
in my judgment , it is a grave mistake to punish these individuals while rewarding credit card companies and business lobbyists at a time when corporate greed has already destroyed the lives of millions of american workers . 
mr. speaker , i rise today as a proud cosponsor of h.r. 8 , the death tax repeal permanency act of 2005 . 
mr. speaker , i do not believe that there has ever been a more reprehensible tax on the face of the earth than the death tax . 
husbands , wives and children and other relatives bear the burden of this tax while they are still struggling to cope with the loss of their loved one . 
taxes have already been paid , and every bit of profit that they might make in a year is taxed as well . 
currently , the repeal of the death tax is set to expire in 2010 ; and , mr. speaker , i can not understand how anyone would allow the federal government to hand a grieving family in 2011 a bill for the death of their loved one . 
mr. speaker , let us get the federal government off the backs of grieving families and pass this rule and this bill for the sake of fairness and decency . 
mr. speaker , i want to commend the gentleman from missouri ( mr. hulshof ) xz4001900 , the gentleman from alabama ( mr. cramer ) xz4000840 , the gentleman from california ( mr. cox ) xz4000830 , and all those who have worked so hard to get rid of this onerous burden on a number of american citizens . 
i represent the fifth district of virginia . 
we have a number of counties and jurisdictions that focus on manufacturing . 
many of our smaller manufacturers have had to sell out to larger manufacturers ; and as a result , we have double-digit unemployment in a number of jurisdictions that used to be the home to small manufacturers . 
if we pass this bill , we will help the job situation in those types of jurisdictions in the united states . 
let me tell the members under the current law the really rich in this country trust and foundation themselves out of the federal estate tax . 
i believe that mr. gates , the owner of microsoft , is a proponent of keeping the federal death tax . 
he has got a father that is in charge of his foundation . 
but many small farmers and average business persons are not able to have the cash to set up the trusts and the foundations that will get themselves out of the federal estate tax . 
and i predict that if we pass this bill , the incentive to set up those trusts and foundations that avoid taxes will not be there and in the long run the treasury of the united states will benefit because we will still get the capital gains tax when the assets are sold . 
it is time that we relieve consumers from the burden of paying for the debts of others . 
s. 256 , the bankruptcy abuse prevention and consumer protection act , is the culmination of years of work and bicameral as well as bipartisan negotiations . 
a key aspect of s. 256 is retention of the income-based means test . 
the application of such objective standards will help ensure that the fresh start provisions of chapter vii will be granted to those who need them , while debtors that can afford to repay some of their debts are steered toward filing chapter 13 bankruptcies . 
as chairman of the house committee on agriculture , i am pleased that we are finally making the chapter 12 provisions of the bankruptcy code permanent . 
bankruptcy relief for family farmers will be made easier for those to obtain a discharge of their indebtedness . 
in addition , the bill allows more family farmers to qualify for chapter 12 relief by doubling the debt limit and lowering the percentage of income that must be derived from farming operations . 
mr. speaker , i rise in strong support of the `` bankruptcy abuse prevention and consumer protection act of 2005. '' bankruptcy filings are at an all time high . 
it is time that we relieve consumers from the burden of paying for the debts of others . 
s. 256 , the `` bankruptcy abuse prevention and consumer protection act of 2005 '' is the culmination of years of work and bi-camerla , as well as bi-partisan negotiations . 
a key aspect of s. 256 is the retention of the income-based means test . 
the application of such objective standards will help ensure that the fresh start provisions of chapter 7 will be granted to those who need them , while debtors that can afford to repay some of their debts are steered toward filing chapter 13 bankruptcies . 
s. 256 is good for america 's family farmers , who are the backbone of our agriculture industry . 
the bill permanently extends chapter 12 bankruptcy relief for family farmers and makes it easier for family farmers to obtain discharges of their indebtedness . 
in addition , the bill allows more family farmers to qualify for chapter 12 relief by doubling the debt limit and lowering the percentage of income that must be derived from farming operations . 
in addition , it protects consumers from `` bankruptcy mills '' that encourage people to file for bankruptcy without fully informing them of their rights and the potential harms that bankruptcy can cause . 
s. 256 also ensures the fair treatment of those that administer our bankruptcy laws . 
specifically , this legislation restores fairness and equity to the relationship between the u.s. trustee and private standing bankruptcy trustees by providing that in certain circumstances , after an administrative hearing on the record , private trustees may seek judicial review of u.s. trustee actions related to trustee removal . 
this compromise , worked out between the u.s. trustee 's office and representatives of the private bankruptcy trustees , will ensure fairness for those who dedicate themselves to their duties as private trustees while ensuring that the u.s. trustee is subject to the same checks and balances as other government agencies . 
i want to commend chairmen sensenbrenner and cannon for their tremendous work on this legislation , and i urge each of my colleagues to support this fair and reasonable overhaul of the u.s. bankruptcy system . 
this bill will weaken homestead protections currently in place under state laws , hurting my constituents , the citizens of texas , and the citizens of any other states that have laws protecting individuals ' homes valued over $ 125 , 000 , which is the limit this bill sets . 
texas , which has the longest and oldest history of homestead protection laws in our country , has no cap on homestead protection , along with kansas , iowa , florida , and south dakota . 
minnesota , rhode island , and nevada 's laws protect home equity of $ 200 , 000 . 
the median resale price of a home in california is $ 215 , 000 . 
while i understand there must be a sensible cap on exemptible home equity to ensure the law is not protecting million dollar mansions , $ 125 , 000 is unreasonable given the skyrocketing price of real estate in texas and many other parts of the country . 
this bill will make bankruptcy even more expensive and burdensome than it already is , on hardworking americans who have fallen on hard times and seniors on fixed incomes , while doing nothing to address the out of control lending practices by credit card companies . 
mr. speaker , i rise in support of h.r. 8 , which will finally free america 's hard-working farmers and small business owners from the specter of the death tax . 
benjamin franklin said : `` in this world nothing is certain but death and taxes , '' but i doubt even the inventive mr. franklin imagined the taxation of death itself . 
the impact of the death tax extends far beyond the pain it inflicts upon grieving families . 
the national federation of independent businesses has estimated that the death tax will compel one-third of small business owners today to sell some or all of their business . 
the center for the study of taxation found that 70 percent of all family businesses can not survive the second generation and 87 percent do not make the third . 
all of this wasted money , energy and over 100 , 000 jobs lost per year and for what , a tax that the joint economic committee says costs just as much to collect as it generates in revenue . 
mr. speaker , the opponents of h.r. 8 can not provide any justification for the continued existence of this useless relic . 
i urge my colleagues to drive the final nail in this coffin so 6 years from now americans will not wake up to find that , like a vampire , this unfair tax has arisen from the dead to once again suck the blood from a lifetime of hard work and sacrifice . 
mr. speaker , we come to the floor today to address an issue of tax fairness . 
you see , no matter what kind of spin our friends on the other side of the aisle try to use -- the death tax simply is n't fair . 
many of our small family businesses are wrapped up in a loved one 's estate . 
i 've heard countless stories from families who have had to sell off a chunk of the family farm just to handle their tax burden . 
our friends on the other side of the aisle say that this is too costly and it 's bad for the budget . 
what kind of nation have we become when a small family farmer ca n't afford to pass the business on to his children ? 
70 percent of family businesses do not survive the second generation , 87 percent do not make it to the third generation . 
many of these businesses are going belly-up because of the death tax . 
mr. speaker , by direction of the committee on rules , i call up house resolution 202 and ask for its immediate consideration . 
mr. speaker , for the purpose of debate only , i yield the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from massachusetts ( mr. mcgovern ) xz4002630 , pending which i yield myself such time as i may consume . 
during consideration of this resolution , all time yielded is for the purpose of debate only . 
mr. speaker , house resolution 202 is a structured rule providing for 1 hour of general debate on h.r. 8 , a bill to make the repeal of the estate tax permanent , to be equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the committee on ways and means . 
the rule provides for consideration of the amendment in the nature of a substitute printed in the committee on rules report accompanying the resolution , if offered , by the gentleman from north dakota ( mr. pomeroy ) xz4003230 or his designee , which shall be considered as read and shall be separately debatable for 1 hour equally divided and controlled by the proponent and an opponent . 
finally , mr. speaker , the rule waives all points of order against the amendment printed in the report and provides one motion to recommit with or without instructions . 
the death tax is a form of double taxation and is simply unfair . 
with permanent elimination of this tax , farmers and business owners will have the sense of security they need to plan for the financial future of their businesses , farms , or families . 
mr. speaker , i reserve the balance of my time . 
mr. speaker , i am pleased to yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from west virginia ( mrs. capito ) xz4000610 , a valuable member of the committee on rules . 
mr. speaker , i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from florida ( mr. putnam ) xz4003280 , a powerful member of the committee on rules . 
mr. speaker , i yield myself such time as i may consume to remind my colleagues that the rule that we are debating here to talk about the repeal of the death tax makes in order the substance of the subject that the gentleman from massachusetts talked about , the pomeroy substitute . 
mr. speaker , i yield myself the balance of my time . 
mr. speaker , this is not the first time that this body has addressed the issue of repealing or making permanent the death tax . 
in the 106th congress , on a bipartisan basis , with 279 votes in favor , this body voted in favor of permanently eliminating the death tax . 
unfortunately , in the reconciliation of trying to put the differences between the two houses together , we put the date of the 2011 when that would expire . 
mcgovern at the end of the resolution , add the following : sec . 
2. notwithstanding any other provision of this resolution , the amendment made in order under the first section of this resolution shall be modified by adding at the end the following new section : section __ . 
transfers to social security. & lt ; p & gt ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; ( a ) findings. -- congress hereby finds that -- & lt ; p & gt ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; ( 1 ) permanent repeal of the estate tax will cost $ 290 billion over the 10-year budget window , & lt ; p & gt ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; ( 2 ) this $ 290 billion understates the long-term cost of repeal -- in the last year of the budget window repeal of the estate tax will cost $ 70 billion , & lt ; p & gt ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; ( 3 ) in the next decade , the cost of repealing the estate tax together with the increased interest cost to the united states would be substantially above $ 1 trillion , & lt ; p & gt ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; ( 4 ) the enormous cost of repealing the estate tax would only benefit the wealthiest 0.3 percent of all families in the united states , & lt ; p & gt ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; ( 5 ) permanent repeal of the estate tax would result in a substantial reduction in income tax receipts , and could result in lower receipts in the social security trust funds because of that tax avoidance , & lt ; p & gt ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; ( 6 ) the provisions of this act would prevent the reduction in social security receipts that could result from permanent repeal and it would preserve funds necessary to meet commitments made to the social security system or other programs , & lt ; p & gt ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; ( 7 ) the provisions of this act provide immediate and substantial estate tax relief , exempting 99.7 percent of all estates from the estate tax , & lt ; p & gt ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; ( 8 ) the united states is faced with many other fiscal challenges , including the requirement to meet the commitments made through the social security system , and & lt ; p & gt ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; ( 9 ) the amounts saved by enacting this act as compared to permanent repeal -- & lt ; p & gt ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; ( a ) in the long run on an annual basis would equal the current costs of the operations in iraq , & lt ; p & gt ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; ( b ) could be used for improvements in veterans benefits , and & lt ; p & gt ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; ( c ) would close half of the shortfall faced by the social security system. & lt ; p & gt ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; ( b ) transfers to social security. -- section 201 of the social security act ( 42 u.s.c . 
401 ) is amended by adding at the end the following new subsection : & lt ; p & gt ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; `` ( o ) for purposes of ensuring that amounts are available to meet the commitments of the social security system , the secretary of the treasury shall , from time to time , transfer from the general fund in the treasury to the federal old-age and survivors insurance trust fund , the savings from the enactment of the certain and immediate estate tax relief act of 2005 as compared to the permanent repeal of the estate tax by the bill h.r. 8 ( as introduced in the 109th congress ) as follows : & lt ; p & gt ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; `` ( 1 ) for fiscal years 2010-2015 , the transfers in each year shall total for each fiscal year specified in the following table , the amount specified in connection with such fiscal year , as follows : & lt ; p & gt ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; amount & lt ; p & gt ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; `` fiscal year : & lt ; p & gt ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; transferred : & lt ; center & gt ; 2010 & lt ; /center & gt ; $ 6.1 billion & lt ; center & gt ; 3011 & lt ; /center & gt ; $ 35.4 billion & lt ; center & gt ; 2012 & lt ; /center & gt ; $ 39.4 billion & lt ; center & gt ; 2013 & lt ; /center & gt ; $ 42.7 billion & lt ; center & gt ; 2014 & lt ; /center & gt ; $ 47.9 billion & lt ; center & gt ; 2015 & lt ; /center & gt ; $ 50.5 billion . 
`` ( 2 ) for fiscal years beginning after september 30 , 2015 , the transfers in each year shall total the amount the secretary of the treasury determines to be the savings from the enactment of such act as compared to such permanent repeal of the estate tax. '' . & lt ; p & gt ; mr. speaker , i yield back the balance of my time , and i move the previous question on the resolution . 
mr. speaker , i rise today as a cosponsor of h.r. 8 and in support of this rule . 
but after years of payroll taxes and income taxes and sales taxes and property taxes , many businesses and farms just do not make it . 
and those that do , the government can step in and take over half of what they worked their entire life to build . 
now , mr. speaker , i grew up working on a farm , and i represent a large portion of rural east texas . 
and it is not fair that the federal government can step in and automatically inherit 55 percent of the family farm , a family business or a family nest egg . 
mr. speaker , i rise in strong support of legislation to bury the destructive death tax once and for all ; and i might mention that my personal experiences , even with my own family and others , has been just the opposite of the gentleman who just spoke before . 
four years ago , i joined with president bush and a majority of representatives and senators in an effort to enact into law historic tax relief legislation , including repeal of the death tax . 
consider that the heirs of those who pass away in 2010 will face no death tax whatsoever , while those whose families are unfortunate enough to pass away in 2011 or thereafter will face tax rates of up to 55 percent on their assets , forcing many of them to have to sell . 
mr. speaker , the death tax is , without question , one of the most destructive , counterproductive and unfair provisions of our tax code . 
i have been one of the few democrats in congress who has been willing to cross party lines to vote for tax cuts . 
with a war in iraq and looming postwar costs , increased expenses for domestic security and a ballooning budget deficit , congress must exercise restraint on both revenues and spending to prevent fiscal policy from spiraling out of control . 
the consensus in favor of balancing the budget over the long term must be re-established . 
there are a wide range of pressing national challenges that need action , from rapidly increasing health care costs , to our increasing dependence on ever-more-expensive foreign oil , to a broken and increasingly corrupt political system , and yet today we are passing a bill that will only help a few of the already wealthy . 
today we are debating total elimination of the federal inheritance tax . 
add in the interest costs of borrowing the funds to pay for this measure , and the true 10-year cost is nearly $ 1.3 trillion . 
according to representative pomeroy 's calculation , his package would exempt 99.68 percent of all estates from the estate tax , yet it would save the treasury $ 217 billion compared to total repeal . 
it is worth noting that the saving of $ 217 billion is equal to 40 percent of the shortfall of social security of the next 75 years . 
here we have another tax cut that is not being paid for , even as the bush administration and the leadership of this congress spend more than the american government has ever spent on homeland security and on all the other expenses of running the government -- especially the huge costs of the war in , and occupation of , iraq . 
government borrowing of this scale places the burden of repaying our debts on our children . 
they did not send us here so we can pass those decisions on to our children , and they certainly did not send us here to pass the cost of our decisions on to our children . 
i want the people of this country to realize that , right now , we owe collectively , about $ 4.5 trillion to foreign countries . 
japan holds $ 702 billion of our debt ; china , including hong kong , $ 246 billion ; the u.k . 
more tax cuts of this size will not only jeopardize critical public services now , but they will also hurt americans well into the future . 
i urge my colleagues to join me in supporting permanent reform of the estate tax , but not irresponsibly repealing it . 
government should follow the principle of helping the present generation and helping future generation as well -- not leaving future generations to pay our bill . 
mr. speaker , thank you for allowing me the opportunity to offer my remarks today regarding s. 256 , the so-called `` bankruptcy abuse prevention and consumer protection act. '' the issue of bankruptcy reform is extremely important and it is critical that we pass a measure that will both ensure greater personal responsibility of debtors , as well as ensure that credit card companies and other creditors take responsibility for their reckless lending . 
this bill will do nothing to reduce the number of bankruptcy filings or address the problem of record-high consumer debt , which now stands at $ 2 trillion . 
as to the substance of the legislation , it is no secret that the number of bankruptcies has risen dramatically over the past few years . 
according to the center for american progress , in 2003 there were a record number of 5.5 personal bankruptcy filings for every 1 , 000 people living in the united states . 
in 2003 , my own state of new jersey ranked slightly below the national average at 4.8 filings per every 1 , 000 residents . 
this past year , the number of personal bankruptcies had risen to 1 , 584 , 170 , an increase of over 13 percent . 
in my own state of new jersey , citizens have seen a similar increase in bankruptcy filing over the past three years . 
with those facts in mind , i strongly support the principle of increased personal responsibility of debt . 
while there are many problems with s. 256 , i 'll name just a few of the more egregious provisions to which i strongly object . 
while the bill purports to elevate the priority of child support payments , in reality credit card companies would receive repayment of debt at the same rate as child support obligations . 
the bill 's homestead-exemption cap does little to address the problem of wealthy debtors shielding their assets from creditors by purchasing million-dollar homes . 
the provision in the bill dealing with `` asset protection trusts '' also does not adequately address the problem of wealthy individuals stashing millions away the bill also imposes artificial deadlines and cumbersome new paperwork requirements on small businesses trying to reorganize , and it unnecessarily limits the discretion of bankruptcy judges in crafting the best possible result for small-business debtors and creditors . 
mr. speaker , i recognize that there have been , and likely continue to be , abuses of the bankruptcy law , which was designed to be a safety net . 
however , this should coincide with greater responsibility on the part of the creditors . 
it is the creditors who subsequently grant these individuals higher levels of credit at high interest rates . 
it is the creditors who saddle these individuals with insurmountable levels of debt . 
i believe we would be better served if we could fully debate the merits of this legislation , as well as substantive amendments that were disallowed from consideration by the full house . 
mr. speaker , i rise in opposition to h.r. 8 , legislation that unwisely imperils our nation 's financial security in order to advance the interests of an elite few . 
estate tax reform is extremely important for all the people in the 15th district of california . 
as a result , too many of my santa clara county constituents have been burdened by an estate tax that was originally written to affect only the very wealthiest americans . 
under this plan , 99.7 percent of all estates would have no estate tax liability . 
the republican majority has put forward a more expensive plan to benefit the three-tenths of one percent not covered by the democratic substitute . 
current income tax law provides for a `` step-up '' in the basis of an inherited asset to its fair market value at the time of decedent 's death . 
when the heir sells the asset , the capital gain for income tax purposes is measured by the difference between the heir 's selling price and the stepped-up basis of the asset . 
mr. speaker , today , the republican majority continues its assault on hardworking americans by ramming through the house of representatives bankruptcy legislation that harms even the most ethical among us . 
s. 256 , the bankruptcy abuse prevention and consumer protection act , purports to introduce a greater level of personal responsibility into the bankruptcy system by eliminating various loopholes and incentives that encourage consumer bankruptcy filings and abuse . 
the bill 's proponents argue that this kind of abuse is rampant , but expert analyses suggest another story . 
according to a harvard study , about 50 percent of all families that file for bankruptcy are forced to do so as a result of medical expenses , and three-quarters of those individuals actually have health insurance . 
the american bankruptcy institute estimates that no more than three percent of filers avoid repayment of debts by gaming the system . 
amendments to close loopholes for millionaires , discourage predatory lending , and cap interest on extension of credit were flatly rejected by the republican majority on the rules committee . 
reasonable bankruptcy reform may be necessary , but s. 256 is an abuse of the legislative process and a threat to the financial security of all americans . 
`` it would raise taxes for thousands of families and thousands of family farmers and small businesses . 
for years , house republicans have proclaimed that the elimination of the inheritance tax , a tax , now hear me on this side of the aisle , i know you want to hear this , a tax first proposed by theodore roosevelt in 1906 . 
now for those of you who may not be quite fully cognizant of our history , theodore roosevelt , of course , was a republican president of the united states of america . 
but , today , not according to the gentleman from maryland ( mr. hoyer ) xz4001890 , not according to the gentleman from north dakota ( mr. pomeroy ) xz4003230 , not according to all the democrats in this house or in the senate , according to the republican department of agriculture , i tell my friend from missouri , the republican department of agriculture says more farm estates would have increased tax liability from the carryover basis rules in this bill than would benefit from repeal of the inheritance tax . 
first of all , we do not have that complicated look-back to find out what the basis was 10 , 20 , 30 , 40 , 50 years ago . 
that means that 99.7 percent of the people in america would never pay an estate tax . 
so this argument , i tell my friend from missouri , is about the three-tenths of 1 percent of the very largest estates in america . 
i paid a little bit of alternative minimum tax this year . 
but there are a whole lot of people that are not doing nearly as well as we are doing , and we are not helping them at all by simply giving away revenue that we could spend on the education of their kids and the defense of their country , which we are borrowing for , of course , so that their kids will pay the debts . 
mr. speaker , under current law , the joint economic committee estimates that only 7 , 500 estates , in a nation of 290 million people where some 3 million people die every year , 7 , 500 estates out of the 3 million people that die would have any estate tax liability in 2009 . 
however , the permanent switch to carryover basis rules , rules that are used to calculate cap gains , would impact an estimated 71 , 000 additional estates , and many of those estates would face capital gains tax increases . 
there are a lot of taxes on all of us , and we have a lot of services in this country . 
but the fact of the matter is , i have three children , three daughters , they are wonderful people , and they provided me with three grandchildren . 
all of us are buying that . 
shoot , we are borrowing all the social security money right now that the republicans said they were not going to spend a nickel of . 
they are going to spend $ 170 billion of social security money this year alone . 
at a time of record budget deficits of nearly half a trillion dollars , this republican bill would cost nearly $ 1 trillion over the first 10 years of full repeal . 
we have given away trillions of dollars over the last 4 years as we go trillions of dollars into debt . 
as a matter of fact , $ 9 trillion into debt . 
it costs less than one-third of this republican bill . 
three-tenths of the estates would be left in 2009 and , as a result , exempt 99.7 percent of all estates from estate tax liability . 
it solves the problems of small farmers , it solves the problems of small businesses , it solves the problems of pretty significant but nevertheless smaller estates , to make sure that the hard work of mom and dad can be passed along to their daughter and their son and their son 's and daughter 's families . 
mr. speaker , pursuant to house resolution 202 , i call up the bill ( h.r. 8 ) to make the repeal of the estate tax permanent , and ask for its immediate consideration . 
mr. speaker , i appreciate the fact that we are here today poised to pass h.r. 8 , the death tax repeal permanency act of 2005 . 
on behalf of the lead democratic sponsor , my colleague , the gentleman from alabama ( mr. cramer ) xz4000840 , as well as the over 200 bipartisan members who have co-sponsored this bill , i am pleased that we are poised to pass in this body this commonsense legislation . 
i would like to talk about a couple of constituents , particularly a constituent named howard effert who is a resident of columbia , missouri , who in 1965 began a lumber yard business there in columbia . 
he had the idea and a desire for a new venture even though many within the community felt this venture would be unsuccessful , but yet his partners helped him provide the financial assistance and of course some valuable mentoring to help him open the doors to this lumber business . 
his two sons , brad and greg , are running the day-to-day operations of the business . 
of course , they want this family business that has been in their family since its modest beginnings in 1965 to be able to be passed on pursuant to the american dream , that is , to create a legacy , to help your children be better off than you were . 
yet the effert family today , mr. speaker , has to write a check for $ 1 , 000 a week , $ 52 , 036 to be precise , to purchase a term life insurance policy , the proceeds of which will be to pay the federal government on that inevitable day that howard effert passes from this world to the next . 
in 2001 we passed historic legislation that let all income tax payers keep a little bit more of what they earned , and this historic legislation included a repeal of the federal death tax which was a top tax priority for a lot of small business and family farm groups . 
now , this quirk in the law can be directly attributed to the senate 's byrd rule , which applies to the consideration of reconciliation bills . 
as a matter of basic fairness , we must permanently repeal the death tax . 
the death of a family member quite simply should not be a taxable event . 
conversely , the tax forces taxpayers to engage in a host of economically inefficient activities to avoid the very punitive nature of the tax . 
with a tax like the death tax , a family business or farm has no choice but to divert these precious resources , as in the case of the effert family , to plan financially for the financial impact for the tax : money that could be used to expand the business , to purchase a forklift , to bring another person on the payroll , whatever is in the best interest of that business . 
instead , this money is diverted in anticipation of this very punitive tax . 
now , supporters of retaining the death tax will claim that perhaps redistribution of income promotes economic fairness and social responsibility . 
instead of rewarding savings and investment , this tax actually rewards those who spend lavishly and leave no ongoing business interest or assets to the next generation . 
i am mindful of the bumper sticker that i saw recently traveling missouri 's highways on a big recreational vehicle that says `` i am spending my children 's inheritance. '' if you wanted to give some good estate tax advice to someone that has put together some assets to pass along , it would be simply to consume it . 
yet as we talk about some sort of tax reform and perhaps a consumption tax , this tax actually focuses on non-consumption and on thrift and savings . 
for that and for a variety of reasons , we will have the opportunity , i hope , in a good debate , in a civil discourse . 
mr. speaker , i reserve the balance of my time . 
mr. speaker , a lot of individuals have worked on h.r. 8 , and i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from california ( mr. herger ) xz4001760 , one of those individuals . 
the bill , h.r. 8 , actually does allow for a step up in basis of $ 3 million for a surviving spouse and another $ 1.3 million for surviving heirs . 
if the intent of the legislation , which it is , is to help family businesses be passed from one generation to the next and the surviving heirs choose not to farm or continue the family business , then they are the ones making the taxable decision to dispose of assets that would be subject to a 15 percent capital gains rate but certainly not the 45 percent estate tax . 
mr. speaker , i am pleased to yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from the great state of missouri ( mr. blunt ) xz4000340 a colleague of mine , the majority whip . 
mr. speaker , among the many groups that support h.r. 8 , including the national federation of independent business , which is the voice of small business , there are many minority owners of small businesses that also support complete repeal . 
mr. speaker , i would remind the gentleman from massachusetts ( mr. neal ) xz4002910 as he mentions iraq and afghanistan that the budgetary impact of h.r. 8 is really not felt until the year 2011 and beyond . 
mr. speaker , i yield myself such time as he may consume to the gentleman from alabama ( mr. cramer ) xz4000840 , my cosponsor of h.r. 8 . 
mr. speaker , i reserve the balance of my time . 
mr. speaker , i yield myself the balance of my time . 
mr. speaker , i appreciate in large measure the tone of the debate . 
what i would say to the gentlewoman who just spoke and to others who raised the red herring of social security is to remind folks , first of all , the federal receipts from the federal death tax represent less than 1.5 percent of all revenues , first of all ; and , secondly , that none of the income tax money generated from the estate tax goes to social security for the trust funds , and eliminating the tax in no way will affect or impact current social security benefits . 
if you stopped for a cup of coffee , you paid a sales tax . 
and , of course , when you are at work , your wages are subject to a payroll tax that does go into social security , payroll taxes that do pay for medicare , not to mention your income taxes . 
and , yes , if you scrape and invest and save and you build a family business , have the audacity to pursue the american dream , the federal government is there with its hand out saying give us 45 percent of the value of your family business . 
well , then let me tell you a very quick personal story , a story of a farm family in missouri , a young married couple who in 1956 left portageville , missouri , in the district of the gentlewoman from missouri ( mrs. emerson ) xz4001210 , with $ 1 , 000 in their pocket , and that was going to be the stake that they had . 
that married couple happened to be my parents , and over the last 2 1/2 years i have had the unfortunate reality that obviously death is inevitable , and i have had the unfortunate experience in our family of having both my father pass away in late 2002 and my mother one year ago . 
now we did not have to pay the tax , but 14 days ago i had the requirement of filling out the form and paying the $ 2 , 000 accountant fee ; and , again , i do not quarrel with that . 
but , mr. speaker , the death of a family member should not be a taxable event , period . 
it would be the american taxpayers ' money , who are probably , even as we speak , trying to grapple with those forms as they have tax day coming , as the income tax payers of america that provide for the comfortable living that he and i enjoy . 
mr. speaker , i would say to my friend , and of course , as we have had a lot of unforeseen circumstances that have occurred , as was mentioned earlier , iraq and afghanistan . 
but i would say to my friend , and i appreciate the question , but he also mentioned the department of agriculture , and lest , mr. speaker , anyone wonder who those agricultural groups are that represent farm families across america , i would place into the record a letter from said groups . 
in essence , the letter reads as follows : the groups listed below support permanent estate tax repeal , ask for this body to vote for h.r. 8 , and the letter goes on to say , individuals and families own virtually all of the farms and ranches that dot america 's rural landscape . 
death taxes threaten the transfer of these operations to the next generation of food and fiber producers . 
sincerely , alabama farmers federation , american farm bureau federation , american sheep industry association , the american soybean association , farm credit council , national association of wheat growers ; to my friend from north dakota , national cattlemen 's beef association , national corn growers association , national cotton council , national grain sorghum producers , national milk producers federation , national potato council , usa rice producers federation , u.s. rice producers association , and the western peanut growers association . 
dear representative : the groups listed below support permanent estate tax repeal and ask you to vote for h.r. 8 , the death tax repeal permanency act of 2005 . 
individuals and families own virtually all of the farms and ranches that dot america 's rural landscape . 
death taxes threaten the transfer of these operations to the next generation of food and fiber producers . 
sincerely , mr. speaker , to my friend from south carolina , i am not sure if any of those groups happen to represent farm families in his district , but i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from south carolina ( mr. barrett ) xz4000160 . 
mr. speaker , the gentleman just indicated that the pomeroy substitute solves the problem once and for all , and i have listened to a number of individuals on the other side during the course of this discussion that this is only going to affect the superwealthy and that really there are no family businesses that are affected by the estate tax . 
it has been interesting , because some of those comments have come from colleagues of mine on the committee on ways and means . 
mr. speaker , we have had a number of hearings going back to at least , from my memory , 1997 . 
so i will mention some of these folks who have come and testified in front of the committee on ways and means . 
martin whalen testified about his family-owned and -operated company , etline foods corporation , a distributor of food service products in york , pennsylvania . 
several parcels of land in south dakota were liquidated in order to pay the federal tax . 
what about roger hannay of hannay reels , incorporated , a small manufacturer in the foothills of the catskill mountains about 25 miles from albany , new york , a small manufacturer employing 150 employees ? 
each of these testified , mr. speaker , that they were impacted negatively by the existence of the death tax . 
what about carol loop , jr. , president of luke 's nursery and greenhouses , a wholesale plant nursery operation in jacksonville , florida ? 
or christopher and kimberly clements of golden eagle distributors in tucson , arizona . 
he lost his life at the age of 58 . 
or jeannine mizell , a third-generation owner of mizell lumber and hardware company of kensington , maryland . 
their family had to shut down a facility in north carolina , laying off two-thirds of the 110 employees to pay the estate tax . 
or jack cakebread , founder of cakebread cellars in napa valley , california . 
would each of these individuals be solved or their estate problems solved by the substitute ? 
it is a rhetorical question , and the gentleman from north dakota ( mr. pomeroy ) xz4003230 knows it , and i do not mean to put him on the spot , but he can not answer the question because when we draw a line , an arbitrary line , wherever we draw that line , we still are going to have those entrepreneurs that have been willing to invest in their businesses , hire employees , build local communities ; and as long as the death tax remains in existence , they are going to have to do some sort of estate planning . 
mr. speaker , i reserve the balance of my time . 
as the gentleman from north dakota recognizes ; and , again , i do not think he meant to misspeak , but the underlying bill , h.r. 8 , does provide a step up in basis of $ 3 million for the surviving spouse and a $ 1.3 million step up in basis for surviving heirs . 
mr. speaker , many have worked on the death tax repeal and going back even to the , i think , family heritage preservation act of 1993 . 
now , of course , we are over 200 on permanent repeal . 
mr. speaker , notwithstanding the gentleman 's props , i would commend to him for his reading leisurely `` the economics of the estate tax : an update , '' a joint economic committee study dated june 2003 which in essence states the estate tax raises very little , if any , net revenue because of distortionary effects of the estate resulting in income tax losses roughly the same size as the revenue collected . 
secondly , estate taxes force the development of environmentally sensitive land . 
through 2001 , 2.6 million acres of forest land were harvested and 1.3 million acres were sold every year to raise funds to pay the estate tax . 
regarding his criticism on philanthropy , the estate tax according to the joint economic committee study , the estate tax may actually be one of the greatest obstacles to charitable giving as estate taxes crowd out charitable bequests . 
mr. speaker , i reserve the balance of my time . 
mr. speaker , i yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from washington ( miss mcmorris ) , a newly elected member from the state of washington . 
mr. speaker , i appreciate the opportunity to address the house today on this very important piece of legislation , the repeal of the death tax and making it permanent . 
the repeal of the death tax is one of the first bills that i was honored to place my name on as a cosponsor . 
one of my top priorities in congress is to grow jobs and expand the economy in the pacific northwest . 
i believe that the repeal of the death tax will help accomplish this goal , especially for the farmers and small businesses in my district . 
the death tax costs thousands of jobs each year ; and by repealing this unnecessary tax , jobs will be created and many small business owners will be able to add workers to their payrolls . 
when farms and ranches shut down , so do the businesses they support , leaving many out of work and leading to a depressed rural economy . 
i support the passage of h.r. 8 in order to end this unjust , unfair , and inefficient tax burden on our families , businesses and especially our farming communities . 
mr. speaker , i yield myself the balance of the time . 
let me first say , mr. speaker , how much i appreciate my friend from north dakota as we have done this in a number of sessions of congress , and i appreciate the tone , and he is a friend of mine , and i have a lot of respect for him and the intent with which he comes to this debate . 
let me answer a couple of points that have been raised in particular , first of all , about the tax simplification . 
tax day is 2 days away , and i am sure taxpayers , in particular small businesses and family farmers , would appreciate anything that we can do to simplify our tax laws , and i would submit that permanent repeal of the death tax does just that . 
in fact , h.r. 8 is one simple paragraph , and it reads as follows : `` section 901 of the economic growth and tax relief reconciliation act of 2001 shall not apply to title v of such act. '' basically , we repeal the sunset . 
the reason that we are here is because of complicated and arcane senate budget rules , called the byrd rule , that we phase out the death tax for one single year . 
in 2010 , it magically disappears , and then on january 1 of 2011 it springs back to life , and the uncertainty , how would one as an estate planner advise a client when the tax is gone today and comes back again in the very next year ? 
so when one is talking about simplification , what better simplification would there be than ripping these pages dealing with the estate tax completely out of the internal revenue code ? 
lastly , when it comes down to the nuts and bolts of it , whether or not the pomeroy substitute , and again , in the effort to pursue the american dream , whether those businesses are going to be shielded by the pomeroy substitute or not shielded , the fact is that as long as the tax is on the books , as long as congress draws some line in the sand , and that is all we are doing with the substitute , is just some arbitrary line , we are still going to have those family businesses that are going to be taking some of their resources and these convoluted schemes , legal , but efforts to avoid the tax . 
i mean , this is the land of opportunity , is it not ? 
i would submit to my colleagues that the billionaires and the top of the fortune 500 lists , those folks have a stable full of lawyers and accountants to create this intricate estate plan to thwart the estate tax . 
the gentleman from illinois ( mr. emanuel ) xz4001200 , again a colleague of mine on the committee on ways and means , said , why are not we debating real reform ? 
interestingly , there is a lot of discussion . 
there is a lot of talk about the consumption tax , and yet it is notable that , while there may be support for the idea of a general consumption tax , the death tax , by contrast , is a tax on nonconsumption . 
in fact , if you are looking at your 1040 right now , look at line eight because it says if you have been thrifty and you are able to generate a little interest income , guess what , uncle sam says put this amount here because we are going to take our bite of the apple . 
permanent repeal of the death tax actually rewards virtue . 
people who die with large amounts of wealth have done three good things for society . 
they have exercised their talents , rather than living a life of leisure . 
they have saved , contributing to a common pool of capital whose benefits manifest , for example , in lower interest rates , inure to all . 
and they have refrained from spending all of their wealth on themselves. '' in fact , professor mccaffrey across the capitol some years ago i think before the senate finance committee said , to paraphrase scripture , the reason he changed his mind , i was blind but now i see . 
if this comes from an unrequited liberal that the estate tax , the death tax , is a bad tax , then i would suggest to all of my colleagues here that it is time to permanently and completely repeal the tax . 
finally , i would say to my friend again , because there has been some discussion about creating a new tax , as the gentleman knows , the intent of h.r. 8 , the underlying bill , is to help make it easier to pass a family business from one generation to the next . 
as we have heard from nonpartisan groups , 70 percent of family businesses do not make it to a second generation , 87 percent of family businesses do not make it to a third generation , and often the reason cited is because of this very confiscatory punitive tax called the death tax . 
the fact is that under h.r. 8 , if it were to pass and become the law of the land , the tax rate imposed at death on a lifetime of work and thrift is zero percent . 
if a surviving heir chooses not to farm and then makes the conscious decision to dispose of assets , then that is a taxable event , but that is a purposeful decision made by the heirs of that family business owner . 
it is not the federal government requiring the death of a family member to be a taxable event . 
so i would simply say to all of my colleagues that death should not be a taxable event , period . 
under the underlying bill of h.r. 8 , it would no longer be a taxable event . 
that is why prominent organizations such as the chamber of commerce , national federation of independent business , american farm bureau federation and a host of other small business coalition members , representing the interest of small businesses and family farms across the country , support h.r. 8 and oppose my friend from north dakota 's substitute . 
mr. speaker , i yield back the balance of my time . 
mr. speaker , i think it is important as we debate this question that the opponents of this bill not be defined or classified as opposing responsibility and opposing the responsibility of being a good citizen and adhering to the debt that you accrue . 
i think that is a wrong-headed definition of the opponents . 
but i think it is important for the american people to understand that we are engaging in a democratic process to be able to allow a voice of opposition to be heard for a tainted , stale and stagnant piece of legislation that has been bought and paid for by special interests . 
our desire is to possibly encourage our colleagues in the house to take a serious and deliberative review of s. 256 . 
someone said that there was a tax refund a couple of years ago , $ 350 , $ 400 . 
we are in the depth almost of a deficit that is about to stagnate and stifle us . 
so let me suggest to you as i look at the medical conditions , i would ask my colleagues on the other side of the aisle does their stale old bill , this stack of old papers respond to the medical causes of bankruptcy that shows that because there is death in the family , illness or injury , people who go try to repay their bills and they fall into bankruptcy and this old stale 1998 bill does not respond to that . 
testimony of elizabeth warren before the senate committee on the judiciary my name is elizabeth warren . 
as some of you know , i have followed this issue with interest for some time . 
even if it had been a flawless piece of legislation then , and it surely was not , the events of the past eight years have dramatically changed the economic and social environment in which you must consider this bill . 
while the actual number of consumer bankruptcy cases has declined slightly in the past year , many of the largest corporate bankruptcy cases in american history have occurred since the senate last reevaluated the bankruptcy laws , and some of those cases are already legend for the corporate scandals that accompanied them . 
companies in chapter 11 that cancel pension plans and health benefits , leaving thousands of families economically devastated . 
companies that continue to pay executives and insiders tens of millions of dollars , while they demand concessions from their creditors . 
military families targeted for payday loans at 400 % interest , insurance scams , and other forms of financial chicanery . 
scandals have rocked the so-called non-profit credit counseling industry , exposing how tens of thousands of consumers struggling desperately to pay their bills and not file for bankruptcy were cheated . 
sub-prime mortgage companies , financed by some of the best names in american banking , have unlawfully taken millions of dollars from homeowners , then fled to the bankruptcy courts to protect their insiders and bank lenders . 
we now know : one million men and women each year are turning to bankruptcy in the aftermath of a serious medical problem -- and three-quarters of them have health insurance . 
unlike eight years ago , we need not have a theoretical debate about the homestead exemption because we have had example after example of abuse tied directly to the failure of american companies . 
millions of jobs have been lost but not the florida and texas fortunes of their corporate executives . 
unlike eight years ago , we need not have a theoretical debate about the effects of the proposed legislation on small business . 
the time-lines in s. 256 would have denied reorganization to more than a third of the small businesses that eventually saved themselves -- destroying value for the companies , their creditors , their employees and their communities . 
for the first time ever , congress would pass a law that says companies like enron and worldcom do n't have to file extra forms , enron and worldcom do n't have to schedule meetings with the office of the united states trustee , and enron and worldcom do n't have to meet fixed deadlines that a judge can not waive for any reason -- but every troubled small business in the chapter 11 system would have to file those papers , undergo that supervision and meet those deadlines or be unlike eight years ago , we need not have a theoretical debate about the economic impact of bankruptcies on credit card company profits . 
minors -- under 18 years of age -- with no incomes and no credit history are now described as an `` emerging market '' for the credit industry . 
some courts have demanded that credit card companies disclose how much of their claims are the amounts actually borrowed and how much are fees , penalties and interest . 
with increased fees and universal default clauses that drive up interest rates even for customers paying on time , a growing number of people have no option but to declare bankruptcy . 
the means test in this bill , section 102 , has been one of its most controversial provisions . 
the bill increases the cost of bankruptcy protection for every family , regardless of income or the cause of financial crisis , and it decreases the protection of bankruptcy for every family , regardless of income or the cause of financial crisis . 
there are provisions that will make chapter 13 impossible for many of the debtors who would file today , provisions that make it easier than ever to abuse the unlimited homestead provisions in some states and yet at the same time hurt people with more modest homesteads in those same states . 
other provisions will compromise the privacy of millions of families by putting their entire tax returns in the court files and potentially on the internet , making them easy prey for identity thieves . 
women trying to collect alimony or child support will more often be forced to compete with credit card companies that can have more of their debts declared non-dischargeable . 
a family driven to bankruptcy by the increased costs of caring for an elderly parent with alzheimer 's disease is treated the same as someone who maxed out his credit cards at a casino . 
a mother who works two jobs and who can not manage the prescription drugs needed for a child with diabetes is treated the same as someone who charged a bunch of credit cards with only a vague intent to repay . 
do not enact a proposal written for 1997 when the problems of the american corporate economy in 1997 deserve far more attention and the problems of the american middle class can no longer be ignored . 
mr. speaker , as i stated with respect to the consideration of the rule , today is a sad day for america , its elderly , its veterans , its bereaved , and its aspirants for a second chance . 
this 512-page legislation before the committee of the whole simply falls far short of its purported goal of ensuring that every debtor repay as much of her debt as she can reasonably afford . 
the bill 's sponsor has said that bankruptcy has become a system `` where deadbeats can get out of paying their debt scott-free , while honest americans who play by the rules have to foot the bill. '' given the economic gap as evidenced by the predominance of african american and hispanic bankruptcy filers , it is clear that these minorities are viewed as the `` deadbeats '' of society . 
according to the democratic platform : `` the heart of the american promise has always been the middle class , the greatest engine of economic growth the world has ever known . 
the bankruptcy bill , as it stands , has the potential to crush the dreams and futures of the vast majority of americans . 
do you know that currently , more that 1 of every 100 adults in america files bankruptcy each year ? 
research shows that approximately 50 percent of all families are forced to file bankruptcy due to medical expenses ; and other 40 percent of families file bankruptcy due to divorce , job loss or death in the family . 
african americans are also twice as likely to lose their homes due to foreclosures , often falling victim to the unscrupulous practices of predatory lenders . 
furthermore , african americans consistently have higher levels of debt . 
in a study of african american families , the typical family had debt of 30 percent of its assets , while the debt of the typical white family was 11 percent of its assets . 
the process by which this bankruptcy bill has made its way to the floor of the house frustrates both the notion of democracy and of representative government . 
i offered amendments to the bill that included : ( 1 ) closing a new loophole that threatens to undermine the comprehensive scheme to compensate victims of nuclear accidents , which congress enacted long ago in the price-anderson act ( paa ) ; ( 2 ) increasing the amount of tuition expenses allowed under the chapter 7 means test ; and ( 3 ) precluding the discharge of debt arising out of suits against sex offenses ; ( 4 ) striking the means test ; and ( 5 ) supporting an amendment by my colleague mr. schiff to offer relief to those who are victims of identity theft . 
chairman mel watt offered substantive amendments including one that would protect consumers from predatory lending tactics , and another that would seek to protect the credit of college students . 
similarly , representative bobby scott offered amendments that included proposals to allow debt to be discharged when bankruptcy is caused by unforeseen medical expenses or by the death of a spouse . 
however , the republican majority did not accept the amendments , and therefore ignored the issues advocated by my constituents and those of my seventeen democratic colleagues . 
the republican leadership of the judiciary committee passed this measure without consideration of a single amendment that was offered by my democratic colleagues and me . 
they effectively shut democrats out of the markup process and thereby ignored the voices of the people 's representatives on this very serious policy matter . 
clearly , the majority has priorities that do not protect americans who are victims of circumstances that have nothing to do with creditworthiness . 
of the amendments that my democratic colleagues and i plan to offer ( for our upcoming consideration ) before the house is one that would remove the chapter 7 `means test ' . 
this would sift out debtors who can afford to repay at least a portion of their debts from those who can not . 
the egregious provisions of this bankruptcy bill and its name are not unlike many recent bills that have sifted through committee and onto the house floor . 
banks , credit card companies , and retailers have accounted for more than $ 24.8 million of campaign and partisan contributions since 1999 . 
commercial banks have given some $ 76.2 million , according to a study of campaign finance and lobbying disclosure reports and the center for responsive politics . 
in fact , according to the new york times , `` the main lobbying forces for the bill -- a coalition that included visa , mastercard , the american bankers association , mbna america , capital one , citicorp , the ford motor credit company and the general motors acceptance corporation -- spent more than $ 40 million in political fund-raising efforts and many millions more on lobbying efforts since 1989. '' clearly , the republican majority has shut democrats out of the process in order to appease these special interest groups -- to the detriment of middle-class and elderly americans . 
as an african american , i am troubled by the fact that both african american and hispanic families , both of whom are over-represented in bankruptcy , would suffer disproportionately if this bill becomes law . 
proponents of this bankruptcy bill suggest that it will put pressure only on the families that have the ability to repay . 
in fact , the weight of the evidence demonstrates that this legislation will increase the cost of bankruptcy for every family , and decrease the protection of bankruptcy for every family , regardless of income or the cause of financial crisis . 
the bill contains provisions that will force many honest debtors unnecessarily out of chapter 7 , make chapter 13 impossible for many of the debtors who file today , protect significant loopholes for wealthy and well-advised debtors , as well as raise the cost of the system for all parties . 
it will turn the government into a private collection agency for large creditors , and force women trying to collect child support or alimony to compete with credit card companies that will have more of their debts declared non-dischargeable . 
the ability to file for bankruptcy relief and to receive a fresh start is a source of hope for a number of american families that suffer the burden of financial problems . 
it will make it virtually impossible for many families to extricate themselves from a web of high interest debt -- and kill the dream of these families to become homeowners . 
mr. speaker , i reject this legislation not only because it is flawed in and of itself but also because the process by which it is being considered is severely flawed . 
mr. speaker , benjamin franklin noted over 200 years ago that `` in this world nothing can be said to be certain , except death and taxes. '' unfortunately , the convergence of these two inescapable events , in the form of the federal estate tax , results in a number of destructive outcomes in terms of slower economic growth , reduced social mobility , and wasted productive activity . 
for these reasons , among others , i urge my colleagues to join with me in support of permanent repeal of the federal estate tax . 
in three of those instances ( 1797-1802 , 1862-70 , and 1898-1902 ) , the estate tax was repealed shortly thereafter . 
other supporters of the estate tax point to the $ 22 billion in tax revenues for 2003 , or to the incentive for charitable bequests . 
nonetheless , there are many reasons to question the value of taxing the accumulated savings of productive , entrepreneurial citizens . 
not the least of these reasons is the widely-held belief that families who work hard and accumulate savings should not be punished for sound budgeting . 
additionally , it is unclear whether the estate tax raises any revenue at all , since most if not all of its receipts are offset by losses under the income tax . 
the freedom to attain prosperity and accumulate wealth is the basis of the `` american dream. '' we are taught that through hard work we can achieve that dream and , god willing , pass it on to our children . 
the current tax treatment of a person 's life accumulations is so onerous that when one dies , the children are often forced to turn over half of their inheritance to the federal government . 
this is tragically wrong and nullifies the hard work of those who have passed on . 
in the minority community there are numerous examples of the injurious effects of the estate tax . 
the chicago daily defender -- the oldest african american-owned daily newspaper in the united states -- is a good example of the unique problem presented for minority families . 
but , beyond that , the questions were -- was the chicago defender family forced to sell , could a minority owner be found to purchase it , or would it become a white-owned asset , reducing the overall wealth of the african american community ? 
on a smaller scale , another potential victim , a storeowner named leonard l. harris who is a first generation owner of chatham food center on the south side of chicago is frightened that all the work and value he has put into his business will be for naught because it will be stripped from his two sons . 
for this reason , cash resources to pay federal estate taxes , based on the way valuation is made , would force my family to sell the store in order to pay the irs within 9 months of my death . 
our yearly earnings would not cover the payment of such a high tax . 
according to the life insurance marketing research association , less than half of all family-owned businesses survive the death of a founder and only about 5 percent survive to the third generation . 
another recent study found the following : eight out of ten minority business owners questioned believe the federal estate tax is unfair . 
only one minority business owner in three has been able to take any steps whatsoever to prepare for the ramifications of the estate tax . 
one in four believes that his or her heirs will be forced to sell off at least part of their businesses to pay the estate tax liability . 
many of my colleagues who are proponents of the estate tax contend that the tax adds progressivity to the tax code and provides needed tax revenue . 
they argue that the estate tax falls on wealthier and higher income individuals and increases the total tax paid by this segment of the population relative to their income . 
this helps offset the regressivity of payroll taxes and excise taxes , which fall more heavily on low-income groups relative to their income . 
they also argue that increasing the unified credit to $ 4 , $ 5 , $ 6 or $ 7 million would remove small family-owned businesses and farms from the harsh impact of the estate tax . 
however , i find these arguments in support of the estate tax unconvincing in the face of substantial evidence otherwise . 
first , there is no clear evidence that the estate tax is progressive or that larger estates are paying a greater portion of the tax . 
wealthier members of our society are able to reduce and or eliminate the impact of the estate tax by stuffing money away here and there at the suggestion of high-priced attorneys and accountants . 
similarly , tax planning techniques such as gift tax exclusions or valuation discounts reduce the size of the gross estate but do not appear in the irs data causing effective tax rates to be overstated for many larger estates . 
the institute for policy innovation recently revealed evidence of this fact in a study showing that the effective tax rate on the most valuable estates was actually lower than that on medium-sized estates . 
second , the insignificant amount of money the estate tax raises for the federal government can not justify the harmful effects it has on business owners who spend more to avoid the tax than the federal tax revenue raised . 
this represents less than 1.1 percent of the total revenues out of a more than $ 2 trillion federal budget and less than the amount of money spent complying with , or trying to circumvent , the death tax . 
and , when one calculates the amount of money spent on complying with the tax , the number of lost jobs resulting from businesses being sold , or the resources directed away from business expansion and into estate planning , it is clear why this punitive tax must be eliminated . 
according to a study of estate tax repeal proposals , which was prepared by dr . 
allen sinai for american council for capital formation and center for policy research , federal tax receipts would rise in response to a stronger economy , feeding back 20 cents of every dollar of estate tax reduction . 
finally , it is not clear that increasing the unified credit to $ 6 or $ 7 million would remove small family-owned businesses and farms from the threat of the estate tax . 
the small business administration 's definition of a small business is based on industry size standards . 
thus , families who build their businesses past the exemption amount will continue to face estate taxes that range from the aforementioned , alarming rate of 45 to 47 percent . 
more significantly , without significant reform or , more appropriately , repeal , these same small businesses face the prospect of estate tax rates as high as 60 percent beginning in 2011 . 
permanent repeal of the estate tax will provide american families with fairness in our tax system and remove the perverse incentive that makes it is cheaper for an individual to sell the business prior to death and pay the individual capital gains rate than pass it on to heirs . 
the title of this bill is a misnomer . 
not only were members of the house prevented from engaging in debate but also the american people have been denied the opportunity to hear legitimate debate regarding this act we are considering today . 
my review of s. 256 compels me to conclude that the framers of the bill failed or refused to recognize that recent economic policies by the current administration have directly contributed to the proliferation of bankruptcy filings by consumers . 
burgeoning deficits , perpetual and high unemployment , and the exportation of jobs overseas are just a few of the by-products of failed and poorly conceived government policies that have contributed and continue to contribute to the need for individuals to seek bankruptcy protection . 
democrats were denied the opportunity to offer amendments , the american people have been denied a full opportunity to determine the full implications of the changes in bankruptcy law , and the act is fundamentally anticonsumer . 
this is wrong and we should be working to stop those who take advantage of the bankruptcy laws . 
however , i worry s. 256 will hurt the thousands of americans who have absolutely no choice but to file bankruptcy as a last resort . 
the numerous activations and extended tours of duty in iraq and afghanistan are causing our military families to face debt and serious financial strain . 
studies show that the incomes of military , families decrease significantly when the service member is deployed . 
four out of 10 reservists , for example , take a drop in pay once they are deployed overseas . 
some military families will have no choice but to file for bankruptcy because of the environment we have created for them . 
the bankruptcy reform bill before us today does not address the needs of our military families and the realities they are facing . 
s. 256 will make it harder for military families to recover from a bankruptcy because of the additional costs and the stricter requirements . 
the senate did include provisions exempting military personnel serving in combat from certain provisions of the bill . 
but , unfortunately , the financial impact of an extended deployment could remain long after the service member returns home to his family . 
mr. speaker , i rise today in strong support of making estate tax relief permanent so that family-owned farms and businesses can be passed down from generation to generation . 
the estate tax should be updated and modernized to reflect both the economic growth many americans have experienced in recent years , and the hard work of millions of entrepreneurs and those just trying to make a living . 
the united states is the land of opportunity , encouraging free enterprise and rewarding entrepreneurs . 
the estate tax should be modified to protect family-owned small businesses and family farms from the threat of having to be sold just to pay the tax . 
but , mr. speaker , h.r. 8 would fully repeal the estate tax for all americans at a time when the administration is running record deficits that threaten the futures of our children 's children . 
as we all know , the estate tax applies to fewer than 2 percent of all estates , about 50 , 000 a year . 
this meaningful , common-sense bill will exempt 99.7 percent of all estates from the estate tax . 
under current law , the tax basis for inherited property is `` stepped up '' to its value at transfer through 2009 , which helps farmers and small business owners who inherit property by reducing the amount of capital gains taxes to which the property is subject . 
mr. speaker , i rise today in support of this legislation because the current system needs reform to protect those people truly in need of debt relief , while holding accountable those who can repay their debt . 
i believe bankruptcy should be a last resort -- one that allows people who need protection to receive it and people who can repay all or some of their debts to do so . 
the system in place now gives incentives to people in trouble and encourages them to steamroll headfirst into chapter 7 liquidation of all their debts , even when they could get back on their feet through a reasonable repayment plan or basic credit counseling . 
while s. 256 is not a perfect bill , i do believe it goes great lengths in addressing the growing problem of bankruptcy in this country . 
however , millionaires who use bankruptcy law as a method of financial planning will no longer be able to buy extravagantly and subsequently have all of their debt written off . 
it is also important to note that many families and small businesses will benefit because of changes to this law . 
bankruptcy costs are passed on to other consumers , and the average family pays hundreds of dollars each year in higher prices . 
additionally , small businesses that might otherwise not be paid for their goods or services will have a better chance of gaining compensation as a result of this bill . 
a very positive aspect of s. 256 is that it makes permanent chapter 12 of the bankruptcy code . 
i , along with other members of congress , have been working for years to make permanent this much-needed source of relief for our family farmers . 
there have been accusations that this bill will be detrimental to the most needy ; in fact , there are a great deal of safeguards . 
additionally , families who have exorbitant medical bills they can not afford can still file for chapter 7 , and judges will still have a great deal of discretion when it comes to the issue of means-testing . 
with an over-reliance on credit cards and a lack of saving for retirement , too many americans find themselves on shaky financial ground . 
it helps prevent abuse of the system while providing debt protection to those who truly need it . 
mr. speaker , i am proud to vote in favor of s. 256 , the bankruptcy abuse prevention and consumer protection act of 2005 . 
the legislation reduces the unfair disparity of treatment in the bankruptcy system by establishing more uniform and predictable standards . 
patients are given a voice through the appointment of an ombudsman , who advocates for the confidentiality of patients ' records and ensures patients are transferred to appropriate facilities . 
these are critical provisions that protect the rights of those with failing health . 
i would like to commend a constituent from my district for his contributions to this legislation , keith j. shapiro , esq. , of northbrook , illinois , and his colleague nancy a. peterman , esq . 
mr. shapiro testified in support of these patient health provisions before the u.s. senate committee on the judiciary subcommittee on administrative oversight and the courts on june 1 , 1998 . 
the passing of this legislation marks the culmination of mr. shapiro and ms. peterman 's tireless efforts to protect patients ' interests in bankruptcy cases . 
on behalf of my colleagues in congress , i offer my sincere gratitude for their dedication to fair bankruptcy policy . 
mr. speaker , after eight years of intense congressional scrutiny and debate , this long-overdue legislation is now close to becoming law . 
i will vote in favor of this legislation , just as i have supported similar bills in the past , and i encourage my colleagues to pass s. 256 without amendments so it can go directly to the president for his signature . 
under current law , it is far too easy for debtors with significant cash resources to declare bankruptcy and walk away from their debts , even when they have the ability to pay a substantial portion of those debts . 
bankruptcies cost the rest of us american taxpayers billions of dollars each year . 
because commercial institutions have to pass their losses on to everyone else in the form of higher prices and higher interest rates . 
the bankruptcy abuse prevention and consumer protection act is a well-balanced measure that will permit people with real financial need to get a fresh start , but lessen the burden placed on other working americans who now must support people who are taking advantage of the system . 
the bill also makes common-sense revisions to homestead exemptions to reduce the ability of a wealthy individual shielding his money in an extravagant home just prior to filing bankruptcy . 
put simply , this legislation helps restore the fundamental concept of personal responsibility in the bankruptcy system . 
mr. speaker , almost half of the bankruptcies in the united states are connected to an illness in the family , whether people had health insurance or not . 
middle-class americans , who had the misfortune of either experiencing a medical emergency themselves or watching a family member suffer , were then forced to face the daunting task of pulling themselves out of debt . 
at the same time , we are removing protections that would stay an eviction , that would keep a roof over the head of a working family . 
today i rise in support of the pomeroy substitute to h.r. 8 , the estate tax repeal permanency act , and in opposition to the underlying bill . 
as the son of a small business owner , i know firsthand the tax burden placed on entrepreneurs and working families , and i support efforts to responsibly protect small business owners . 
increasing the exemption to this level would mean that 99.7 percent of all estates will not pay a single penny of the estate tax . 
while the benefits overwhelmingly go to the wealthiest 0.3 percent of estates , republican leaders fail to mention that their proposal actually raises taxes on thousands of estates , including those not previously affected by the estate tax . 
the department of agriculture estimates that this change will raise taxes on more farms than would benefit from repealing the tax . 
ending the estate tax will reduce revenues by $ 290 billion over ten years , and by 2021 , this legislation will have added a total of more than $ 1 trillion to our debt . 
these added costs also come as the president proposes to privatize social security at a cost of up to $ 6 trillion . 
we must work to meet our existing obligations rather than cutting taxes for the wealthiest 0.3 percent of families in america . 
based on internal revenue service data for 2004 , out of approximately 10 , 000 deaths in my home state , only 312 rhode island decedents filed estate tax returns . 
i urge my colleagues to join me in supporting permanent reform of the estate tax , but not irresponsibly repealing it . 
our small business owners are in need of relief , and we must provide it without leaving future generations to pay the bill . 
mr. speaker , it is fascinating if you would think if there was a proposal in the substitute to eliminate the whole list of taxes that the gentleman referred to , but i have never heard one case where they have talked about eliminating any tax , only increasing taxes . 
we spend thousands and thousands of dollars every year as a way to try and avoid what the death tax will do to us . 
it is morally wrong that the day you die , your heirs should not only see the undertaker but have to go see the tax man to see how much the federal government is going to take away from a lifetime of work . 
the idea , while the gentleman from north dakota ( mr. pomeroy ) xz4003230 , i have the greatest respect for him , but the idea of continuing an immoral tax that destroys family , destroys family businesses , i have seen neighbors who have lost everything they have , lost generations of work on a family farm because of the death tax . 
it is a fact that nothing is more harmful , nothing is more hurtful than a tax that takes away the hope of the american dream . 
that is the lifeblood of this nation , and nothing destroys it more than the death tax ; and that is why we have to kill this death tax to make sure that we can experience the american dream in this country . 
it is a death wish on the part of some of my colleagues about fiscal responsibility . 
one-third of the estate tax is paid by the wealthiest one of one thousand americans . 
i think that is one-tenth of 1 percent . 
the pomeroy amendment would totally take care of this , and what my majority colleagues ' bill does , and it is interesting , they do not come here and say so , they would increase the taxes for thousands and thousands of americans . 
why do my colleagues not come here and say this is a tax increase for thousands of americans ? 
my colleagues have come here , some of them on the majority side , talking about social security and how we need to address the shortfall . 
for some of these same colleagues , private accounts do not even touch that , and then they come here and increase the shortfall . 
the first problem is that the bill does not distinguish between those individuals who abuse their credit and then seek to wipe the slate clean through chapter 7 , and those who enter bankruptcy as the result of a costly medical emergency or after one of the breadwinners in a family loses their job . 
the results were striking : half of the people in the study said that illness or medical bills drove them into bankruptcy . 
most of these people actually had some health insurance ; but high co-payments , deductibles , exclusions from coverages left them liable for thousands of dollars in out-of-pocket costs when serious illness struck . 
in many cases , people were let go from their jobs soon after the onset of a debilitating illness , so the medical bills begin to arrive just as the insurance and paychecks disappear . 
the second fundamental problem left unaddressed by the bill is the credit card industry 's role in the surge of bankruptcy filings in recent years . 
the result is that even if someone wants to pay off their credit debts , they are unable to do so because of thousands of dollars of punitive fees and penalty interest rates that can run as high as 40 percent . 
the lending policies of the credit card companies themselves is a major factor in driving consumers into bankruptcy , yet the legislation before the house does nothing to end these abuses . 
i include with my statement an article from the march 6 edition of the washington post entitled , `` credit card penalties , fees bury debtors ; senate nears action on bankruptcy curbs. '' credit card penalties , fees bury debtors ; senate nears action on bankruptcy curbs for more than two years , special-education teacher fatemeh hosseini worked a second job to keep up with the $ 2 , 000 in monthly payments she collectively sent to five banks to try to pay $ 25 , 000 in credit card debt . 
`` all of my salary was going to the credit card companies , but there was no change in the balances because of that interest and those penalties. '' punitive charges -- penalty fees and sharply higher interest rates after a payment is late -- compound the problems of many financially strapped consumers , sometimes making it impossible for them to dig their way out of debt and pushing them into bankruptcy . 
the senate last week voted down several amendments intended to curb excessive fees and other practices that critics of the industry say are abusive . 
bankruptcy experts say that too often , by the time an individual has filed for bankruptcy or is hauled into court by creditors , he or she has repaid an amount equal to their original credit card debt plus double-digit interest , but still owes hundreds or thousands of dollars because of penalties . 
owens tried for six years to pay off a $ 1 , 900 balance on her discover card , sending the credit company a total of $ 3 , 492 in monthly payments from 1997 to 2003 . 
of that total , over-limit penalty fees alone were $ 1 , 158 . 
twice in that time , versions of it have passed both the house and senate . 
credit card companies and most congressional republicans say current law needs to be changed to prevent abuse and make more people repay at least part of their debt . 
opponents also argue that the legislation is unfair because it ignores loopholes that would allow rich debtors to shield millions of dollars during bankruptcy through expensive homes and complex trusts , while ignoring the need for more disclosure to cardholders about rates and fees and curbs on what they say is irresponsible behavior by the credit card industry . 
the republican majority , along with a few democrats , has voted down dozens of proposed amendments to the bill , including one that would make it easier for the elderly to protect their homes in bankruptcy and another that would require credit card companies to tell customers how much extra interest they would pay over time by making only minimum payments . 
no one knows how many consumers get caught in the spiral of `` negative amortization , '' which is what regulators call it when a consumer makes payments but balances continue to grow because of penalty costs . 
two years ago regulators adopted a policy that will require credit card companies to set monthly minimum payments high enough to cover penalties and interest and lower some of the customer 's original debt , known as principal , so that if a consumer makes no new charges and makes monthly minimum payments , his or her balance will begin to decline . 
banks agreed to the new rules after , in the words of one top federal regulator , `` some arm-twisting. '' but bank executives persuaded regulators to allow the higher minimum payments to be phased in over several years , through 2006 , arguing that many customers are so much in debt that even slight increases too soon could push many into financial disaster . 
`` if you are a good customer and have an occasional mishap , they 'll waive the fees , because there 's so much competition and it 's too easy to go someplace else. '' banks are also willing to work out settlements with people in financial difficulty , she said , because `` there are still a lot of options even for people who 've been in trouble. '' many bankruptcy lawyers disagree . 
u.s. bankruptcy judge david h. adams of norfolk , who is also the president of the national conference of bankruptcy judges , said many debtors who get in over their heads `` are spending money , buying things they should n't be buying. '' even so , he said , `` once you add all these fees on , the amount of principal being paid is negligible . 
john rao , staff attorney of the national consumer law center , one of many consumer groups fighting the bankruptcy bill , says the plight consumers face was illustrated last year in a bankruptcy case filed in northern virginia . 
feddis , of the banker 's association , said the nature of debt means that interest will often end up being more than the original principal . 
`` anytime you have a loan that 's going to extend for any period of time , the interest is going to accumulate . 
the interest is much , much more than the principal. '' samuel j. gerdano , executive director of the american bankruptcy institute , a nonpartisan research group , said that focusing on late fees is `` refusing to look at the elephant in the room , and that 's the massive levels of consumer debt which is not being paid . 
`` late fees are n't the cause of debt , '' he said . 
credit card use continues to grow , with an average of 6.3 bank credit cards and 6.3 store credit cards for every household , according to cardweb.com inc. , which monitors the industry . 
despite , or perhaps because of , the large increase in cards , there is a `` fee feeding frenzy , '' among credit card issuers , said robert mckinley , cardweb 's president and chief executive . 
hammer investment bankers , a california credit card consulting firm , banks collected $ 14.8 billion in penalty fees last year , or 10.9 percent of revenue , up from $ 10.7 billion , or 9 percent of revenue , in 2002 , the first year the firm began to track penalty fees . 
one group who will be especially hurt are family forced into bankruptcy because of a medical crisis . 
a recent study conducted by professors at harvard medical and law school showed that about half of all personal bankruptcies can be attributed to medical costs . 
among those who cited illnesses as a cause of bankruptcy , the average unreimbursed medical costs totaled nearly $ 12 , 000 even though more than three-quarters had health insurance . 
under the bill for the first time there will be a presumption that many of these families abuse the bankruptcy system . 
under current law , people facing a medical bankruptcy can seek several forms of relief . 
under 7 debtors are required to forfeit all of their property other than the exempt assets in exchange for having their debts extinguished . 
but unlike this bill , current law provides a presumption in favor of granting relief to the debtor . 
this bill will hurt families facing medical bankruptcy because it will force many of them into chapter 13 . 
but instead of using a debtor 's actual projected income , the means tests uses the debtor 's average income over the prior 6 months . 
thus , if a family 's bankruptcy was triggered by a loss of income resulting from a serious illness , the means test would still attribute the lost income for the purpose of determining whether the family is abusing the bankruptcy system . 
almost nobody will be able to discharge their debts in bankruptcy from santa clara county because of that high cost , no matter how meritorious for their claim for relief . 
similarly , instead of using the debtor 's actual expenses , the inflexible guidelines developed by the irs is used . 
to investigate medical contributors to bankruptcy , we surveyed 1 , 771 personal bankruptcy filers in five federal courts and subsequently completed in-depth interviews with 931 of them . 
among those whose illnesses led to bankruptcy , out-of-pocket costs averaged $ 11 , 854 since the start of illness ; 75.7 percent had insurance at the onset of illness . 
450 b.c. ) our bankruptcy system works differently from that of ancient rome ; creditors carve up the debtor 's assets , not the debtor . 
debtors ' names are often published in the newspaper , and the fact of their bankruptcy may show up whenever someone tries to find them via the internet . 
most previous studies of medical bankruptcy , however , have relied on court records -- where medical debts may be subsumed under credit card or mortgage debt -- or on responses to a single survey question . 
research has been impeded both by the absence of a national repository for bankruptcy filings and by debtors ' reticence to discuss their bankruptcy , in population-based surveys , only half of those who have undergone bankruptcy admit to it . 
edward kennedy ( d-ma ) gave an impressionistic account of `` sickness and bankruptcy. '' the likelihood of incurring high out-of-pocket costs was incorporated into older estimates of the number of underinsured americans : twenty-nine million in 1987 . 
about 16 percent of families now spend more than one-twentieth of their income on health care . 
among terminally ill patients ( most of them insured ) , 39 percent reported that health care costs caused moderate or severe financial problems . 
at least 8 percent , and perhaps as many as 21 percent of american families are contacted by collection agencies about medical bills annually . 
our study provides the first extensive data on the medical concomitants of bankruptcy , based on a survey of debtors in bankruptcy courts . 
the instant a debtor files for bankruptcy , the court assumes legal control of the debtor 's assets and halts all collection efforts . 
about 70 percent of all consumer debtors file under chapter 7 of the bankruptcy code ; most others file under chapter 13 . 
in chapter 7 the trustee liquidates all nonexempt assets -- although 96 percent of debtors have so little unencumbered property that there is nothing left to liquidate . 
at the conclusion of the bankruptcy , the debtor is freed from many debts . 
this study is based on a cohort of 1 , 771 bankruptcy filings in 2001 . 
in addition , we conducted follow-up telephone interviews with about half ( 931 ) of these debtors . 
we used cluster sampling to assemble a cohort to households filing for personal bankruptcy in five ( of the seventy-seven total ) federal judicial districts . 
we collected 250 questionnaires in each district , representative of the proportion of chapters 7 and 13 filings in that district . 
we based our analyses on all 1 , 771 bankruptcies with responses weighted to maintain the representativeness of the sample . 
with the cooperation of the judges in each district , we contacted the trustees who officiate at meetings with debtors . 
questionnaires ( which were available in english and spanish ) included a cover letter explaining the research project and human subjects protections and encouraging debtors to consult their attorneys the questionnaire asked about demographics , employment , housing , and specific reasons for filing for bankruptcy , it also asked whether the debtor had medical debts exceeding $ 1 , 000 , had lost two or more weeks of work-related income because of illness , or had health insurance coverage for themselves and all dependents at the time of filing , and whether there had been a gap of one month or more in that coverage during the past two years . 
during the spring and summer of 2001 we collected questionnaires from consecutive debtors in each district until the target number was reached . 
the written questionnaire distributed at the time of bankruptcy filing invited debtors to participate in future telephone interviews , for which they would receive $ 50 ; 70 percent agreed to such interviews . 
we ultimately completed follow-up telephone interviews with 931 of the 1 , 771 debtor families , a response rate of 53 percent . 
each of the 931 interviewees was asked if any of the following had been a significant cause of their bankruptcy : an illness or injury ; the death of a family member ; or the addition of a family member through birth , adoption , custody , or fostering . 
we used data from the self-administered questionnaires ( and court records ) obtained from all 1 , 771 filters to analyze demographics , health coverage at the time of filing , and gaps in coverage in the two years before filing . 
we developed two summary measures of medical bankruptcy . 
under the rubric `` major medical bankruptcy '' we included debtors who either ( 1 ) cited illness or injury as a specific reason for bankruptcy , or ( 2 ) reported uncovered medical bills exceeding $ 1 , 000 in the past years , or ( 3 ) lost at least two weeks of work-related income because of illness/injury , or ( 4 ) mortgaged a home to pay medical bills . 
our more inclusive category , `` any medical bankruptcy , '' included debtors who cited any of the above , or addiction , or uncontrolled gambling , or birth , or the death of a family member . 
the in-depth medical interviews regarding 391 people with medical problems are the basis for our analyses of which household members were ill , diagnoses , health insurance at onset of illness , and out-of-pocket spending . 
to extrapolate our findings nationally , we assumed that our sample was representative of the 1 , 457 , 572 households filing for bankruptcy during 2001 . 
exhibit 1 displays the demographic characteristics of our weighted sample of 1 , 771 bankruptcy filers . 
medical causes of bankruptcy . 
exhibit 2 shows the proportion of debtors ( n = 1 , 771 ) citing various medical contributors to their bankruptcy and the estimated number of debtors and dependents nationally affected by each cause . 
nearly half ( 46.2 percent ) ( 95 percent confidence interval = 43.5 , 48.9 ) of debtors met at least one of our criteria for `` major medical bankruptcy. '' slightly more than half ( 54.5 percent ) ( 95 percent ci = 51.8 , 57.2 ) met criteria for `` any medical bankruptcy. '' a lapse in health insurance coverage during the two years before filing was a strong predictor of a medical cause of bankruptcy ( exhibit 3 ) . 
nearly four-tenths ( 38.4 percent ) of debtors who had a `` major medical bankruptcy '' had experienced a lapse , compared with 27.1 percent of debtors with no medical cause ( p & amp ; lt ; .0001 ) . 
surprisingly , medical debtors were no less likely than other debtors to have coverage at the time of filing . 
however , the `` major medical bankruptcy '' group was 16 percent ( p & amp ; lt ; 03 ) less likely than other debtors to cite trouble managing money as a cause of their bankruptcy ( data not shown ) . 
during the two years before filing , 40.3 percent had lost telephone service ; 19.4 percent had gone without food ; 53.6 percent had gone without needed doctor or dentist visits because of the cost , and 43.0 percent had failed to fill a prescription , also because of the cost . 
among the total sample of 1 , 771 debtors , those with more than $ 1 , 000 in medical bills were more likely than others to have taken out a mortgage to pay medical bills ( 5.0 percent versus 0.8 percent ) . 
fifteen percent of all homeowners who had taken out a second or third mortgage cited medical expenses as a reason . 
follow-up phone interviews revealed that among homeowners with high-risk mortgages ( interest rates greater than 12 percent , or points plus fees of at least 8 percent ) , 13.8 percent cited a medical reason for taking out the loan . 
following their bankruptcy filings , about one-third of debtors continued to have problems paying their bills . 
although our interviews occurred soon after the bankruptcy filings ( seven months , on average ) , many debtors had already been turned down for jobs ( 3.1 percent ) , mortgages ( 5.8 percent ) , apartment rentals ( 4.9 percent ) , or car loans ( 9.3 percent ) because of the bankruptcy on their credit reports . 
medical diagnoses , spending , and type of coverage . 
in three-quarters of cases , the person experiencing the illness/injury was the debt or spouse of the debtor ; in 13.3 percent , a child ; and in 8.2 percent , an elderly relative . 
illness begot financial problems both directly ( because of medical costs ) and through lost income . 
three-fifths ( 59.9 percent ) of families bankrupted by medical problems indicated that medical bills ( from medical care providers ) contributed to bankruptcy ; 47.6 percent cited drug costs ; 35.3 percent had curtailed employment because of illness , often ( 52.8 percent ) to care for someone else . 
half ( 51.7 percent ) of the medical problems involved ongoing chronic illnesses . 
three-fourths ( 75.7 percent ) of these debtors were insured at the on-set of the bankrupting illness . 
three-fifths ( 60.1 percent ) initially had private coverage , but one-third of them lost coverage during the course of their illness . 
of debtors , 5.7 percent had medicare , 8.4 percent medicaid , and 1.6 percent veterans/military coverage . 
only 2.9 percent of those who were uninsured or suffered a gap in coverage said that they had not thought they needed insurance ; 55.9 percent said that premiums were unaffordable , 7.1 percent were unable to obtain coverage because of preexisting medical conditions , and most others cited employment issues , such as job loss or ineligibility for employer-sponsored coverage . 
presumably , such costs were often ruinous because of concomitant income loss or because the need for costly care persisted over several years . 
out-of-pocket costs since the onset of illness/injury averaged $ 11 , 854 ( 95 percent ci = $ 8 , 532 , $ 15 , 175 ) . 
debtors with private insurance at the onset of their illnesses had even higher out-of-pocket costs than those with no insurance . 
this paradox is explained by the very high costs -- $ 18 , 005 -- incurred by patients who initially had private the human face of bankruptcy . 
debtors ' narratives painted a picture of families arriving at the bankruptcy courthouse emotionally and financially exhausted , hoping to stop the collection calls , save their homes , and stabilize their economic circumstances . 
many of the debtors detailed ongoing problems with access to care . 
some expressed fear that their medical care providers would refuse to continue their care , and a few recounted actual experiences of this kind . 
several had used credit cards to charge medical bills they had no hope of paying . 
the co-occurrence of medical and job problems was a common theme . 
he found new employment but was denied coverage because of his preexisting conditions , which required costly ongoing care . 
a hospital wrote off her $ 20 , 000 debt , but she was nevertheless bankrupted by doctor 's bills and the cost of medications . 
a second common theme was sounded by parents of premature infants or chronically ill children ; many took time off from work or incurred large bills for home care while they were at their jobs . 
finally , many of the insured debtors blamed high copayments and deductibles for their financial ruin . 
for example , a man insured through his employer ( a large national firm ) suffered a broken leg and torn knee ligaments , he incurred $ 13 , 000 in out-of-pocket costs for copayments , deductibles , and uncovered services -- much of it for physical therapy . 
bankruptcy is common in the united states , involving nearly four million debtors and dependents in 2001 ; medical problems contribute to about half of all bankruptcies . 
many had coverage at the onset of their illness but lost it . 
our study 's strengths are the use of multiple overlapping data sources ; a large sample size ; geographic diversity ; and in-depth data collection . 
although our sample may not be fully representative of all personal bankruptcies , the chapter 7 filers we studied resemble chapter 7 filers nationally ( the only group for whom demographic data has been complied nationally from court records ) . 
first , just prior to answering our questionnaire , debtors had filed extensive information with the court under penalty of perjury -- information that was available to use in the court records and that virtually never contradicted the questionnaire data . 
third , one of us ( thorne ) interviewed ( for other studies ) many debtors in their homes . 
almost all specifically denied spend-thrift habits , and observation of their homes supported these claims . 
most reflected the lifestyle of people under economic constraint , with modest furnishings and few luxuries . 
finally , our findings receive indirect corroboration from recent surveys of the general public that have found high levels of medical debt , which often result in calls from collection agencies . 
many debtors described a complex web of problems involving illness , work , and family . 
dissecting medical from other causes of bankruptcy is difficult . 
we can not presume that eliminating the medical antecedents of bankruptcy would have preventing all of the filings we classified as `` medical bankruptcies. '' conversely , many people financially ruined by illness are undoubtedly too ill , too destitute , or too demoralized to pursue formal bankruptcy . 
although methodological inconsistencies between studies preclude precise quantification of time trends , medical bankruptcies are clearly increasing . 
in 1981 the best evidence available suggests that about 25 , 000 families filed for bankruptcy in the aftermath of a serious medical problem ( 8 percent of the 312 , 000 bankruptcy filings that year ) . 
our findings suggest that the number of medical bankruptcies had increased twenty-threefold by 2001 . 
since the number of bankruptcy filings rose 11 percent in the eighteen months after the completion of our data collection , the absolute number of medical bankruptcies almost surely continues to increase . 
only a handful of medical debtors with a gap in coverage had chosen to forgo insurance because they had not perceived a need for it ; the overwhelming majority had found coverage unaffordable or effectively unavailable . 
the privations suffered by many debtors -- going without food , telephone service , electricity , and health care -- lend credence to claims that coverage was unaffordable and belie the second , many health insurance policies prove to be too skimpy in the face of serious illness . 
many insured families are bankrupted by medical expenses well below the `` catastrophic '' thresholds of high-deductible plans that are increasingly popular with employers . 
third , even good employment-based coverage sometimes fails to protect families , because illness may lead to job loss and the consequent loss of coverage . 
lost jobs , of course , also leave families without health coverage when they are at their financially most vulnerable . 
finally , illness often leads to financial catastrophe through loss of income , as well as high medical bills . 
hence , disability insurance and paid sick leave are also critical to financial survival of a serious illness . 
as in canada and most of western europe , health insurance should be divorced from employment to avoid coverage disruptions at the time of illness . 
the low rate of medical bankruptcy in canada suggests that better medical and social insurance could greatly ameliorate this problem in the united states . 
according to legend , the resulting depletion of the papal treasury is reflected in his unadorned plaster sarcophagus in st . 
`` the man of great wealth , '' teddy said , `` owes a particular obligation to the state because he derives special advantages from the mere existence of government. '' wow , nicely said , and a republican , too . 
though republicans want to undo all the good for the sake of greed , please , america , do not be phonied up by this rhetoric that we hear on this bill . 
three-quarters of the money that comes in comes from people with estates over $ 2.5 million . 
now if you can give your kid $ 2 million and say , now , johnny , here is two million bucks , i think that ought to kind of get you a start in the world . 
ronald reagan put the sign of the cross on it . 
if the japanese stop buying dollars and they start buying euros , and the chinese start buying euros and the middle east buys euros , where do my colleagues think we are going to borrow money and what kind of interest rate are we going to pay ? 
today , because of that deceptive campaign , millions of americans seem to believe they will be subject to the so-called death tax . 
facts are stubborn things , and the facts prove that the republican leadership is once again trying to pass a bill that helps the very wealthy few at the expense of everyone else . 
the truth is that the overwhelming majority of american families , 99.7 percent , are not subject to estate taxes . 
let me repeat : 99.7 percent of american families are not subject to estate taxes . 
this permanent repeal of the estate tax does not help the average american . 
instead , it benefits the heirs of the wealthy . 
the reality is that most of these family farmers and small business owners are already exempt from the estate tax . 
further , as the washington post pointed out today , permanently repealing the estate tax may actually hurt more family farmers and small businesses than it would help because of the cumbersome new reporting requirements and changes in how assets are valued . 
exempting estates up to $ 1 million , the original level before the 2001 bush tax cut , leaves only the top 2 percent of the estates in the country . 
but current law goes well beyond the $ 1 million exemption ; and to hide the real cost of their bad economic policies , the republican leadership included a provision that sunsets the 2001 tax cut in 2011 . 
mr. speaker , for most of the 20th century , this country operated on a progressive taxation system . 
of course this debt is of their creation . 
president bush came into his first term with a surplus and ended his second term with the largest deficit in the history of the united states of america , and now they bring forward another tax cut that costs $ 290 billion according to the joint committee on taxation . 
the wealthiest of the wealthy are getting a free ride at this very difficult time in our history . 
this would cost dramatically less than the republican bill , $ 72 billion compared to $ 290 billion , and it would exempt 99.7 percent of all estates from ever facing the estate tax . 
health care costs are spiraling out of control . 
i , for one , do not believe the answer to these challenges is a permanent repeal of the estate tax . 
mr. speaker , i reserve the balance of my time . 
we hear the phrase `` death tax , '' which really is kind of a misnomer . 
the issue is whether or not estates in the billions of dollars should be subject to any taxation . 
the gentleman from north dakota has a substitute that would basically exempt 99.7 percent of all estates from any estate tax . 
there seems to be no concern on the other side of the aisle about what this does to our deficit or our debt . 
he said , so people can understand what the debt means , if you stack up one thousand dollar bills , a million dollars would be about a foot high ; a billion dollars would be about the size of the empire state building ; a trillion dollars would be 1 , 000 empire state buildings . 
this is about helping the wealthiest of the wealthy . 
let me again remind people that we are talking about three-tenths of 1 percent who actually pay an estate tax . 
let me just make a couple of points here . 
this is about protecting the three-tenths of the 1 percent wealthiest people in this country . 
i enter into the record an article that appeared in today 's washington post that really kind of explains what this debate is all about , about how mars candy , gallo wine , and campbell soup fortunes have been lobbying for the complete repeal of the estate tax for some time so they can end all taxation on their inheritance . 
this is about protecting the richest of the rich . 
erosion of estate tax is a session in politics in 1992 , when heirs to the mars inc . 
fortune joined a few other wealthy families to hire the law firm patton boggs llp to lobby for estate tax repeal , the joke on k street was that few washington sightseers had paid so much for a fruitless tour of the capitol . 
`` i think this train has an awful lot of momentum , '' said yale university law professor michael j. graetz , a former senior official in the treasury department of president george h.w . 
last month , graetz and yale political scientist ian shapiro published `` death by a thousand cuts , '' chronicling the estate tax repeal movement as `` a mystery about politics and persuasion. '' `` for almost a century , the estate tax affected only the richest 1 or 2 percent of citizens , encouraged charity , and placed no burden on the vast majority of americans , '' they wrote . 
`` a law that constituted the blandest kind of common sense for most of the twentieth century was transformed , in the space of little more than a decade , into the supposed enemy of hardworking citizens all over this country. '' the secret of the repeal movement 's success has been its appeal to principle over economics . 
while repeal opponents bellowed that only the richest of the rich would ever pay the estate tax , proponents appealed to americans ' sense of fairness , that individuals have the natural right to pass on their wealth to their children . 
in 2001 , out of 2 , 363 , 100 total adult deaths , only 49 , 911 -- 2.1 percent -- had estates large enough to be hit by the estate tax . 
the value of the taxed estates in 2001 averaged nearly $ 2.7 million . 
congressional action since 2001 will likely bring down the number of taxable estates still further . 
president bush 's 10-year , $ 1.35 trillion tax cut in 2001 began a decade-long phase-out of the estate tax . 
the portion of an estate exempted from taxation was raised from $ 675 , 000 in 2001 to $ 1.5 million in 2004 . 
the number of estates filing tax return is falling sharply , from 123 , 600 in 2000 to an expected 63 , 800 this year . 
and only a small fraction of those will actually be taxed . 
under the 2001 legislation , however , all of the tax cuts , including the estate tax 's repeal , would be rescinded in 2011 . 
that would be enough to exempt 99.7 percent of all estates . 
the pomeroy bill would cost the treasury $ 72 billion over 10 years , compared with the $ 290 billion price tag of a full repeal through 2015 , according to the joint committee on taxation . 
jon kyl ( r-ariz. ) , a repeal proponent , to find a compromise that could win a filibuster-proof 60 votes in the senate this year , even if it falls short of full repeal . 
repeal opponents have been unable to whip up big support , he said , because they never made the emotional case that the american belief in equal opportunity runs counter to the existence of an aristocracy born to inherited riches . 
and now famously enjoys spending it , could have been their counter to the small-business owners and family farmers whom repeal proponents held up as the victims of the tax . 
`` the public does n't believe people should be taxed at the time of death , whether they are paupers or billionaires , '' said frank luntz , a republican pollster who has been working on estate tax repeal for a decade . 
a little-known southern california estate planner named patricia soldano launched her repeal effort with the backing of about 50 wealthy clients , with the gallo and mars families leading the way . 
other contributors included the heirs of the campbell soup and krystal hamburger fortunes . 
the effort caught fire when small-business groups such as the national federation of independent business and agriculture groups led by the national cattlemen 's beef association joined in . 
a parade of small-business owners and family farmers appealed to their congressmen , worried that they could not pass on their enterprises to their children , even though most of them would not be affected by the tax . 
`` there 's been a sustained , determined campaign of misinformation that in the end has left the american people with a very different notion of what the estate tax is and does than actually exists , '' pomeroy said . 
early this year , with soldano 's money , luntz again began polling , this time in the face of record budget deficits and lingering economic unease . 
more than 80 percent called the taxation of inheritances `` extreme. '' about 64 percent said they favored `` death tax '' repeal . 
`` the politics are still very powerful. '' mr. speaker , i reserve the balance of my time . 
the debate is about whether three-tenths of 1 percent of higher income-earners in this country deserve additional tax relief at a time when they are cutting medicaid , veterans benefits , when they are dipping into the social security trust fund . 
what they are talking about is a debt tax , d-e-b-t , adding to the deficits and the debt of this country . 
we need to rein in some of these extravagant tax cuts for the wealthy so that we can get our fiscal house in order here in this country , so we can start taking care of social security in the long term , so we do not have to cut veterans benefits or educational benefits or environmental protection . 
mr. speaker , i at this time i will enter into the record an article by e.j. dionne entitled `` the paris hilton tax cut. '' the paris hilton tax cut the same people who insist that critics of social security privatization should offer reform proposals of their own are working feverishly to eliminate alternatives that might reduce the need for benefit cuts or payroll tax increases . 
under a wacky provision of the 2001 tax cut designed to disguise the law 's full cost , congress voted to make the estate tax go away in 2010 , but come back in full force in 2011 . 
fewer than 1 percent of the people who died in 2004 paid an estate tax , and half the revenue from the tax came from estates valued at $ 10 million or more . 
yet , because the wealthy have gotten wealthier over the past three decades or so , the estate tax produces a lot of money . 
counting both revenue losses and added interest costs , complete repeal of the estate tax would cost the government close to $ 1 trillion between 2012 and 2021 , according to the center on budget and policy priorities . 
you can reject outlandish claims that social security faces some sort of `` crisis '' and still acknowledge that it faces a gap in funding for the long haul . 
the estate tax should be part of the solution . 
in a little-noticed estimate confirmed by his office yesterday , stephen goss , the highly respected social security actuary , has studied how much of the social security financing gap could be filled by a reformed estate tax . 
what would happen if , instead of repealing the tax , congress left it in place at a 45 percent rate , and only on fortunes that exceeded $ 3.5 million -- which would be $ 7 million for couples ? 
that , by the way , is well below where the estate tax stood when president bush took office and would eliminate more than 99 percent of estates from the tax . 
according to goss , a tax at that level would cover one-quarter of the 75-year social security shortfall . 
the congressional budget office has a more modest estimate of the shortfall . 
applying goss 's numbers means that if cbo is right , the reformed estate tax would cover one-half of the social security shortfall . 
michael j. graetz and ian shapiro , authors of a new book on the estate tax , `` death by a thousand cuts , '' have referred to its repeal as the `` paris hilton benefit act. '' to pick up on the metaphor , why should congress be more concerned about protecting paris hilton 's inheritance than grandma 's social security check ? 
how can a member of congress even think about raising payroll taxes while throwing away so much other revenue ? 
most of the `` compromises '' being discussed would repeal 80 to 90 percent of the estate tax . 
but if they agree to any steps beyond that , democrats will , once again , be placing the concerns of wealthy donors over the interests of the people who actually vote for them . 
the friends of paris hilton realize that as federal deficits mount and rising medicare costs loom , the case for the total repeal of the estate tax grows steadily weaker . 
that 's why they 're hoping they can sucker defenders of estate taxes into a so-called compromise that gives away the store -- the store , in this case , going to neiman-marcus shoppers , not to those who rely on target . 
what we are having is not a real debate on the future of social security but a sham discussion in which the one issue that matters to the governing majority is how to keep cutting taxes on the wealthiest people in our country . 
mr. speaker , i reserve the balance of my time . 
the gentlewoman from tennessee talked about the thousands of people in her district that had to pay the estate tax last year . 
i am reading from a report here that said there were roughly 440 taxable estates , or about 2 percent of all taxable estates were made up of farm and business assets in the year 2004 . 
what we are talking about here , and again , if we agree to the pomeroy substitute , is three-tenths of 1 percent of the wealthiest people in this country . 
we are talking about the richest of the rich . 
what is unconscionable is that we are moving forward on this at a time when the majority of this house is proposing budgets that slash medicaid , that cut community development block grants , that cut veterans health benefits , that cut education , that cut things that people rely on every single day . 
please do not exaggerate the impact of the difference between what the gentleman from north dakota ( mr. pomeroy ) xz4003230 has suggested and what you are proposing here . 
what you are doing here is trying to extend this to protect the richest of the rich , and that is just wrong . 
mr. speaker , i reserve the balance of my time . 
i want to make it clear , as there is a lot of misinformation being promoted on the other side here : our side supports relief for family farmers and small businesses . 
the difference between our approach is the three-tenths of 1 percent richest people in this country , the paris hiltons of the world , the executives at campbell soup , the heirs of campbell soup or mars candy if you read the washington post today . 
and , again , what we are talking about here is not what the gentleman just spoke of . 
what we are talking about here is the richest of the rich in this country . 
mr. speaker , i reserve the balance of my time . 
mr. speaker , i reserve the balance of my time . 
mr. speaker , i yield myself the balance of my time . 
but what the majority is suggesting is that somehow we need to do something to help the three-tenths of 1 percent of the richest people in this country at a time when they present budgets that cut medicaid , that cut veterans benefits , that cut educational programs , that cut programs for the poor . 
how can you come here with a straight face and say that we need to help the three-tenths of 1 percent richest people in this country , when so many people who are struggling in the middle class , so many struggling to get in the middle class , are having such a difficult time ? 
mr. speaker , at the end of this debate , i will call for a vote on the previous question ; and if the previous question is defeated i will offer an amendment to the rule . 
the pomeroy substitute will exempt 99.7 percent of all estates . 
mr. speaker , there are a lot of people on the other side of the aisle who go back home and do town hall meetings and tell their constituents that they are for protecting social security . 
mr. speaker , i ask unanimous consent to insert the text of the amendment immediately prior to the vote on the previous question . 
mr. speaker , i have no further requests for time , and i yield back the balance of my time . 
mr. speaker , this bankruptcy bill is but the latest attempt by the republican congress to undermine the economic security of the middle class . 
health care costs , not spending sprees , are the single largest causes of bankruptcies in america . 
why are we here trying to increase the profits of credit card companies while doing nothing to lower the cost of health care for middle-class american families ? 
it is disgraceful that this bill is being considered under a closed rule , with just an hour of debate , with no opportunity for amendment . 
supporters of this bill claim to have exempted service members who become disabled on active duty , but to be exempted you have to go into debt while on active duty . 
a veteran who returns home from iraq or afghanistan and then goes into debt because of the injuries sustained on active duty is still subject to the punitive means test . 
what a way to treat the men and women in uniform fighting on behalf of the united states . 
mr. speaker , i think this piece of legislation that the majority is clearly going to be able to pass today is one of the most outrageous tax cuts that we have brought to the house floor . 
the democrats are going to offer an alternative , and i appreciate the fact that it was allowed by the rules committee , but this alternative would exempt 99.7 percent of american families from having to pay inheritance taxes . 
so all we are really talking about is three-tenths of 1 percent , a relative handful , the people who clearly can most afford to pay taxes . 
this excessive , unnecessary cut will pass despite the fact that , within the last few legislative sessions , this congress has voted to take 300 , 000 families off food stamps , to take 300 , 000 children off daycare , to run the risk , by taking $ 20 billion out of medicaid , that as many as 7 million very poor elderly people dependent on government help in nursing homes will not get that assistance . 
where is our source of fairness ? 
but in this country , unfortunately , when you see the effect of these tax cuts , that equal opportunity is really dependent upon the accident of birth . 
millions of people in our country are suffering for the accident of birth , without health insurance , without any real prospect of getting decent schooling . 
what excuse are we using for burdening the next generation with hundreds of billions of dollars of debt ? 
we are taking hundreds of billions of dollars , borrowing it from the social security trust funds , just to give more help to the very children who , because of the accident of birth , have the very best education that this country can allow , have all the contacts imaginable , are virtually guaranteed economic success unless they choose to turn their backs on it . 
what we have done is to turn our backs on the vast majority of the american people , and to close our consciences to our children 's generation , who are getting swamped with debt . 
i ask you to consider the fact that it takes away the stepped-up basis at the point of inheritance , insuring that there will be more small businesses , more family farms that are going to get hurt -- over 70 thousand -- by this provision , by this legislation than are going to be helped , because they are going to have to pay capital gains at the point when they actually inherit calculated by going back to the original cost to the deceased . 
so it just does not make any sense , other than to people gripped by this ideological fervor to cut taxes irregardless of the rationale or the consequence . 
mr. speaker , the `` bankruptcy abuse prevention and consumer act '' is long overdue and with house passage later today , it stands a very real prospect of becoming law . 
ironically , the legislation was drawn from the recommendations of the bipartisan national bankruptcy review commission that was established through legislation passed in 1994 by a democratic-controlled congress . 
it enjoyed the same level of bipartisan support as when it passed the senate last month . 
the main component of the commission 's recommendations and the legislation we have here today is to establish a means-based test to determine who should work with creditors on a plan to repay their debts and those who can not afford to do so . 
the means test in this bill carves out a series of exemptions to steer those who can afford to repay at least part of their debt toward a chapter 13 repayment plan . 
it is estimated that only a small minority of those already filing for bankruptcy would be affected , perhaps as little as 7 percent . 
back in 1998 , i encouraged supporters of the bill to improve its consumer protection provisions . 
at the onset of the 107th session , i sought and won the house 's approval of my pro-consumer amendments that remain a part of today ' s bill . 
these provisions : require credit card companies to include a disclosure statement highlighting the number of months necessary to repay a balance if the card holder were to pay only the minimum amount due ; require credit card companies to inform cardholders on when their low introductory rates expire and new higher rates take effect ; and prevent deceptive and fraudulent advertising practices by debt relief agencies by making certain that creditors are informed of their rights as debtors . 
but perfection should not be an enemy of the good . 
increasingly , bankruptcy has become a tool of first impulse rather than a last option after all other avenues have been exhausted . 
last year , 1.6 million consumers filed for bankruptcy , a figure just short of the number of filings in 2003 , which represented the most in our nation 's history . 
how is it that during periods of sustained economic growth and prosperity , such as during the clinton presidency , when all incomes rose , bankruptcies also continued to climb ? 
s. 256 has been criticized for advancing the interests of the credit card industry on the backs of the poor and the middle class , many of whom are in debt because of circumstances beyond their control . 
those deserving of a fresh start will still be able to do so under this legislation . 
another is because 7.3 million americans live on the minimum wage , more than one-third of whom rely on the $ 5.15 cents per hour to support their family . 
it is because during the height of the last recession , the majority party refused to allow any extension of unemployment benefits , because they were too busy falling all over themselves to cut taxes for the wealthiest americans . 
we just passed this week a permanent elimination of the estate tax , helping the wealthiest among us avoid paying any tax on their untaxed earnings , and passed a budget resolution that will cut health care to the indigent . 
it is the majority 's overall agenda that is bankrupt and in need of reform . 
mr. speaker , this bill is the worst giveaway to special interests , the worst rip-off of the public , of the middle class than i have ever seen in my public life . 
landlords who want to boot tenants out of their apartments , it is easier . 
there is an entire title in the bill just to squeeze more money out of debtors . 
congress is more worried about the rights of pawnbrokers than about the rights of children . 
why does congress believe studies paid for by the credit card industry that label millions of americans crooks , while ignoring our own congressional budget office , the independent and nonpartisan american bankruptcy institute , and the government accountability office , all say these studies are bunk ? 
the public will be the victims , and we will rue the day in a few years when the 60 or 70 different ways in which this bill enables the credit card companies to stick their hands in the pockets of low- and middle-income people and extremists going bankrupt because of a medical emergency , and take more money out of that . 
mr. speaker , this bill is the worst giveaway to special interests , the worst rip-off of the public , of the middle class , i have ever seen in my public life . 
mr. speaker , bankruptcy is notoriously complicated , but the members of this house have certainly never let the complexity of a problem get in the way of a good deal . 
landlords who want to boot tenants out of their apartments ? 
there is an entire title in this bill just for you to squeeze more money out of debtors . 
that 's right , congress is more worried about the rights of pawn brokers than about the rights of children . 
more to the point -- why are so many members of congress so willing to believe bankers over the people who we work with day in and day out to protect the rights of children ? 
why does congress believe studies paid for by the credit card industry that label millions of americans crooks , while ignoring our own congressional budget office , the independent and non-partisan american bankruptcy institute , and the government accountability office , all of whom tell us these studies are bunk ? 
it will impose new costs on the private sector of more than $ 123 million per year , in violation of the unfunded mandate reform act . 
i asked george wallace , the representative of the creditor coalition , that question . 
i asked whether he was aware that current law gives creditors the right to challenge the discharge of debts , examine debtors under oath , demand any documents from the debtors , seek dismissal of a case , and many other legal remedies . 
he said `` i have done these things and they do take a fair amount of time and i bill my clients for them . 
because it is not the job of the creditor. '' a governmental program ? 
we need to spend millions of taxpayer dollars to help the nation 's biggest banks collect money from bankrupt families ? 
the distinguished chairman of the judiciary committee has made this the cornerstone of the legislation . 
he recently told the financial times of london , `` the responsible thing for the credit card issuers to do would be to reduce interest rates because there is less risk . 
if they do n't they will play into the hands of the opponents of the bill -- it would reduce their credibility. '' i agree , but the republican leadership would n't allow us to consider an amendment that would sunset the bill in 2 years if no savings are passed on to consumers . 
the slogan of the moderate republican party is this : we are rich , and we are not going to take it any more . 
it is day after day in this institution , borrow money , run up the debt , run up the deficits and then with a straight face say , we are going to repeal a tax that affects 1 percent of the american people , just 1 percent of the american people . 
we see what happens to this money when it gets to the fourth and fifth generation of the same family : thrift is gone , the work ethic is gone . 
they quarrel about who is going to have enough money so they can enjoy the lavish ways of american life . 
when i hear people say , as they have said recently in this debate , well it is going to take care of the family farmer , they can not find a farmer that is not taken care of in the legislation that is about to be proposed here . 
this legislation that they are proposing today cuts against the grain of what thomas payne reminded us in `` common sense. '' he was concerned about hereditary power , the idea that the same people would control the wealth of america with the same families that would get to go to the same schools so the same families would have the same doctors and lawyers and accountants so the rest of america might not have a chance to participate . 
when we look at who enjoys the fruits of this money , the smallest number of american people , again the top 1 percent in america . 
there is no sense in the house of lords that you can advance yourself . 
here in this house , the people 's house , every walk of life is represented . 
why do we just not establish a house of lords after we get rid of the estate tax so then when we get rid of hereditary power , we will simply have the permanent state of aristocracy and privilege for the few . 
the costs of their health premiums increased 163 percent since 1988 . 
the american bankruptcy institute says that 96.3 percent of the people filing chapter 7 just do not have the money . 
now we are not saying forget about all of this , but we are saying let us be reasonable . 
who should be first on the list of congressional priorities ? 
i am very proud of the work of the gentleman from north dakota ( mr. pomeroy ) xz4003230 , our member of congress , a very distinguished member of the committee on ways and means , for his initiative and leadership in presenting to the congress today an alternative that makes sense to the american people , that is fair to america 's families . 
mr. speaker , in the 20th century , in the early part of the 20th century , our country made a decision to honor our american value of fairness by moving forward toward a progressive system of taxation . 
but under 10 years of republican rule , this congress has consistently passed legislation that has moved away from a progressive tax code . 
in its analysis of the president 's budget , the nonpartisan congressional budget office found that the tax rate on wage income is nearly twice the rate of capital income , unearned income . 
and it comes at a staggering cost of nearly $ 1 trillion over 10 years once it takes full effect . 
but we can not support putting the luxuries of the super-rich before the needs of america 's families . 
the pomeroy substitute would provide relief to 99.7 percent of estates in america , 99.7 percent ; and .3 percent of estates would not be covered under the bill . 
that is a small percentage , but a huge amount of money being deprived from the national treasury . 
the savings achieved by pursuing the more fair and targeted approach put forth by the gentleman from north dakota ( mr. pomeroy ) xz4003230 would cover about one half of the long-term shortfall facing social security . 
think of it : if we pass the gentleman from north dakota 's ( mr. pomeroy ) xz4003230 bill , the savings would cover one half of the shortfall in social security down the road . 
do we want to put the wealthiest .3 percent of estate holders ahead of millions of american workers who have earned their social security benefits with a lifetime of work ? 
do we want to continue reckless republican tax policies or return to a fair system of taxation ? 
this is a remarkable choice before us , and i hope that the american people can avail themselves of the information to understand what is at stake here . 
mind you , the gentleman from north dakota ( mr. pomeroy ) xz4003230 has covered 99.7 percent , which is most , of course , 99.7 percent of the people in america . 
in fact , they will be hurt because of what it does to social security and what it does in terms of capital gains for over 71 , 000 families in america . 
the creation of wealth is important to our economy . 
so let us come down and vote for america 's workers , let us come down in favor of america 's families , and let us recognize that everybody , the wealthiest as well as those not so wealthy , everyone in america benefits when we have fairness in our tax code , where we have balance in our budget in terms of our values and in terms of our fiscal responsibility . 
in the course of our country 's history , our economy , our government has always provided for people to get a fresh start under the bankruptcy law to enable them to go forward to make a contribution to our economy and our society . 
this duty is paramount because we have been shut out of the process here , the legislative process to bring any amendments to the floor . 
that would have been an amendment on identity theft , which this week 's news accounts demonstrate there are real problems of identity theft , and an amendment was rejected . 
we tried to take a legislative course of action in our previous question , which is a technicality , is a procedure here on the floor ; but we were not able to get any republican support to address the issue of identity theft and how individuals can be protected from identity theft under the bankruptcy bill . 
according to the sponsors of this bill , 1.6 million americans who filed for bankruptcy last year are deadbeats who are avoiding their debts . 
that is really the essence of what they are saying with this bill . 
proponents claim that there is a bankruptcy tax in which honest americans are footing the bill for abusive users of credit cards . 
we should be vigilant for any abuse of any legal process . 
there is no evidence , however , of widespread bankruptcy abuse . 
in fact , a recent study indicated that 45 percent of those filing for bankruptcy had skipped a needed doctor 's visit , 25 percent had utilities shut off , 20 percent went without food . 
as a distinguished group of law professors wrote : `` some people do abuse the bankruptcy system , but the overwhelming majority of people in bankruptcy are in financial distress as a result of job loss , medical expense , divorce , or a combination of those causes . 
it frustrates a key goal of the bankruptcy code , to give individuals who suffer economic misfortunes through no fault of their own a fresh start . 
the bill neglects the real causes of bankruptcies , as i just mentioned , medical concerns , divorce , in some cases death , while rewarding irresponsible corporate behavior . 
judge lundin says , `` the folks who brought you `those who can pay , should pay ' are pulling the stuffing out of the very part of the bankruptcy law where debtors do pay. '' he says , `` the advocates are n't trying to fix the bankruptcy law ; they 're trying to mess it up so much that nobody can use it. '' they interviewed dozens of bankruptcy judges , whose names have been suggested by proponents and opponents of this legislation , for their standing on this issue , to speak out ; and the reasons why these judges are opposed are several reasons . 
it would also extend the length of time people would have to make repayments and impose repayment schedules that critics describe as so onerous that debtors would fall behind . 
the bankruptcy judges say the result would be the collapse of more repayment plans , forcing debtors out of bankruptcy court protection . 
many people would have to pay creditors far into the future and thus be unable to restart their economic lives , a long-held aim of bankruptcy . 
for nearly a decade , proponents of overhauling the nation 's bankruptcy laws have described their aim as ensuring that americans who enter bankruptcy court do not escape bills that they can truly afford to pay . 
but only weeks before congress is likely to approve the long-sought overhaul , bankruptcy judges across the country warn that the measure would undermine the very section of the law under which debtors are now repaying more than $ 3 billion annually to their creditors . 
these judges say the effect of the overhaul would be to discourage most forms of personal bankruptcy , which -- for nearly two centuries has served as a safety net for people in economic trouble . 
`` the folks who brought you `those who can pay , should pay ' are pulling the stuffing out of the very part of the bankruptcy law where debtors do pay , '' said keith lundin , a federal bankruptcy judge in the eastern district of tennessee in nashville and an authority on bankruptcy repayment plans . 
in interviews , a dozen current or former bankruptcy judges , whose names were suggested by proponents as well as opponents of the overhaul legislation , described what they saw as the problems that could result from key provisions of the new measure . 
it would also extend the length of time people would have to make repayments and impose repayment schedules that critics describe as so onerous that many debtors would fall behind . 
the result , the judges said , would be the collapse of more repayment plans , forcing debtors out of bankruptcy court protection . 
many people would have to pay creditors far into the future , the critics said , and thus be unable to restart their economic lives , a long-held aim of bankruptcy . 
repayment plans `` are pretty fragile documents to begin with , but they 're going to get a lot more fragile under these conditions , '' said ronald barliant , a former bankruptcy judge from the northern district of illinois in chicago . 
`` it 's going to take away a lot of the incentives '' for people to enter repayment plans , said david w. houston iii , a bankruptcy judge from the northern district of mississippi in aberdeen . 
many proponents are deeply scornful of bankruptcy judges , who they charge have let the system spin out of control . 
`` they 're part of the ... .. 
problem , '' declared jeff tassey , a washington lobbyist who heads the coalition of credit card companies , banks and others that has spearheaded the overhaul drive . 
he was referring to article 3 of the u.s. constitution , under which judges in the regular federal court system are appointed for life . 
they can file a chapter 7 case , in which they forfeit most of their assets in return for cancellation of most debts and a debt-free `` fresh start. '' or , they can file a chapter 13 case , in which they get to keep most of their property but must agree to repay a portion of their debts over a period of time . 
some advocates for changing the system have contended that these provisions should be rewritten to address a kind of moral laxness in bankruptcy practices . 
`` when you have seen a system that has gone from a few hundred thousand cases to 1.5 million last year -- most of that increase during the fat years of the clinton administration -- you must conclude something is not right , '' said edith h. jones , a federal appellate court judge in houston who served on a blue-ribbon panel to review bankruptcy law in the 1990s and is widely believed to be seen as on president bush 's short list for a position on the supreme court . 
`` people have been encouraged to see bankruptcy as an easy way out of uncomfortable situations , '' jones said . 
overhaul proponents have also said that the new measure is so narrowly cast that it would affect no more than 15 pecent of bankruptcy filers . 
those who are above the median and have the means would no longer be allowed to file under chapter 7 and wipe out most of their debts , but would have to file chapter 13 cases and agree to a repayment plan . 
however , largely overlooked in the debate has been a series of proposed changes in chapter 13 that critics say would make it harder for debtors to stick with repayment plans -- the opposite effect of what supporters say they want . 
they cite a study by the nonpartisan american bankruptcy institute , which concludes that only about 3 percent of those who wipe out their debts in chapter 7 could afford to repay a portion in chapter 13 . 
but critics say the courts ' success with chapter 13 is threatened by several little-noticed elements of the proposed legislation : under current law , those who file under chapter 13 must repay car loans only up to the amount the car is worth at the time they enter court , or they risk losing the vehicle . 
and , according to bankruptcy experts , it means that auto lenders are treated on an equal footing with other `` secured '' creditors -- they are promised repayment only to the value of the item they could repossess . 
under the new measure , debtors would have to pay the full amount on any vehicle purchased within 2 1/2 years of bankruptcy , or risk losing the vehicle . 
`` that 's going to be a big deal , '' predicted a. thomas small , a bankruptcy judge for the eastern district of north carolina in raleigh . 
many bankruptcy judges say debtors who come before them often do not have enough income to make both sets of payments . 
`` if you 're confronted with a mountain of debt and have no hope of getting out from under it , you 're either going to go underground or turn to crime , '' said kenneth n. klee , a former republican congressional staffer who was one of the chief authors of the last major bankruptcy law change in 1978 and now teaches law at ucla . 
`` loads of people have filed bankruptcy -- mark twain , buster keaton , walt disney , '' said lundin , the nashville-based bankruptcy judge . 
`` it 's part and parcel of the american dream. '' mr. speaker , while this bill fails to improve the bankruptcy system , the bill succeeds in being harsh , punitive and mean-spirited . 
national guard and reservists make up nearly 40 percent of those serving in the iraqi theater . 
as for the bill , instead of addressing real causes of bankruptcy , this bill rewards irresponsible corporate behavior and fattens the already large profits of the credit card industry . 
there are now 5 billion credit card solicitations a year stuffed into our mail boxes and many targeted at teenagers with no jobs , no income , no visible means of support to pay these credit card bills . 
instead , we have a situation where it is mean and harsh to those who can least afford to pay back and gives opportunity to the wealthiest , the wealthiest , and corporate abusers of the system . 
mr. speaker , i thank the gentleman for yielding me this time , and i rise in strong support of the rule and the death tax repeal permanency act of 2005 . 
it was 17 years ago today at the too-young age of 58 that my father , ed pence , passed away . 
he was a small business owner that many on the floor of the congress today would classify as a rich american . 
now , the rich american that i saw was a man who started out in a very small business in columbus , indiana , and worked tirelessly to raise his four sons and two daughters and build a business that employed several hundred local people in support of their families . 
it is really , with the memory of my father in mind , that i rise in vigorous support of the permanent repeal of the death tax . 
because while my family was reeling from the grief of the loss of my father to a sudden heart attack 17 years ago today , also we were settling into the reality that much of what he had built , all of which he had already paid taxes on , was now subject to as much as a 47 percent estate tax . 
my father 's death and the business that he built and the resources that he had husbanded , after paying all of his debts and all of his taxes , should not have been subject to another tax . 
and we come into this well today on behalf of small business owners and family farmers just like my dad to put to an end permanently this truly immoral death tax in america . 
it is the reality out there , not the heated rhetoric of rich versus poor , that explains why 89 percent of small business owners favor permanent repeal . 
in fact , they know that more than 70 percent of family businesses do not survive to a second generation ; 87 percent do not make it to a third generation . 
much is made of middle america that i am proud to represent and the fact that main streets and courthouse squares are largely boarded up . 
well , i put the majority of the blame in practical terms at the doorstep of the death tax . 
so in the tender memory of my father , of his earnest labors , and with it in my mind the men and women who to this day labor to raise their families and build small businesses and family farms all across america that i extol the authors of this bill . 
i endorse the rule , and i vigorously support the permanent repeal of the death tax . 
the estate tax level attached at $ 600 , 000 per individual at the beginning of this decade . 
so that , as my colleague from west virginia talks about the concern of estate tax on small businesses and farms , that may have been more the case at that time . 
the estate tax level attaches at $ 1.5 million per individual , $ 3 million per couple , and obviously the number of estates that would have tax consequences has fallen significantly . 
by the end of the decade , it moves to $ 7 million . 
looking across this country , 99.7 percent of estates in this country no longer have estate tax issues under the substitute that i am advancing . 
that is 997 out of 1 , 000 . 
there are a couple of other differences . 
it is one-quarter of the cost of the majority proposal , $ 290 billion , that they are talking about . 
i represent family farms and small businesses all across the state of north dakota . 
i am telling you , if we set this level at $ 6 million per couple , to move to $ 7 million by the end of the decade , we largely take care of the problem . 
right now in the handling of an estate , there is no capital gains tax . 
again , at a total budget cost of $ 290 billion over the first 10 years and more than $ 800 billion over the second 10 years . 
at a time when we are talking about how we address the long-term solvency of social security , to just , without a concern , pass a $ 290 billion bill to help three-tenths of 1 percent of the most affluent in this country seems to be standing priorities directly on their head . 
the very people that favor privatizing social security , which is going to add risk in the social security benefit , which is going to reduce benefits sharply because they change the inflation index going forward , that is going to reduce the benefits on our children and grandchildren , want to now run up the debt on our children and grandchildren in order to help that three-tenths of 1 percent , the very wealthiest among us . 
what kind of sense is that ? 
there is a lot of talk from the other side : where 's your plan ? 
let us start by addressing the problem and making a good deal of it go away . 
if we took the difference , the amount of estate tax revenue over the $ 7 million figure at the end of the decade , and dedicated it to the social security trust fund , we could fill 40 percent of the hole over 75 years , almost make half the problem go away , while preserving benefits , while keeping the inflation adjustment that our grandchildren need . 
i think in the consequence of our floor discussions today it is important to talk about both concepts , the immediate and certain estate tax relief alternative that we are advancing and what we could do with the difference . 
i can think of something even more unfair , and that is cutting the benefits of social security to our children and grandchildren . 
we can make estate tax go away for 99.7 percent of the people in this country , take the balance between the bills , invest it in the social security trust fund and deal with almost half of the problem of the underfunding over the next 75 years . 
it is important that we talk about real facts today and , honest to goodness , some of the language does not reflect what reality would be relative to the estate tax if you would pass the pomeroy substitute and set it at $ 6 million per couple , taking care of , making estate tax completely go away for 99.7 percent of the people in this country . 
clearly , that language does not match the facts of the proposal that we have advanced . 
we heard about the immorality of taxing for the wealthiest three out of the 1 , 000 estates in this country . 
i believe another immorality is on the floor today , and that is the immorality of privatizing social security and reducing the benefits of social security for our children and grandchildren . 
an essential part of the social security debate is changing the inflation index that would reduce the benefit for our subsequent generations . 
if you take $ 290 billion out of the budget for the wealthiest three out of 1 , 000 , you impact the ability to fix social security for everybody else . 
that would fill 40 percent of the unfunded liabilities . 
well , by dedicating the sums that we capture with this three-tenths of 1 percent , we could fill 40 percent of the hole on social security . 
let us make the estate tax go away for 99.7 percent of the estates in this country . 
let us not impose new capital gains taxes at the time of estates , and let us dedicate the difference to addressing social security . 
it brings us almost halfway there in terms of keeping all of the guarantees , while meeting the funding challenge over the next 75 years . 
mr. speaker , i am pleased to begin the presentation of the amendment in the nature of a substitute by yielding such time as he may consume to the distinguished gentleman from maryland ( mr. hoyer ) xz4001890 , the minority whip . 
mr. speaker , i reserve the balance of my time . 
mr. speaker , i yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from oregon ( mr. blumenauer ) xz4000330 , the other member of the earl caucus of this house . 
mr. speaker , it is a privilege to carry this debate today on behalf of the minority , and a privilege to participate with the gentleman from missouri , who is one of my favorite members of the house . 
he asked relative to a number of estates , would they be covered under the pomeroy substitute ? 
well , i believe that a number of them would have their estate tax problems completely eliminated , because we take the exemption and we double it . 
we go from today , a joint estate at $ 3 million , and we say , if you have a joint estate of $ 6 million , no estate tax . 
so as to the question he asked , i do not know the particulars of those cases , but i expect that a number , if not all of them are covered , because 99.7 percent of the estates in this country are under that amount . 
but there is a feature of the majority proposal that is not represented in our substitute , and i want to talk about it right now , and this involves the imposition of capital gains liability at the handling of an estate under the majority bill . 
i can just imagine members in the majority , some of them that might have signed that `` no new tax '' pledge that was going around last congress , just wringing their hands because they are about to vote for a tax increase , a tax increase in the form of capital gains taxation on estates . 
section 541 of the bill that the majority proposal would make permanent reads this way : termination of step-up in basis at death . 
number of estates today with capital gains issue , zero ; and that is because the taxable basis in the property is established at time of transfer in an estate . 
it means going back in and trying to establish what the value of the property was at the time mom and dad acquired it . 
it was delayed from implementation and then repealed retroactively because of its consequences . 
the cattlemen 's association , one touted as one of these that want to re-establish capital gains on estates , they say , because of its complexity , carryover base is impossible to comply with . 
it will increase the tax burden and compound the illiquidity of estates of farmers , ranchers and other family business operators who sell inherited property in the normal course of business , and i quote , and find it in the record from the national cattlemen 's association . 
so says the national federation of independent business , the very group that they have cited as trying to re-establish carryover basis in the tax code and put capital gains back on estates . 
mr. speaker , i reserve the balance of my time . 
you know , anyone in the accountant or tax-planning profession worrying about losing business because of the estate tax is going to be smiling broadly at the end of tonight when we pass this re-creation of capital gains tax and estates . 
the problems identified in the report include unequal treatment of capital losses , difficulty in applying basis adjustments to property sold during the administration of the estate , treatment of property with debt and excessive basis , treatment of installment loans , unequal treatment of pension assets , administrative problems with allocation to spousal property , discrimination in favor of spouses in community property states . 
even a cursory examination of that report leads to a conclusion that serious problems exist with the new rules and that their surface simplicity is quite misleading . 
let us just walk through some of the titles , some of the titles of the new capital gains law that they are going to have : basis increase for certain property ; limit increased by unused built-in losses and carryovers ; spousal property basis increases ; qualified terminable interest property ; definitions and special rules for application of subsections ( b ) and ( c ) ; fair market value limitation ; coordination with section 691 ; information returns , et cetera . 
mr. speaker , i reserve the balance of my time . 
mr. speaker , in light of the imbalance of time , i would be happy to have my friend from missouri burn up a little more of his time , unless he has no further speakers . 
mr. speaker , i believe we are at the end of our time , and i yield myself the balance of the time to close our side . 
none of us know . 
there is not a nickel 's worth of certainty in that . 
and we all know , because as damaging as this is to the budget in the first 10 years , with $ 290 billion of revenue loss , debt service added , this is a $ 326 billion hit to the budget in the first 10 years , look what happens in the second 10 years : $ 1.3 trillion impact in the second 10 years when we count the value of the debt service . 
do any of us think that we are really going to allow this to happen in the future years ? 
it deals with the estate tax issues of 99.7 percent of the population . 
those of my colleagues looking at this chart may not be able to see this tiny red line , because that is what three-tenths of 1 percent represent with looking at the total population , three out of 1 , 000 , and we know that on average those estates are going to average $ 15 million . 
so for three-tenths of 1 percent we offer an alternative that has no capital gains , that is one-quarter of the cost , that immediately phases in estate tax relief and is far and away the superior way to go . 
mr. speaker , i yield back the balance of my time . 
i am proud to be a part of the committee on rules , which reported out a very balanced rule that allows both sides to be heard on this issue . 
there is disagreement about the numbers and the number of people for whom it should go away , our side believing that it should be totally repealed , the other side believing that there are a certain number of people who should be exempt from paying this . 
taxes have already been paid on the assets subject to the taxation under the death tax during the lifetime of the owners . 
it amounts to a second bite of the apple for the government . 
with the repeal of the tax , more small businesses and farms will stay in the hands of those families . 
currently , the death tax is a leading cause of dissolution . 
and we see this all the time in agriculture , that when the grandparents die they have to sell off a portion of the land so that the government gets their share so that they break up the very asset that made that farm what it was . 
they eliminate the opportunity for that next generation to participate even though they worked on it themselves , growing up , paying their way through school , helping to support all of the family efforts . 
that is a great cause of the loss of rural communities and small-time agriculture in this country , and i think that we can all agree that that is a shameful loss to our nation . 
they form the backbone of our rural heritage . 
the death tax is a virtue tax in the sense that it penalizes work , penalizes savings and thrift in favor of large-scale consumption . 
mr. speaker , 87 percent of family businesses do not make it to the third generation . 
this is especially true of businesses that are land-rich and cash-poor . 
that is what we call it in the south , mr. speaker , where you have all of your assets tied up in things . 
mr. speaker , i urge that we adopt the rule and continue forward with the repeal of this scurrilous tax on death . 
instead of investing money on productive measures such as creating new jobs or purchasing new equipment , businesses and farms are forced to divert their earnings to tax accountants and lawyers just to prepare their estates . 
they 're owned by hard-working families who pay their taxes , create jobs and contribute not only to the quality of life in their communities , but to this nation 's rich heritage . 
is it so much to ask that they be able to pass on the fruits of their labor -- their small business or their family farm -- to their children ? 
mr. speaker , today , congress has the opportunity to finish the task of preventing corporate malfeasance by agreeing to pass s. 256 . 
in addition , this bill prohibits people convicted of felonies like securities fraud from claiming an unlimited exemption when filing for bankruptcy , protecting taxpayers from having to bear the cost of corporate malfeasance . 
it also guards against fraud and abuse by requiring that high-income debtors who have the ability repay a significant portion of their debts do so , preventing them from sticking responsible borrowers with their tab . 
it accomplishes all of this while preserving the ability of people who truly need to discharge their debts to do so . 
this long-overdue legislation will reform the critically-flawed bankruptcy process , and prevent affluent filers from gaming the system and passing on their bad debt to hard-working families while preserving the ability of people who truly need to discharge their debt through bankruptcy to do so . 
by agreeing to this legislation , congress will make the existing bankruptcy system a needs-based one and correct the flaw in the current system that encourages people to file for bankruptcy and walk away from debts , regardless of whether they are able to repay any portion of what they owe ; and it does this while protecting those who truly need protection . 
i commend my colleagues for their hard work on this legislation , and i strongly urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this report and help honest taxpayers by closing the loopholes in the current bankruptcy system . 
mr. speaker , i rise in strong opposition to the so-called bankruptcy abuse prevention and consumer protection act of 2005 . 
the only thing that this bill does is distort our bankruptcy laws so that working families are treated more like criminals than people in need of relief . 
but this bill does the exact opposite of that . 
instead of helping struggling families in debt , this bill erects harsh legal and monetary roadblocks for people who are trying to file bankruptcy . 
the vast majority of people who file for bankruptcy , 9 out of 10 , do so because they have either lost their job , suffered a medical emergency , or there has been a divorce or separation in their family . 
we are talking about some of the 1.6 million families who have lost their private-sector jobs since 2001 when a republican administration took over the white house . 
it is harmful to struggling families and goes against the basic policy of our bankruptcy laws , helping families in financial trouble get a fresh start . 
i urge every member of the house to stand by america 's working families by voting no for passage of s. 256 . 
mr. speaker , this is actually one of the more absurd debates that i have ever heard in my life , and i think anybody who turns on the television and wonders what is going on here in congress will then conclude that the reason that this institution is held in so low regard is because we have debates like this . 
study after study shows that real wages for american workers are going down ; and in the last 4 years , 4 million more americans have entered the ranks of poverty . 
ceos of large corporations now make 500 times what their workers make . 
in america today we have the most unfair distribution of wealth and income in the history of our country and of any major country on earth . 
are we going to stop the hemorrhaging of decent-paying jobs going to china ? 
the richest people in america said several years ago , hey , yes , we are worth billions of dollars . 
mr. speaker , we are here debating an issue that has zero impact on 98 percent of the american people . 
all of the estate tax is paid by the wealthiest 2 percent . 
if their proposal passes , half of the benefits go to the richest one-tenth of 1 percent . 
they are raising prescription drug fees for our veterans , and they want to charge a $ 250 co-pay for veterans of wars who enter the va hospital . 
they are increasing our deficit , increasing our national debt , all on behalf of the richest people in this country . 
this bill is bought and paid for by millionaires and billionaires , and anyone who votes for it should be ashamed of themselves . 
mr. speaker , i rise today with the gentleman from ohio ( mr. strickland ) xz4003900 to offer this motion on behalf of our brave citizen soldiers who are risking their lives for us and then , as a thank you , risking their homes and their businesses , too . 
our motion simply shields financially distressed national guard and reservists from the means test found in s. 256 while they are in service and for the 2 years after they have transitioned back to civilian life if a substantial portion of their debt is due to their service . 
this motion is a narrow protection for those who suffer financial hardship , financial disaster , as a direct result of serving our country . 
regardless of members ' position on the overall bill , we owe it to those who risk their lives and their livelihoods to prevent financial catastrophe caused by their service . 
according to the national guard , 4 out of 10 members of the guard and reserve forces lose income when they leave their civilian jobs for active duty . 
there is no reasonable way they could have financially anticipated and prepared for those extensions of their service . 
some face the reality of losing their homes , as this cartoon depicts : tie a yellow ribbon around the old oak tree , and for some of those returning from iraq , it is a foreclosure sign around their house . 
many guard and reservists are self-employed or run small businesses and face the daunting task of reestablishing their businesses after their release from active duties . 
since 9/11 , approximately 470 , 000 guard and reservists have been called to active duty , tens of thousands more than once . 
some of these patriotic americans are facing financial crisis not because they are exploiting loopholes in the bankruptcy law , they are not scheming to avoid paying their debts , they are in a financial hole their country dug for them . 
the special circumstances and sacrifices of guard and reserve forces require that we not make recovery even harder for them . 
dear representative conyers : the disabled american veterans ( dav ) is a nonprofit organization of more than one million veterans disabled during time of war or armed conflict . 
the dav is the official voice of our nation 's service-connected disabled veterans , their families , and survivors . 
on behalf of the dav , i ask you please keep in mind the sacrifices of the brave men and women of our armed forces as you consider s. 256 , the bankruptcy abuse prevention and consumer protection act of 2005 . 
specifically , disabled veterans who incur debt during the initial 24 months following completion of active duty should not be subject to the bankruptcy means test . 
mr. speaker , i object to the vote on the ground that a quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not present . 
mr. speaker , what the gentleman suggested was , if someone has overwhelming medical bills , hundreds of thousands in medical bills , that they can file under chapter 7. that is not true . 
every dime they have got after food and rent will go to all of their bills . 
mr. speaker , pursuant to house resolution 211 , i call up the senate bill ( s. 256 ) to amend title 11 of the united states code , and for other purposes , and ask for its immediate consideration in the house . 
mr. speaker , i rise in support of s. 256 , the bankruptcy abuse prevention and consumer protection act of 2005 . 
this legislation consists of a comprehensive package of reform measures pertaining to consumer and business bankruptcy cases . 
the current system has created a set of incentives that encourage opportunistic personal filings and the abuse of a bankruptcy system originally intended to strike a delicate balance between debtor and creditor rights . 
this legislation represents the most comprehensive reform of the bankruptcy system in more than 25 years . 
as many of us know , bankruptcy reform has been subject to exhaustive congressional review for more than a decade , beginning with the establishment of a national bankruptcy review commission in 1994 . 
it is important to note that over the course of the last four congresses , the house has passed bankruptcy reform on eight separate occasions by overwhelming and bipartisan margins . 
central to these reforms is a merit-based test that reflects the commonsense proposition that those who are capable of repaying their debts after seeking bankruptcy relief must actually repay their debts . 
of critical importance , the legislation prevents deadbeat parents from abusing the bankruptcy system to shirk their child support obligations . 
with respect to these reforms , the national child support enforcement association stated that s. 256 is `` crucial to the collection of child support during bankruptcy. '' some might ask why congress has been so concerned about abuse in the bankruptcy system . 
as a result , every abusive bankruptcy filing impacts hard-working americans in the form of higher interest rates and increased costs of goods and service . 
our economy and the hard-working americans who sustain it should not suffer any longer from the billions of dollars in losses associated with abusive bankruptcy filings . 
s. 256 will provide the tools to crack down on bankruptcy petition mills , which often misrepresent the benefits and risks of bankruptcy relief . 
it will impose heightened standards of professional responsibility for attorneys who represent debtors . 
it will require certain credit card solicitations , monthly billing statements , and related materials to include important disclosures and explanatory statements on a broad range of credit terms and conditions , including introductory interest rates and minimum payments . 
the bill includes protections for medical patients in bankruptcy health care facilities and pro-privacy provisions that protect against the unwanted disclosure of personal information . 
there are several other critical reforms contained in this comprehensive legislation , but the limits of time prevent an exhaustive recitation . 
we have before us legislation that represents the culmination of a decade of legislative toil and persistence . 
it is the product of extensive bicameral and bipartisan compromise and was approved by the other body by a vote of 74 to 25 . 
we also have before us a historic opportunity to return a measure of fairness and accountability to the bankruptcy system in a manner that will curb bankruptcy abuse while rewarding the vast majority of hard-working americans who play by the rules and pay their bills as agreed upon . 
mr. speaker , before closing , i include for the record a supplemental statement acknowledging the hard work of many members and staff who have helped make this legislation possible , as well as a summary of the principal provisions of this bill . 
beginning with my colleagues in the house , i would like to mention the many contributions of the chairman of the subcommittee on commercial and administrative law ( mr. cannon ) xz4000590 for his hard work on behalf of this legislation . 
the chairman of the financial services committee ( mr. oxley ) has also been a great resource . 
i also appreciate the contributions of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle , the ranking member of the judiciary committee ( mr. conyers ) and the gentleman from virginia ( mr. boucher ) . 
in addition , i would like to mention the following staff on the judiciary committee for their contributions : phil kiko , majority committee general counsel and chief of staff ; rob tracci , chief legislative counsel and parliamentarian ; raymond smietanka , chief counsel , subcommittee on commercial and administrative law ; perry apelbaum ; david lachmann ; matt iandoli , legislative director for representative cannon ; todd thorpe , chief of staff for representative cannon ; laura vaught , deputy chief of staff for representative boucher ; jean harmann , house legislative counsel and dina ellis , counsel for the house financial services committee . 
the vital and indispensable efforts of one staff member have uniquely contributed to the bankruptcy reform legislation we consider today . 
her technical expertise in a complex area of law has resulted in dramatic improvements in successive drafts of bankruptcy reform legislation and helped establish a record of legislative history that elucidates the legislation we consider today . 
her professionalism , attention to detail , and commitment to serving the house of representatives deserves the recognition and commendation of this house . 
i would also like to acknowledge the countless contributions of our colleagues in the other body . 
this legislation has also benefitted from the hard work and devoted assistance of numerous senate staff members . 
in addition , the following individuals must also be acknowledged : harold kim and tim strachan , counsels for senator specter ; perry barber , rene augustine , and former staffer makan delrahim , counsels for senator hatch ; and ed pagano , chief of staff for senator summary of principal provisions of s. 256 , `` the bankruptcy abuse prevention and consumer protection act of 2005 '' abuse prevention : s. 256 instills a greater level of personal responsibility by closing various loopholes and eliminating incentives in the current bankruptcy system that encourage opportunistic consumer bankruptcy filings and abuse . 
the bill 's needs-based provisions target , for example , those debtors who have a demonstrated ability to repay their debts and channels them into a form of bankruptcy relief that requires debt repayment . 
debtors who have committed crimes of violence or engaged in drug trafficking will no longer be able to use bankruptcy to hide from their creditors . 
likewise , deadbeat needs-based reforms : s. 256 implements an income and expense analysis to determine whether a debtor has a demonstrated ability to repay a significant portion of his or her debts . 
if a debtor has the ability to repay debts , he or she must either be channeled into a form of bankruptcy relief that requires repayment or risk having the bankruptcy case dismissed as an abusive filing . 
the debtor may rebut the presumption of abuse by demonstrating special circumstances warranting additional expenses or income adjustment . 
spousal and child support protections : s. 256 prioritizes the collection and payment of spousal and child support in bankruptcy cases by giving these claims the highest payment priority ( current law gives these claimants an only 7th level payment priority ) . 
the bill requires bankruptcy trustees to give child support claimants important information about the availability of state child support enforcement assistance and to notify the proper state child support enforcement authorities of the deadbeat parent 's bankruptcy filing . 
s. 256 allows various enforcement actions to be brought against a bankrupt deadbeat parent , including the withholding of his or her driver 's license , or the suspension of the debtor 's professional or occupational license . 
it also allows state child support enforcement agencies to intercept closes the `` mansion loophole '' for greedy corporate culprits : under current bankruptcy law , debtors living in certain states can shield from their creditors virtually all of the equity in their homes . 
in light of this , some debtors actually move to these states just to take advantage of their `` mansion loophole '' laws . 
in addition , s. 256 requires a debtor 's homestead exemption to be reduced for to the extent attributable to the debtor 's fraudulent conversion of nonexempt assets ( e.g. , cash ) into a homestead exemption . 
promotes greater certainty in the financial market place : s. 256 reduces systemic risk in the banking system and financial marketplace by minimizing the risk of disruption when parties to certain financial transactions become bankrupt or insolvent . 
while current bankruptcy law has a specialized form of bankruptcy relief -- chapter 12 -- that is specifically designed for family farmers , its benefits for farmers are limited because of its restrictive eligibility requirements . 
the bill responds to this problem in several key respects : it more than doubles the debt eligibility limit and requires it to be periodically adjusted for inflation ; it lowers the requisite percentage of a farmer 's income that must be derived from farming operations ; and it gives farmers more flexibility with respect to how certain creditors can be repaid . 
as a result , many more deserving family farmers facing financial hard times will be able to avail themselves of chapter 12 . 
in addition , s. 256 makes chapter 12 a permanent component of the bankruptcy laws and extends the benefits of this form of bankruptcy relief to family fishermen . 
transnational insolvencies : in response to the increasing globalization of business dealings and operations , s. 256 establishes a separate chapter under the bankruptcy code devoted to transnational insolvencies . 
these provisions are intended to provide greater legal certainty for trade and investment as well promote the fair and efficient administration of these cases . 
privacy protections : under current law , nearly every item of information supplied by a debtor in connection with his or her bankruptcy case is made available to the public . 
s. 256 prohibits the disclosure of the names of the debtor 's minor children and requires such information to be kept in a nonpublic record , which can be made available for inspection only by the court and certain other designated entities . 
in addition , if a business debtor had a policy prohibiting it from selling `` personally identifiable information '' about its customers and the policy was in effect at the time of the bankruptcy filing , then s. 256 prohibits the sale of such information unless certain conditions are satisfied . 
protections for employees : s. 256 requires certain back pay awards granted as a result of the debtor 's violation of federal or state law to receive one of the highest payment priorities in a bankruptcy case . 
in addition , s. 256 streamlines the appointment of an erisa administrator for an employee benefit plan , under certain circumstances , to minimize the disruption that results when an employer files for bankruptcy relief . 
in light of the disaterous impact that bankruptcy cases like worldcom and enron have had on their employees , reforms that more than double current the monetary cap on wage and employee benefit claims entitled to priority under the bankruptcy code . 
other provisions would protect retirees in cases where chapter 11 debtors mr. speaker , i reserve the balance of my time . 
mr. speaker , i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from utah ( mr. cannon ) xz4000590 , the chairman of the subcommittee on commercial and administrative law . 
mr. speaker , i reserve the balance of my time . 
there is a means test that is contained in this bill , but 11 united states code , section 1307 which permits the conversion of a chapter 13 case to a chapter 7 case is not amended at all in any respect . 
1307 ( a ) : `` a debtor may convert a case under this chapter to a case under chapter 7 of this title at any time . 
any waiver of the right to convert under this subsection is unenforceable. '' so if chapter 13 is such a straight jacket , the way out is through the conversion as provided for in section 1307 . 
mr. speaker , once again the opponents of this legislation are not correct . 
the united states government has stood behind everybody who has a service-connected injury or disability and pays for the medical treatment out of taxpayers ' money because that is the right thing to do . 
mr. speaker , i reserve the balance of my time . 
mr. speaker , i reserve the balance of my time . 
mr. speaker , i reserve the balance of my time . 
mr. speaker , i yield myself the balance of my time . 
mr. speaker , one does not need to get a good grade in economics 101 to realize that those who pay their bills as agreed end up having to pay for the cost of debts that are ripped off in bankruptcy . 
the number of bankruptcy filings has exploded . 
the number of proven instances of people gaming the system and using bankruptcy as a financial planning tool has gone up , and this bill stops those types of abuses . 
i would like to quote from page 4 of the committee report from testimony that was given by professor todd zywicki , and he said , `` like all other business expenses , when creditors are unable to collect debts because of bankruptcy , some of those losses are inevitably passed on to responsible americans who live up to their financial obligations . 
every phone bill , electric bill , mortgage , furniture purchase , medical bill and car loan contains an implicit bankruptcy tax that the rest of us pay to subsidize those who do not pay their bills . 
exactly how much of these bankruptcy losses is passed on from lenders to consumer borrowers is unclear , but economics tell us that at least some of it is . 
we all pay for bankruptcy abuse in higher down payments , higher interest rates and higher costs for goods and services. '' the credit union national association , which is a national organization of nonprofit credit unions that are owned by their members , said that , as of 2002 , they lost over $ 3 billion from bankruptcies since congress started its consideration of bankruptcy reform legislation in 1998 ; and cuna estimates that over 40 percent of all credit union losses in 2004 will be bankruptcy related , and those losses will total approximately $ 900 million . 
now the credit unions are not the big issuers of credit cards . 
they are owned by their members , and those members have to pay additional costs of the services of their own credit unions because of the huge write-offs that have been described in this report . 
now if my friends on the other side of the aisle were so concerned about bankruptcy abuse and the fact that this bill does not deal with the problem , they could have spent the time drafting an amendment in the nature of a substitute . 
if this bill goes down , eight states and the district of columbia will continue to have an unlimited homestead exemption where corporate crooks can hide their assets from bankruptcy in a homestead and , once they get their discharge , sell that mansion and go off on their merry way . 
we have heard an awful lot about asset protection trusts that become the law in a number of states . 
page 506 of the bill contains a new section on fraudulent transfers and obligations that says that anybody who creates one of these trusts within 10 years of the date of filing can have that transfer voided if such a transfer was made to a self-settled trust or similar device , such transfer was made by the debtor , the debtor is the beneficiary of the trust or similar device , and the debtor made the transfer with actual intent to hinder , delay , or defraud any entity to which the debtor was or became , on or after the date such transfer was made , indebted . 
they drew a random sample and , of 5 , 203 debtors , 54 percent listed no medical debt . 
those that did , medical debt accounted for 5.5 percent of the total general unsecured debt ; 90.1 percent reported medical debts of less than $ 5 , 000 ; 1 percent of the cases accounted for 36.5 percent of the medical debt ; and less than 10 percent of all cases represented 80 percent of all reported medical debt . 
in the last congress , the congress enacted the servicemembers civil relief act , public law 108-189 , which gives protection to people on active duty from collection of these debts by those that they have become indebted to , and this law puts a cap on interest at an annual rate of 6 percent on debts incurred prior to a person 's entry into active military duty service . 
it is a good bill , but it plugs a lot of loopholes that abuse has been generated under , and it does provide protection for medical debts and to our service people . 
mr. speaker , i yield back the balance of my time . 
people who fall behind the lines of the needs-based test will continue to have bankruptcy protection under chapter 7 as is provided in the current law . 
crs and even the new york times recognized that the servicemembers civil relief act of 2003 provides a broad spectrum of protection to servicemembers , their spouses and their dependents ; and the revised statute , according to the new york times , is clearer and more protective than the old one . 
already there is in law , signed by president bush in 2003 , we have responded to the special financial burdens that members of the military may encounter . 
there is a cap on the interest rates of 6 percent . 
it clarifies that the balance of interest for the period of the servicemember 's military service is to be forgiven by the lender . 
there are restrictions on cancellation of life insurance and more flexible options to allow servicemembers on active duty to terminate residential and automobile leases . 
congress has already passed a law that provides those types of protections . 
mr. speaker , i yield back the balance of my time . 
listening to the debate that we have listened to from the other side , the sole argument seems to be that it only applies to a small amount of our population , the wealthiest among us . 
i am in favor of the hulshof bill to repeal the death tax simply because it is the right thing to do . 
to go in and tax almost half of someone 's estate because they have accumulated a lot and to make death an incident of taxation is wrong . 
mr. speaker , i rise in support of h.r. 8 , the death tax repeal permanency act , although the base bill does not address the estate tax in the manner i believe to be most prudent . 
because estate and gift taxes have had devastating effects on small businesses -- many of which are forced to liquidate assets simply to pay taxes ranging from 35 to 55 percent of the value of the business -- i think we need to provide significant relief in this area . 
in the last congress , i voted for today 's base bill because if it is not enacted the estate tax , which is being phased-out over a period between 2001 and 2010 , will return in 2011 with an exemption of just $ 675 , 000 and a top rate of 55 percent . 
while my first choice would be to significantly increase the exclusion and lower the top rate , i believe full repeal is preferable to the return of this onerous tax . 
mr. chairman , i rise in support of s. 256 , the bankruptcy abuse prevention and consumer protection act . 
it is a basic principle of commerce in our country that when a person makes an obligation to pay someone for a good or service , they do so . 
when creditors are unable to collect money owed to them , we all pay the cost in the form of higher costs , higher interest rates and higher downpayments . 
those who earn wages and have the ability to repay , however , will be required to file for chapter 13 bankruptcy , restructure their debt and repay a portion of it . 
i have heard from a number of my constituents concerned about high credit card rates , predatory loan practices and identity theft . 
mr. speaker , this bill shows the courage to boldly go where none have gone before , to levels of public debt and levels of trade deficits that no nation has ever tried , higher than any have dared . 
we have a dollar that is dependent upon our fiscal markets , a trade deficit that grows every year ; and the result of this bill and its twin cousins and related siamese twins , the other parts of the republican tax and spend or borrow and spend policy , will be a declining dollar and a declining economy or a dollar that crashes and an economy that crashes . 
and this courage is all summoned up on behalf of the one quarter of 1 percent of american families it is designed to help . 
mr. speaker , i thank the gentleman from north dakota for yielding me this time and perhaps for mentioning what i see as the only good part of this bill . 
to eliminate a tax that applies to only 1/4 of 1 percent of america 's families . 
they want to vote for a bill that takes $ 290 billion out of the treasury in its first 4 plus years and about $ 70 billion a year thereafter and make it impossible for the federal government to ever give any relief for those other taxes . 
it is a bill to shaft 99 and 3/4 percent of all american families . 
republican after republican has come up here and boasted how the passage of this bill will slash charitable giving . 
so it is not just a loss to the federal treasury , it is a loss to our hospitals and a loss to our universities , who are strangely silent on this bill because they are afraid of angering 1/4 of 1 percent of the families in the united states who happen to be a huge chunk of their donors . 
let us look at this from the standpoint of a widow , a surviving spouse . 
it is part of an overall republican tax package . 
now these republican tax policies have caused the president of the united states to call into question our intent and ability to pay u.s. government bonds . 
this bill is part of an overall plan that keeps in effect the electrical tax , the sales tax , the telephone tax , the income tax , the payroll tax , the marriage tax , the cable tax , and the fuel tax . 
and it is part of an overall plan that , well , i ought to write a commercial because there is a lot of public policy commercials out there , and i ought to write them for them . 
our families and our country are better off when they keep more of what they earn . 
no one should be taxed throughout their lifetime and then have their property retaxed at the time of their death . 
companies absorb the cost of unpaid debts by passing along these costs to consumers . 
many of these filings are legitimate attempts by debtors to pay their debts and obtain a fresh start . 
mr. speaker , i rise in strong opposition to s. 256 , legislation that will make it harder for individuals to eliminate their debts after liquidating most of their assets by filing bankruptcy . 
thousands of women and their children are affected by the bankruptcy system each year . 
women who lose a job , have a medical emergency , or go through divorce make up more than 90 percent of the women who file for bankruptcy . 
this legislation 's means test provision would require even the poorest filers -- struggling single mothers , elderly women who are victims of scam artists -- to meet complicated filing requirements to access the bankruptcy system . 
in addition , the bill would make it much harder for women to collect child support payments from men who file for bankruptcy because the bill gives credit card companies , finance companies , auto lenders and other commercial creditors rights to a greater share of the debtor 's income during and after bankruptcy . 
it increases the rights of creditors while making it harder for single parents and others facing financial crises . 
this bill will do nothing to reduce the number of bankruptcy filings or address the problem of record-high consumer debt . 
instead of giving a handout to credit card companies , we should ensure that americans losing their jobs or struggling with medical debt have a second chance for economic security . 
another huge tax cut or break for the less than 1 percent of the richest americans while they turn their back and cut medicaid , refuse to recognize that social security is not in crisis but needs some adjustment , cut head start , cut programs for housing , cut programs for the environment , fail to provide the promised benefits to our 140 , 000 servicemen in iraq , turn their back on all that is american to give a few dollars to the very richest of americans . 
i find that many of the republicans who have actually worked for a living at some point in their lives , and not just either inherited money or been at the trough of the government , actually oppose this bill . 
$ 300 billion over the next 10 years and perhaps another $ 700 billion over the decade following that are going to be frittered away to a very small number of americans . 
we could get rid of the doughnut hole in the poorly constructed medicare drug benefit . 
and while we may help a few very rich children with an inheritance , we will cut hundreds of thousands of children 's medicaid benefits . 
we could cover a large portion of the 45 million people who are without health insurance , i might add 8 million more than when president bush took office . 
now , if you eliminate this , you are only going to help probably less than a couple thousand people a year , and they will arguably have by 2009 estates of over $ 7 million . 
i might add to my friend from missouri of his people in the lumber business , if their children can not get the first $ 7 million handed to them and then get a 50 percent down payment on the balance of the business and be given 10 years at less than 6 percent to pay off the balance of that , they are probably too dumb and would lose the business in no time at all anyway . 
so what the current law allows is so generous , and there have been absolutely no instances , not one , of a family farmer or family business being lost , decimated or put on the auction block because of the estate tax . 
in fact , 99.7 percent of all estates would be exempt from the estate tax if we just extend the tax as it applies in 2009 . 
they can only show that gives billions , $ 300 to almost $ 1 trillion over 20 years , to the very smallest , most select group of rich people in this country . 
it is indeed a follow on of the republican mantra , give money to the rich , give it to them in huge amounts and cut back on education , cut back on health care , do not help the environment , cut back on support for our troops and cut back on improving america 's infrastructure , all in the name of helping the few rich who may be contributors to the republican party . 
i urge that my colleagues vote for the gentleman from north dakota 's ( mr. pomeroy ) xz4003230 who will offer a responsible substitute , which will at least keep the $ 300 billion from being squandered , and it will prevent this bill , which does nothing to help hardworking americans or small businesses , and i hope we can bring some sanity back to the financial code and to the economic future of this country by not passing this bill . 
mr. speaker , i reserve the balance of my time . 
mr. speaker , i reserve the balance of my time . 
mr. speaker , i yield the balance of my time to the gentlewoman from california ( ms. pelosi ) xz4003140 . 
mr. speaker , i support this motion to recommit because it provides added financial protections for veterans , military personnel and their families who are enduring financial hardships as a direct result of serving this country . 
additionally , this motion to recommit offers help to members of the reserves and national guard who all too often must leave behind their family jobs and businesses . 
it is simply a reaction to a real problem that has been highlighted in countless news stories , by the national military families association , disabled veterans of america , and individual servicemembers . 
it had nothing to do with the theory that the gentleman from massachusetts ( mr. neal ) xz4002910 spoke so eloquently about , and that is to keep 3 percent or 1 percent of the people from owning 99 percent of our country . 
we did not want to be like england where whoever got control of the land and money , and 1 , 450 still had it 26 generations later and people who were hardworking could not break through that ceiling because of the nobility that was enshrined in their tax code . 
it is because , as i look in the faces of these young people , you are looking at a house , a senate and an administration that has embarked since 2001 on the most radical , irresponsible financial riverboat gamble that this country has ever seen . 
there has been no political american leadership that has ever done what this group of people who currently hold the power of government here in washington have done to this country . 
since april of 2001 , in your name and mine , this government has borrowed $ 1.2 trillion in hard money . 
what that means to us is that we have transferred , at only 4 percent interest , $ 50 billion a year from programs like social security , like health care , like armor for our troops , from veterans , to health care , to education , all the things that will give the citizens of this country a chance , an opportunity to be whatever it is their god-given talents give them , we have transferred $ 50 billion a year from that to interest . 
eighty-four percent of this $ 1.2 trillion has been borrowed from overseas . 
eighty-four percent of this interest check is going overseas . 
a former official of the people 's bank of china , the country 's central bank and now an economist in hong kong , was recently quoted as saying that the u.s. dollar is now at the mercy of asian governments . 
in your name , we are borrowing at the rate of $ 13 , 300 a second . 
what we have done has created a financial vulnerability vis-a-vis the rest of world that is every bit as big a security interest as anything else we are going to face in the future . 
mr. speaker , in pertinent part , section 202 of s. 256 , the `` bankruptcy abuse prevention and consumer protection act of 2005 , '' amends section 524 of the bankruptcy code by making the discharge injunction inapplicable to certain acts by a creditor having a claim secured by a lien on real property that is the debtor 's principal residence , so long as the creditor satisfies certain criteria . 
first , the creditor 's act must be in the ordinary course of business between the creditor and debtor . 
second , such act is limited to seeking periodic payments associated with a valid security interest in lieu of pursuit of in rem relief to enforce the lien . 
under current law , however , some secured creditors stop sending monthly billing statements or payment coupons for fear of violating the discharge injunction . 
mr. speaker , i rise to register my opposition to the total repeal of the estate tax . 
if we want to talk about values , as so many people did in the last couple of months leading up to this , let us talk about the value of supporting one 's family and supporting one 's community . 
let us talk about the values of responsibility and fairness . 
eighty percent of court cases are commercial in nature . 
the securities and exchange commission is our tax money trying to make large corporations behave and treat each other well instead of cheating each other . 
the fact of the matter is that this bill absolves the top three-tenths of 1 percent from their responsibility to pay their fair share . 
and i say the top three-tenths of 1 percent because the democratic alternative would exclude the first $ 3.5 million , or $ 7 million for a couple . 
so much for the argument of small farms and small businesses . 
they would not pay a dime on the first $ 7 million and only pay a portion of anything above that . 
the fact of the matter is that most of the money that is going to be taxed on that top three-tenths of 1 percent was not earned money . 
it is money they got by appreciation , just the value of that property increasing over time . 
to compensate for what these members of our society will not be paying as their fair share , small businesses , the people that go out and create payrolls , will have to pay more . 
mr. speaker , let me just close by saying they are robbing us of opportunity and prosperity and community by attacking our education and our health , our clean water , and our clean air . 
all of this because they want to give america 's princes and princesses a little break at the top three-tenths of 1 percent . 
mr. speaker , i am cosponsor of the death tax repeal permanency act of 2005 because this tax is an unfair burden on american families . 
three of my constituents , jenell ross ; her mother , norma ; and her brother rob , run a small business , ross motor cars in centerville , ohio . 
when jenell 's father unexpectedly passed away in 1997 , the ross family received a tax bill for nearly half the value of their family business . 
she says , `` 30 years ago my father took the chance of a lifetime . 
like a lot of people , my father thought he would live forever . 
`` when he died unexpectedly in 1997 , the overwhelming responsibility of keeping the family business afloat fell squarely '' to us . 
we could never have prepared ourselves for the shock of receiving a tax bill nearly half the value of the dealership , where nearly 90 percent '' of the assets were `` tied up in nonliquid assets such as inventory , equipment , buildings , and land . 
in recent years , colorado has been one of the states with the greatest increase in bankruptcy filings . 
so , i am not opposed to any change in the current bankruptcy laws , and in fact i think some of the bill 's provisions would make reasonable adjustments in those laws . 
in particular , i think that the bill should have been amended to more appropriately address the financial problems being encountered by some members of the regular armed services as well as by members of the national guard who have been called to active duty in iraq or elsewhere . 
if the motion to recommit had prevailed , the bill would have been amended to exempt from the means test at least those national guard and reservists whose debt resulted from active duty service or was incurred 2 years of returning home from their service . 
for me , this is a very serious matter and the lack of such an amendment is one of the main reasons i can not support the bill . 
i think it still needs work -- and because of both its shortcomings and the refusal of the leadership to permit consideration of any changes , i can not support it . 
mr. speaker , thank you for allowing me the opportunity to offer my remarks today regarding s. 256 , the so-called `` bankruptcy abuse prevention and consumer protection act of 2005. '' the issue of bankruptcy reform is extremely important and it is critical that we pass a measure that will ensure greater personal responsibility of debtors , as well as ensure that credit card companies and other creditors take responsibility for their irresponsible lending . 
these amendments would have addressed the impact that this bill would have on groups such as disabled veterans returning from iraq , single parents , families experiencing a catastrophic medical event , and people who are victims of identity theft . 
this continued smothering of the democratic process by the majority is shameful and must stop . 
as to the substance of the legislation , it is no secret that the number of bankruptcies has risen considerably in the past twenty years . 
the number of filings has dropped 3.8 percent in 2004 down to 1.59 million . 
s. 256 is full of provisions that i adamantly oppose . 
it is these creditors who subsequently grant these individuals higher levels of credit at high interest rates . 
it is the creditors who saddle these individuals with insurmountable levels of debt . 
i would like to reiterate that i strongly support the principle of increased personal responsibility for debt , but i believe this bill does more harm than good . 
i believe we would be better served if we could fully debate the merits of this legislation , as well as substantive amendments that were disallowed from consideration by the full house . 
mr. speaker , the passing of this bill would be a complete detriment to the american people . 
for many americans find themselves , usually through no fault of their own , facing bankruptcy . 
americans file for bankruptcy usually due to catastrophic medical expenses , divorce , or the loss of their jobs . 
more specifically , one loophole in the bankruptcy bill leaves the victims of domestic violence and their children left with no resources should they file for bankruptcy . 
please note , this relief would have only been available if a domestic violence debtor is certified , under penalty of perjury , that the debtor was in fact a victim of domestic abuse and that their physical well-being or the physical well-being of the debtor 's child would be threatened if this debtor were evicted . 
mr. speaker , this amendment would have provided a safe harbor for those victims who faced the great threat of more violence and extreme danger if their homes are taken as a result of bankruptcy . 
they send them all of this unsolicited mail , and they telephone them unrelentlessly to get them involved in taking these credit cards . 
some of them are now 30 , 35 years old , out of college for years , still paying on these credit cards because they allowed their minimum payments that do not even take into account all of the interest on the debt . 
it is outright unreasonable that we did not have an amendment allowed by my friends on the opposite side of the aisle to try and protect families and future young families from this kind of exploitation . 
mr. speaker , those of us who started this process 6 years or so ago in the good faith belief that there were problems with the bankruptcy system , in the sense that people were gaming the system , and felt that there needed to be genuine reform can not help but be disappointed today because , in the process , we have lost sight of the objective of reforming to do away with the sinister influences and the advantageous corruption that is going on in the system . 
the result is that individuals who fall below the means test threshold can continue with impunity to game the system without any kind of responsibility , and those who fall above the threshold get subjected to a set of arbitrary rules that , even if they are not gaming the system , they are taken advantage of . 
so we have lost sight of that . 
the second thing is we have built in a set of perverse incentives for easy credit now . 
the third problem is that , as we have gone through this process , the more we have bought into this means test philosophy and debated this , we now get to a point at the end of the process where it has corrupted even our democratic process . 
because we are here on the floor with 30 minutes of debate on our side to tell the public the problems with this bill . 
mr. speaker , i want to express my strong support for h.r. 8 , the death tax repeal permanency act of 2005 . 
i believe it is important that we accomplish the goal of passing this in the house and the senate and seeing this bill enacted into law . 
small business owners and family farmers pay taxes throughout their lifetime , then at the time of death they are assessed another tax on the value of the property on which they have already paid taxes . 
i have spoken in the past about a constituent of mine , danny sexton of kissimmee , fl and owner of kissimmee florist . 
he , like millions of other americans , has experienced the sad realities of the death tax . 
mr. sexton , who comes from a family of florists , inherited his uncle 's flower shop and was faced with paying almost $ 160 , 000 in estate taxes . 
this forced him to have to liquidate all of the assets , layoff workers and take out a loan just to pay the death tax . 
he also had to establish a line of credit just to keep the operation running . 
the death tax is n't a tax on just the rich , it is a tax that hurts family owned businesses -- family owned businesses that are the backbone of this great nation . 
family owned businesses provide and create millions of jobs for american workers . 
the people who worked in mr. sexton 's florist were not rich , but they lost their jobs because of the death tax . 
in a recent survey conducted by the national federation of independent businesses , 89 percent of small business owners favored permanent repeal of the death tax . 
because these small business owners know this tax may mean the death of their business for future generations . 
according to the center for the study of taxation , more than 70 percent of family businesses do not survive the second generation and 87 percent do not make it to the third generation . 
family owned and operated businesses deserve the right to be inherited by the next generation without the blow of the death tax . 
i urge my colleagues to vote for h.r. 8 , the death tax repeal permanency act of 2005 . 
the bill before us preserves that right for those individuals who simply get in over their heads and have no other way out unfortunately , some dishonest individuals have taken advantage of our bankruptcy laws by hiding assets , racking up debt in anticipation of filing for bankruptcy , using bankruptcy as a financial planning tool , and walking away from that which they owe . 
this hurts our economy because it forces retailers and businesses to simply raise the prices of goods and services for honest americans . 
i support s. 256 , the bankruptcy abuse prevention and consumer protection act of 2005 . 
i am a cosponsor of the house version of this bill . 
this common sense legislation preserves the right to file bankruptcy for those who truly can not repay their debts while ensuring that those who do have the ability to repay a portion of their debts do so . 
s. 256 provides the same kinds of bankruptcy reforms the house has approved twice before . 
it restores the principles of fairness and personal responsibility to our bankruptcy system and protects the rights of consumers . 
now lining up for their share and licking their lips is the credit card industry who stands to make billions of dollars at the expense of american consumers . 
with the hope of helping to protect veterans from these regulations , i offered an amendment to this bill to simply waive any fee charged for credit counseling for any servicemember returning from a combat area for a period of 2 years . 
many of these men and women have been away from their families , from their homes , their jobs for long periods of time because of unethical procedures that keep them overseas . 
many of these individuals have lost their businesses , they have lost their homes and they have bills and are going to suffer . 
our veterans , they will suffer because of this bankruptcy bill . 
now lining up for their share and licking their lips is the credit card industry , that stand to make billions of dollars at the expense of the american consumer . 
with the hope of helping to protect veterans from these new regulations , i offered an amendment to this bill to simply waive any fee charged for credit counseling for any service member returning from a combat area , for a period of two years . 
many of these men and women have been away from their families , homes and jobs for long periods of time because of unethical procedures that keep them overseas . 
it is appalling that any veteran would face bankruptcy because of their sacrifice . 
mr. speaker , i rise today as a cosponsor of h.r. 8 to express my strong support for this important legislation to permanently repeal the estate or `` death '' tax . 
the estate tax is one of the most unpopular , destructive taxes collected by the federal government . 
it forces many small businesses and farms to dissolve , undermines incentives for work , savings , and investment , and leads to unnecessary development of environmentally sensitive land . 
by permanently repealing the estate tax , we would be eliminating a cruel tax that devalues the hard work and confiscates the savings of some of our most productive citizens . 
as no one i know can accurately guess which year they might pass on to the hereafter , only one year of complete relief of the estate tax is not only cynical -- it 's bad policy . 
the uncertainty of not knowing whether or not the death tax will really be repealed , makes it difficult for american taxpayers to make plans for their futures , their spouses ' futures , and the futures of their children . 
additionally , the tax increase that would result if congress fails to act would be entirely unfair to many of our constituents . 
on the one hand , i am pleased that the house is once again taking action today to rid our tax code of this punitive measure . 
mr. speaker , i rise today to express my strong support of the death tax repeal permanency act of 2005 . 
as a cosponsor of this important legislation , i think it is absurd for the federal government to continue punishing the families through double-taxation . 
the death tax is one of the most burdensome and counterproductive of all taxes . 
small businesses create two-thirds of all jobs in the united states , and 40 percent of gdp in the united states is generated by small businesses . 
when the owner of a small family business passes away , this tax causes families and small business owners severe financial hardship , often to the point that the business must be liquidated . 
a permanent repeal is good for small businesses , family farmers , and the next generation of entrepreneurs . 
mr. speaker , i urge my colleagues to vote for the repeal of the death tax . 
mr. speaker , i rise today in support of the bankruptcy abuse prevention and consumer protection act of 2005 . 
i came to congress to promote the ideals of freedom , security and prosperity . 
embodied within these principles is the duty of the american people to take responsibility for their actions -- including control of one 's personal finances and investments -- without undue influence from the federal government . 
our credit markets have been undermined on a daily basis because of the abuse of the existing laws . 
all too often , people run to the shelter of bankruptcy to escape the consequences of their actions , all to the detriment of the rest of society . 
mr. speaker , as a supporter of the bankruptcy abuse prevention and consumer protection act , i encourage my colleagues to vote for this well-balanced measure that will protect those individuals who need a fresh start while cracking down on abuse of the system . 
it remained through the 1920s and 1930s under the rationale that we should prevent the accumulation of wealth , an issue more than addressed with our current anti-trust laws . 
the death tax has become a harmful relic of previous times . 
it survives through the inertia of government and now has the consequence of punishing hard work and success . 
the death tax is fundamentally unfair and violates what should be our principle of freedom and liberty and the imperative of personal property rights . 
freedom and liberty demand that hard-working americans be able to leave their children and their grandchildren the results of their diligence and their success and not have washington get a windfall . 
i urge all of my colleagues to act positively today on behalf of all americans and let the death tax die for good . 
mr. speaker , i rise today in support of this rule and h.r. 8 . 
i applaud the efforts of the leadership and the gentleman from missouri in bringing forward h.r. 8 to finally bury the death tax once and for all . 
one thing i have learned in the short time i have sat here is that the democrats really look at the person whom this bill would affect , and , by the way , i do not think any of them are watching this on tv right now because they are all probably at work , but they are looking at the person whom this bill would affect as someone who got up early , worked hard all his life , looked after his family , built infrastructure , saved money , put capital back into this system , provided jobs , benefits , health care for people , and the democrats look at this individual as a gift who keeps on giving . 
one of the things our country needs is individuals who are willing to work hard and save their money . 
it is the basis of our economy and the american dream . 
this country is a wonderful land of opportunity . 
it allows people who earn that money to keep more of it in their pocket . 
we have seen this in the reagan tax cuts that led to the boom of the 1990s and in this president 's tax cuts that have brought us out of the recession that this country experienced after 9/11 . 
and most times the assets of a family business are not in cash , or easily so . 
when a family business is hit with an estate tax , it often requires the selling of a large amount of inventory or other assets in order to pay the debt . 
that hurts families who want to continue the legacy of their loved ones who have passed away . 
the death tax has made crooks out of honest people because they have to search for all kinds of ways to avoid paying the tax . 
more than 70 percent of small family businesses do not last beyond the second generation , and the estate tax plays a large part in that . 
having someone pay half of their assets to the government is absolutely wrong no matter what is being paid . 
one of the things i hate more than anything is a double tax . 
when the government takes its bite out of the apple , it should not get a second bite . 
yet the death tax takes an even bigger bite out of the money that has already been taxed . 
economic studies have shown that the cost of trying to comply or avoid the death tax consumes as much out of the economy as is generated by the death tax itself . 
if their assets are not in cash , as in most family businesses they are not , they have to make a huge burden and sacrifice that they are not ready for by having to get somebody else to advise them about how to take care of their families and their children . 
and in spite of all this , the death tax does not even generate that much revenue or `` windfall profit '' for the government , yes , a `` windfall profit '' for the government , while placing this huge burden on the families of this country . 
the idea of the tax coming back in 2011 is amazing . 
getting rid of the death tax will simplify our nation 's laws and ease the burden on our country . 
if it takes a cpa or a lawyer to figure out what one is trying to do and what burdens the government has put on them , then it is too much of a burden . 
although i was not in congress when the phase-out of the death tax began , i am thrilled to be here today to cosponsor and vote for it to be completely eliminated . 
and i urge all of my colleagues to do the same . 
mr. speaker , i strongly support h.r. 8 , the death tax repeal permanency act of 2005 , and encourage my colleagues to pass this important legislation . 
this vital legislation will permanently repeal the estate tax , a tax that is unjust , inefficient , and harmful to small businesses , the backbone of our economy . 
repeal of the death tax will create a system that is more equitable and more productive for our economy . 
in louisiana , our family-owned farms have been faced with decreasing profitability and in many instances the death tax is an additional burden that they can not carry ; this tax is a leading cause of the dissolution for thousands of family-run businesses across the country . 
since the 1930 's , revenue from the tax has fallen steadily as a percentage of total federal revenue . 
the rate of taxation is as high as 47 % , and this is in addition to the taxes that were already paid on the assets subject to this tax . 
i urge congress to act today to permanently repeal the death tax and ensure that our future generations will be able to carry on the heritage of our forefathers . 
mr. speaker , today i voice my strong support for the death tax repeal permanency act of 2005 . 
the death tax is an unreasonable and unfair burden on thousands of american families , small businesses , and family farms . 
the death tax is the largest threat to the vitality of family-owned businesses and farms because most of their owners have the entire value of their business or farm in their estate . 
the federal government currently receives nearly half of an estate when the owner passes . 
as a result , more than two-thirds of family businesses do not survive the second generation and nearly 90 percent do not make it to the third generation . 
as my colleague , representative sam johnson of texas , said : americans receive a birth certificate when they are born , a marriage license when they are wed , and a tax bill when they die . 
i encourage my colleagues to vote `` yes '' for the death tax repeal permanency act of 2005 . 
mr. speaker , we have heard a lot of rhetoric here today , and some of it a bit disingenuous . 
i think it is a bit disingenuous to say in a loud tone , demanding an answer to some rhetorical question , and then demand , well , i hear none , when all of us here are observing the rules and not interrupting . 
i bought this music box at an irs auction where the irs forced the sale of everything she owned . 
they accumulated about 2 , 500 acres of farm and ranch land . 
she died in july of 1986 , and shortly thereafter land was dumped on the market . 
times were rough , and the value of the land that was around $ 2 , 000 an acre when she died went to $ 600 or $ 700 an acre . 
they gave a couple of extensions or so . 
the irs required the sale of every acre of land that they owned . 
they sold every item out of her home . 
mr. speaker , today i rise in support of permanently repealing the death tax . 
i could tell you many stories about families that were forced to borrow large sums of money or sell off or parcel out their farms or businesses , dividing their families . 
it is time we removed this financial burden from the backs of those pursuing the american dream . 
republicans on the rules committee blocked the consideration of several amendments offered by me and my colleagues to this bill . 
one of the amendments blocked was the amendment i offered which would put passenger security fees into two funds that will guarantee that tsa will spend the authorized amounts of $ 650 million a year and $ 250 million for the installation of inline baggage screening systems and passenger checkpoint explosive detection , respectively . 
given that these security investments are financed by the existing passenger security fee , the congressional budget office has determined that the increased investment does not increase the size of the deficit . 
in april , the department of homeland security inspector general ( dhsig ) and the government accountability office ( gao ) both released reports that indicate that our airport screening system still needs improvement . 
last year , the 9/11 commission specifically recommended that the tsa and the congress improve the ability of screenings checkpoints to detect explosives on passengers . 
108-458 ) authorized $ 250 million for the research and deployment of advanced passenger screening technologies , such as trace portals and backscatter x-ray systems . 
the recent dhs ig report clearly stated that the `` lack of improvements since our last audit indicates that significant improvement in performance may not be possible without greater use of technology. '' further , the tsa concurred with the 9/11 commission recommendation that we must `` expedite the installation of advanced ( in-line ) baggage screening equipment. '' in addition , in-line baggage screening systems have a much higher throughput than stand-alone systems . 
if we install in-line systems , more bags will be screened by explosive detection systems instead of less reliable , alternative methods . 
the tsa and airport operators rely on commitments in letters of intent ( lois ) as their principal method for funding the modification of airport facilities to incorporate in-line baggage screening systems . 
the tsa has issued eight lois to cover the costs of installing systems at 9 airports for a total cost to the federal government of $ 957.1 million over 4 years . 
in total , the gao reports that 86 of 130 airports surveyed are planning or are considering installing in-line baggage screening systems throughout or at a portion of their airports . 
while $ 650 million is authorized for the installation of in-line baggage screening systems , annual appropriations have not allowed for any new lois to be signed .

p & gt ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; ( 2 ) purposes of regulations. -- the regulations shall be consistent , to the extent the secretary determines appropriate , with and not duplicative of other federal regulations and international agreements relating to the shipping of extremely hazardous materials and shall require -- & lt ; p & gt ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; ( a ) physical security measures for such shipments , such as the use of passive secondary containment of tanker valves and other technologies to ensure the physical integrity of pressurized tank cars used to transport extremely hazardous materials , additional security force personnel , and surveillance technologies and barriers ;

p & gt ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; ( 2 ) content. -- the report under paragraph ( 1 ) shall include -- & lt ; p & gt ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; ( a ) information specifying -- & lt ; p & gt ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; ( i ) the federal and state agencies that are responsible for the regulation of the transportation of extremely hazardous materials ; and & lt ; p & gt ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; ( ii ) the particular authorities and responsibilities of the heads of each such agency ; and & lt ; p & gt ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; ( b ) an assessment of the vulnerability of the infrastructure associated with the transportation of extremely hazardous materials. & lt ; p & gt ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; ( 3 ) form. -- the report under paragraph ( 1 ) shall be in unclassified form but may contain a classified annex. & lt ; p & gt ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; ( d ) definitions. -- in this section , the following definitions apply : & lt ; p & gt ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; ( 1 ) extremely hazardous material. -- the term `` extremely hazardous material '' means -- & lt ; p & gt ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; ( a ) a material that is toxic by inhalation ; & lt ; p & gt ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; ( b ) a material that is extremely flammable ; & lt ; p & gt ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; ( c ) a material that is highly explosive ; and & lt ; p & gt ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; ( d ) any other material designated by the secretary to be extremely hazardous . 
( 2 ) area of concern. -- the term `` area of concern '' means an area that the secretary determines could pose a particular interest to terrorists. & lt ; p & gt ; 
many , many pilots are willing to volunteer to undergo rigorous training to certify themselves as federal flight deck officers to become the last line of defense on our planes . 
most americans are under the impression that all of their baggage is being screened . 
some of it is being hand searched . 
some of it is being trace searched . 
some of it is being looked at . 
some of it is being loaded on the plane . 
and some of it is going through very sophisticated in-line explosives detection systems , and we have the numbers . 
where those systems exist , we can find threat objects , explosives a very , very high percentage of the time . 
where those systems do not exist , there is a very disturbing lack of detection of test objects , threat objects , explosives . 
the last wakeup call we are probably ever going to get before the day when planes start falling out of the sky was in russia where two terrorists , women , boarded planes with explosives , we do not know exactly whether they were in their carry-on bags or whether they were wearing suicide belts , but here in the united states of america we are doing nothing to find suicide belts or explosives in bags . 
we are still using 1980s technology at the checkpoints , technology that was thrown out of the united states capitol more than a decade ago as inadequate to the threat , thrown out of the white house and other places . 
yet aviation was attacked and aviation in russia was attacked by what i think , as does the chairman of the committee , is the most likely future threat , which is explosives . 
we need to move ahead with more robust acquisition of that equipment in the near future and this bill does not mandate that . 
remember , the homeland security department started out of chaos . 
the president refused to create a homeland security cabinet-level position or department until one day when an fbi agent was spilling her guts here in washington , d.c. , to a committee and karl rove wrote out the plan on the back of a napkin . 
congress is just starting to make sense of what the department of homeland security will be in the future . 
mr. speaker , i thank my friend for yielding me this time , and i rise in strong support of this rule and the underlying legislation . 
we all know that september 11 of 2001 changed our lives forever . 
we know that shortly after september 11 the president of the united states stepped up to the plate and put into place this now cabinet-level department of homeland security , but it obviously took a period of time for us as an institution to put together the structure that would allow for adequate oversight . 
at the beginning of this congress , we established a new permanent standing committee on homeland security , and we selected my extraordinarily able colleague , the gentleman from california ( mr. cox ) xz4000830 , to serve as chairman of the committee on homeland security dealing with jurisdictions that fell within a wide range of other committees . 
it is jurisdiction which focuses on a lot of new things for us . 
the fact that when we refer to men and women in uniform on the front line , they are no longer just the men and women in our armed forces , they are now men and women who wear the uniforms of firefighters and law enforcement officers . 
we now have , because of the threat , a greater focus on border security . 
frankly , i will say that we are continuing to work on that , and i urge my colleagues to join in cosponsoring h.r. 98 , which will help us produce a counterfeit-proof social security card so we can diminish the flow of illegal immigration with the magnet of jobs that draws people across our southern border and instead allow our border patrol , which is increased in this authorizing legislation , to focus their attention on criminals and those who pose a terrorist threat to the united states of america . 
with the rule , i am very proud of having had , as the gentleman from texas ( mr. sessions ) xz4003670 so ably said a fair rule , and i am proud of the work he has done . 
he was a member of the select committee on homeland security . 
he was unable to serve on the committee in this congress because of the exclusivity of the committee on rules , but as the gentleman from california ( mr. cox ) xz4000830 pointed out , he is serving as the committee on rules liaison focusing on these very important new homeland security issues . 
one of the things that we can do , as we increase the border patrol , if we can pass h.r. 98 , which will decrease by 98 percent the flow of illegal immigrants across our southern border , is letting the border patrol put their time and energy into trying to diminish the flow of criminals and those who pose a terrorist threat to us . 
but i would note that the rule which has been put together allows for the consideration of 25 different amendments . 
we will be having a full 5 hours of debate on this issue , and i am pleased we made in order a democratic substitute which is 221 pages long , a full substitute which frankly includes many of the amendments that have been proposed by both republicans and democrats . 
a number of those are included in the substitute . 
i am also very proud of the fact that we were with the daughter , son-in-law and grandson of our distinguished ranking minority member , the gentlewoman from rochester , new york ( ms. slaughter ) xz4003780 , and we were able to make in order two amendments which the gentlewoman has proposed to the committee . 
i will say that of those 25 amendments , 13 of them have been offered by democrats , made in order , 10 by republicans , and two are bipartisan amendments with democrats and republicans coming together to deal with this issue . 
we are going to address a wide range of concerns . 
but the mere passage of this legislation , the mere passage of this legislation and moving it to the president 's desk will , i believe , help us address a lot of the concerns that some whose amendments were not made in order have been trying to address . 
mr. speaker , one of the most important responsibilities of this congress is to defend and protect our nation from external and internal terrorist threats . 
some of the vital features of h.r. 1817 , the homeland security authorization act , include funding to train and prepare first responders , improvements in cyber security , improvements in container security and enhanced border security . 
the homeland security authorization act will authorize funding for 2 , 000 new border patrol agents and it requires the secretary of the department of homeland security to develop a plan to coordinate and address duplication problems between the customs and border protection agency and the immigration customs enforcement agency . 
illegal immigration has become a threat to the security of many of our communities , even those not along our borders . 
the problem of illegal immigration has grown in part because local and state authorities have been uncertain of the jurisdiction regarding the apprehension , detention and deportation of illegal aliens . 
a porous border that allows terrorists and the enemies of this nation to pass through undetected is unacceptable . 
mr. speaker , i encourage passage of this rule , passage of the norwood amendment , and passage of the underlying bill to strengthen our borders and protect our homeland from another attack . 
the president of the united states requested $ 110 million for shoulder-fired missile research and development . 
over the past several years , the gentleman from florida ( mr. mica ) xz4002730 , republican chairman of the aviation subcommittee , and i have been working on this issue . 
but it is not just the gentleman from florida ( mr. mica ) xz4002730 and i. it is the state department which released a report saying that shoulder-fired missiles are the leading cause of loss of life in commercial aviation around the world . 
they were used in december of 2003 against an israeli jetliner in kenya . 
there are hundreds of thousands of these systems available around the world in the hands of 27 separate terrorist groups including al qaeda . 
everyone who has studied this issue , the president , the department of homeland security , the state department , the fbi , the cia , the aviation subcommittee , the committee on appropriations , agrees that this threat needs to be addressed . 
we are going to be worried about the end of the aviation industry as we know it and devastating consequences to our economy and the american people will look at what we did on this floor today and ask why we turned our backs on the president 's request , the state department 's urgency , the committee on appropriations , the aviation subcommittee , republicans and democrats , and , most importantly , the flying public . 
i will vote for the bill , but i am hopeful that we can work together on the basis of common sense and proceed to protect the american flying public . 
mr. speaker , i rise in opposition to the structured rule only insofar as it restricts both the number of amendments made in order and the time allowed for debate of such a grave piece of legislation . 
the restrictive nature of h. res. 283 will deprive the american people of debate over the aspects of the proposed legislation that affects them the most . 
h.r. 1817 is the first authorization measure since the passage of the homeland security act of 2003 . 
ruling only a quarter of the 80 amendments offered at the committee on rules meeting does not measure well with the action that the appropriators have taken to hold the department of homeland security ( dhs ) accountable for its unfulfilled reporting requirements . 
the appropriators withheld over $ 700 million from dhs due to these requirements ; therefore , our passage of the most comprehensive and representative measure possible would equate to having conducted `` due diligence '' on our part . 
just yesterday , we in the house passed the appropriations act for fy 2006 , h.r. 2360 , by a margin of 424-1 . 
an open rule for debate on the authorization measure would have continued the spirit of true bi-partisanship . 
today , the committee of the whole will make history by passing its first homeland security authorization measure , and i support an expedient but prudent completion of this endeavor . 
during the 13-hour homeland security committee markup session that ended at 11 : 15 p.m. , i was able to secure sincere commitments from the majority leadership to work with me for inclusion of some of my major initiatives : funding and more clearly defining the citizen corps and the citizen corps councils -- which will include consideration of a stand-alone bill that i will introduce shortly ; and increasing capacity for historically black colleges and universities , hispanic serving institutions , and tribal institutions in homeland security procurement and in employment with the department of homeland security . 
in addition , i was fortunate to have had my amendment , co-sponsored by the gentlelady from california , ms. lofgren , that seeks to authorize the funding of programs for the education of minorities in the areas of cyberscience , research , and development to close the gap in achievement in those areas and to make america better equipped to fight terrorism overall . 
furthermore , i achieved an agreement from the majority committee leadership to collaborate on addressing the mr. speaker , what the house has done this week and will do today will establish the breadth and efficacy of the entire department of homeland security . 
case in point : the cargo security amendment offered by the gentleman from massachusetts ( mr. markey ) xz4002530 and just spoken of by the gentleman from connecticut ( mr. shays ) xz4003700 . 
that being said , today we will consider h.r. 1817 , the first ever authorization measure for the department of homeland security . 
while it is not as far reaching as many of us had hoped , h.r. 1817 takes several critical steps in improving our nation 's security and preparedness . 
it authorizes sufficient funding to hire an additional 2 , 000 border patrol agents , which will help us meet the goal of 10 , 000 new agents over 5 years set forth in last year 's intelligence reform bill . 
the measure also streamlines the background check system for those working in sensitive positions , creates an assistant secretary for cybersecurity , and requires reform of the homeland security alert system so that more specific and targeted information can be provided to those who need it . 
finally , this bill will improve our intelligence and information capabilities by allowing new recruiting tools to attract the best-qualified analysts and mandating increased coordination in the dissemination of threat information to state , local , and private sector officials . 
the rules committee also blocked an amendment by congressmen markey and shays that would have required 100 percent check of cargo on commercial airlines . 
this restrictive rule also blocked 60 other amendments , forty-seven of which were democratic amendments . 
what the rules committee did last night was deny us the opportunity to address the health needs of the heroes of 9/11 . 
one of my amendments was modeled after the remember 9/11 health act . 
this is a bill that would provide medical monitoring and treatment for individuals who are sick or injured as a direct result of the attacks of 9/11 . 
right now we have a 6 , 000-person waiting list just to be a part of this medical screening . 
for the 12 , 000 who have been screened , about 50 percent of them are still sick as a direct result of 9/11 . 
these are men and women who were there for us on 9/11 and now we have turned a cold shoulder to them in their time of need . 
the next amendment i wanted to offer was written by a republican , senator voinovich of ohio , and passed the senate by unanimous consent . 
the amendment realizes that there are times when the health of first responders is at risk , such as during the response to 9/11 , and with a presidential declaration , would establish environmental and health monitoring . 
this amendment is modeled after h.r. 1310 , the protection of civil liberties act . 
the only way we will have a robust protection of our civil liberties is to have a robust civil liberties board . 
by not allowing these and many other amendments , we are restricting the ability of this house to do the business of the american people . 
mr. speaker , under cover of darkness and hidden from public view , the republican-controlled committee on rules cooked up an unwise , unfair and ill-considered rule that shuts out dozens of democratic amendments designed to close dangerous homeland security loopholes that put the american public at risk . 
for example , one of the amendments would have been one made by the gentleman from connecticut ( mr. shays ) xz4003700 and myself which would have ensured that all cargo which is placed upon passenger planes in the united states was screened , so when the people in this gallery and people around the country step on planes they have to take off their shoes , their bags go through , they are screened , their bags are put in the belly of the plane , they are screened , but the cargo , the cargo , which is placed on the very same plane , is not screened . 
we should not put americans on planes where the cargo has not been screened knowing that al qaeda continues to place civilian aircraft at the top of their terrorist target list . 
it is wrong for the republicans not to have a debate about this incredible , glaring vulnerability in passenger aircraft as hundreds of millions of americans put their families on planes , especially as we are nearing the fourth anniversary of 9/11 . 
another amendment , one dealing with the hundreds of thousands of shipments of extremely hazardous materials which go through the cities and towns of the united states every single year . 
this is a photograph of one of those hazardous material shipments within a couple of blocks of the capitol . 
the republicans would not put in order an amendment that would ensure that a rule-making by the federal government would be put in place in order to make sure that we would increase the security for the shipment of these hazardous materials through the cities and towns of the united states of america . 
the gentleman from georgia ( mr. barrow ) xz4006280 and i made a request to the committee on rules , let us debate it out here on the house floor , let us debate if we want to put any additional security protections on something , which , for all intents and purposes , has no security around it as it goes through the cities and towns of the united states . 
no debate on putting cargo into the bay of passenger planes that people fly every single day across america after they have taken off their shoes . 
the republican party is putting a gag on debate on the most important issues that face the security of america and attacks by al qaeda on our country . 
and this issue , especially the issue of cargo on planes , is an absolute reprehensible neglect of the responsibility that congress has for the flying american public . 
once again , they have bent over backwards for big business while putting the safety of the american public at risk . 
last night , on a party-line vote , the republicans in the committee on rules refused to allow the house to consider two important amendments which would have improved safety on airplanes and would have notified the flying public about the safety of the airplanes they fly on . 
i asked the distinguished chairman of the committee on rules why these amendments were not made in order , and all he could say is they decided not to . 
instead of taking action to protect the american public , the committee on rules decided to protect the interest of the airlines and the cargo shippers . 
the gentleman from new york ( mr. israel ) xz4001950 , who i have had the pleasure to work with from the other side of the aisle , crafted legislation which was incorporated into the intelligence reform bills . 
one of the titles of that bill that the president signed , dealing with the threat and the direction of congress towards trying to deal with the problem of manpads , and that is shoulder-launch missiles , and the threat that they posed . 
one of the things that we did was to try to move that project forward . 
sometimes in homeland security we spend a lot of money and we do not get a great deal of results . 
i view , as chairman of the house subcommittee on aviation , one of the greatest threats that we face other than a suicide bomber or several of them getting on planes , which they can easily do in our flawed system today , i view the second greatest threat as shoulder-launch missiles . 
with the conflict in the world , particularly in the middle east , thousands of these shoulder-launched missiles have gone on the market . 
so we worked to , one , curtail the number of shoulder-launched missiles ; two , encourage international treaties , develop ground-based systems , and this bill does something towards that . 
we started a program several years ago when we saw this threat and we tried to do our best to move forward development of a commercial shoulder-launched missile . 
this bill unfortunately limits the amount of money that can be spent on moving that program forward . 
ladies and gentlemen of the house , we have been very fortunate so far and we can not be remiss in making available the best technology to protect the traveling public . 
not that we have to hang one of these on every commercial aircraft , but we will be remiss if we do not carry this program that has already started forward . 
i look forward to working with the gentleman from california ( mr. cox ) xz4000830 and others as they take on the responsibility of protecting not only the homeland but the flying public . 
mr. speaker , i congratulate the chairman of the homeland security committee for his success last week on legislation to improve the first responder grant program and again today for bringing bipartisan consensus legislation to the house floor . 
if there is one lesson we should learn from the events of 9/11 , it is that our enemies are fighting an unconventional war against us . 
hardening the cockpit door , establishing new protocols to screen passengers , and a number of other measures are a prudent response to deny terrorists the use of commercial aircraft as a weapon . 
representatives barrow , markey , and oberstar have crafted thoughtful responses to a threat that has not been fully addressed : rail security and the transportation of hazardous cargo on our rail system . 
the measures needed to address transit security differ from aviation , but this should not be used as a justification for not providing an infusion of additional funds to address already identified high priority needs . 
for transit and rail , deterrence is only one part of the strategy , additional resources are also needed to mitigate the impact of a potential terrorist attack and hasten the recovery after an attack . 
allocating additional resources towards improving response and recovery times can save lives and lessen the economic consequences of an attack . 
enhanced detection capabilities , communications equipment and redundancy in critical operating control functions could allow for a quicker shutdown and evacuation of a passenger rail transit system exposed to multiple attacks thereby significantly reducing the causality rate . 
mr. chairman , a 30-ton chlorine tank rail car , if ruptured , could kill thousands of people unfortunate enough to be within a few miles downwind of the attack . 
local emergency responders in urban areas with potential targets of key infrastructure and national icons understand this threat , but are limited on what they can do to prevent an attack . 
should they patrol hundreds of miles of track and rail yards or take some measures under some circumstances to reroute hazardous traffic around what we know are high probability targets ? 
today , there still is no clear understanding of what hazardous material security plans have been developed . 
if they exist , they are not being shared or discussed with the very people , local officials and emergency response planners , who have the best information on the local geography , vulnerabilities and potential set of targets . 
today , local officials are being told by the railroads and the department of homeland security to `` trust us. '' i get nervous when someone i do n't know tells me to `` trust '' them . 
the laws on the books today did not envision hazardous cargo as a weapon of mass destruction , and under current law interstate commerce trumps local ordinances to suspend or redirect hazardous cargo . 
mr. speaker , each member of this house knows that when we go on vacation , one of the first things that we want to do is get a map so that we know where we are going and know the stops we are going to make and have a general idea of what is facing us on this vacation . 
mr. speaker , several members of the law enforcement caucus were discussing the issues of border security because we know we have been talking a lot about securing our borders . 
well , yesterday , my colleagues , the gentleman from michigan ( mr. stupak ) xz4003910 , the gentleman from texas ( mr. ortiz ) xz4003020 , and myself offered an amendment at the committee on rules that would have required the department of homeland security to develop and begin to carry out a comprehensive , long-term border strategy to secure this nation 's borders . 
the amendment would have expanded what is already in place , called the `` american shield initiative , '' to ensure that every inch of the borders is monitored at all times , either through technology or resources . 
we all know that since 9/11 , we have acknowledged that we need to increase the number of border patrol agents and immigration inspectors and , but congress literally has been picking figures seemingly out of thin air as we go through wanting to secure the border . 
we do not have that kind of strategy . 
mr. speaker , by direction of the committee on rules , i call up house resolution 283 and ask for its immediate consideration . 
mr. speaker , for the purpose of debate only , i yield the customary 30 minutes to the gentlewoman from new york ( ms. slaughter ) xz4003780 , my friend , pending which i yield myself such time as i may consume . 
during consideration of this resolution , all time yielded is for the purpose of debate only . 
mr. speaker , the rule before us today is a fair , structured rule that provides for 1 hour of general debate , equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the committee on homeland security . 
it provides that in lieu of the amendments recommended by the committee on homeland security , the committee on energy and commerce , and the committee on the judiciary now printed in the bill , the amendment in the nature of a substitute printed in part a of the committee on rules report shall be considered as the original bill for the purpose of amendment and shall be considered as read . 
it waives all points of order against the amendment in the nature of a substitute printed in part a of the committee on rules report and makes in order only those amendments printed in part b of the committee on rules report . 
they shall be considered as read , debatable for the time specified in the report equally divided and controlled by the proponent and an opponent , and shall not be subject to amendment or a demand for the division of the question in the house or in the committee of the whole . 
finally , this rule waives all points of order against the amendments printed in part b of the committee on rules report and provides for one motion to recommit with or without instructions . 
mr. speaker , i rise today in strong support of this rule and its underlying legislation , the first ever homeland security authorization legislation . 
the rule before us today is a fair rule that will allow for consideration of 25 amendments to the legislation , 13 of which are sponsored by a member of the minority party , 10 by members of the majority party , and two which enjoy bipartisan sponsorship . 
this bill , brought to the floor today by the leadership of my friend , the gentleman from california ( mr. cox ) xz4000830 , and the ranking member , the gentleman from mississippi ( mr. thompson ) xz4004021 , empowers the core mission of the department of homeland security , which is , first , to prevent terrorist attacks within the united states ; second , reducing america 's vulnerability to terrorism ; and , third , responding to and recovering from terrorist attacks if some tragedy does occur . 
through the authorization of over $ 34 billion in homeland security spending in 2006 , this legislation will ensure that our nation 's highest funding priorities are met . 
it also includes a number of other legislative and oversight measures to strengthen and improve the safety of americans here at home , including : deploying counterterrorism technologies within 90 days so that federal , state , local , and private sector officials can prevent domestic terror ; funding 2 , 000 additional border patrol agents ; assessing the effectiveness of operations at the departments of customs and border protection and immigration and customs enforcement so that spending on these programs is efficient and effective ; consolidating the current background check system , so that individuals can be prescreened by checking their names and biometric identifiers against terrorist watch lists and other criminal databases ; adopting risk-based cargo screening , and expanding the number of foreign ports where customs and border patrol agents screen incoming containers from 36 to approximately 50 ports ; improving information analysis and infrastructure protection recruiting ; improving nuclear and biological intelligence ; establishing a one-stop shop within the department of homeland security for reliable , comprehensive , and accessible open-source intelligence information and analysis ; providing better information to local leaders by requiring that any threats be communicated in a manner that limits confusion and operational conflicts ; clarifying the color-based threat system so that specific information is given directly to regions , states , localities , and private sector industries ; creating a national terrorism exercise program to coordinate and establish minimum standards for all federal , state , and local terrorism drills ; and providing for greater federal , state , and local homeland operations collaboration that needs to take place . 
by providing leadership and guidance on these issues and many others , chairman cox and his committee have provided this house with a product that i believe is effective in providing for the security of our homeland , which deserves the support of every single member of this body . 
mr. speaker , i reserve the balance of my time . 
mr. speaker , i yield myself such time as i may consume to say that it makes me so proud to hear the gentlewoman from new york talk with glowing admiration not only about how important this homeland security bill is but about the hard work that went into it and how it became a part of a better product . 
the chairman , the gentleman from california , not only listened to them but he worked with the chairman of the committee on homeland security , the gentleman from california ( mr. cox ) xz4000830 , on perfecting this bill by adding in amendments . 
as i mentioned earlier , mr. speaker , there are a large number of amendments that were added to this , perfecting the bill , perfecting the process , but more importantly giving an opportunity for members of this body to make sure , from their own perspective , that homeland security became more effective by providing the information that was needed to address their local communities . 
mr. speaker , i am pleased to yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from california ( mr. dreier ) xz4001150 , the chairman of the committee on rules . 
mr. speaker , i yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from indiana ( mr. souder ) xz4003850 , chairman of the subcommittee on criminal justice , drug policy and human resources . 
mr. speaker , i yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from florida ( mr. mica ) xz4002730 , the chairman of the subcommittee on aviation . 
we have had a number of our colleagues make observations , just as the gentleman from oregon did , about the importance of not only the debate that takes place here in the house but also about our desire to make homeland security even better , more robust , more dynamic , aiming at the threat . 
i am sure we will hear a debate about cargo , cargo ships , thousands of containers that come to this country every day , the commerce of this country that is affected . 
we know that we talked yesterday in the committee on rules about the canadian border and how the canadian border needs the attention that they not only deserve but also with the flow of goods and services with the economies that are affected and products and services that are denied when the backlogs occur . 
each of these has been a part of the arguments , the debates , the discussions that the gentleman from california ( mr. cox ) xz4000830 has taken into account , has made sure that he has taken them to the homeland security department , has spoken with the administration . 
i am proud that this debate , some 5 hours of debate that will take place today about this very important subject where members of congress are able to come down and really identify their specific suggestions that they have . 
mr. speaker , i reserve the balance of my time . 
our next speaker was a part of those thoughtful ideas . 
he not only sat through hours of testimony , quizzing members about their questions and comments , things that would make things better , but also a few ideas himself . 
mr. speaker , as the gentleman has noted , there will be 5 hours of debate today . 
and i am really proud of the time that we have . 
mr. speaker , i have no further requests for time , and i reserve the balance of my time . 
we have doubled the number of air cargo inspectors that would be at the airports to make sure that we are looking at the cargo . 
i would also at this time like to thank the white house and the liaisons that the white house provided to us , brian conklin for his great leadership , chris frech for his hard work with us , and certainly their superstar at the white house , elan elinjg , who took time to make sure that members were updated , not only about the position of the administration , but about how they could work closely with members of congress . 
so i think today has been another successful opportunity for us to begin the 5 hours of debate that will take place today where every member will have an opportunity to come down and express themselves and where we will have a democrat substitute that will be over 200 pages where they are able to express the things which they believe are best . 
members of congress will be able to vote and a decision can be made today . 
mr. speaker , i am proud of this process . 
mr. speaker , i yield back the balance of my time , and i move the previous question on the resolution . 
i know we all have strong feelings about a lot of things , and sometimes someone could say we may not be right but we are never in doubt . 
i think it is an outrage that we do not inspect the cargo that is in the belly of a passenger aircraft . 
first , we started to inspect the carry-on luggage , and americans thought we must be checking baggage on the belly of an aircraft . 
and we worked on an amendment , and we put and got in the bill a few years ago that there had to be deadlines for eventually inspecting all baggage that went in the belly of an aircraft . 
and the gentleman from massachusetts ( mr. markey ) xz4002530 informs me , and i did not know it , that 22 percent of what is in the belly of an aircraft is cargo uninspected . 
if the argument is that we do not have the technology , which we do , or we do not have enough of the technology , which is right , we allowed under the gentleman from massachusetts ' ( mr. markey ) xz4002530 amendment for a 3-year phase-in : 35 percent the first year , 65 in the second , and then 100 percent in the third year . 
but to not even allow a debate on the floor of the house about this issue ? 
i salute both sides of the aisle for this bill . 
we are fighting a new kind of war every day here in america . 
our struggle against terror is one that requires us to focus our resources inward like no time in our history , because today the battlefields are the streets and sidewalks of this country and not some faraway land . 
we have to ensure that our government is prepared to responsibly address any threat that imperils the peace and prosperity of this nation . 
that is why this homeland security authorization bill is critically important , because it represents the blueprint of our homeland defense and our collective peace of mind for many years to come . 
but i would have wished today for an open rule , and we are still faced with serious issues of accountability and trust in the management of the department of homeland security . 
this is in no small part as a result of the bush administration 's unwillingness to fill critical job vacancies at the senior levels of the agency . 
in fact , the department of homeland security has had two secretaries and three deputy secretaries in 2 years . 
today , 42 percent of the high-level political positions inside the agency are vacant or staffed by people who have already announced their departures . 
this lack of stability at the department has impacted the agency 's ability to meet its mandate effectively . 
but it has been stalled by endless bureaucracy and lack of accountability at the department of homeland security . 
but it is not just a lack of accountability that has plagued the agency . 
we recently discovered that the infamous homeland security terror alerts , which were raised so often in the months leading up to the presidential election , and rarely since , if ever , were repeatedly elevated over the objections of the homeland security secretary and his staff . 
that constitutes a violation of trust with the american people , and we can not afford that in this war on terror . 
we ought not to employ the tactics of fear as a means of control in our pursuit to keep the homeland secure . 
such draconian measures are not in keeping with the spirit of america . 
we dare not trade in a currency of fear , but rather should strive to liberate ourselves from fear through awareness of our world and an honest understanding of the challenges which lay before us . 
i know many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle agree on this principle , and i am pleased that the committee has seen fit to include more specific criteria for how the terror alert is and is not to be utilized . 
likewise , the appropriation bill passed yesterday by a nearly unanimous vote also included measures that promise to provide a higher degree of accountability at the agency , accountability that i am sure we all agree is sorely needed . 
despite the serious problems at dhs , which still must be addressed , there is much in this authorization bill that i believe every member of congress will support . 
this funding would mark a welcome change in the administration 's approach to handling border security issues away from an economically disastrous agenda of imposing passport requirements on our citizens who want to cross our northern border and towards a more sensible policy of effective border enforcement , one which maximizes security resources and safeguards the freedoms and options our citizens and our trading partners deserve . 
the house leadership 's decision to include in this rule two amendments of mine suggests there may be room for common ground on the critical border issue after all . 
those of us who represent border economies understand how important the unencumbered flow of commerce across the northern border is to continued economic growth and to prosperity . 
the nexus program , we hope , will reduce the long waits at the border and allow an unprecedented level of security . 
but there are many others , i know , we would all like to debate here on the floor today ; but of 89 , only 25 were ruled in order , which is less than 30 percent . 
our framers thought so , and i think so , and i think most of my colleagues and most americans think so . 
but just as we can not afford to live in fear in this age of terrorism , we also can not fear engaging in genuine debate in consideration of those matters which may be controversial for some , but which are clearly important for the safety of all americans . 
the free flow of debate and democracy are a hallmark of our american values , which this house was designed to embody . 
they are the core values which separate us from those who seek to destroy us and our way of life . 
and here in the cradle of democracy , we diminish those most american of values at our own peril . 
mr. speaker , i reserve the balance of my time . 
mr. speaker , i yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from the district of columbia ( ms. norton ) xz4002950 . 
mr. speaker , the barrow-markey amendment would direct the department of homeland security to promulgate regulations upgrading the security associated with transporting extremely hazardous materials such as chlorine , which is toxic by inhalation , and those materials that are flammable or explosive . 
at this point , mr. speaker , i ask unanimous consent to insert the text of the amendment immediately prior to the vote , and request a no vote on the previous question . 
mr. speaker , i yield back the balance of my time . 
mr. speaker , i object to the vote on the ground that a quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not present . 
this has been a very difficult process , and as the committee on rules along with the gentleman from california ( mr. cox ) xz4000830 , the chairman of our permanent select committee on homeland security on which i also serve , this has been an incredibly difficult process from the time this committee has been organized . 
yet at the same time there are practical reasons , and let me illustrate a few of my own concerns and how i approach this amendment process . 
i withdrew them in front of the committee on rules after talking with the gentleman from california ( mr. cox ) xz4000830 and the other relevant committees . 
one of them is to merge the border protection agency and ice inside homeland security . 
but in fact , the challenge here of inland immigration is somewhat a different problem , as is deportation , from the border question as it relates to homeland security . 
similarly , a second amendment i had on intelligence that is trying to coordinate this proliferation of intelligence agencies , and we seem to create a new one every 6 months , both in congress and in the administration , one or the other of us , and we are getting all this stovepiping and no coordination which is exactly opposite of what the 9/11 commission proposed . 
i believe this rule , by allowing 25 amendments , is clearly identifying the direction of the house . 
i am frustrated that i did not get two of mine in order , but this is a complicated process . 
today is the first step and the committee on rules has made an important first step in allowing 25 amendments , many over the objections of people who are objecting to jurisdiction , and keeping enough out that we can keep a coalition together to show the american people we want to move homeland security bills and this house will not be held up by jurisdictional fights over homeland security . 
as a ranking member of the committee on homeland security , i strongly believe this base bill is deficient in a number of significant areas . 
this 79-page bill fails to address a number of critical aspects of homeland security and does not deliver on the homeland security commitments made in the 9/11 act . 
that is why i , like many of my colleagues in the house , felt compelled to submit amendments to the committee on rules for this bill . 
all told , there were 85 amendments offered , many of them from my colleagues on the committee on homeland security . 
it would have required airport workers to be physically screened before accessing planes in restricted areas of airports . 
the rule also denies consideration of an amendment offered by the gentlewoman from california , this rule also prevents the gentlewoman from the district of columbia ( ms. norton ) xz4002950 from presenting her amendment to close gaps in the public transit and rail system . 
mr. speaker , i have every intention of supporting today 's homeland security authorization bill , but i think this bill could be dramatically improved , especially regarding the rail safety standards that apply to the shipment of extremely hazardous materials in local communities all across our nation . 
three days after i took office this year , an early morning train carrying three rail cars filled with chlorine gas slammed into a parked rail car in the town of graniteville , south carolina . 
this produced a toxic cloud of chlorine and sodium hydroxide that forced 5 , 400 local residents to flee for their lives . 
in all , over 240 people were sickened by the gas and 10 people died because of the accident . 
the long-term effects of the leak are still unknown and the cleanup process continues to this day . 
since the graniteville incident , i have met with a number of safety experts , and i guarantee that if any members of this congress were to sit down with these representatives they would be shocked to learn how many commonsense safeguards are out there that have not been implemented to address rail safety in this country . 
the current safeguards for the transportation of hazardous materials are nowhere near what they need to be . 
it implements coordination and communication plans in the event of an accident or an attack , it develops new technology to make rail cars more resistant to punctures and , most importantly , it requires prenotification for local law enforcement whenever hazardous materials are being shipped through their communities . 
mr. speaker , i rise in support of h.r. 810 , the stem cell research enhancement act of 2005 . 
even worse , many of these lines are contaminated with animal cells that make them unusable for human therapeutic study . 
mr. speaker , the time has arrived for congress to unshackle our researchers and scientists and allow them to expand the number of stem cell lines that are eligible for federally funded research . 
indeed , mr. speaker , our own top scientists and officials at the national institutes of health , nih , have stated that the president 's 2001 limitations have caused us to fall behind in this research field . 
the nih should be leading this cutting-edge research , yet it is in jeopardy of failing in this role should the president 's policy be allowed to continue . 
some states , such as california , are attempting to fill the void left by the lack of federal funding . 
however , mr. speaker , as the director of the nih has warned , this could lead to a patchwork of stem-cell policies , with different laws and regulations which could defeat the type of collaborative research nih is chartered to carry out . 
mr. speaker , h.r. 810 would simply allow federal funding for research on embryonic stem-cell lines regardless of the date on which they were derived . 
also , there must be written consent for donation of the embryo from the individuals for whom the embryo was created . 
finally , the bill calls for the director of nih to issue guidelines to ensure that federally funded researchers adhere to ethical standards . 
mr. speaker , the stem cell research enhancement act of 2005 is needed to ensure that the full promise of embryonic stem-cell research is fulfilled . 
while all stem-cell research is important , the unique ability of embryonic stem cells to give rise to any tissue or cell in the body that makes these stem cells critically important to medical research . 
this bill , which we have already heard today , would reverse the embryonic stem cell policy instituted by the president of the united states in 2001 , and i believe it is very misguided , in my opinion . 
they have already outlined many of the reasons why the bill should be defeated , but i would like to share some additional thoughts . 
however , what we are discussing today is the federal funding of the embryonic stem cell . 
according to the statement of administration policy this morning , the administration strongly opposes passage of h.r. 810 . 
the bill would compel all american taxpayers to pay for research that relies on the intentional destruction of human embryos to obtain stem cells , overturning the president 's policy that supports research without promoting ongoing destruction . 
mr. speaker , reclaiming my time , i rise today to oppose public funding for the destruction of human embryos . 
instead of playing , i stood pondering a troubling dream from the night before . 
it was of a loving father giving his child a name . 
he looked at me with such love and said , `i have given you the name tesia , which means `` loved of god. '' ' `` i awoke to see a wrinkled face with twinkling dark eyes framed by white hair . 
i said , `tesia. '' ' mr. speaker , this building was built by our founders on pillars , but not just pillars of marble . 
oppose public funding which destroys little you 's and me 's , and oppose this harvest of destruction . 
mr. speaker , i am fortunate to represent the university of wisconsin , madison , where dr . 
these cells can be described as the parent cells of all tissues in the body . 
embryonic stem cells open the possibility of dramatic new medical treatments , transplantation therapies , and cures . 
on august 9 , 2001 , the hope and promise of this embryonic stem cell research was greatly curtailed . 
mr. speaker , why are we tying the hands of our scientists who receive nih grants or other federal dollars to support their research ? 
some members on the other side of this debate say their constituents are opposed to their federal tax dollars being used on this groundbreaking science . 
well , i have constituents as well , like young jessie alswager of madison , wisconsin . 
and michelle , like millions of other americans who could be helped by this science , very much want their tax dollars spent on stem cell research . 
i urge support of the castle-degette bill . 
what we are talking about today is whether taxpayer dollars should be used to destroy potential life , and , for me , life must supersede all other considerations , especially for the purpose of medical experimentation . 
i have here the latest issue of time magazine . 
in view of the interest all across america and in view of the fact that tomorrow we are going to be voting on a bill , i thought it might be well this evening to spend a few minutes putting this debate in context . 
our first chart is a depiction of the development of early embryos and then all of the tissues in the body which develop from this embryo . 
the zygote is produced by the union of the egg from the mother and the sperm from the father . 
a stem cell is a cell which has the capability of differentiating into a number of other cells . 
of course , that is the hope of embryonic stem cell research , that we might induce a cell to develop into a tissue , an organ or cells which will be useful in treating diseases . 
this is a very abbreviated depiction of the early development of the embryo because it skips the morula stage , and we will come back to that in a few moments because that is the stage where most of the attention is focused now . 
here we see in the gastrula the development of what we call the germ layers . 
i guess you would say that a cell from each of these three germ layers , a cell from the endoderm , a cell from the mesoderm or a cell from the ectoderm , are all stem cells because they are destined to become a lot of different tissues and organs in the body . 
from the mesoderm develops most of the mass of the body , all of the bones and all of the muscles , the heart , the red blood cells and so forth . 
and then the endoderm , although widely dispersed in the body represents less mass in the body because it is the lining of the lung and the digestive tract . 
now there are cells in all of these that one could say were stem cells . 
tissue , and blood is a tissue , the tissue which has the most obvious stem cell that students were taught at least 50 years ago when i first was studying these things , is the stem cell in the bone marrow from which a number of different blood cells develop . 
in other words , you need to convince the cell that it is not exactly what it is as a result of the development process , that it returns to its original undifferentiated , or relatively undifferentiated state , and then it can make other tissues . 
the embryonic stem cells philosophically certainly hold the most promise because they are cells from which all of the tissues and organs of the body develop . 
there is the rationale then that these embryonic stem cells hold the promise of producing anything and everything that might be needed for fighting diseases . 
we need to differentiate these diseases that result from the action of pathogens . 
there is a very large list of diseases that theoretically might be treated by stem cell application . 
diabetes is one of those . 
it , by the way , represents the largest cost of all the diseases in this country . 
many times during the day and frequently at night they have to prick their finger , their hand , their ear lobe , something in their body to get a drop of blood , and now we have new instruments that require a pretty small drop of blood , and then this new almost miracle instrumentation analyzes that blood to see what the glucose content is so that they know how to set that pump . 
many of them have embedded in their side a little hockey puck size pump that pumps insulin . 
this of all the diseases , mr. speaker , is the one that perhaps most obviously might lend itself to cure through stem cell research . 
and they will not live so long , they will not live so well as the average person in spite of all the miracles of medicine today because insulin does not cure diabetes . 
but if through embryonic or adult , for that matter , if you could do it , stem cell research , if you could develop islet of langerhan cells , you could then put them anywhere in the body . 
the pancreas secretes a large number of enzymes for digestion in the small intestine and the islet of langerhan cells just happen to be resident there . 
there is a long list of diseases : multiple sclerosis , lateral sclerosis , lou gehrig 's disease . 
i have personal familiarity with this because my grandmother died of this a number of years ago , and i remember as a little boy standing by her bedside as she deteriorated and finally the only way that she could communicate with us was by blinking her eyes . 
what happens is that there is a scarring that inhibits the function of these nerves . 
although it was not specifically diagnosed in my mother because she had other ailments that were easier to diagnose , she lived to be 92 and i am sure that she had alzheimer 's because she had many of the symptoms . 
it was really tragic to watch a woman who was very bright and vital lose her ability to remember , lose a sense of proportion , to be calling , roscoe , roscoe . 
i have here a very large number of autoimmune diseases . 
there are 63 of them here . 
i have mentioned a couple of them . 
autoimmune diseases are diseases where the body fails to recognize itself , that is , the parts of the body that have to do with recognizing foreign invaders and assimilating them , ejecting them , killing them . 
very early in our embryonic development , we have a very special kind of life cell which we call t cells . 
there are 6.5 billion of us in the world and these t cells are smart enough to recognize a difference . 
lupus was probably the first widely recognized of these diseases . 
what has happened is that when the body is attacked , the specific tissues of the body are attacked , they degenerate and become not useful . 
there is enormous potential from use of stem cells , whether they are embryonic or adult , to cure many , many diseases . 
we have been working with adult stem cells , mr. speaker , for over 3 decades , and so there have been a fair number of applications to medicine . 
there just has not been time to make those applications , but the fact that there are presently no applications to medicine of embryonic stem cell work does not mean that there will not be and it does not mean that those applications might not be more efficacious than adult stem cell applications . 
there is another very interesting potential that i do not hear often discussed of embryonic stem cells . 
fifty years ago when i was studying and teaching in this area , there was an experiment where the researcher went into a mother black mouse and took a little patch of skin in the uterus from one of her little black babies and then he took that little patch of skin , and he went into the uterus of a white mouse with her white babies , and he cut a little patch of skin out of the white mouse and put in that little patch of black skin and when the white mouse was born with that patch of black skin , it did not reject it . 
this gives the promise , mr. speaker , that there may be less rejection of tissues and organs developed from embryonic stem cells than from adult stem cells . 
the debate that we are going to vote on tomorrow and the debate which was the subject of the special order just before i spoke has to do with whether or not we can effect the needed cures in medicine from adult stem cells or whether we need to move to embryonic stem cells to make this happen . 
early in this debate , i had a personal involvement which was kind of an interesting one . 
they could be two boys , two girls , one of each . 
the mother that ordinarily sloughs one ovum a month this month sloughed two ovums and the sperm , and there are a whole lot of those , millions of them , they found both of them and they fertilized both of them and the uterus was receptive so they both were implanted in the uterus . 
knowing that in identical twinning , regardless at what stage it occurs and it can occur all the way from the two-cell stage clear up to the inner cell mass and there are several stages between these two , but no matter where it occurs , the embryo has lost half of its cells and both parts go on to produce a perfectly healthy baby . 
they said , yes , of course that is possible . 
of course they can go into a relatively large embryo and take out a cell or two . 
and so the president came out with his executive order which said that federal funds could be used in research only on the cell lines that had been developed from embryos that had been killed in the process of developing them , that no new cell lines could begin with embryos that had to be killed . 
this is only with federal money , of course . 
the private sector can do whatever it wishes because there is no law prohibiting the use of embryos . 
i just wanted to put to bed the suggestion that nih says what we are doing can not be done in spite of the fact that that is what karl rove thought they said . 
in my office just a few months ago , nih kind of sheepishly admitted that there was some misunderstanding in conversation because they had never said that we could not go into an early embryo and take a cell . 
ordinarily , we develop a stem cell line from the inner mass cell stage of the embryo . 
i have here , mr. speaker , a little diagram which shows the ontogeny , the development of the embryo . 
it begins , of course , with the egg that comes from the mother , the oocyte , and then the sperm , and it shows only four or five there . 
and there is really a miracle that occurs here because as soon as one of them penetrates that egg , there is a big barrier put up so that there is no other candidate . 
it would be quite disastrous if two of them penetrated that egg because that would create an embryo which would certainly die . 
if this kind of thing happens , they can fertilize it in a petri dish . 
they do this for the benefit of their baby because one would not want , if they had a choice , to bring a child into the world that was going to have a less than optimum quality of life because they had a genetic defect . 
all of this happened in the intervening years between 2001 and now . 
i just want to spend a couple of moments talking about the debate . 
the debate is between the use of discarded embryos that the proponents , and that is what the bill is tomorrow , say are going to be thrown away anyhow and why do we not get some good from them by developing stem cell lines from them since they are going to be discarded anyhow ? 
first of all , it is not certain they are going to be discarded because they can be adopted . 
operation snowflake where parents can adopt one of these embryos and have them implanted in a mother other than the one from whom the ovum was taken . 
put it in the mother 's womb , and it will become a very distinct human being , unlike any other out of the 6.5 billion people in the world . 
this is from a scientist at the johns hopkins university school of medicine , one of the best medical schools in the world : `` as a physician-scientist who has done research involving umbilical cord blood stem cells for over 20 years , i am frequently surprised by the thought from nonscientists that cord blood stem cells may provide an alternative to embryonic stem cells for research . 
opponents of embryonic stem cell research suggested that 58 diseases have been successfully treated using adult stem cells . 
all of the 58 listed , all of them , are represented by organizations that support stem cell research . 
so what this says is that all of those physicians that are involved with these 58 applications of adult stem cells , all of them support stem cell research . 
you may not see this little bit of life that holds the miracle of chromosomes and against that will develop the whole unique individual , not like any other . 
out of 6.5 billion in the world , you may not see that as human life , but it clearly is . 
you may be okay with that , you may not be , but a great number of people are not okay with that . 
h.r. 810 does not have 400 , 000 discarded embryos to use , that is true ; and the statement is made that if you used these 400 , 000 embryos , you would only get 275 stem cell lines , and that is because only 2.8 percent of them have been donated for research . 
only 65 percent of those will survive the thawing . 
a third of them do not survive the freezing and rethawing . 
twenty-five percent of those that are still alive after they thaw , only 25 percent will go on through this development stage , through the blastula , gastrula and so forth , so they can be implanted . 
then , even if it has gone that far , in one trial only one out of 18 attempts produced a stem cell line , and in another trial only three out of 40 produced a stem cell line . 
i have here a very recent report , `` alternative sources of human pluripotent stem cells , '' a white paper by the president 's council on bioethics , and the next chart shows page 25 from this . 
`` but the initial success of the verlinsky group 's efforts at least reaches the possibility that embryonic stem cells could be derived from single blastomas removed from early human embryos without apparently harming them. '' then there is an asterisk , and if you go to the bottom of the page it says : `` a similar idea was proposed by representative roscoe bartlett of maryland as far back as 2001 before the president gave his executive order. '' there are four potential sources listed here . 
they do a very good job of discussing this in the body of the text . 
this is why we are collecting and freezing umbilical cord blood , because we hope that through the life of that person , there might be some opportunity to use stem cells . 
what our bill asks for is simply federal money to do research on animals , on nonhuman primates , that is , the great apes , which genetically are remarkably similar to humans , if it works there , it probably would work in humans , to determine the efficacy and the safeness of doing this . 
they simply state in their recommendation section that they consider it unethical to go to an embryo and take a cell out of it just to establish a stem cell lot . 
these are decisions that parents make , i think , ethically to the benefit of their baby and for all that we would hope in the future . 
and , again , our bill deals only with animal experimentation to determine the efficacy and the reliability of doing this . 
maybe , as the authors of the white paper said , you could develop a stem cell line from that . 
when you read that white paper you will see that they are bending over backwards to satisfy all of the concerns that even the most concerned prolife person could have . 
there are now two kinds of cells in what we call the embryo . 
there is the inner cell mass , which will become the baby ; and then there is the rest of the trophoblast which will become the decidua . 
so if you take cells only from the inner cell mass , they could never become an embryo because these cells have lost all of their ability to produce the decidua , but they retain all of the ability to produce the cells of the body , the great variety of cells in the body . 
i hope , mr. speaker , that a number of my colleagues will sign on to our bill . 
if he vetoes the bill , as he has said he would , then all of those americans , and i believe it is a majority , as there will be a majority tomorrow that vote for h.r. 810 , will wonder why it is not okay to take these embryos that hardly look like a baby , just eight cells , to take these embryos , and they are going to be discarded anyhow . 
and given the two arguments , they may not be discarded , they may be adopted , and at the end of the day , you are taking a life . 
if you think it is okay to take one life to help another , that is okay , but a lot of people do not think that is okay . 
on the other hand , if he lets it become law , then he is going to offend all of those prolife people who really see this as life . 
but as we saw earlier , mr. speaker , from this chart that we had from that page of the white paper , let me put that back up because i think it makes the point , it may be some time . 
but the initial success of the verlinsky group 's efforts at least raises the future possibility that pluripotent stem cells could be derived from single-blast embryos removed from early human embryos without apparently harming them . 
i believe we can pursue all of the potential miracles that could come from embryonic stem cell research and applications to medicine without harming embryos , and i urge an early vote and adoption of this bill . 
allen spiegel and story landis were able to meet with you , mr. otis and mr. aitken during your visit to the national institutes of health ( nih ) last month to discuss ways to derive human embryonic stem cells ( hescs ) . 
spiegel and landis were serving as acting co-chairs of the nih stem cell task force during my leave of absence from this position . 
nih shares your enthusiasm on the therapeutic potentials of hesc research and thank you for your continued support of this field . 
you propose the possibility of using a cell ( or two ) removed from the 8-cell stage human embryo undergoing pre implantation genetic diagnosis ( pgd ) to : 1 ) create a `` personal repair kit '' made up of cells removed from the embryo and stored for future use ; and 2 ) for deriving human embryonic stem cell lines . 
you suggested that creating hesc lines in this manner would avoid ethical questions surrounding the fate of a human embryo . 
live births resulting from embryos which undergo pgd and are subsequently implanted seem to suggest that this procedure does not harm the embryo , however , there are some reports that a percentage of embryos do not survive this procedure . 
nih is not aware of any published scientific data that has confirmed the establishment of hesc lines from a single cell removed from an 8-cell stage embryo . 
we are aware of the published research of dr . 
the human morula is generally composed of 10-30 cells and is the stage that immediately precedes the formation of the blastocyst . 
that is , animal experiments could be conducted to determine whether it is possible to derive hescs from a single cell of the 8-cell or morula stage embryo . 
to date , to the best of our knowledge no such derivations have been successful . 
nih agreed to explore whether there have been any attempts to use single cells from the 8-cell or morula stage of an animal embryo to start embryonic stem cell lines by consulting with scientists that are currently conducting embryo research . 
from these discussions , these scientists believe it is worth attempting experiments using a single cell from an early stage embryo or cells from a morula of a non-human primate to establish an embryonic stem cell line . 
of note , a recent 2003 paper from canada shows that when single human blastomeres are cultured from early cleavage stage embryos , before the morula stage , that there is an increased incidence of chromosomal abnormalities . 
even with hescs derived from the inner cell mass of the human blastocyst , the odds of starting a hesc line from a single cell are long , perhaps one in 20 tries . 
thus , the odds of being able to start with a single cell from an 8-celled or morula staged embryo are equally challenging . 
this would make it difficult to accomplish the goal of establishing `` repair kits '' and hesc lines from any single pgd embryo . 
nih concludes that the possibility of establishing a stem cell line from an 8-cell or morula stage embryo can only be determined with additional research . 
the human embryo research ban would preclude the use of funds appropriated under the labor/hhs appropriations act for pursuing this research with human embryos . 
in animal studies , it has been shown that the blastocyst can be pierced to remove cells of the inner cell mass and the embryo appears to retain its original form but it is not known whether the embryo will result the birth of a healthy baby . 
since this experiment in human embryos at either the morula or the blastocyst stage would require evaluations of not only normal birth but also unknown longterm risks to the person even into adulthood , it would have to be considered a very high risk and ethically questionable endeavor . 
because of the risk of harm , this research would also be ineligible for federal funding . 
i have enclosed a copy of a recently released white paper developed by the president 's council on bioethics ( pcb ) on alternative sources of human pluripotent stern cells . 
madam speaker , there have been a number of articles in the recent press relative to stem cell research , with particular reference to embryonic stem cell research . 
i have here a chart which shows in very abbreviated form the development of an early embryo . 
it starts out with the zygote , which is the fertilized egg ; and then it skips a couple of stages of development , and it goes through the blastocyst , and then it goes to the gastrula . 
by the time the embryo gets to the gastrula stage , the cells have already differentiated to the place that we have three different kinds of somatic stem cells . 
this is the ectoderm , and the mesoderm , and the endoderm , and then those very specialized cells , which in the female will be the germ cells in the ovary , the ova , and in the male will be the millions and millions of sperm that are in the gonads of the male . 
if we look back , madam speaker , at these stem cells that are present here in the gastrula , where we have these three , as we call germ layers , we see the ectoderm can further differentiate into skin and nervous system and some of the pigment cells in our body ; and then the mesoderm , the middle layer , that differentiates into what is most of us by mass and weight , cardiac muscle , our big skeletal muscles , the bone , the smooth muscle , all of our blood , and the blood is an organ , it happens to be a liquid organ that is dispersed through the body ; and then the endoderm . 
the pancreatic cells , the thyroid cells , the lining of the gut , the lining of the lung and so forth . 
it might be worth just a moment , madam speaker , to take a look at our next chart , which kind of puts this in context . 
this is one-half , as the little diagram here in the upper left shows , of the reproductive tract of a female . 
and then as the egg slowly moves down the tube , it splits first into two cells , then four cells , and then eight cells , and then the larger variety of cells , and finally where you have the inner cell mass and then to the gastrula . 
there are two kinds of stem cells , adult stem cells , and those are derivatives of the cells that we showed in the previous chart . 
these are cells which are differentiated to the point that they will produce a limited variety of cells , but still undifferentiated to an extent because these stem cells in the bone marrow can produce red blood cells and polymorphonuclear leukocytes , part of the white blood cells , and the thrombocytes , those are the cells , the platelets as we call them , that are associated with clotting . 
and there are a number of adult stem cells similar to that that still retain some of the capability for producing more than just one kind of cell . 
we have been working with adult stem cells medically now for more than 3 decades , and there have been a number of medical applications , treatment of humans that have been made with adult stem cells . 
but just because they are what they are , madam speaker , a great number of people believe that there should be more potential from the embryonic stem cells simply because they can produce any and all of the tissues of the body . 
since we have been working with embryonic stem cells for now just a little over 6 years , we have not had the opportunities for medical applications we have had in adult stem cells , but this does not dim the hopes of the scientific community and the medical community that ultimately there may be more and better applications of embryonic stem cells to treatment of diseases than adult stem cells , simply because of what they are , puripotent cells retaining the ability to produce any and all of the tissues of the body . 
but if that can be controlled , the medical community and the researchers associated with it believe there is potential for enormous applications to medicine of embryonic stem cell research . 
we have now had 58 applications of adult stem cells in helping to treat some of the diseases . 
ordinarily , one thinks that the greatest potential for the use of stem cells would result from use in diseases from tissue deficiency rather than diseases that result from some organism , although if there is an infection in the body and a tissue is damaged , there is the hope that it might be replaced with stem cell application . 
there are a number of diseases that the scientific community and the general public believe might be amenable to treatment with stem cells , particularly embryonic stem cells . 
diabetes is one of those . 
particularly heartrending are the little children that come there , 5 and 6 years old some of them , such brittle juvenile diabetics that they have an implanted pump and they have to prick their finger or some part of their body a number of times a day to monitor the glucose level so that just the right amount of insulin can be injected to control this . 
this insulin is produced by cells called island of langerhan cells . 
and they look like little eyelets because they are simply distributed through the tissue of the pancreas . 
the pancreas is a very large gland at the very beginning of the small intestine that secretes all of the different kinds of digestive enzymes so that fats , carbohydrates , and proteins all are digested using the enzymes secreted by the pancreas . 
i have no idea why nature placed the islets of langerhans in the pancreas . 
when you give insulin to the diabetic , it delays progression of the disease , but it does not cure it . 
a person with juvenile diabetes faces the prospect that they probably will have a shortened life , problems with their vision as the vascular bed in the back of the eye breaks down , and they may have problems with circulation in their extremities , particularly in the feet where there is some difficulty getting blood back uphill to the heart . 
diabetes is one of the diseases that is very attractive as a potential for use of stem cells , because if we could just produce islet tissue , we could cure diabetes , the most expensive disease that we have . 
it took them quite awhile back , this was a number of years ago , to determine she had lou gehrig 's disease . 
well , anybody who has a friend or a relative that has gone through that kind of experience has to be enthusiastic about the potential for stem cell therapy . 
this was a number of years ago , but if it were tomorrow or the day after tomorrow figuratively , maybe there could be stem cell therapy for my grandmother , and she would not have to have died at the relatively young age she died at . 
there is a whole category of autoimmune diseases . 
i have a paper which lists 63 of the autoimmune diseases . 
when we are developing as embryos in our mother 's womb , there are certain cells in our circulatory system called t-cells located in the lymphatic tissue , and the t-cells are imprinted with who we are because once we get out of the mother 's womb , we are going to be in a hostile environment , exposed to bacteria and viruses , and so it is important that the body knows what it is so the defense mechanisms in the body can be marshaled to eject the intruder . 
these t-cells identify what is you and what is not you , and they alert some of the specialized cells in our white blood cell system so they are attracted to the site , and they eject , they may consume , they eject the intruder . 
i remember my first real introduction to this big list of autoimmune diseases was a secretary i had , a very vibrant young lady whose life was really , really changed because she had lupus . 
there are many americans who have family or friends who have lupus , and lupus was one of the first autoimmune diseases that was discovered . 
we have been working for more than 3 decades with adult stem cells , and our very able medical scientific community has been able to develop a number of applications that can cure or at least lessen the severity of disease using adult stem cells . 
since we have been working with embryonic stem cells for only a brief period of time , we do not have any direct applications to medicine of embryonic stem cell therapy , but that does not dim the enthusiasm of the medical community because they believe that the potential there ought to be greater . 
of course , what we are doing now in the laboratory is not done in the uterus . 
all of this is done in a petri dish . 
about 4 years ago , this produced a real dilemma for the president who , like all of us , has family and friends who have one or more of these diseases that could be potentially ameliorated or cured by embryonic stem cell application . 
he , as i am , is a strong pro-life advocate and the president had a problem with taking one life because that embryo produced in the laboratory in surplus and in vitro fertilization had the potential when implanted in a receptive mother to become a baby and the president 's problem was that he had a moral problem with taking one life with the hope of helping another . 
while the president was wrestling with this problem and what to do about it , there was a briefing at the national institutes of health for members of the congress and for their staff . 
as the next chart shows , when we were talking about the potential for embryonic stem cell lines , i remembered my training of more than 50 years ago when i got my doctorate at the university of maryland and had a course in advanced embryology and then went on to teach medical school for 4 years and postgraduate medicine doing basic research at the national institutes of health . 
i remembered what everybody knows , because they had the course in advanced embryology it was in my mind , that whenever we have identical twins what has really happened is that half of the cells have been taken from the early embryo . 
so knowing that half of the cells could be taken away from an early embryo without harming the embryo , unless you think identical twins are somehow deficient , and i have talked with a number of identical twins , and i have not talked with any of them who thought they were less a person or deficient because half of the cells were taken away to produce the other identical twin . 
a few days later , i had a call from carl rove and the president had turned the pursuit of this suggestion over to carl rove . 
carl , i said either they are funning you or they misunderstand you , because these are the same people that can take a single cell and take the nucleus out of that cell and put another nucleus in it . 
that is what they did with dolly the sheep and the large number of clones that have been produced since then . 
i said , of course , if they can take the nucleus out of a cell and put another nucleus in it , they can certainly take a cell or two out of what is a relatively big embryo . 
madam speaker , you may remember this was kind of a decision like solomon might have made . 
obviously , from the potential efficacy of embryonic stem cell research and medical applications , it is very desirable that we do that . 
on the other hand , if the only way to get embryonic stem cells is by destroying an embryo , then you are left with the quandary of , is it really acceptable to destroy one life with the hope that you are going to help another ? 
he recognized that a number of embryos had already been killed , destroyed to establish stem cell lines , and since you can not turn back the hands of time to change that , these embryos were gone , the stem cell lines were there , and so the president , recognizing the potential for embryonic stem cell research , and being concerned that you should not take one life with the hope of helping another , wisely i think , said we could spend federal dollars on any exploration we chose with the existing stem cells lines , and he thought there were about 60 . 
this was about 4 years ago , and as we knew , the scientific community knew , as i knew because of my background , these stem cell lines would eventually run out . 
we now have , i think the accepted figure is 22 stem cell lines left , and all of these are contaminated with mouse feeder cells . 
this is the result of a technique which is used to facilitate the replication of these cells in the tissue culture , and they are now all contaminated with mouse feeder cells so that although they are perfectly good for research and a lot of research is being done , they are not good for medical application because you would not want to put the cells contaminated with mouse feeder cells in a human . 
one of the potential solutions to this problem is included in h.r. 810 , the castle-degette bill ; and the argument made in this bill is that there are about 400 , 000 surplus embryos out there from in vitro fertilization . 
then he will look at them under the microscope and pick the strongest looking of those embryos and may put two or three or so in the mother . 
one of our members , the rohrabachers , are now the proud parents of triplets from in vitro fertilization . 
all of them grew and so they are now the proud parents of these very happy and healthy little babies . 
since there are 400 , 000 surplus embryos out there that are frozen , the argument is , and this is the argument of the bill , that since these embryos , at least many of these embryos , realistically most of these embryos will ultimately be discarded , they will not stay frozen for 49 years there , they will not last forever , and by and by they will be discarded , and so the argument is , why should medicine not benefit from cells , from embryos that are going to be discarded anyhow ? 
it was a compelling argument to a majority of people in the house , and now they are considering this bill in the senate . 
but to those in the pro-life community , there is another way of looking at these embryos . 
more than 100 times parents who do not have an ovum , can not get pregnant any other way , have adopted these surplus embryos and we have more than 100 of what we call snowflake babies . 
the embryo that i am looking at under the microscope might be adopted and that could be any one of the 400 , 000 embryos , and it might be the next albert einstein . 
as a result of a series of discussions with the white house and with a number of the interested groups , we have developed a bill which is called h.r. 3144 , the respect for life pluripotent stem cell act of 2005 . 
madam speaker , i will make this short bill a part of the record . 
be it enacted by the senate and house of representatives of the united states of america in congress assembled , & lt ; p & gt ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; section 1. short title. & lt ; p & gt ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; this act may be cited as the `` respect for life pluripotent stem cell act of 2005 '' . & lt ; p & gt ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; sec . 
the use of cells from embryos has drawn great interest in the scientific community but also raises very serious ethical concerns for many americans , because as practiced today it requires the destruction of human embryos to obtain their cells . 
( 2 ) the president 's council on bioethics in its may 2005 white paper : `` alternative sources of pluripotent stem cells , '' describes several potential methods to derive stem cells like those now derived through the destruction of embryos , but which would not involve doing harm to embryos . 
some methods propose to involve embryos in ways that do not harm them , while others propose to reprogram adult cells to produce cells with the capabilities of embryonic stem cells without producing or involving embryos at all. & lt ; p & gt ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; ( 3 ) such proposals should be thoroughly tested in animal models before being applied to humans , to establish that they do not involve creating or harming human embryos. & lt ; p & gt ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; ( 4 ) several scientific reports also suggest that some subclasses of adult stem cells ( derived from postnatal tissues , umbilical cord blood and placenta ) show a flexibility comparable to that of stem cells now derived through the destruction of embryos. & lt ; p & gt ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; ( 5 ) american scientists should be encouraged to pursue all ethical avenues of stem cell research and to explore morally uncontroversial alternatives to research requiring the destruction of human embryos. & lt ; p & gt ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; sec .

such authorization is in addition to other authorizations of appropriations that are available for such purpose. '' . & lt ; p & gt ; madam speaker , the gentleman from georgia ( mr. gingrey ) xz4001510 has joined us . 
i would like to yield to him before i go through the history of how we got to this bill and the people we talked to and exactly what is in the bill . 
after the president came down with his executive order , i continued to meet with the folks at nih , and i subsequently learned , by the way , i need to come back to that problem with karl rove and his discussion with the nih people , and this was a typical example of failed communications . 
now , as a matter of fact , a russian scientist working in this country , verlinsky , says he has , in fact , done that . 
i have met a number of times with people from nih . 
on july 20 of last year , for instance , we had an extended meeting in my office with representatives from nih , with representatives from health and human services , and with representatives from the white house . 
and then , madam speaker , a very interesting thing happened while we were having this series of meetings with the nih and hhs and the white house and with the outside groups . 
a few weeks ago i spent probably a half hour or more on the phone with two of the medical scientists there who were involved in this research . 
i would like to avoid , madam speaker , even the possibility of a problem . 
the members of the president 's , and i have the white paper here i am going to refer to in just a moment , council on bioethics think that that is not feasible . 
but , madam speaker , if we were to wait just a little later to take the cell to the inner cell mass , and i probably ought to put that chart of the uterus back up here so that i can point to what i am referring to here , in the laboratory they are going at the eight-cell stage and taking a cell or two out and doing a preimplantation genetic diagnosis . 
to avoid that , if we just wait until the inner cell mass stage , which is the stage from which the embryonic stem cell lines are now developed when they destroy the embryo , there is no reason they can not go into this inner cell mass and through the trophoblast and they could take out several cells then because there are a lot of cells there . 
the decidua is the amnion and chorion , the tissues that support the baby , and we can see those starting to develop down here in day 8 and 9 when the embryo has attached itself to the wall of the uterus and the uterus grows and produces some tissues and there is a growth of this decidua here and we have the placenta , these big opposing vascular bags through which food and oxygen and co 2 and hormones and so forth are exchanged between the baby and the mother . 
by the way , madam speaker , this is a pretty hazardous journey ; and we do not know the exact percentage , but maybe less than half of all of the ova here that get fertilized actually implant in the uterus . 
as a matter of fact , one of the techniques for preventing conception is an iud . 
they simply place a foreign object here in the uterus , and the uterus reacts to the presence of that foreign by not permitting the fertilized egg , the embryo , to implant there . 
while we are carrying on these discussions with the white house and nih and hhs and with the outside groups , the president 's council on bioethics submits a white paper ; and in this white paper they go over four potential techniques that might produce pluripotent stem cells , which is another way of saying the equivalent of embryonic stem cells , without destroying or harming an embryo . 
and what our bill does , madam speaker , is simply ask nih to please explore these potentials , first of all , in animal models ; and the bill gives them $ 15 million to begin this exploration . 
i just wanted to spend just a moment talking about the four things that are in here because it may be of interest to a number of people . 
and when an embryo is moribund , it is not going to divide anymore , then it is the equivalent of a brain dead person and there should be no problem taking cells from it like they would take organs from a brain dead person . 
one might have a little question about the vitality of the cell they take from that embryo , but at least ethically if the embryo is dead or moribund , the equivalent of a brain dead person , they could take an embryo from it . 
and what the proposal there is that they take an ovum and they take the nucleus out of the ovum and then they take an altered nucleus out of a somatic cell . 
you alter the nucleus so that you have turned off some of the genes , and then you put that nucleus inside the egg . 
because in the cytoplasm of the egg outside the nucleus of the egg , there are some factors which turn on and turn off genes and kind of control what happens inside the nucleus . 
so now they have turned off some genes so this thing will divide ; that will never be a baby because they have kind of messed up the genetics . 
oh , the fourth one of these is pluripotent stem cells by differentiation . 
i mentioned the differentiation of cells . 
that is when they decide that they are going to be just this or that , and all the cells they produce after that are just that kind of cell . 
now , sometimes , you can take a cell and kind of put it in an environment where you have confused it , you have shocked it , you have done something to it , so it forgets what it was supposed to be , and it starts making cells , tissues that it would not ordinarily make in that stage of differentiation . 
so what our bill does is to permit the research , particularly on two of these , the nucleus transfer and the taking of cells from the early blastomere . 
our bill has received input from the white house , from the conference of catholic bishops , from right the life communities , so there is a broad spectrum of individuals and organizations out there that are supportive of what we are doing . 
in the few moments left , madam speaker , i would like to note that there have been a plethora of articles very recently about this , and i would like to submit these for the record . 
here is a letter of may of this year from dr . 
battey who is the chief spokesman for stem cell research at the national institutes of health who is quite supportive of our bill and what we propose to do , and here is a very interesting op-ed piece written by richard doerflinger who represents the catholic bishops . 
it was richard doerflinger who made the great suggestion that the first thing you do with that cell you take from the early embryo is to create a repair kit so that all during the life of that person , they will have frozen the ability to produce a new liver if they need it , islets of langerhans , spinal cord cells , whatever they need . 
he says , representative tuesday , july 12 , associated press , lawmakers wary of backup stem cell bill . 
for those of us who believe that we really ought to research stem cells , we really look forward to a bill which the president can support . 
i am very pleased , madam speaker , that my background has permitted me to understand some of the potential here , my experience with my grandmother , with these little diabetic kids , my profound pro-life commitment . 
i am very pleased that i was able to propose a potential solution that i think meets the morals and the demands of both sides of this issue . 
allen spiegel and story landis were able to meet with you , mr. otis and mr. aitken during your visit to the national institutes of health ( nih ) last month to discuss ways to derive human embryonic stem cells ( hescs ) . 
spiegel and landis were serving as acting co-chairs of the nih stem cell task force during my leave of absence from this position . 
nih shares your enthusiasm on the therapeutic potentials of hesc research and thank you for your continued support of this field . 
you propose the possibility of using a cell ( or two ) removed from the 8-cell stage human embryo undergoing preimplantation genetic diagnosis ( pgd ) to : ( 1 ) create a `` personal repair kit '' made up of cells removed from the embryo and stored for future use ; and ( 2 ) for deriving human embryonic stem cell lines . 
you suggested that creating hesc lines in this manner would avoid ethical questions surrounding the fate of a human embryo . 
live births resulting from embryos which undergo pgd and are subsequently implanted seem to suggest that this procedure does not harm the embryo , however , there are some reports that a percentage of embryos do not survive this procedure . 
in addition , long-term studies would be needed to determine whether this procedure produces subtle or later-developing injury to children nih is not aware of any published scientific data that has confirmed the establishment of hesc lines from a single cell removed from an 8-cell stage embryo . 
we are aware of the published research of dr . 
the human morula is generally composed of 10-30 cells and is the stage that immediately precedes the formation of the blastocyst . 
that is , animal experiments could be conducted to determine whether it is possible to derive hescs from a single cell of the 8-cell or morula stage embryo . 
to date , to the best of our knowledge no such derivations have been successful . 
nih agreed to explore whether there have been any attempts to use single cells from the 8-cell or morula stage of an animal embryo to start embryonic stem cell lines by consulting with scientists that are currently conducting embryo research . 
from these discussions , these scientists believe it is worth attempting experiments using a single cell from an early stage embryo or cells from a morula of a non-human primate to establish an embryonic stem cell line . 
of note , a recent 2003 paper from canada shows that when single human blastomeres are cultured from early cleavage stage embryos , before the morula stage , that there is an increased incidence of chromosomal abnormalities . 
even with hescs derived from the inner cell mass of the human blastocyst , the odds of starting a hesc line from a single cell are long , perhaps one in 20 tries . 
thus , the odds of being able to start with a single cell from an 8-celled or morula staged embryo are equally challenging . 
this would make it difficult to accomplish the goal of establishing `` repair kits '' and hesc lines from any single pgd embryo . 
nih concludes that the possibility of establishing a stem cell line from an 8-cell or morula stage embryo can only be determined with additional research . 
the human embryo research ban would preclude the use of funds appropriated under the labor/hhs appropriations act for pursuing this research with human embryos . 
in animal studies , it has been shown that the blastocyst can be pierced to remove cells of the inner cell mass and the embryo appears to retain its original form but it is not known whether the embryo will result in the birth of a healthy baby . 
since this experiment in human embryos at either the morula or the blastocyst stage would require evaluations of not only normal birth but also unknown long term risks to the person even into adulthood , it would have to be considered a very high risk and ethically questionable endeavor . 
because of the risk of harm , this research would also be ineligible for federal funding . 
i have enclosed a copy of a recently released white paper developed by the president 's council on bioethics ( pcb ) on alternative sources of human pluripotent stem cells . 
but those alternatives to the most promising stem cell science are enough to win the attention of anti-abortion republicans and president bush . 
nonetheless , it said four types of studies `` deserve the nation 's careful and serious consideration. '' bush was receptive to funding the theoretical approaches rather than medically more promising research that destroys embryo , three lawmakers who have discussed the subject with him told the associated press . 
he clearly supported it. '' another possible compromise , being drafted by representative roscoe bartlett , r-md. , a biological engineer , would send $ 15 million to the national institutes of health for stem cell research on animal embryos , according to a draft obtained by the ap . 
`` we 'll probably consider a number of bills , '' frist told the ap . 
senator rick santorum , r-pa. , who also attended the meeting with bush , said he may try to amend one of congress ' must-pass spending bills to provide federal money for specific studies outlined in the bioethics council 's report . 
senator gordon smith , r-ore. , said that in his own talk with bush , he found the president `` looking for a way to stay within his ethical boundaries. '' almost two-thirds of americans say they support embryonic stem cell research and a majority of people say they would like to see fewer restrictions on taxpayer funding for those studies , according to recent polling . 
but it also would spend millions of dollars on studies whose value is speculative . 
some of the techniques have not even been attempted in animals . 
frist , who is a heart and lung transplant surgeon , told the ap at least three of the processes on the bioethics council 's list met his criteria for funding embryonic stem cell research . 
`` all of the research you have there stops short of the creation of an embryo for experimental purposes , and short of destruction of an embryo for experimental purposes , '' he said . 
`` that is the direction i think we should explore. '' those are the same boundaries set out by bush , who in a 2001 executive order prohibited federal funding of any research using human embryonic stem cells harvested after aug . 
9 of that year . 
senator tom harkin , d-iowa , a chief supporter of traditional embryonic stem cell research , shrugged at the notion of an alternative . 
`` most of these ideas are nothing but theories . 
no one knows whether scientists could find healthy stem cells inside an embryo already so damaged that it would n't grow , or coax them to live when transferred out of that embryo . 
it 's not clear whether older cells can be returned to an embryonic state. & lt ; center & gt ; & lt ; pre & gt ; -- & lt ; /pre & gt ; & lt ; /center & gt ; lawmakers wary of backup stem cell bill washington ( ap ) . -- president bush and his conservative senate allies are trying to peel votes from a stem cell bill by offering alternative legislation that would instead fund promising but unproven studies , several senators said tuesday . 
`` i 'm all for these alternative sources , ( but ) not as a substitute , not as some way of stopping what we 're about to do , '' said tom harkin , d-iowa , senate sponsor of a bill already passed by the house that would end bush 's 2001 ban on federal funding for new human embryonic stem cell studies . 
`` it 's a no-brainer , '' said robert lanza , one of the scientists working on a process by which embryonic stem cells are derived without destroying life . 
`` i do not think we should keep the scientific community or the patient community waiting. '' another scientist at the table , william b. hurlbut of stanford university , said vital science that could someday lead to cures of diseases like alzheimer 's and parkinson 's must have the engine of public consensus behind it . 
a member of the president 's council on bioethics , hurlbut noted that large sections of the public believe human embryonic stem cell research is immoral because it destroys the embryo , which many , including bush and some congressional conservatives , consider a budding human life . 
1 deadline for voting on the legislation , senate negotiators were no closer tuesday to agreeing on a list of bills to debate on the senate floor . 
still swirling were talks over a six-bill package of legislation , including the harkin-specter measure , and others that would fund alternative methods or ban certain stem cell and cloning techniques altogether . 
testifying were james battey , chairman of the national institutes of health stem cell task force , and lanza , who has done research into deriving stem cells from a single animal cell without destroying the embryo . 
that is far less than the two-thirds support that would be needed to override a veto bush has threatened , and it was unclear that either house of congress had the two-thirds vote necessary to override a veto . 
the battle lines of the stem cell debate have become familiar . 
the cells are `` pluripotent , '' capable of producing all the 210 cell types in the human body . 
embryonic stem cells are far from curing any disease , while adult and umbilical cord blood stem cells have helped many thousands of patients . 
just before congress 's july 4 recess , representative roscoe bartlett ( r-md ) introduced the `` respect for life pluripotent stem cell act. '' it instructs the national institutes of health to fund research in obtaining `` pluripotent '' stem cells without creating or harming human embryos . 
the nucleus of a body cell is combined with an egg deprived of its own nucleus . 
signals in the egg activate a much wider range of genes in that nucleus , so it no longer directs one specialized type of cell but begins the development of a whole new organism . 
& lt ; /center & gt ; it would be good news indeed if modern science ends up resolving some moral dilemmas that an irresponsible use of science has created . 
stem cell legislation is at risk promising but still unproven new approaches to creating human embryonic stem cells have suddenly jeopardized what once appeared to be certain senate passage of a bill to loosen president bush 's four-year-old restrictions on human embryo research . 
embryonic stem cells are coveted because they have the capacity to become virtually every kind of body tissue and perhaps repair ailing organs , but they are controversial because days-old human embryos must be destroyed to retrieve them . 
`` the new science that may involve embryo research but not require destruction of an embryo is tremendously exciting , '' senate majority leader bill frist ( r-tenn. ) said recently . 
`` it would get you outside of the boundaries of the ethical constraints. '' but because the value of these new scientific methods remains speculative , they have complicated the political calculus in the highly partisan senate , which could take up the issue as early as next week . 
proponents of embryonic stem cell research are divided over how strongly to promote the new work because of fears it will undermine efforts to expand federal funding of conventional embryo research , which they say has better odds of success . 
but some opponents of embryo research are uncomfortable with the emerging alternatives , too . 
`` this is something that could be very valuable if it works , no doubt about it , '' stanford university stem cell researcher irving weissman said of the new work . 
`` but do n't tell me we should stop doing [ embryo ] research until we find out , because people 's lives are at stake. '' in may , the house easily passed bipartisan legislation allowing federally funded scientists to study stem cells derived from some of the thousands of human embryos destined for disposal at fertility clinics -- a significant expansion of the bush policy . 
until this week , senators arlen specter ( r-pa. ) and orrin g. hatch ( r-utah ) expressed confidence that they had more than enough votes to pass the same bill in the senate , despite threats of a presidential veto . 
the administration is eager for bush to sign legislation supportive of at least some types of stem cell research , according to several lobbyists close to the congressional negotiations . 
signing such a bill could take some of the sting out of a veto that is sure to infuriate patient groups and could rile a majority of americans , who tell pollsters they back expanded funding of embryonic stem cell research . 
during the fourth of july recess , many senate republicans struggled with the question of whether the new legislation should be brought to the floor as a substitute for the house-passed bill or as a competing bill -- and if both were to come up , then how to vote on each . 
at least a handful of senators have hinted in recent days that they may transfer their vote to the new bill , hill sources said -- among them hatch , johnny isakson ( r-ga. ) and kay bailey hutchison ( r-tex. ) . 
the issue will get its first formal airings at a senate subcommittee hearing tuesday and at a hill media event on wednesday at which pro-research celebrities michael j. fox and dana reeve , widow of `` superman '' star christopher reeve , will call for an immediate loosening of bush 's policy . 
some supporters of the research say they would be happy if both bills passed . 
but for some of the more ardent advocates of an immediate expansion of the bush policy , bartlett 's alternative legislation is a diversion . 
`` these alternative methods of deriving stem cells -- we do n't know whether they 'll work . 
in one , a single cell is removed from a days-old embryo created for fertility purposes and coaxed to become a self-replicating colony of stem cells , leaving the remainder of the embryo to develop normally . 
`` you might find that late in life , there are some strange differences between those people and others. '' hurlbut is the leading proponent of a different approach , which he calls altered nuclear transfer , or ant . 
it involves the creation of an embryo -- or what hurlbut says is something akin to an embryo -- that lacks a gene necessary for the development of a placenta . 
because a placenta is required for an embryo to implant in a woman 's womb , the altered embryo would be genetically incapable of becoming a fetus or a baby . 
researchers have tried the technique in mice with some success , but its usefulness as a source of human stem cells remains hypothetical . 
he said he has no problem with the funding of such research as long as it does not interfere with increased funding for existing programs of embryo research . 
practical or not , ant has gained a quickly widening circle of support . 
the roman catholic archbishop of san francisco , william j. levada , has written a letter to bush assuring the president of his support . 
but other conservative leaders have mixed views on whether it makes sense to pursue the new alternative therapies or to focus single-mindedly on defeating any expansion of the current policy . 
jessica echard , executive director of the eagle forum , the public policy organization founded by phyllis schlafly , said her group opposes `` middle ground '' legislation that pursues alternative methods for producing embryonic stem cells . 
mr. speaker , i move to suspend the rules and pass the bill ( h.r. 2520 ) to provide for the collection and maintenance of human cord blood stem cells for the treatment of patients and research , and to amend the public health service act to authorize the c.w . 
mr. speaker , i rise in strong support of h.r. 2520 , the stem cell therapeutic and research act of 2005 , legislation i have cosponsored along with the honorable gentleman from new jersey ( mr. smith ) xz4003801 , who is in the chamber . 
this would expand the number of stem cell options available to americans suffering from life-threatening diseases . 
every year , nearly two-thirds of the approximately 200 , 000 patients in need of a bone marrow transplant will not find a marrow donor match within their families . 
these patients must rely on the help of strangers to donate bone marrow for a transplant . 
through this program , congress made a significant investment to connect patients with a rich source of stem cells that offer immediate clinical benefits . 
cord blood units have been shown to be a suitable alternative to adult bone marrow for the treatment of many diseases , including sickle cell anemia . 
this is an especially important advancement for those americans who have desperately searched for a marrow donor but could not find a match with even the help of the national bone marrow registry . 
as another rich source of stem cells , a cord blood transplant is another chance at life for many of these patients . 
through a competitive contracting process , this new program will allow transplant doctors and patients to access information about cord blood units and bone marrow donors , at the same time , and i want to emphasize at the same time , through a single point of access . 
instead , it will provide comprehensive information about both sources of stem cells to doctors and patients and allow them to make the most clinically appropriate choice . 
it was the gentleman from florida 's ( mr. young ) xz4004391 drive , when he was chairman of the committee on appropriations , and his steadfast support for the idea of a national registry for bone marrow that led to the program 's creation . 
the capacity to search for cord blood units through a national network of cord blood banks will help facilitate cord blood transplants . 
we also need to expand the inventory of cord blood units so that more transplants can occur . 
the bill before us today authorizes a new grant program to provide subsidies to cord blood stem cell banks to expand the inventory of high-quality cord blood units that will be included in the new , expanded cell transplantation program . 
in addition to expanding the number of cord blood units available for clinical use to save lives today , the bill would also expand the number of cord blood units available for research . 
research on adult stem cells holds the potential to develop new cures for many diseases , as well as to expand our knowledge of how human beings develop and the body works . 
the bill would authorize research on the clinical outcomes of patients who are recipients of a stem cell therapeutic product , including bone marrow , cord blood , and other such products , from a biologically unrelated donor . 
this is an important bill that merited many hours of negotiation , demanded the willingness of all those involved to put the interest of their patients first . 
i would also like to thank the gentleman from florida ( mr. young ) xz4004391 ; the house leadership , including the honorable gentleman from texas ( mr. delay ) xz4001040 ; congressional black caucus ; the gentleman from michigan ( mr. dingell ) xz4001100 , the ranking democrat on the committee ; the gentleman from ohio ( mr. brown ) xz4000501 , the subcommittee ranking member who is here to speak on the bill ; and all of the staff who have labored on this bill . 
particularly , i would like to thank cheryl jaeger , on my left , of my committee staff , for all of her efforts . 
in the last few weeks , she has been able to forge a compromise that ultimately was acceptable to all the advocates of both bone marrow and cord blood . 
we will continue to improve the legislation that moves forward so that pregnant women are informed of all of their options with respect to cord blood donation and the programmatic activities of the cell transplantation program are clarified . 
mr. speaker , at the appropriate time , i would urge all of my colleagues to support this bill . 
it is good legislation , well thought out , and deserving of majority support . 
the stem cell therapeutic and research act of 2005 establishes a foundation for improving access to lifesaving cellular therapy transplants the national marrow donor program ( nmdp ) is pleased that the sponsors of the stem cell therapeutic and research act of 2005 have taken a positive step forward toward expanding the long-standing congressional commitment to cellular transplant therapies by introducing legislation to continue federal support for bone marrow , peripheral blood , and umbilical cord blood transplantation and research . 
through the legislation introduced today , they acknowledge the important role congress has played and must continue to play in ensuring that the more than 14 , 000 americans in need of these types of transplants have access to them . 
the bill calls for federal dollars to increase the number of umbilical cord blood units available for transplant and research . 
the nmdp estimates that with access to the existing adult donors and units , the addition of 150 , 000 cord blood units listed through the existing registry will provide a match for approximately 95 percent of americans . 
in 1986 , representative young 's vision of a single integrated national bone marrow donor registry became a reality . 
as evidence supporting cord blood as a source of the same cells found in bone marrow and peripheral blood has grown , the national registry , operated by the nmdp , has expanded the expansion of the program will benefit patients most if they are able to access the new sources of cells easily and efficiently . 
the nmdp supports the intent of the sponsors to provide patients and physicians with access to cord blood , bone marrow , and peripheral blood stem cells through a single point of access . 
to ensure the continued expansion of cord blood transplants , it is important that patients and physicians can search for all of these sources through a single registry , compare each source of cells for transplant quickly and efficiently , and obtain the cells once the search process is finished . 
one-stop-shopping to obtain information and logistical support is a critical component of the success of transplantation regardless of whether adult donors or cord blood units are used . 
the bill although this bill is a step in the right direction , it is critically important that the program also have the authority to establish criteria and standards that provide transplant physicians with the assurances they need to be confident that when they compare various cord blood units and/or adult donors , they have the same type of information about each unit or donor . 
the need for assistance in addressing barriers to access should be extended to all recipients of transplants under this program , regardless of cell source . 
physicians and patients must be able to receive all of the services necessary for a successful the nmdp applauds the sponsors for undertaking this important public health initiative . 
through their leadership , thousands of americans who might otherwise die will have access to lifesaving bone marrow , peripheral blood stem cell , and cord blood transplants . 
statement of administration policy -- may 24 , 2005 the administration strongly supports house passage of h.r. 2520 , which would facilitate the use of umbilical-cord-blood stem cells in biomedical research and in the treatment of disease . 
cord-blood stem cells , collected from the placenta and umbilical cord after birth without doing harm to mother or child , have been used in the treatment of thousands of patients suffering from more than 60 different diseases , including leukemia , fanconi anemia , sickle cell disease , and thalassemia . 
researchers also believe cord-blood stem cells may have the capacity to be differentiated into other cell types , making them useful in the exploration of ethical stem cell therapies for regenerative medicine . 
h.r. 2520 would increase the publicly available inventory of cord-blood stem cells by enabling the department of health and human services ( hhs ) to contract with cord-blood banks to assist them in the collection and maintenance of 150 , 000 cord-blood stem cell units . 
this would make matched cells available to treat more than 90 percent of patients in need . 
the bill also would reauthorize a similar program already in place for aiding the use of adult bone marrow in medical care . 
there is now $ 19 million available to implement the cord blood cell bank the administration also applauds the bill 's effort to facilitate research into the potential of cord-blood stem cells to advance regenerative medicine in an ethical way . 
some research indicates that cord blood cells may have the ability to be differentiated into other cell types , in ways similar to embryonic stem cells , and so present similar potential uses but without raising the ethical problems involved in the intentional destruction of human embryos . 
the administration encourages efforts to seek ethical ways to pursue stem cell research , and believes that -- with the appropriate combination of responsible policies and innovative scientific techniques -- this field of research can advance without violating important ethical boundaries . 
mr. speaker , i reserve the balance of my time . 
mr. speaker , i yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from new jersey ( mr. smith ) xz4003801 , the original author of the bill and my cosponsor . 
mr. speaker , i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from new jersey ( mr. ferguson ) xz4001320 , a member of the committee on energy and commerce . 
mr. speaker , i yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from florida ( mr. weldon ) xz4004271 , a doctor , and one of our more thoughtful members on this subject and somebody who has given a lot of time to it .

mr. speaker , i yield myself the balance of my time , and i want to thank the majority leader and the speaker for bringing these two bills to the floor today . 
this bill , by itself , is an extremely important advance for those of us that believe you can use medical research ethically to help find cures for existing disease and enhance human life both now and in the future . 
i am , obviously , as one of the original sponsors of the bill , going to vote for it and encourage all the members on both sides of the aisle to vote for its . 
it is a good piece of legislation and , by itself , is a major advancement in the state of the art that we have today . 
the next debate that we will have is on the castle-degette bill which is another form of stem cell research , embryonic stem cell . 
mr. speaker , pursuant to the order of the house of monday , may 23 , 2005 , i call up the bill ( h.r. 810 ) to amend the public health service act to provide for human embryonic stem cell research , and ask for its immediate consideration . 
mr. speaker , i ask unanimous consent that the gentleman from texas ( mr. delay ) xz4001040 be given 45 minutes of the debate time on the pending bill . 
mr. speaker , i ask unanimous consent that the gentleman from delaware ( mr. castle ) xz4000700 be allowed to control 20 minutes of the remaining 45 minutes that i currently have control over . 
most of the issues that come before this body , there is an automatic position on . 
but every now and then an issue comes up that is really an issue of conscience . 
but there are some of us , and i am in that camp today , that believe it is not an easy issue . 
well , part of it is personal and part of it deals with tragedies in my family in the past . 
my father died of complications of diabetes at the age of 71 . 
my brother , jon kevin barton , died of liver cancer at the age of 44 . 
my first granddaughter , bryn barton , died in the womb 2 days before delivery with complications of the umbilical cord , which had become crimped , and she was actually born dead . 
maybe the research we are debating today could not have helped any of those diseases or could not have helped my granddaughter , but maybe it could . 
i am also going to vote for castle-degette because of the future , not just the past . 
now , we just voted for an expansion of cord blood and bone marrow research , which is a very , very good deal , and it deals with adult stem cells . 
but maybe , just maybe , it is going to come because of embryonic stem cells . 
but in any event , none of those lines that are currently allowed to be used for research purposes at the federal level have been shown to have that breakthrough stem cell . 
the hope of stem cell research , whether it is adult or embryonic , is that we will find that one perfect cell that can be replicated into any of the other cells . 
it is assumed , and it is an assumption , not a fact , that the plasticity of the embryonic cell is better and that there is a greater likelihood , although the research has only been done for the last 7 or 8 years , that there is a likelihood there might be a greater potential . 
let us also vote for castle-degette and look at all of our resources . 
that is why i am going to vote `` yes. '' mr. speaker , i rise to manage the time of debate on h.r. 810 , legislation designed to expand the number of sources of embryonic stem cell lines that may be the subject of federally funded research . 
before i yield time to my colleagues , i want to clarify a few of the following facts . 
what the sponsors of this bill are trying to do is create enough lines of embryonic stem cells to allow basic scientific research to move forward . 
many scientists believe that once we can identify a perfect , undifferentiated stem call , it will lead to significant scientific breakthroughs and the discovery of cures for many diseases . 
currently , there are approximately 22 lines of embryonic stem cells that are available for federally funded research . 
this number is far below the estimated number of stem cell lines that were thought to exist in august of 2001 , when the president announced his stem cell policy . 
when president bush announced that federal research dollars could be used for the first time on then existing stem cells , it was believed that there were at least 60 viable lines of stem cells that could be used for this research . 
for a variety of reasons , not all of these potential lines are now available for research . 
in recent conversations with leading stem cell researchers , they indicated to me that all lines of embryonic stem cells eventually become exhausted . 
in order to produce clinical therapies , it is likely that researchers will also need more embryonic stem cell lines , of different genetic variations , than are presently eligible to receive federal support . 
in addition , the majority of the existing embryonic stem cell lines eligible for federal support use mouse feeder cells , which will make it nearly impossible for these embryonic stem cell lines to be adopted in clinical use . 
for all of these reasons , researchers believe that the current number of embryonic stem cell lines will have to be increased . 
on recognizing the profound potential benefits of embryonic stem cell research , president bush permitted for the first time federal taxpayer dollars to be spent on embryonic stem cell research . 
for my entire career in congress , i have been a staunch defender of the culture of life and opposed all forms of abortion . 
my decision was shaped , in part , by the painful experiences of my own family . 
we lost my brother jon in 2000 , at the age of 44 , after a long struggle with liver cancer . 
jon died in just three months short of his 44th birthday . 
i offered to give him part of my liver , but the doctors said he was too far-gone and it would n't work . 
every time i see them and their mom , i think of jon and wonder what stem cell research could have done for our family . 
now , a few others will say that death is simply a part of life . 
as we move forward with debate on this bill , my only request is that my colleagues try to respect one another and the deeply held beliefs on both sides of this very complex issue .

mr. speaker , first of all , i want to thank the majority leader , the gentleman from texas ( mr. delay ) xz4001040 , for the tenor of the debate today and for granting extended time and making sure all points of view have been heard on this important issue . 
i respect members on both sides of this issue . 
i made sure that members of the committee i chair , the committee on energy and commerce , regardless of their position , had an opportunity to speak and put their comments on the record . 
i come at this as a 100 percent pro-life , lifetime , voting member of congress . 
i have also voted numerous times for our defense bill , where we have voted hundreds of billions of dollars to defend our nation and put our young men and women at risk , some of them that might have to give up their lives . 
but i would say this : if they did , out of the 400 , 000 that we think may be in existence , if you narrow that down to the 2.8 percent that the gentleman from texas ( mr. delay ) xz4001040 talked about that are probably not going to be used for reproductive purposes , if they did , would not some of them , knowing the stakes , volunteer ? 
it only takes one , the right one , that magic silver bullet embryo that creates that magic stem cell that can be replicated into any of the 200 cell lines that make up the human body . 
if i had that opportunity , might i not take advantage of it ? 
and since they can not , because they do not have consciousness , under a traditional law in this united states of america we give custody to the parents . 
in addition to the cord blood bill that we have just passed , why not make it possible for some of these under the conditions in the castle/degette bill for some to be used for research purposes . 
but i also say given a choice , let us err on the side of opportunity . 
now we will add a fourth option , and that is to allow these embryos to be used for scientific research , to find cures for diseases that have afflicted americans , a large portion of americans , that threaten the lives of young people . 
mr. speaker , i rise in strong support of h.r. 810 . 
the 22 lines currently available under the president 's policy were developed using outdated techniques and have been contaminated , possibly skewing the outcome of experiments . 
in order to explore all of the possibilities , scientists must have access to all three kinds of stem cells : adult , embryonic , and those from the umbilical cord blood . 
mr. speaker , i am proud to support h.r. 810 and for the sake of the millions suffering from diseases , i ask my colleagues to do the same . 
you know , i believe that everybody engaged in this debate today means well , and this is one of those great debates that we have on this floor . 
it is full of passion . 
and the substance of this debate is life , clear and simple . 
while we do not know where embryonic stem cell research might lead us , we do know that engaging in this form of research would require ending a human life for the purpose of experimentation . 
and that is something that i do not think any of us want to sanction . 
and in my opinion , we would be giving away our humanity , our sense of ethics , for the mere hope , the mere hope that this form of research would someday yield results . 
and we hear that by using islet cells from living donors or adult brain cells instead of embryos , there is a potential to cure diabetes . 
we should stop and look at the substance of the debate . 
mr. speaker , i appreciate the gentleman 's courtesy of yielding me this time . 
the question is whether the united states government 's official policy will remain frozen in place , or whether we will exert the same type of leadership that we have exerted in other areas of research , technology , and dealing with human health . 
for the sake of life , for the sake of health , for the sake of our families , i hope that this legislation passes , that we will be able to make sure that the federal government exerts its appropriate role in making sure that we have the resources , the direction , and the control to do this successfully . 
mr. speaker , i thank the chairman for yielding me this time and for his leadership and the leadership of others on this debate today . 
this debate is defined in so many ways by the conscience of each member ; and as each member comes to the floor , as each member speaks , i think my colleagues can see that this debate uniquely is based on their own view of this and their deeply founded view of this . 
because we feel on both sides of this aisle , apparently , today that this is a matter of real conscience . 
this is a matter about the very definition of life itself . 
because of that , i am firmly on the side of those who believe it is not time yet to federally fund this particular kind of research . 
some states like the state of california recently decided they would fund this in a significant way . 
the ethics of this issue , as the gentlewoman from ohio ( ms. kaptur ) xz4002110 suggested earlier , are not as clear as they should be . 
the future ownership and use of this research is not as clear as it needs to be . 
the first principle of bioethics should be : first , do no harm . 
we are at the point when we can say that all of those concerns that this research is not possible if we do not fund it with federal funding are just not right . 
i do not agree with it myself , but i particularly do not agree that we should take the tax money of millions and millions of taxpayers who believe this is absolutely wrong and pay for this research in that way . 
mr. speaker , every invention , each new scientific concept , every technical advance in the history of mankind has been challenged and analyzed and debated , and properly so . 
change makes us uncomfortable , forces us to design new paradigms ; but in the final analysis , it is man 's fundamental obligation to use science for the betterment of mankind . 
the answer is , no , we should move forward with important scientific research , forward movement which will be enhanced in a measured way by passage of the measure before us . 
mr. speaker , i rise in strong support of h.r. 810 . 
i would like to thank the chairman for all of his work in bringing this bill to the floor , and i would like to thank my leadership for allowing a vote on this important legislation . 
as representatives , we are in the unique position to frequently meet with a wide cross-section of people , many of whom are suffering from debilitating diseases , injuries , and ailments . 
these millions of patients , as well as their loved ones , have a clear message for policymakers : we support this research and we need their help . 
opponents of this bill have argued that we should not use federal funds to pay for embryonic stem cell research . 
scientists and researchers throughout the united states are constantly reminding us that the focus needs to be on the quality of the stem cell lines available which are eligible for federal research . 
i would also like to state that there is no funding for the derivation of the lines and the lines must be ethically in accordance with the principles the president has laid out in his policy . 
dana reeves , the widow of actor and activist christopher reeves , sat with me less than 2 months ago and shared her family 's devastating story . 
dana and nancy are just two of the more visible faces of public figures who have asked for this research . 
today , mr. speaker , we will consider two bills that have significant bearing on the future of medicine and medical research in our country . 
i want to thank the gentleman from new jersey ( mr. smith ) xz4003801 and the gentleman from texas ( mr. barton ) xz4000180 for their work on the first of these bills . 
cord blood and bone marrow have several therapeutic uses in common : first and foremost , the treatment of blood diseases . 
with this kind of coordinated program , there will be a single entry point for transplant doctors and their patients to locate available cord blood units . 
this bill also increases outreach and education efforts so that we can amass the most diverse possible reserves of cord blood . 
in addition to the therapeutic uses of cord blood , this bill makes cord blood stem cells available for research purposes . 
there is clearly therapeutic potential in the use of cord blood and adult stem cells . 
some of the most important research in this area is taking place in ohio , in northeast ohio , where i call home , at the national center for regenerative medicine , a partnership of case western reserve university hospitals , and the cleveland clinic in cleveland . 
i mentioned we will be considering two bills today that have significant bearing on the future of medicine . 
each type of research holds unique potential . 
for example , while adult stem cells represent an important advance in the treatment of blood disorders , these cells simply do not occur in every tissue in the body . 
because there are no adult stem cells , for example , in the pancreas , the potential of adult stem cells to develop into therapies for a disease like diabetes is very limited . 
that is one example of many . 
embryonic stem cell , on the other hand , can grow into any type of cell in the body , making potential use of these far more diverse and far more valuable . 
we should not minimize the importance of cord-blood and adult stem cell research , but by the same token , we should n't mislead the public into believing that if smith-barton passes , the castle-degette bill is unnecessary , because surely it is not . 
it is irresponsible and even dangerous for members of this body to distort the value of one form of research in order to stifle another promising avenue of research . 
we in this congress have a responsibility to support medical research and to foster its development , as the committee of the gentleman from texas ( mr. barton ) xz4000180 committee has done well over time . 
millions of lives have been saved and improved because of the brilliant research conducted in this country . 
both sides of this debate owe it to the public to draw clear lines between the beliefs we hold and the facts that hold , regardless of what we believe . 
the fact is , if we invest in all three types of research , we may finally be able to find cures for debilitating illnesses , cures that are currently beyond our reach . 
people that you and i know , they may be friends , they may be family members , they may be professional colleagues , will suffer and die from potentially curable illnesses while we wait for the rest of the world to fill our shoes . 
embryonic stem cell research does not and need not increase the number of embryos that are destroyed . 
instead , it decreases the number of embryos that are destroyed in vain . 
we will have an opportunity today to pass two pieces of legislation , both are important , that will deliver hope to patients whose futures depend on new answers to life and death medical questions . 
mr. speaker , i urge members to vote in favor of both the smith-barton bill and the castle-degette bill . 
mr. speaker , i reserve the balance of my time . 
mr. speaker , i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from new york ( mr. engel ) xz4001220 , a member of the health subcommittee . 
mr. speaker , i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from texas ( mr. gene green ) , an outstanding member of the health subcommittee . 
mr. speaker , i reserve the balance of my time . 
mr. speaker , we wonder , as most medical scientists wonder , why not both kinds of research . 
we in no way want to restrict it to just one or the other like my friends on the other side of the aisle . 
mr. speaker , i reserve the balance of my time . 
mr. speaker , i reserve the balance of my time . 
mr. speaker , i would like to share the words from the president who seems to have sent a different message than my friends on the other side of the aisle . 
president bush said , `` most scientists believe that research on embryonic stem cells offers the most promise because these cells have the potential to develop in all of the tissues in the body. '' i hear my friends on the other side of the aisle argue that we really only need cord blood stem cell research , that that will lead us to all that we need . 
and the president said about that , that `` no adult stem cell has been shown in culture to be pluripotent. '' and he said , `` embryonic stem cells have the potential to develop into all or nearly all of the tissues in the body. '' i then hear my friends on the other side of the aisle talk about research , that this is going to lead to so much more research . 
yet at the same time we have seen no increase , flat-lined spending , budgeting on the national institutes of health , something that many of us , the gentlewoman from colorado ( ms. degette ) xz4001010 and many of the rest of us , have thought we should increase spending on , medical research all across the board in all kinds of medical research . 
so when i hear my friends talk on this , i do not quite get how this will expand medical research while closing out one whole avenue of medical research and , at the same time , cutting spending on what we should be doing to move our country ahead . 
mr. speaker , i yield the remainder of my time to the gentlewoman from colorado ( ms. degette ) xz4001010 , the sponsor of this bill . 
mr. speaker , i come from florida , and a lot of people think that only retirees and seniors live in florida , but i want to put a face on a couple that was very successful with in vitro fertilization . 
they had a daughter born as a result of in vitro fertilization . 
and when you look at the huge book of pork that comes out every single year , when we go back home and say to our constituents , would you rather have some of this money going to , for example , some foreign countries that regularly turn their backs on us , or would you like to see some significant research done from embryonic stem cells that would be disposed of , the majority of our constituents are clearly going to say , use the money for significant research . 
mr. speaker , i rise today in strong support of h.r. 810 , the stem cell research enhancement act of 2005 . 
i stand with 200 of america 's most respected research organizations in support of this bill . 
i would like to especially thank congressmen castle and degette for their tireless efforts on behalf of the millions of people who may benefit from enhanced stem cell research . 
i would also like to thank speaker hastert and leader delay for the debate today and for giving the 200+ cosponsors of this legislation a vote on the house floor . 
i rise today as a mother , as a concerned grandparent , and as someone who is worried that the untapped potential of stem cell research may be falling by the wayside . 
in my congressional district on the gulf coast of florida , i have had the pleasure of meeting holly , a 47-year-old mother of two . 
holly and her husband are well aware of operation snowflake and the adoption options for their embryos . 
put another way , the issue of embryos and their ability to be used for stem cell research is kind of like a flashlight . 
in addition , when the couple stops paying the daily fees to store the embryos , unless they have the medical donation option , their remaining embryos will be disposed of as medical waste . 
additionally , i have yet to hear in this entire debate what opponents of h.r. 810 would do with those embryos that are not adopted , and eventually go to waste in a cryogenic freezer . 
holly and her husband know that the great potential and promise of stem cell research will not move forward without their donated embryos and their support . 
however , it is their respect for the culture of life that has brought them to this decision . 
they have weighed the choices available to them , and rather than donating the embryo for adoption , have chosen to let their embryos potentially save millions of lives . 
thousands of people around the country have made similar decisions to support life-affirming and life-enhancing research . 
passage of this bill today will let the research on stem cells continue under ethical guidelines , and will provide millions of americans suffering from terminal diseases the hope that they have been denied . 
i urge my fellow members of congress to vote yes on the bill 
honesty is an important part of this debate , and i am concerned that more than a promise has been offered to people who are suffering and the reality is that those potential treatments are much more limited than they have been portrayed . 
the president , i think , wisely put parameters , set boundaries around this type of research back in 2001 . 
the reality is in a poll of my reproductive endocrinologists back home : that never comes up as an issue . 
zerhouni 's testimony before our committee , that will be developed after the issue of animal growth medium becomes overcome . 
the reality is if there are indeed a third of the population of the united states who would benefit from this research , i believe that the big biotech money would be jumping into this . 
remember that that inner cell mass that we are talking about that is taken at about 2 weeks of development , if we put that on a timeline of a human pregnancy , about 5 days later we are going to see a heartbeat on a sonogram . 
mr. speaker , today the house can vote to give millions of americans suffering from diseases new hope . 
my state of california is already on the way . 
californians overwhelmingly support this research and decided not to tie the hands of our scientists , not to block the promising new opportunities that stem cell research affords . 
this is the kind of research we wanted when we created the national institutes of health . 
mr. speaker , as my colleague from massachusetts eloquently stated a minute ago , today this house has a historic opportunity to vote for hope , hope for millions of americans suffering with devastating diseases . 
one of my dearest friends recently died of als , or lou gehrig 's disease , which causes fatal destruction of nerve cells . 
with heart disease affecting so many of us in this nation , the promise of embryonic stem cell research has advancements for the human heart which are incredible to think of . 
instead of patients suffering because their heart cells are failing and no longer able to pump blood , new ways could be discovered to replace those cells . 
for example , it could facilitate the testing of new medications and treatments , not in time for my daughter 's life , but for her young children 's generation . 
in each of these cases , stem cell research holds out promise . 
it will expand the ability of the national institutes of health to fund this research and improve the chances for finding new treatments and cures . 
as we have discussed , each year thousands of embryos no bigger than the head of a pin are created in the process of in vitro fertilization . 
a small percentage of these embryos are implanted and , hopefully , become much-longed-for children . 
some of the rest will be frozen , but most are discarded . 
but under h.r. 810 , with the informed consent of the donor , under strict ethical guidelines , these embryos can be used to give life to millions of americans . 
mr. speaker , i rise in support of h.r. 810 . 
this bipartisan legislation will enhance existing stern cell research and help our nation 's scientists make significant progress toward the development of treatments for conditions affecting more than 100 million americans . 
today , the house is considering opening new lines of research -- research that will help the united states retain its place as a world leader in this burgeoning new field , while helping to alleviate the pain and suffering of many around the world . 
current federal policy , put into place by president bush on august 9 , 2001 , allows federal funds to be used to support research from the stern cell lines that existed on that date , but it bans the creation of additional stern cells from embryos that are stored at in vitro fertilization clinics . 
in fact , only 22 lines are available and some of these were found to have been contaminated from contact with mouse `` feeder '' cells . 
scientists at the national institutes of health report that these lines also lack the genetic diversity necessary to perform extensive research for diseases that disproportionately since the president 's policy was implemented , i have heard from hundreds of marylanders who have been diagnosed with debilitating illnesses , including leukemia , diabetes , parkinson 's disease , alzheimer 's disease , and spinal cord injuries . 
they are grateful for the federal research funding that congress has provided in past years , particularly the doubling of the nih budget over a five year period , and they look to the future with hope that more effective treatments and someday , cures , will be forthcoming . 
two of the finest academic medical centers are located in baltimore -- the university of maryland medical center and the johns hopkins university medical center . 
some of my colleagues have raised ethical concerns about stem cell research , and i believe that this bill effectively addresses these concerns . 
the authors of this bill , mr. castle and ms. degette , have written this legislation so as to not encourage the creation of human embryos for research or for any other purposes . 
this bill stipulates that all embryos used for research must have been originally created for in vitro fertilization and are in excess of clinical need ; it requires that the embryos would not have been implanted and would have otherwise been discarded ; and it requires donors to provide written consent before embryos may be donated for research . 
these guidelines are ethically sound ; they help ensure that enhancing stem cell research policy will not come at the expense of respect for human life . 
back in june of 2001 , our knowledge of stem cell research 's potential was nowhere near what it is now , and we did not yet know what the president would propose . 
today , we have much broader and deeper knowledge about the scientific possibilities of stem cells , but much less capacity to research stem cell lines than we had anticipated . 
today , i will vote to keep my promise to sue and faith stamos and to the thousands of other marylanders who are waiting for cures . 
it touches on questions of human suffering , medical ethics , scientific potential , the role of government , moral considerations , and life itself . 
it encourages research , but it does not encourage the creation of embryos for research purposes . 
it allows us to support the efforts of the brilliant scientists in our research institutions who have dedicated their careers to alleviating the suffering of others . 
it allows us to honor the wishes of in vitro fertilization donors who want to make a contribution toward medical advancement . 
mr. speaker , i wish to express my strong , principled and hopeful support of h.r. 810 . 
i commend the vital leadership of my brave colleagues , representatives castle and degette , for bringing this urgent issue to the floor . 
scientists regard embryonic stem cell research as one of the greatest hopes for the cure of medical conditions such as parkinson 's disease and diabetes due to their unique ability to develop into virtually any type of cell in the body . 
recently , researchers at the university of miami came up with a technique to transform embryonic stem cells into the insulin-producing cells destroyed by type-l diabetes . 
such research may also help us better understand the causes of birth defects , genetic abnormalities , and other conditions that arise during the critical period of early human growth . 
other possible medical applications include the repair of crippling injuries such as spinal cord damage and the ability to correct the damaging side effects of existing medical treatments like chemotherapy . 
we must continue to support the work of our brilliant scientists and help them once again lead the world in this vitally important new field . 
this bipartisan legislation would expand the scope of stem cell research while enacting stringent procedural guidelines . 
all activities would be subject to the strict ethical guidelines of the national institutes of health . 
the cells used in this research will be donated voluntarily by patients of in-vitro fertilization clinics . 
mr. speaker , i rise today in support of h.r. 2520 , which establishes a national cord blood stem cell inventory , a cord blood system , and to reauthorize the national bone marrow registry . 
this is an important piece of legislation because it addresses a vital need to establish a publicly coordinated national umbilical cord blood bank similar to the national bone marrow registry . 
however , it is important to note that umbilical cord blood cells are a type of adult stem cells that have been used only to treat blood disorders like leukemia and lymphoma . 
david shaywitz , an endocrinologist and stem cell researcher at harvard , it seems extremely unlikely that adult blood cells or blood cells from the umbilical cord will be therapeutically useful as a source of anything else but blood . 
that is why we must support all forms of stem cell research , including embryonic stem cell research , so researchers have the greatest chance of discovering treatments and cures . 
mr. speaker , just speaking to the members perhaps back in the offices listening , i have 820 , 000 constituents in delaware , and probably more than a third of them have some kind of a disease that might be able to be benefited by embryonic stem cell research . 
that is true of the figures in the country . 
we have 110 million people who have illnesses out of the 290 million people who are living here . 
i am all for the first bill we debated today because i think it might help somewhat , but i have also looked at some statistics and i have come to realize that of the 15 leading diseases , adult stem cells can not do anything about 14 of them and can do a only little bit about heart diseases as they deal with only blood diseases in terms of what they can do . 
if you read the vast body of research in the united states of america on this subject by people who are truly knowledgeable , you are going to learn there is more potential here than anything that has ever happened in medicine in the history of the united states of america . 
but at the end of the process , a decision is made by the individuals that may be involved with that . 
if the decision is they no longer want that particular embryo , they may do a variety of things with it . 
that is where the vast , almost all of them actually go as hospital waste . 
we want to give them the opportunity to say , within that embryo there are stem cells which could help other people live better lives and give them the opportunity to be able , instead of having it put in a bag for hospital waste , sitting at that table , to be put over here , and the state to be able to do the research . 
we need to be able to develop that as rapidly as we possibly can for the benefit of all mankind . 
mr. speaker , i rise today in support of h.r. 810 , the stem cell research enhancement act . 
i have been in public office for over 30 years and throughout my career , i -- just like all of you -- have had the opportunity to change and improve public policy so this country may continue to flourish on the principles it was founded . 
and the 820 , 000 people i represent in the state of delaware are a constant reminder to me of this responsibility . 
i am their voice in the congress of the united states . 
some of you may be wondering why i have become so interested and involved in embryonic stem cell research . 
we estimated that about one-half of all visits to my office are about health care and about one-half of those visits are by delawareans who are suffering themselves or whose family members are suffering -- from juvenile diabetes , alzheimer 's , cancer , parkinson 's , hiv and hosts of other dredge diseases . 
in the early years we would discuss the necessity of funding the national institutes of health , and i was proud to be able to support newt gingrich and the republican party 's drive to double funding for the nih . 
her parents were first time parents so it is no wonder that the practice of testing her blood sugar and giving her insulin shots was extremely heartbreaking . 
she is one of 110 million people who are suffering that may be helped by stem cell research . 
i remember very clearly the difficult decision president bush made on august 9 , 2001 and i know how careful he was to balance the needs of science with his own moral concerns . 
but as we know , unfortunately , the number of lines eligible for research -- once as high as 78 -- is now only at 22 , with the nih saying the number of lines will never get above 23 . 
the legislation we are going to vote on today , h.r. 810 , the stem cell research enhancement act , which has the backing of the medical groups , the scientists , the research universities and the patient advocacy groups , mirrors the president 's ethical requirements . 
i will read them to you and ask that you think about them very closely : ( 1 ) embryos used to derive stem cells were originally created for fertility treatment purposes and are in excess of clinical need ; ( 2 ) the individuals seeking fertility treatments for whom the embryos were created have determined that the embryos will not be implanted in a woman and will otherwise be discarded ; and , ( 3 ) the individuals for whom the embryos were created have provided written consent for embryo donation and without receiving financial inducement . 
it is also critical that we are clear about what this legislation does not do : ( 1 ) no federal funding for the destruction of embryos or human life . 
( 2 ) no federal funding for the creation of embryos for research . 
they are created in a petri dish , are about 5 days old and are the size of a pine head . 
of the 400 , 000 frozen embryos in in vitro fertilization clinics throughout the u.s. , about 2 percent are discarded annually -- that is about 8 , 000 -- 11 , 000 embryos that could be slated for research . 
allowing the option of donating these excess embryos to research is similar to donating organs for organ transplantation in order to save or improve the quality of another person 's life . 
throughout this debate you will hear about adult stem cells and more about umbilical cord cells and how these types of cells are sufficient for scientists . 
adult and umbilical cord cells are already differentiated into the types of cells they are , they are difficult to harvest and grow and they do not exist for every tissue type . 
on the other hand , embryonic stem cells are `` master cells '' -- they have the potential to grow into any type of cell in the body , they are easier to identify , isolate , purify and grow and they are capable of continual reproduction . 
this means that embryonic stem cells may be pluripotent -- that is , able to give rise to cells found in all tissues of the embryo except for germ cells rather than being merely multipotent -- restricted to specific subpopulations of cell types , as adult stem cells are thought to be . 
in 2003 , 1.6 million people died of heart disease , cancer , diabetes , alzheimer 's , kidney disease , liver disease and parkinson 's . 
of the 15 leading causes of death , adult stem cell research only addresses one . 
we must explore research on all types of stem cells , but the reality is the only policy that is restricted is the federal embryonic stem cell policy . 
why should we waste one more year , one more day , forcing millions to suffer because of a policy that is outdated and unworkable . 
mr. speaker , i reserve the balance of my time . 
mr. speaker , i reserve the balance of my time . 
mr. speaker , i reserve the balance of my time . 
mr. speaker , i reserve the balance of our time . 
mr. speaker , i yield 1 minute to the gentleman from new york ( mr. boehlert ) xz4000350 , the chairman of the committee on science . 
mr. speaker , i reserve the balance of my time . 
mr. speaker , i reserve the balance of my time . 
mr. speaker , i reserve the balance of my time . 
mr. speaker , i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman physician from the state of michigan ( mr. schwarz ) xz4006370 . 
sometimes there are issues of such critical social importance that it is only right that the congress of the united states do this in the open , and they did that and for that we should all be very appreciative . 
i just want to leave my colleagues with some closing thoughts , perhaps some of the things i started with . 
there are 110 million people just in the united states of america out of 290 million who have some sort of illness that potentially could be helped by the use of embryonic stem cells . 
most of those will never be helped by the use of adult stem cells . 
we know that anything other than just the use of adult stem cells in blood tissues has been experimental at best and probably will never work . 
we talk about life , and i do not necessarily want to get into that argument back and forth , but the bottom line is there are a lot of lives that are being foreshortened in the united states of america and across the world that perhaps could be lived out to their fullest if that opportunity was given to the individuals involved . 
the national institutes of health said : `` human embryonic stem cells are thought to have much greater developmental potential than adult stem cells . 
this means that embryonic stem cells may be pluripotent , that is , able to give rise to cells found in all tissues of the embryo except for germ cells rather than being merely multipotent , restricted to specific subpopulations of cell types , as adult stem cells are thought to be. '' that is where the science is . 
there are discussions of dollars . 
there are no dollars used directly in the destruction of embryos at an in vitro fertilization clinic . 
not a lot of options . 
one of them is to give that particular embryo up for adoption . 
some people may make other decisions , but basically it will be one of two decisions if this legislation passes . 
there are about 400 , 000 of these embryos . 
that is an estimate of about 3 years ago . 
a lot of people now , if this passes , are going to be offered the opportunity to give up the embryo for research instead of hospital waste , and they are going to make that decision , and we will get the kind of work that we need . 
i would just close by saying that 14 out of the 15 diseases that are most likely to kill people in the world are not ever going to be helped by adult stem cells . 
with your vote today you can provide hope to tens of millions of americans and many more around the world . 
sadly , passage of this bill will put the government and taxpayers in the position of sanctioning and funding the destruction of that human life . 
now , we all feel strongly about the need for aggressive and advanced research to cure and combat the myriad of diseases that prematurely take the lives of our friends and our family members and our fellow citizens . 
that is why i am so supportive of the rapid progress being made in the fields of adult and umbilical cord stem cell research . 
cord blood stem cells have already been used to treat patients , we have been hearing , for up to 67 diseases , and it is my understanding they have the potential to become any kind of cell , similar to what embryonic stem cells do . 
while i recognize that many proponents of this bill offer their support with good intentions , in this case we do have clear alternatives , and i would strongly urge my colleagues to support adult and umbilical and reject this bill . 
mr. speaker , i rise today to voice my support for the stem cell therapeutics and research act of 2005 . 
as many of my colleagues have discussed , this bill provides federal support to help cord blood banks collect and maintain new cord blood units . 
through the nmdp today , individuals in need of a cord blood transplant already have access to the largest listing of cord blood units in the united states -- more than 42 , 000 units . 
in addition , the nmdp lists more than 9 million i am particularly proud of the work of the nmdp , especially its strong support for cord blood and because of its partnership with the st . 
louis cord blood bank is the cornerstone of an active clinical stem cell transplantation and research program at cardinal glennon children 's hospital and st . 
louis cord blood bank , the nmdp partners with 14 of the 20 u.s. public cord blood banks . 
another 3 are in the process of becoming partners . 
together , the nmdp and these cord blood banks are working to increase the national inventory of cord blood available for transplants and research . 
their work helps thousands of americans with life-threatening diseases , such as sickle cell anemia . 
physicians should not have to waste time searching multiple cord blood banks and adult donor registries or having to coordinate the further testing and delivery of units . 
physicians need to be confident that the results of their searches allow them to truly compare cord blood units and adult donor information . 
thus , the cord blood community should work with the national program to establish criteria and standards to ensure consistency of the information that is part of the registry . 
the nmdp already provides physicians and their patients with this type of support . 
therefore , i urge my colleagues to vote in favor of h.r. 2520 , which provides for an integrated national program . 
mr. speaker , i rise in strong support of h.r. 810 . 
we are talking about improving the lives of countless numbers of people in this country . 
we are talking about putting american health care and researchers in the best position to finding the cures for today 's diseases tomorrow and to preventing the diseases of tomorrow today . 
doctors , researchers , and scientists spoke about how the president 's strict limits on stem cell research is prohibiting them from conducting the level of research that they would like to do . 
some of those embryos cryogenically deteriorate so they are going to discard those embryos . 
this is an issue of life to me . 
i am for life and i am for the quality of life , but i do not want another 6-year-old to die . 
mr. speaker , most of my colleagues that support this bill are from the pro-choice field . 
a lot of times i disagree with my colleagues because i think in some cases they would go further , and a fact that many people will not take under their wing is that many of these stem cells are going to be thrown away , either cryogenically they deteriorate and they throw them away , or a woman says `` i do n't want to keep them for 1 , 000 years '' and they discard them . 
if you take a look at some of the blood diseases with bone marrow used , that is stem cell . 
mr. speaker , let me begin by joining the various members of this institution who will speak today and who will urge the passage of both of these bills . 
i certainly can not speak with the particular passion of the gentlewoman from california ( ms. matsui ) xz4006631 who has been touched by this issue , but this is a very good day for the house of representatives . 
it is a very good day , because we have managed to reach across the partisan divides , i believe twice today , or we will manage to reach across the partisan divide , i believe twice today , to pass bills that are good for the american people and good for countless numbers of americans who need this research . 
i have had the honor for 2 years of working with the gentleman from new jersey ( mr. smith ) xz4003801 on this bill , and i am a democratic sponsor on it ; and i want to thank him for his good work . 
the young man that we saw on the cannon terrace yesterday who suffered from sickle cell anemia whose life has been permanently transformed by cord blood cell technology speaks to the power of this bill . 
it actually provides relief for a group of people who otherwise would not have seen it . 
but i want to talk for just a moment about the concept of principled difference , because i think it is very much illustrated today . 
and as circumstance has it , both of these approaches are before us today . 
the final point that i will make is that i firmly believe that we have all of our genius and all of our brilliance as a scientific and medical community for a very good reason . 
i am hopeful that all of the technological advances that have happened in the last several years , with cord blood cells and with stem cells , can make a significant difference . 
so to all the members of this institution , i simply urge them and encourage them to vote for both of these bills but , even more importantly , to accept this as an example of what happens when democrats and republicans find intelligent common ground . 
there will be people who will benefit from this , and i do not think it is going too far to say that lives will be saved because of these two bills . 
so i thank the gentleman from new jersey ( mr. smith ) xz4003801 for his good work and , again , i am honored to be the lead democratic sponsor of the cord blood bill . 
in the absence of the federal government , the states are already taking the lead . 
california is at the forefront of establishing a robust embryonic stem cell research program . 
new jersey has followed suit , and seven other states are in the process of doing so . 
we do not want our stem cell research policies left to the vagaries of state electoral politics . 
the less nih is involved with its time-tested methods and procedures , the less we are assured of good ethical guidelines and scientific methods will be followed . 
opponents argue that it is the product of a utilitarian world view , that somehow this is a zero-sum game , if the members will , in which life is taken in order to give life . 
under this bill , federal research will proceed using those embryos not used in fertility clinics , embryos voluntarily given that would otherwise be destroyed , that is , embryos that held the promise of life but are certain not to fulfill that promise . 
i urge passage of h.r. 810 . 
like adult stem cells , umbilical cord stem cells have proven to be a source of hematopoietic stem cells . 
instead of proliferating , they quickly evolve into specialized cells . 
that is why they have not proven to be useful in some of the early studies . 
now , the opponents of h.r. 810 say , well , embryonic stem cells have not been used to cure any disease . 
that is because we are in the very promising early stages of that research . 
mr. speaker , i am here to say that there is no , no scientific evidence today that will show that the cord blood or the adult stem cells will cure alzheimer 's , parkinson 's , type 1 diabetes , or the multitude of other diseases that are not blood based . 
now , some of the opponents of h.r. 810 say , well , scientific studies have shown adult stem cells to be pluripotent . 
furthermore , the studies where there were some indications of that were not peer reviewed and , frankly , are rejected by the scientific community . 
if people do not want to do embryonic stem cell research , they can look in the eye of our colleague , the gentleman from massachusetts ( mr. langevin ) xz4002300 and others and say to them , we do not want to do the research that could cure your disease , and i challenge them to do that . 
in conclusion , curt civin , m.d. , who is a doctor at johns hopkins university school of medicine and a researcher , says `` as a physician-scientist who has done research involving umbilical cord stem cells for over 20 years , i am frequently surprised by the thought from nonscientists that core blood stem cells may provide an alternative to embryonic stem cells for research . 
mr. speaker , i yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman from new york ( ms. slaughter ) xz4003780 for the purpose of making a unanimous-consent request . 
mr. speaker , before yielding to the gentlewoman from new york ( mrs. lowey ) xz4002460 , i would just yield a minute to myself to respond to a couple of comments . 
first of all , there is a misconception here . 
last year it was really $ 25 million , and the reason is because the president 's policy , issued in august of 2001 , has not worked . 
instead of 80 or 90 stem cell lines , we only had around 19 to 22 stem cell lines . 
and of those lines , all of them were contaminated with mouse `` feeder '' cells , and many of them were not available to researchers here in country . 
in 1995 , two members of congress , mr. dickey and the gentleman from mississippi ( mr. wicker ) xz4004320 , inserted language in the appropriations bill , which is there every year and has been there every year i have been in congress , and it says : `` no federal funds shall be used to create or destroy embryos. '' now , those on the other side of this debate say they do not think federal funds should be used for this research , even though by their own admission the majority of americans support this research . 
what it says is , people who go to in vitro fertilization clinics , there are leftover embryos as part of the process . 
they can decide one of two things : number one , do they want to not discard the embryos and either donate them to other couples , and they can be these snowflake children , or to store them in a freezer ? 
just as the president 's executive order in august of 2001 allowed stem cell lines to be researched with federal funding , but he limited those lines , we are allowing more of those lines . 
i assume no one on the other side of this issue would want to force everybody to give up their embryos for adoption , because clearly that would be limiting the choice that people have . 
mr. speaker , i have no further speakers , and i am intending to reserve the rest of my time for closing . 
mr. speaker , i yield for the purpose of making a unanimous consent request to the gentlewoman from texas ( ms. jackson-lee ) xz4001990 . 
mr. speaker , i yield myself the balance of my time . 
mr. speaker , first i would like to give my heartfelt thanks to my partner , the gentleman from delaware ( mr. castle ) xz4000700 , our bipartisan whip team , the 201 cosponsors of this bill , and so many others who spoke today from the bottom of their hearts . 
more than 100 years ago , justice oliver wendell holmes recognized that we are living in an increasingly complex world and that `` the chief worth of civilization is just that it makes the means of living more complex. '' this world , he says , `` calls for great and combined intellectual efforts instead of simple , uncoordinated ones. '' the truth of justice holmes ' words in today 's complex world is best seen in the state of scientific research . 
we are on the verge of breakthroughs that will cure diseases that affect tens of millions of americans . 
yet some want to turn away from this potential , to refuse to even acknowledge its existence , simply because they do not understand the complexity of this issue . 
this refusal is slowing the process of ethical science and , worse , delaying advancements that could cure diseases that affect patients and families around the world . 
research moves ahead , but not with the resources and coordination of the national institutes of health and without clear ethical standards . 
it gives the patients for whom the embryos are created the decision on how they will be used : as now , freezing for possible future use ; discarding them as medical waste or donating them to other couples for implantation ; and if this bill passes , another option , donating them for critical research that could save millions of lives of people who are already born . 
both of these boys have type 1 diabetes , and both of them have been diagnosed since they were 2. a couple of months ago , little noah had convulsions in the middle of the night from low blood sugar . 
how can we tell these boys , these two boys and millions of others , that we would rather throw the embryonic stem cells that could provide them a cure than to allow them to be donated for science ? 
how can we tell our colleagues , the gentleman from rhode island ( mr. langevin ) xz4002300 and the gentleman from illinois ( mr. evans ) xz4001260 , our mothers with alzheimer 's , our brothers with lou gehrig 's disease , the millions of americans who are praying for a cure and for whom embryonic stem cell research may hold the key , sorry , the federal government is opting out ? 
mr. speaker , i am proud to stand on the house floor today to speak in favor of the stem cell research enhancement act , legislation which will bring hope to millions of people suffering from disease in this nation . 
the discovery of embryonic stem cells is a major scientific breakthrough . 
this could have profound implications for diseases such as alzheimer 's , parkinson 's , various forms of brain and spinal cord disorders , diabetes , and many types of cancer . 
according to the coalition for the advancement of medical research , there are at least 58 diseases which could potentially be cured through stem cell research . 
however , that is vastly different from stem cell research and as an ovarian cancer survivor , i am not going to stand in the way of science . 
permitting peer-reviewed federal funds to be used for this research , combined with public oversight of these activities , is our best assurance that research will be of the highest quality and performed with the greatest dignity and moral responsibility . 
this congress must not stand in the way of that progress . 
we have an opportunity to change the lives of millions , and i hope we take it . 
we will consider several measures under suspension of the rules . 
a final list of those bills will be sent to members ' offices by the end of the week . 
on tuesday and the balance of the week , the house will consider several bills under a rule : h.r. 810 , the stem cell research enhancement act of 2005 ; h.r. 2419 , the energy and water development appropriations act for fiscal year 2006 ; and h.r. 1815 , the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2006 . 
in addition , mr. speaker , we plan to consider the military quality of life appropriations act for fiscal year 2006 sometime later in the week . 
hopefully , we could finish that bill by tuesday night and start the dod authorization bill on wednesday and thursday , if necessary , and complete the week with the military quality of life appropriations bill . 
i would anticipate the same types of amendments being allowed that has been sort of tradition around here on the dod authorization bill . 
most of the amendments would be considered by the rules committee , but obviously it is too early to tell what the rules committee will finally do . 
in working with the minority leader 's office and your office , there have been requests to accommodate some members and start this debate early in the afternoon instead of early in the morning . 
i would , along with the unanimous-consent request , anticipate us working out an agreeable time , and i would expect after discussions already being held that we would anticipate the debate to start on that bill somewhere early in the afternoon and running for the length of time agreed to by both sides . 
as the gentleman knows and most of the members know , the appropriations committee is trying their best to get all the appropriations bills out of the house before the july 4 break , so there is very little time between now and the fourth of july to do other bills . 
we will probably have to consider some type of short-term extension next week , hopefully an agreed-to extension bill . 
mr. speaker , i would just say that the president has been criticized for not vetoing any bills over the last 4 1/2 years , but it has become a tradition around here to include the president as we do legislation through the house and the senate and therefore working out any of our differences so that he would not have to veto a bill , and i do not see that the highway bill is any different than anything else we have been doing for the last 4 1/2 years . 
i would just point out to the gentleman that in the good old days that he refers to , yes , this house had a great reputation for wanting to spend more money , and those days have changed in that the president is adamant about spending and spending the right amount of money to do the job and the house has concurred in that many times and have voted in the house . 
mr. speaker , the issue of human cloning and embryonic stem cell research cuts to the very core of politics . 
and today the house will hear passionate arguments , essentially about the nature and value of human life . 
now , that debate will be , among other things , controversial , because the proponents of embryo destruction in the name of progress believe it is not the embryo destruction its opponents oppose , but rather progress itself . 
this bill , which provides for federal funding of research using adult stem cells which have , unlike embryonic stem cells , proven medical benefits in treating more than 60 separate diseases , will pass with the overwhelming support of both sides of this debate . 
now , this bill , sponsored by the gentleman from new jersey ( mr. smith ) xz4003801 will , for the first time , provide for taxpayer-funded research on well-developed stem cells from umbilical cords , expand federal funding in bone marrow stem cell research , and provide for the development of a national stem cell therapy database for medical practitioners and researchers . 
this is what progress is , mr. speaker , concrete , definable and based on fact , rather than speculation or a false sense of hope . 
the best one can say about embryonic stem cell research is that it is a scientific exploration into the potential benefits of killing human beings . 
proponents of medical research on destroyed human embryos would justify admittedly unfortunate means with the potential ends of medical breakthroughs down the line . 
but the deliberate destruction of unique , living self-integrated human persons is not some incidental tangent of embryonic stem cell research . 
it is the essence of the experiment . 
kill some in hopes of saving others . 
the choice , however well intentioned , is predicated upon a utilitarian view of human life that this bill shows our government need not take . 
the smith bill will fund the only kind of stem cell research that has ever proven medically beneficial , while helping to develop new and exciting avenues of inquiry , all without harming a single human embryo . 
this bill is progress , mr. speaker , and represents a perfect contrast to speculative and harmful methods of embryonic stem cell research . 
progress , even progress that pushes the envelope of medical knowledge , need not be controversial . 
it need not divide us or force people of goodwill to devalue human life . 
progress , in fact , is the opposite of such a choice . 
and the smith bill unites the public and private sectors , both doctors and patients , and recognizes the inherent dignity and value of every human person . 
mr. speaker , i yield 1 minute to the gentleman from georgia ( mr. price ) xz4006261 , a physician for 25 years in georgia and a member of the faculty at emory university . 
mr. speaker , i yield 1 1/2 minutes to the gentleman from texas ( mr. burgess ) xz4000520 , who was an ob/gyn physician for 21 years and has delivered over 3 , 000 babies and understands that an embryo is a stage of development . 
that is what this whole bill does is to allow funding of embryonic stem cell research , and in order to do that research , you have to destroy the embryo . 
that is the whole notion of what is going on here . 
it is not true to say that her bill does not allow federal funding for destruction of embryos . 
i guess they want to add another portion to their bill requiring parents to give their embryos up for research because at the present time there are only 2.8 percent of the parents that have allowed or have designated their embryos to be used for research . 
mr. speaker , i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from louisiana ( mr. boustany ) xz4006360 , a heart surgeon , a graduate from lsu , and chief resident of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery at the university of rochester in rochester , new york . 
mr. speaker , i reserve the balance of my time . 
mr. speaker , could i inquire of the gentlewoman from colorado ( ms. degette ) xz4001010 and the gentleman from michigan ( mr. stupak ) xz4003910 how many speakers they each have left ? 
so i yield , mr. speaker , 3 1/2 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from illinois ( mr. hyde ) xz4001920 , who has been fighting for the culture of life his entire career . 
mr. speaker , i yield myself the balance of my time . 
both sides of this debate wish to ease human suffering . 
for all the arguments we have heard today , scientific , ethical , political , the debate for and against the castle bill , for and against the authorization of federal taxpayer dollars to fund medical research predicated on the destruction of human embryos is in essence a question of the level of respect and dignity our government chooses to grant human life in its earliest stage . 
an embryo is whole , just unfinished , just like the rest of us . 
we were all at one time embryos ourselves , and so was abraham , so was mohammed , so was jesus of nazareth and shakespeare and beethoven and lincoln . 
what level of respect and dignity , then , should our government grant such little creatures , these tiny beings who our eyes suggest are not like us but who our hearts and minds know in fact are us ? 
the castle bill says essentially that the potential medical and scientific progress represented by an embryo 's stem cells justifies , justifies taxpayer funding for the destruction of that embryo through the harvesting of the stem cells . 
of course , it is not the hoped-for end of the castle bill that we oppose , nor necessarily , among some on this side of the aisle , even its destructive means , but instead the entitlement of those destructive means to federal tax dollars . 
we just do not think the government should be forcing the american people to pay for it , especially considering the discouraging track record of the kind of research the castle bill has in mind . 
to date , mr. speaker , none , none , not one of the countless and extraordinarily well-endowed private embryo-cell-harvesting projects has yielded a single treatment for a single disease . 
harvested embryonic stem cells are typically rejected by the host patient and often form cancerous tumors as a byproduct of that rejection . 
in truth , then , it is not the ends that would supposedly justify the grizzly means of the castle bill , but the mere aspiration to those ends . 
on the other hand , better developed stem cells from the umbilical cords of newborn babies and the bone marrow of fully grown adults have led to treatments of no fewer than 67 separate diseases . 
indeed , one might say the stubborn advocacy of embryonic harvesting in the face of the overwhelming clinical evidence of its futility might be a genuine case of ideology trumping science . 
what if all the utopian comments of the castle bill 's proponents were to come true ? 
what if we could be sure that government-funded destruction of human embryos could do all the things we are asked to believe ? 
well , in that case , mr. speaker , we would still be right to oppose it because in the life of men and nations , some mistakes you can not undo . 
a decision by our government to sanction embryo harvesting here at the very dawn of the biotechnology age could come to own us , for the paltry research sum envisioned by the castle bill is but the first generation , the first drop of the deluge . 
its offspring will ultimately include cloning , genetically engineered children , a black market of human body parts , and a global economy organized around the exploitation and hyper-ovulation of impoverished women and girls for their eggs . 
if the mere aspiration of ends justify the means here , in our first ethical challenge of the biotechnology age , how could we hope for a higher standard the next time ? 
which returns me to the irreducible question of this debate : what level of respect and dignity ought this government grant defenseless unburdensome human life at its earliest , most vulnerable stage ? 
given the biological fact of a human embryo 's membership in the human family , given the technological necessity of embryonic destruction as a precondition of embryonic stem cell research , given the medical reality of embryonic stem cell research 's consistent therapeutic failure , given the moral catastrophe of means-justifying-the-ends morality , and given the physical revulsion people instinctively feel when considering the destruction of defenseless human life by scientists in lab coats ; given all these factors , the answer a proponent of taxpayer-funded embryonic stem cell harvesting and research must give is `` none. '' for if we afford the little embryos any shred of respect and dignity , we can not in good faith use taxpayer dollars to destroy them . 
it is just wrong , not as a matter of ideology or even fate , but as a matter of respect and dignity . 
we are not asking anyone here to recognize the rights of human embryos , but the wrongs of human adults . 
because the choice to protect a human embryo from federally funded destruction is not ultimately about the embryos , it is about us and our rejection of the treacherous notion that while all human lives are sacred , some are more sacred than others . 
the issue is a test in which we are asked out of good and pure intentions just this once , just this tiny little bit , to let the ends justify the means , to let the noble aspirations justify ignoble actions . 
in this test , in this vote , then , we have an opportunity today to speak truth to the power of biotechnology , to rise up against the prevailing winds of human excess and hold fast to the dignity of human life upon which all other worldly truths are based : to ensure our appetite for knowledge is checked by our knowledge of our appetites ; to stand up , as only america can , in the name of the least among us , whom we serve , and become the people we are . 
during that period of time , she has worked to raise large sums of money . 
we are all supportive of umbilical cord research , but i believe that it is proper for us to pursue embryonic stem cell research , mr. speaker . 
in a week and a half , we mark the first anniversary of ronald reagan 's passing . 
we all know there are no guarantees at all , but passage of this legislation does provide an opportunity for hope , hope that we will be able to turn the corner on these debilitating diseases from which so many people suffer . 
and while i am concerned that there is disagreement with the president of the united states , i hope that we will be able to , at the end of the day , work out a bipartisan agreement that will include the president of the united states in this effort . 
mr. speaker , as an original cosponsor of h.r. 810 , the stem cell research enhancement act of 2005 , i rise in strong support of this legislation . 
there are ethical concerns over the use of embryonic stem cells in research , and we should not treat stem cells as just another laboratory product . 
but it is important to recognize that , as part of the process of in vitro fertilization , many embryos are created that are never used and are slated to be destroyed . 
with the stringent moral safeguards established by this legislation , including the required written consent of the donors , i believe we should permit the use of stem cells from these embryos . 
the use of embryos for research that would otherwise be destroyed strikes a responsible balance between the ethical and medical values associated with stem cell research . 
the current state of stem cell research suggests that there is significant progress to be made if we move forward in this area . 
leading scientists have testified that adult stem cells and umbilical cord stem cells do not share the ability of embryonic stem cells to replicate all other cells in the human body . 
if we do n't invest in stem cell research , millions of americans with some of the most debilitating diseases will not be able to avail themselves of the treatments or cures that might result . 
in addition , if we fail to invest federal resources in embryonic stem cell research , the u.s. will lose its competitive advantage in this essential area of science . 
the limited federal support for stem cell research is just one area of science in which the u.s. is falling behind . 
nearly 40 percent of u.s. jobs in science or technology requiring a ph.d . 
we now rank below 13 other countries -- including japan , germany , and south korea -- in the percentage of 24-year-olds with a college degree in a science or engineering field -- that 's down from third in the world 25 years ago . 
i urge all of my colleagues to support it . 
i have introduced a constitutional amendment to ban abortions every session of congress since 1997 and have a perfect pro-life voting record . 
cody is a handsome and articulate young man who happens to live in a wheelchair because of a car accident . 
embryonic stem cells are the only avenue for research we know of now that can possibly help alleviate those two diseases . 
neither adult stem cells nor cord blood are plausible for the study or treatment of brain tissue . 
but when presented with an embryo , an embryo that can not live outside a uterus , an embryo that is going to sadly be thrown out as medical waste , and the lives of little james wood and young cody , i ask do they not have as much of a right to life as that embryo that is going to be tossed away ? 
each life is precious , and so i must follow my heart on this and cast a vote in favor of h.r. 810 . 
and i rise in support of h.r. 2520 , the stem cell therapeutic and research act of 2005 . 
this act , combined with h.r. 810 , the stem cell research enhancement act of 2005 , will go a long way towards helping millions of americans who suffer from debilitating health conditions . 
as anyone who suffers from diabetes , parkinson 's disease , als , or a host of other health problems knows , one possible treatment is the use of stem cells to help regrow the tissues affected by their ailments . 
scientists have stated that embryonic stem cells provide the best opportunity for devising unique treatments of these serious diseases since , unlike adult stem cells , they may be induced to develop into any type of cell . 
please understand that i do not discount the promise of adult stem cell research or cord blood research , but i agree with the national institutes of health that we must carefully study all types of adult and embryonic stem cells . 
in their words , `` given the enormous promise of stem cell therapies for so many devastating diseases , nih believes that it is important to simultaneously pursue all lines of research. '' our loved ones deserve science 's best hope for the future . 
i oppose cloning of human beings . 
this is about the use of embryonic stem cells which would have been discarded anyway . 
this is about the use of embryonic stem cells which would have been discarded anyway . 
i would never condone the donation of embryos to science without the informed , written consent of donors and strict regulations prohibiting financial remuneration for potential donors . 
president bush has limited federal funding of stem cell research to only those stem cell lines that existed prior to august of 2001 . 
mr. speaker , i rise in support of this bill , which will expand funding for embryonic stem cell research , and i am proud to be an original cosponsor of it . 
it represents hope for the cure of diseases that plague so many of our people , from juvenile diabetes all the way to the other part of life , which is alzheimer 's , and so many diseases in between . 
this congress and previous congresses have seen fit to double the funding of the national institutes of health . 
i have always called them the national institutes of hope . 
we are now on the threshold , we are now on the threshold of debating an issue that can bring hope to our people . 
that is why no human cloning is a part of the bill that i support . 
the american people are decent and they want an ethical standard , but they also want their nation 's leaders to continue to give hope to them , hope for the cure of these diseases that cause so much human suffering . 
we have a responsibility in terms of our compassion , in terms of the instruction that our nation 's scientists have given to us . 
mr. speaker , i rise in support of this bill which will expand funding for embryonic stem cell research , and i 'm proud to be an original cosponsor of it . 
under this bill embryonic stem cell lines will be eligible for federal funding only if the embryos used to derive stem cells were originally created for fertility treatment purposes and are in excess of clinical need . 
today , there are thousands of surplus embryos from fertility treatments that will never be used and will likely be discarded . 
my home-state of california recently approved a $ 3 billion ballot initiative to fund embryonic stem-cell experiments . 
this initiative places california at the forefront of the field and exceeds all current stem-cell projects in the united states . 
any policy restricting federal funding for embryonic stem cell research threatens the long-term vitality of the u.s. economy , and most importantly denies millions of americans hope . 
mr. speaker , today the house is considering h.r. 810 , the stem cell research enhancement act of 2005 , which expands funding for embryonic stem cell research . 
as an advocate of stem cell research , i 'm proud to be an original cosponsor of this legislation because i believe that this critical research can lead to cures for type 1 diabetes , parkinson 's disease , alzheimer 's disease , paralysis caused by spinal cord injury , and other serious health problems . 
over 3 , 000 people die every day in the united states from diseases that may some day be treatable as a result of stem cell research . 
today , of the 78 stem cells lines approved for federal research , only 22 are available to researchers . 
under h.r. 810 , embryonic stem cell lines will be eligible only if embryos used to derive stem cells were originally created for fertility treatment purposes and are in excess of clinical need . 
today , there are thousands of surplus embryos from fertility treatments that will never be used and will likely be discarded . 
this november , my home-state of california approved a $ 3 billion ballot initiative supported by governor schwarzenegger to fund embryonic stem-cell experiments . 
this initiative puts california at the forefront of the field and exceeds all current stem cell projects in the united states . 
we are losing ground to the rest of the world . 
as the washington post reported last friday ( may 20 , 2005 ) , south korea is leapfrogging ahead of us and is developing techniques proving that stem cell research is robust . 
we have an opportunity to help end the suffering of millions of people with chronic or terminal diseases , and we should seize it . 
long-term economic growth depends on productivity , productivity depends on technology , and technology ultimately depends on basic science , which is why any policy restricting federal funding for embryonic stem-cell research threatens the long-term health and vitality of the u.s. economy . 
biotechnology is at a stage of development similar to where information technology was in the late 1980s -- ready to explode . 
the federal government should be in the business of encouraging and assisting research that can help save the lives of its citizens . 
the stem cell research enhancement act of 2005 accelerates scientific progress toward cures and treatments for a wide range of diseases while simultaneously instituting stronger ethical requirements on stem cell lines that are eligible for federally funded research . 
mr. speaker , i rise in support of h.r. 810 , the stem cell research enhancement act . 
advances in medicine have made virtually obsolete killer diseases like smallpox and polio , have increased life expectancy and improved the quality of life for people around the globe . 
from roman times around 2000 years ago to 1900 life expectancy increased from 25 to 47 years of age . 
however , because of important discoveries and advances in medicine and medical treatments , by the year 2000 life expectancy had increased to over 76 years of age . 
they occurred as a result of visionary leadership in both the public and private sectors . 
they occurred as a result of political will and public capital . 
they occurred because of the private sector 's ability to convert government funded basic research into life-saving applications . 
government funded basic research has and continues to serve as the foundation for the medical advances that have improved the health and quality of life for millions of people . 
the scientific community overwhelmingly believes that embryonic stem cell research holds the potential for medical advances and therapies that could make these and other diseases as obsolete as polio and small pox , and the national institutes of health have proposed an ethically sound policy to further this research . 
i support federal funding for embryonic stem cell research because without it we run the risk of missing an historic opportunity to improve the lives of millions of i understand that many of the opponents of this legislation have moral qualms about using embryos for research . 
but the embryos covered under this legislation would otherwise be discarded , so defeat of this legislation would do nothing to assuage moral difficulties surrounding destruction of embryos . 
and defeat of this legislation would deny innocent victims of terrible diseases the opportunity of relief from their suffering and healing of their afflictions . 
i support funding for this research because of the bright promise it holds to make life better and more productive for generations to come . 
our north carolina values guide us to expand scientific and medical knowledge to enhance the health and well being of our families , neighbors and fellow citizens , and this research is key to that effort . 
mr. speaker , i rise in support of h.r. 810 because we need to support studying every kind of stem cell , from cord blood to adult to embryonic . 
parkinson 's disease affects over 1 million americans , and i am one of them . 
parkinson 's does not keep me from doing the things that are important to my life and my work , but parkinson 's does affect me every day of my life . 
these doctors are among some of the most talented , dedicated , and well-respected doctors in this country . 
poll after poll has shown that a wider majority of americans support ethical embryonic stem cell research . 
the majority of bush supporters , for example , have voted to support this research . 
mr. speaker , today we will hear some of our colleagues talk about the empty promise of embryonic stem cell research . 
they will argue for research that not only requires the destruction of human life , but to date , has also not yielded a single therapy . 
what we in congress should be advocating for is the continuing advancement of adult stem cell research , a true scientific success story , which has benefited thousands of americans already . 
perhaps nowhere is this success more evident than in the advancement of cord-blood stem cells . 
a rich source of stem cells , umbilical cords are already treating patients . 
cord-blood stem cells have already been used to treat thousands of patients and more than 67 different diseases , including leukemia , sickle cell anemia and lymphoma . 
the stem cell therapeutic and research act focuses government efforts on research with real promise , providing federal funding to increase the number of cord-blood units available to match and treat patients . 
the bill also takes on the recommendations of the institute of medicine , providing a national network that would link all the cord-blood banks participating in an inventory program into a search system , allowing transplant physicians to search for cord-blood and bone marrow matches through a single-access point . 
the other gentleman from texas ( mr. barton ) xz4000180 , the chairman of the committee ; yes , sir , you too were an embryo once . 
the gentleman from delaware , the sponsor of this bill , you were an embryo once . 
a human embryo is a member of the human family . 
it is irreplaceable , and it is a member of the species homo sapiens . 
it is not just a bit of tissue . 
it is not just , as some have suggested , a couple of cells in a petri dish . 
today , we are debating embryonic stem cell research , a type of stem cell research in which a tiny member of the human family must die . 
and that is really what this whole debate is about , paying for what works and paying for it in a way that is consistent with the morals of our taxpayers . 
look , even the president and ceo of the juvenile diabetes research foundation , a group that is a strong supporter of destroying human embryos for research , he said , `` there have been more promising results in adult stem cells than there have been in embryonic stem cells. '' he predicted that their foundation would soon be spending more on adult cells research than embryonic research . 
washington must also spend its money efficiently on what works , while representing the values of the taxpayer . 
first of all , the gentleman from maryland ( mr. bartlett ) xz4000170 , as he pointed out just a second ago , is a ph.d . 
and that is the subject of embryology . 
medical students get maybe in a 4-year period of time , 6 months ' worth of embryology ; and of course , to hear my colleague from maryland explaining the embryologic process , it sort of takes me back to those days . 
but i realize , of course , how difficult it is to understand for members of the body . 
there are 435 of us , of course , and just a handful have ever taken any embryology . 
we need a little research , nonhuman primate research , but we are a lot closer to this possibility than a lot of our colleagues and the general public understand . 
when we get below 1 , 000 , it is very difficult and the chances of a natural conception are markedly diminished at that point . 
intracytoplasmic sperm injection , and all of a sudden an embryo is created . 
and after several days in cell multiplication , as the gentleman from maryland ( mr. bartlett ) xz4000170 was explaining , then that is implanted in the mom 's uterus , and the miracle of birth can occur for that couple . 
we are not talking about a procedure , icsi , that is being done exclusively at the national institutes of health . 
this is being done right in my community of marietta , georgia , by reproductive endocrinologists , those doctors who specialize in infertility and doing those kinds of things ; and it has been going on for 10 , 12 years now . 
that is to obtain embryonic stem cells without destroying or indeed even harming the embryo , and that analogy , that explanation of twinning and how the mono-zygotic single egg identical twin that the egg divides at a certain stage ; and indeed , they are taking away 50 percent of the cells , and in most instances , if the division is complete , they have two perfectly identical , beautiful children that develop . 
with a little study , a little funding to be able to develop this technique of obtaining these stem cells , these totipotential cells , as he described , without scrambling the egg and doing it the easy way , the simple way , killing the embryo , which is destruction of life . 
i have heard people on the other side of this argument say , well , we are talking about getting these stem cells , and they are not really embryos , they are pre-embryos . 
physiologist knows about the definition of pre-embryo , but i never learned that in embryology or any medical school course i took or in my obstetric and gynecology training and my 30 years of experience in the field . 
an embryo begins at the moment of conception when that sperm and egg come together . 
really , an embryo , that stage lasts until the birth of the child . 
now , you can differentiate and say at 8 weeks or 10 weeks we start calling it a fetus , but there is no , to my knowledge , definition of a pre-embryo . 
i wanted to just kind of follow on the gentleman from nebraska 's remarks . 
the thing that the american public maybe does not understand is that when they are asked the question , are you for embryonic stem cell research that can cure some of these dreaded diseases , my colleagues have talked about , naturally the response is going to be , oh , yes . 
we are going to cure juvenile type i diabetes , and christopher reeves , god rest his soul , we are going to restore the function of his limbs , and we are going to cure alzheimer 's . 
but i think so many people , mr. speaker , and even some of our colleagues , need to understand that in getting those embryonic stem cells , the life is destroyed . 
we need to make sure that people understand that the harvesting today and the way it is done and the way it is proposed and the way we are hearing from the castle-degette bill we are going to discuss tomorrow is using federal dollars , taxpayer dollars , where people had no choice , they had to pay their taxes , we are going to use those dollars to fund research that involves the destruction of human life , a little , tiny infant , who with a little bit of luck and ingenuity could grow up and be a member of this body some day . 
of course we were . 
and when you get this and you start down this slippery slope in regard to what the south koreans are doing , suppose , mr. speaker , that the harvesting of these stem cells from these cloned embryos that the results are not very good , as they have not really been very good in the embryonic stem cells we have retained from these so-called throw-away babies , these 400 , 000 in these fertility clinics . 
that is why the gentleman from nebraska said that most of the private funding is going toward adult stem cells . 
mr. speaker , i rise today in strong support of the gentleman from new jersey ( mr. smith 's ) stem cell therapeutics and research act of 2005 , and commend the gentleman for his courageous and principled stand for the sanctity of life . 
as a physician member , i know that significant successes are being reported from the use of umbilical cord stem cells in the treatment of 67 diseases , including sickle cell anemia , leukemia , osteoporosis and lymphoma . 
aside from the fact that harvesting embryonic stem cells results in the destruction of innocent life , embryonic stem cells are gathered without knowledge of blood cell type , without assurance that they are free from infection , and without screening for genetic defects . 
it is h.r. 2520 , which enhances federal funding for expanding the already successful use of umbilical cord stem cells . 
mr. speaker , i rise this evening in opposition , strong opposition , to h.r. 810 , not as a physician , not as an obstetrician-gynecologist , but as a pro-life catholic who firmly believes in the sanctity of life . 
i have sat here for almost 3 hours listening to every word of the debate as part of my job as a member of the rebuttal team , and here is my legal pad of notes and rebuts . 
most of those rebuts are against people on my side of the aisle , because this issue is clearly a bipartisan issue . 
so i have got plenty of rebuttals that i could make , but very briefly , i will just mention one or two . 
one of the gentlemen on my side of the aisle said that we need the federal government , we need the federal government involved in embryonic stem cell research and the funding of that to provide ethical guidelines to the states . 
well , if the federal government is involved in a program where taxpayer dollars are spent to destroy human life , what ethical advice can they give to my state of georgia , i ask ? 
you see , i firmly believe in the sanctity of life , and i believe that life does begin at conception , and these embryos are definitely living human beings . 
well , there are hundreds today of these snowflake children , and there will be many more when people realize this is available to them . 
i may be a vegetable. '' you would not want to destroy those lives , any more than the embryos at the beginning of life . 
any opportunity that i have as an original cosponsor of the gentleman from maryland 's legislation , h.r. 3144 , is an opportunity that i gladly accept no matter what the hour . 
the importance of this issue really can not be overstated . 
i know the gentleman from maryland as he started this special order hour discussed the fact that of the so-called throwaway embryos , throwaway babies as we see it in these in vitro fertilization clinics that exist across this country , i think somebody estimated there were 400 , 000 of them and that in some instances couples who had gone through in vitro fertilization and completed their families truly would have some extra embryos that they at least at a certain point in time had no intention of having reimplanted . 
but those of us who feel very strongly about the sanctity of life truly believe that there is no such thing as an excess human life at either extreme , the very youngest embryonic stage or the very oldest , many of whom i would be referring to , our octogenarians and older who might be in a nursing home suffering from alzheimer 's disease at the final stages of their lives , but all of these lives are extremely important ; and as the gentleman from maryland pointed out , there are actually 100 or close to 100 little babies , up to 6 , 8 months old now who were referred to as the snowflake babies . 
as the gentleman from maryland points out , there are a lot more of those little lives that are still on ice , if you will ; and the gentleman from maryland is so right in pointing out that , hey , maybe one of those would be an einstein one of these days , the next einstein . 
some of my colleagues say , well , just 100 out of 400 , 000 , that is not very many . 
indeed , it is a fourth of this body , madam speaker , almost a fourth of 435 members of the house of representatives . 
more importantly , of course , it could be the next pope john ii or pope john iii or martin luther king , jr . 
i am just so grateful for the gentleman from maryland for bringing us a bill , h.r. 3144 , which avoids this issue of destroying human life for the purpose of obtaining embryonic stem cells . 
i do not think , madam speaker , that we will ever get to the point in this chamber , as much as i , and i am sure the gentleman from maryland is of the same mind-set , of wanting to do things in a bipartisan fashion with our colleagues on both sides of the aisle , this issue , this pro-life/pro-choice issue . 
that is what the gentleman from maryland is bringing to us , an opportunity to support a bill that does not lead us down that road where there seems like there will never be a meeting of the minds . 
as i understand the bill , it is an opportunity to encourage , with the president 's blessing , increased funding through the nih for research on nonhuman primates to make sure that this biopsy , actually it has already been done in genetic counseling studies on couples who have a really strong family history of inheritable diseases , something like hemophilia or duchenne 's muscular dystrophy where maybe if it is an adult child , it has a 50 percent chance of having one of these life-threatening , eventually fatal diseases . 
we are talking about one of the brightest members of this body , a ph.d . 
physiologist , a doctor of physiology who has taught in medical school . 
madam speaker , when i was in medical school , it was my instructor who taught me physiology , the functioning of the human body in a healthy situation , whether we are talking about the heart , the lungs , or any organ system of the body . 
that is the study of physiology . 
he knows of what he speaks . 
i know my colleagues as they listen to his presentation tonight and they look at the material , the visual aides that he has with him , it is clear that his understanding , his depth of knowledge is far beyond maybe what even the physician members of this body have . 
so it is with a deep amount of respect for him that i have signed on to this bill . 
i am fully supportive of it . 
it gives us an opportunity to address this issue of trying to find a way with stem cells , whether they are adult or embryonic ; and i tend to agree with the gentleman from maryland that embryonic stem cells probably do have a little more potential , although we have had great success in adult stem cells and a lot of these diseases that our colleagues have talked about and we have seen there is no argument , i do not think , in this body , in a partisan way about wanting to help and wanting to use science to the best of our ability to look for a cure . 
there are probably lots of complications , false starts , two steps back for one step forward . 
there will be lots of money , federal dollars probably being spent on research . 
but the point is the president in august of 2001 was absolutely right , in my humble opinion , in regard to his decision to put a moratorium on the harvesting of stem cells , embryonic stem cells that would result in the destruction of human life . 
we do know that they have a very unique , full complement of dna that have all of their genetic material they are going to ever have . 
they are the tiniest of human life , little tiny babies . 
we can just name so many where people think that their family is complete and they have got all they want out of their reproductive life , and all of a sudden , as the old country song goes , `` some days are diamonds and some days are stones , '' all of a sudden we have a few days that are stones and there might be a tragic loss of a child or more than one child , and all of a sudden maybe those frozen embryos do not seem so expendable anymore . 
so that is why this issue is so important and why i feel so very passionate , not just myself and the author of this bill , the gentleman from maryland ( mr. bartlett ) xz4000170 , but a number of others who have signed on to this bill . 
the white house , i think , is very supportive of this . 
there is a companion piece of legislation , as i understand ; it originating in the other body . 
and again it is a pleasure to join my colleague tonight and share these thoughts , try to maybe enlighten my colleagues on both sides of the aisle , madam speaker ; and i do thank the gentleman for giving me an opportunity to be with him to discuss such an important issue . 
madam speaker , i wanted to mention to the gentleman that as an ob/gyn physician , of course i have had some experience with some of the processes that can occur in reproductive endocrine laboratories and the technique dealing with infertile couples , and i have had a discussion with the gentleman from maryland about this . 
but in a situation where the couple is infertile and it is because of male infertility , there is nothing wrong with the egg , but there is a very , very low sperm count in the male , and normally it takes probably 1 , 000 sperm to successfully fertilize an egg in the natural way . 
and these biologists working with reproductive endocrinologists , medical doctors who specialize in infertility , can literally take a single sperm and with a needle inject that sperm into the egg and create a life , and that has been done many times , and not just at the nih , but in a lot of these infertility clinics across this great country , in my state of georgia . 
so what the gentleman from maryland ( mr. bartlett ) xz4000170 is talking about in this poster presentation in regard to waiting to just the right point for these scientists to be able to develop a technique to obtain embryonic stem cells without destroying that embryo and beyond the point where that single cell itself would be an embryo , he knows of what he speaks . 
undoubtedly , each of us on this floor today has a friend , family member or neighbor who could benefit from increased embryonic stem cell research , whether they suffer from spinal cord injury , alzheimer 's , ms or juvenile diabetes . 
as we consider both the castle/degette stem cell bill and the smith legislation on umbilical cord stem cells , it is important we differentiate between the effects of these two bills . 
i support both of them . 
it is this element of embryonic cell research that offers the most hope for finding cures to the diverse set of diseases that plague too many americans . 
the president 's policy shut that door , and we have lost 4 years of robust research that will be needed to cure the most complex diseases . 
opponents of this bill will say that the embryonic cell research is unproven , but we will never know the true promise of embryonic stem cells if we hold back federal dollars for the research . 
these tremendous people , as well as countless more in each of our communities , know what it is like to live every day waiting for your cure . 
we have watched the progression of that terrible disease . 
but by voting today for both these bills , we can help maybe the next generation , instead of sticking our heads in the sand . 
i urge my colleagues to do the right thing for the millions of americans suffering from incurable diseases . 
mr. speaker , the promise for curing a whole host of debilitating diseases is brighter than it 's ever been . 
representatives castle and degette have crafted this bill meticulously , which would allow the use of surplus embryos from in vitro fertilization treatments and require donor consent . 
this legislation takes an ethical and moral approach to a challenging subject , and throughout is respectful of the value of life . 
real political courage and leadership -- on both sides of the aisle , in the house and senate -- was required to bring us to this point . 
people from every point along the political spectrum -- from nancy reagan to the late christopher reeve -- have embraced the promise and potential of stem cell research . 
we owe it to generations of suffering americans and their families to help find treatments that could lead to full recovery . 
mr. speaker , i rise in support of the legislation to help us have continued success in the funding for research for uses for adult stem cells . 
adult stem cells really encompass a number of different kinds . 
a number of them have already been used clinically and with much success . 
i believe it is this congress 's duty to help support that , because certainly we will have many people who have benefited already and additional people in the future who can benefit from this kind of research . 
in fact , the university of pittsburgh in my hometown just announced about a week or so ago that they are doing clinical trials regarding the use of bone marrow stem cells to help reverse chronic heart failure . 
mr. speaker , i thank the majority leader for yielding me this time , and i am rising in opposition to the legislation that would fund the destruction of embryos in order to take the stem cells for research . 
there are a number of reasons that i oppose the bill . 
the very first one , though , is one of the statements we keep hearing over and over again from those who support the bill , and that is that these embryos would just be discarded . 
and , in fact , the children i met today were wonderful evidence of that . 
on the right is the list of success with embryonic stem cells . 
i encourage my colleagues to reject the false promise of embryonic stem cell research and reject this legislation . 
mr. speaker , we will be hearing a great deal today about the humane and helpful and hopeful research of embryonic stem cells . 
this is an advance similar to advances in past years of blood transfusions and organ transplants . 
supporting cord blood research at the expense of supporting embryonic stem cell research is like buying a schwinn bicycle to travel across the country . 
mr. speaker , i am proud to represent new jersey , one of the few states that devotes its own resources to embryonic stem cell research . 
to help us understand this humane line of research , let us look at in vitro fertilization . 
several decades ago , many people raised concerns about this procedure ; everywhere there were attacks using the term `` test tube babies. '' but today there are 400 , 000 young people who are the products of in vitro fertilization , and in every case , there are eggs , fertilized eggs , that were not brought to full-term birth . 
but people do not condemn the use of ivf . 
and just as we do not place ethical burdens on the children who were conceived through ivf , we should not place ethical burdens on the millions of americans suffering from parkinson 's , alzheimer 's , diabetes , et cetera . 
mr. speaker , i rise today in strong support of the bipartisan stem cell research enhancement act , h.r. 810 , legislation that will dramatically expand the number of stem cell lines available for federally funded research . 
this bill will allow scientists to more effectively pursue cures and therapies for a wide array of life-threatening illnesses and disabilities affecting millions of americans . 
embryonic stem cells have a unique ability to develop into any type of cell as they mature , offering scientists tremendous insights on the replacement of damaged cells and organs , the mechanics of life-threatening diseases , and the testing and development of new drugs . 
adult stem cells , on the other hand , have not shown this ability to differentiate into specific types of cells , have not yet been identified in all vital organs , and are difficult to identify , purify , and grow . 
although embryonic stem cell research promises extraordinary medical discoveries , the available supply of existing embryonic stem cells is woefully insufficient . 
according to the national institutes of health , nih , only 22 of the 78 stem cell lines that were deemed eligible for federal funding by president george bush in 2001 are currently available to nih investigators . 
some of these 22 lines are too expensive or difficult to obtain , and some have been contaminated with non-human molecules diminishing their therapeutic value for humans . 
to make matters worse , these stem cell lines lack the genetic variation needed to develop therapies that will benefit the diverse population of the united states . 
h.r. 810 addresses the shortage of embryonic stem cell lines by lifting the arbitrary and indefensible august 9 , 2001 cut-off date for stem cell eligibility . 
since 2001 , 128 embryonic stem cell lines have been developed , including disease-specific stem cell lines that allow researchers to understand the basic cause of some rare diseases . 
the state of california has already taken steps to ensure that human embryonic stem cell research will be allowed to develop by establishing the institute for regenerative medicine , which will devote $ 3 billion to california universities and research institutions over the next 10 years . 
the passage of h.r. 810 will further empower and equip california scientific institutions to undertake cutting-edge research on the most pressing medical challenges of our day . 
let us make no mistake , the development of lifesaving medical procedures has been slowed by an unwarranted restriction on stem cell research . 
i believe that , as policymakers , we have a moral imperative to pursue innovative medical research that can improve the quality of life and prevent harmful illnesses and diseases for generations to come . 
mr. speaker , i yield to the distinguished majority leader for the purposes of inquiring of the schedule for the coming week . 
if i could go through a couple of these bills . 
the defense authorization bill , mr. leader , do you expect at this point in time to have that on a particular day of the week ? 
with respect to the defense authorization bill , can you tell us now what kind of a rule might be applicable to the consideration of that bill ? 
this , obviously , is a very important bill , a large sum of money , critically important at a time when we are confronting terrorists in iraq and around the world and our men and women are in harm 's way . 
all of us want to make sure that we have our ideas on how we can best strengthen our efforts in that bill . 
so to the extent that the leader can prevail upon the rules committee to allow such amendments as democratic members and , for that matter , republican members want to offer , i think that would be in the best interests of full consideration . 
it is my understanding that that bill will be brought to the floor and that it will not be subject to amendment ; it will be considered as reported out of committee . 
i know that our leader and your office are working on that unanimous consent and the parameters of the consideration of , as you point out , a very , very important bill . 
there are obviously different points of view on the legislation . 
would you have a thought as to when , because of the importance of this bill , our members want to be sure that they are here , as i am sure yours do as well , what time of day you would expect to be considering that piece of legislation ? 
there are strong views on either side of this issue and quite obviously the consequences of this bill are very substantial . 
as we know , the highway bill is now more than 2 years overdue in terms of reauthorization , has been sitting for some period of time . 
we not only passed it last week but we passed it a number of times before that . 
and then the president , of course , will have to do what he thinks is best and make a determination , and then we might have a shocking event and he may veto a bill and send it back to us , and i am relatively confident we would work our will at that point in time . 
mr. speaker , reclaiming my time , i recall that democrats , when they were in charge , had a slightly different perspective , believing we were a co-equal branch of the government . 
we would adopt our policies based upon what we believed to be in the best interests of this country , and that the president , as a co-equal branch of the government , would make his determination , and if we disagreed we would override his veto . 
as a matter of fact , i voted to override a number of vetoes that the previous democratic president disagreed with us on . 
we have a 4 1/2 -year unblemished record , as the leader points out , of not doing anything that this president did not want us to do . 
mr. speaker , i have been here for some period of time , as the leader knows , and the only bill that ronald reagan vetoed that was overridden by the congress was a bill in which he said we did not spend enough money in 1983 . 
this is , i think , one of the most important bills that we will consider for the welfare of people not only in this country , but throughout the world . 
this legislation , which has 200-plus cosponsors from both sides of the aisle , would not permit federal funding for cloning ; it would not permit federal funding to create embryos , nor would it permit federal funding to destroy embryos . 
this important legislation simply expands the current federal policy of allowing federal funding for research on stem cell lines derived after the arbitrary date of august 9 , 2001 , from embryos created for fertility treatment that would otherwise be discarded . 
thus , mr. speaker , i believe the issue before this house today is this : will we foster embryonic stem cell research , research that holds great promise for the potential treatment or cure of diseases such as als , lou gehrig 's disease , alzheimer 's , parkinson 's , and other diseases , and offer hope to those with spinal cord injury and other injuries of the nervous system , or will we stand in the way ? 
i know that the opponents of this bill believe that we are ignoring the ethical and moral implications of such research . 
but , in fact , this legislation requires the department of health and human services and the national institutes of health to issue guidelines for ethical considerations ; it requires a determination that the embryos would never have been implanted and would have been discarded ; and it requires the donor 's written , informed consent . 
the polls seem to reflect that at least 60 percent of the americans asked the question support this important effort . 
it is not animal , it is not vegetable , it is not mineral , but a tiny , microscopic beginning of a human life . 
the motives of its sponsors are so noble . 
the first one is , for the first time in our national history , taxpayers ' dollars are going to be spent for the killing of innocent human life . 
and number two , this bill tramples on the moral convictions of an awful lot of people who do not want their tax dollars going to be spent for killing innocent human life . 
americans paid a terrible price for not recognizing the humanity of dred scott . 
we are going to pay a terrible price for not recognizing the humanity of these little embryos . 
in world war ii , 1940 , before america got in the war , there was a publication called the yearbook of obstetrics and gynecology . 
`` at the present time , when rivers of blood and tears of innocent men and women are flowing in most parts of the world , it seems almost silly to be contending over the right to life of an unknowable atom of human flesh in the uterus of a woman . 
on the contrary , it is of transcendent importance that there be in this chaotic world one high spot , however small , which is safe against the deluge of immorality and savagery that is sweeping over us . 
`` that we , in the medical profession , hold to the principle of the sacredness of human life and the rights of the individual , even though unborn , is proof that humanity is not yet lost. '' i believe humanity is not yet lost , and this vote will tell us the answer to that question . 
connie davis , the medical director of university of washington 's kidney and kidney-pancreas transplant program , put this discussion in perspective when i was talking to her yesterday . 
she reminded me that the donation of a kidney used to be a controversial issue in this country . 
our bill allows donors of these stem cells to make a donation decision , a donation to research . 
a narrow segment of our nation did not stop lifesaving kidney donations , and a narrow segment should not stop embryonic stem cell research . 
mr. speaker , i rise today in strong support of this important bill . 
even with this hardship , she graduated from harvard university in 2000 , harvard 's kennedy school of government in 2004 , and she is currently a ph.d . 
i have worked with her to raise public awareness of the importance of stem cell research , and under the unanimous consent agreement , i am including an essay that brooke wrote on the issue in the congressional record . 
although scientists were expecting a big number of available lines , less than one third of the allowed 78 lines are available for distribution . 
the stem cell research enhancement act would expand research on embryonic stem cells by increasing the number of lines stem cells that would be eligible for federally funded research . 
california and new jersey have already set up funding sources for embryonic stem cell research , and a number of other states have announced intentions to fund this research . 
scientists still need funding for the aspects of research that the federal government will not cover . 
today , i am introducing a resolution that expresses the sense of congress that the federal government should not infringe on states or private organizations that fund embryonic stem cell research . 
many of us have family members suffering from devastating illnesses , and the prospect of helping them to be healthy and free of pain is a worthy goal . 
yet painfully far the ability to view the world through another 's eyes is the essence of altruism . 
when putting their pens to the paper of policy , those who legislate ought to take into keen consideration the world as it is seen through others ' eyes , wrought with the problems they face and conditions they endure . 
this is the basic tenet of a representative democracy , the basic belief upon which the united states was founded . 
yet , despite this underlying and widely accepted notion of several voices speaking on behalf of many , this does not always appear to be the case and , in fact , those making collective decisions can become inextricably linked to their own , myopic ideology , failing to understand the situations of others or hear their voices . 
in september of 1990 , when i was eleven years old , i was hit by a car while walking home from my first day of 7th grade . 
tasks that , to others , might seem mundane or be taken for granted are strenuous challenges , sometimes taking long hours instead of mere minutes , causing frustration both from what can not be at present and potential being lost in the future . 
when we place our hopes and visions for our world into the hands of those making broad decisions , we do it with the belief that they will act on behalf of our best interest and not on an isolated viewpoint . 
to undermine the interests of a majority of citizens is bad policy . 
to ignore the voices and dash the hopes of those most in need is bad policy . 
in the context of stem cell research legislation , these are bad policies , yet policies that are being upheld . 
according to this limitation , federally supported research could be done on no more than 78 existing genetic cell lines , although even the most optimistic estimates of viable cells were estimated to be far fewer , less than two dozen . 
to the delight of some and the grief of others , mr. bush indicated that the use of embryonic cells for medical research was a violation of the sanctity of life , analogous to abortion or euthanasia . 
similar to other issues facing our nation today , the decision of whether or not to fund embryonic stem cell research is now left in the hands of the states , with the legislatures and governors picking up where the u.s. congress and president have left off . 
but the cause should not and must not stop there , as two states out of our fifty is simply not enough . 
therapeutic stem cell research , also known as somatic cell nuclear transfer , has the potential to provide cures for a considerable number of neurological and degenerative conditions , including alzheimer 's disease , parkinson 's disease , childhood leukemia , heart disease , als , several different types of cancer , and spinal cord injuries . 
in its most basic description , stem cells are the undifferentiated , unspecialized cells that can be extracted from embryos in their earliest stages of development , three to five days after fertilization . 
importantly , the cells taken from the blastocysts can be well , some have argued , is n't using stem cells just the destruction of one life for the sake of another ? 
however , that is not the case for any of the blastocysts that yield stem cells that are used for research . 
these blastocysts , which some proclaim represent the sanctity of life , will only be kept in freezers at fertility clinics until they have expired and then will be discarded completely . 
under current federal legislation , they are of no use to anybody . 
to rob the stem cells of their other potential of life , which is to cure diseases or to help regenerate parts of the body that are not regenerating on their own , is really to devalue life in another , otherwise avoidable way . 
are n't these cells essentially promoting the creation of another person ? 
the once almost incomprehensible , futuristic ideas of `` cloning '' and `` body-doubles '' are now considered feasible and fearsome possibilities , and therapeutic stem cell research has been the unwitting victim of the prevalent fears . 
orwell 's 1984 has somehow come to life in 2004 , with the speculations made by some of about unintended , science-fiction consequences . 
the real fear , though , is not the potential of mad scientists reproducing people but the lost potential of sound scientists curing people . 
fourteen years ago , i could have never imagined having to advocate for something that could potentially restore for me the very basic aspects of life and humanity . 
stem cells , which would otherwise serve no other purpose , hold the promise of life , not just for the newly born but now for the already living and this opportunity must be seized . 
the time has come when we can change the lives of so many , giving to them the fundamental parts of life and dignity . 
let me thank the sponsors of this legislation , the gentleman from new jersey ( mr. smith ) xz4003801 , the gentleman from texas ( mr. barton ) xz4000180 , the gentleman from alabama ( mr. davis ) xz4000921 , and , of course , the gentlewoman from colorado ( ms. degette ) xz4001010 and the gentleman from delaware ( mr. castle ) xz4000700 for the second bill , the bills being h.r. 810 and h.r. 2520 . 
let me just say that separating these two legislative initiatives would be like separating the flag from the pledge of allegiance . 
it is appropriate to have a marriage today of two very vital and important legislative initiatives , one dealing with adult stem cell research , which is vital and done along ethical lines and will help many in our community that have a number of significant diseases ; in particular , alzheimer 's and sickle cell anemia . 
then , of course , the importance of stem cell lines and expanding it under federal funding is something that we can not imagine . 
his family just said that with all of his leadership and heading up ministerial alliances , he has alzheimer 's . 
but would it not be wonderful for a vibrant and outstanding leader of our community to have an expanded opportunity , as nancy reagan argued for , for president reagan . 
unless federal funding for stem cell research is expanded , the united states stands in real danger of falling behind other countries in this promising area of research . 
i would mention that the national academy of sciences recently issued a set of guidelines to ensure that human embryonic stem cell research is conducted in a safe and ethical manner . 
this legislation , the castle-degette legislation , h.r. 810 , and , of course , the fantastic and forward-thinking legislation , h.r. 2520 , sponsored by the gentleman from texas ( mr. barton ) xz4000180 , the gentleman from new jersey ( mr. smith ) xz4003801 , and the gentleman from alabama ( mr. davis ) xz4000921 , represents a coming together of our family . 
mr. chairman , i rise this morning in support of the `` stem cell therapeutic and research act of 2005. '' this measure , sponsored by christopher h. smith , joe barton , and artur davis would promote research on a type of stem cell , known as an adult stem cell , taken from umbilical cord blood . 
recent evidence has suggested that adult stem cells could provide more flexibility than previously thought , according to the national institutes of health . 
i am supportive of this bill because it would be of great benefit to african americans . 
this bill has specific language that would diversify the bone marrow banks of this nation . 
this would be of extreme importance to many african americans suffering from sickle cell anemia . 
mr. speaker , i rise today in support of h.r. 810 , the `` stem cell research enhancement act of 2005. '' as a supporter of the bill , i would argue that it is necessary to expand the number of stem cell lines that can be used in federally funded research in order to accelerate scientific progress toward the cures and treatments for a wide variety of diseases and debilitating health conditions -- including parkinson 's disease , diabetes , alzheimer 's disease , als , cancer , and spinal cord injuries . 
according to the national institutes of health , nih , of the 78 stem cell lines that were declared eligible for federal funding in 2001 , only about 22 lines are actually available for study by and distribution to researchers . 
these nih-approved lines lack the genetic diversity that researchers need in order to create effective treatments for millions of americans . 
h.r. 810 would expand the number of stem cell lines that would be made available under strict ethical guidelines . 
while embryonic stem cells have qualities that give them the potential to treat a wide variety of diseases and injuries , adult stem cells do not have those same qualities . 
unlike embryonic stem cells , adult stem cells can not be induced to develop into any type of cell . 
unless federal funding for stem cell research is expanded , the united states stands in real danger of falling behind other countries in this promising area of research . 
the recent announcement that south korean researchers have produced cloned human embryos that are genetic twins of patients with various diseases , and have derived stem cells from them , shows just how far that country is going . 
this bill provides a limited -- but nonetheless highly significant -- change in current policy that would result in making many more lines of stem cells available for research . 
passage of this bill would provide hope for those millions of americans suffering from diseases that may be treated or even cured as a result of stem cell research before concluding , i would just mention that the national academy of sciences , nas , recently issued a set of guidelines to ensure that human embryonic stem cell research is conducted in a safe and ethical manner . 
because of the limitations of the current federal policy , only 22 stem cell lines are eligible for federal research and fall under the jurisdiction of national institutes of health guidelines . 
specifically , h.r. 810 requires that : the stem cells must be derived from human embryos that were donated from in vitro fertilization clinics , and that were created for the purpose of fertility treatment , but were in excess of the clinical need of the people seeking such treatment ; the embryos would not have been used for fertility treatment , and would otherwise be discarded ; the individuals seeking fertility treatment donated the embryos with informed written consent and without any financial payment or other inducement to make the donation . 
in addition , the bill requires that not later than 60 days after enactment , hhs , in consultation with the national institutes of health , issue final guidelines to carry out the requirements of this bill . 
the report must include a description of whether , and to what extent , these activities were carried out in accordance with the requirements of this bill . 
listen to the following news reports which indicate this research as viable and of great need for so many . 
since the federal government 's science officials have abdicated their traditional role in setting ethical rules for medical experimentation , the national academy of sciences has filled the void with useful guidelines for research with human embryonic stem cells . 
acting on behalf of scientists around the country , the nas last week issued stem cell research guidelines that should become a blueprint for ethical behavior in both the public and private sector . 
kudos to the national academy of sciences for ably filling the breach caused by the absence of federal guidelines on human embryonic stem cell research . 
while we prefer that rules governing research on human tissues be federal and enforceable , the national academy of sciences ' new voluntary guidelines are a necessary stand-in . 
the national academy of sciences gave a much needed boost to embryonic stem cell research last week when it issued ethics guidelines that should help researchers find a clear path through a minefield of controversial issues . 
they will give practicing scientists the assurance that they can proceed with their work while adhering to principles endorsed by a panel of distinguished scientists , ethicist , and others . 
i rise in strong support of the legislation before us which i consider to be extremely important . 
it builds on the president 's policy by merely allowing the use of embryonic stem cells created for fertility purposes to be donated with permission , but without payment , by the woman for research , research to cure some of the terrible diseases that plague our lives . 
because no nation has created a sustained , strong , globally-competitive economy without the freedom to research the frontiers of knowledge . 
now , we have heard a lot of discussion on the floor today about destroying these cells as taking life and , as a matter of conscience , this is a complicated issue and one on which we disagree . 
if you believe life begins when the sperm enters the egg , then , yes , you would believe this is a taking of life , though we would unceremoniously toss those same cells into a waste bucket . 
but if you believe that life begins when the fertilized egg is implanted in the mother 's womb , which , of course , is essential for it to realize its potential for life , then using a fertilized egg that has not been implanted is not a taking of life . 
so i ask each of my colleagues to think carefully in conscience when life does begin ; and , on that issue , your vote on this bill rests . 
as a co-sponsor of h.r. 810 , i hope we can expand our scope and benefit of existing stem cell lines . 
h.r. 810 represents another step forward in our battle against diseases and illnesses which we have spent billions of dollars trying to research , treat , and cure . 
as the premier medical research nation , we must allow our researchers and doctors to remain at the top of their fields of research both internationally and nationally . 
federal research restricts federal funding of stem cell research to the 78 stem cell lines that existed prior to aug . 
mr. speaker , h.r. 810 does not usher us into uncharted waters : we are already engaged in both the federal funding and the federal oversight of this research . 
within the walls of these three institutions lie perhaps some of the most advanced and prolific members of the scientific research community on regenerative medicine . 
we must support the efforts of the national institutes of health as we move forward . 
i support the movement towards the treatment , research , and cure of diseases and illnesses which the use of stem cells can alleviate . 
today we in the congress are debating the essence of human life , the creation of life and the destruction of life . 
what concerns me , as someone who cherishes life and is a strong supporter of medical research for epilepsy , for diabetes , for spinal cord injury , for alzheimer 's , for so many debilitating diseases , is that this bill seems to be on a very fast track . 
but i know one thing : on a matter of life and death , congress should proceed carefully , thoughtfully and in an informed manner . 
all points of view must be heard and not suppressed . 
i am not yet confident that this institution has allowed for full dialogue to develop on a matter of such gravitas . 
regardless of how you view the bills before us , the lack of a full hearing record is most troubling indeed . 
i ask myself , why is the normal committee process subverted on a matter of such consequence ? 
where is the committee transcript that will tell us the diverging views of scientists on the potentiality of adult stem cell versus embryonic stem cell to improve life ? 
then , where is the committee record that helps us struggle with the essential moral question of : how exactly does one destroy life in order to save it ? 
where is the committee transcript that reveals to the majority of members not on the committee the ethical questions that we and every family should be addressing concerning the proprietary nature of the dna in any embryonic cell ? 
after all , this nation provides for patents for computer software , for medical devices , for seed corn genomes ; and yet we provide no protection for the dna of a human embryo ? 
and what are the rights of the embryo ? 
where is the hearing record that informs us how to carefully manage any transfer of human embryos to research so their essential worth is recognized ? 
we are told that the ethical requirements section of the bill will suffice , yet this section is but 156 words long . 
it directs that nih will issue final guidelines within 60 days of passage of this bill . 
mr. speaker , there is a lot of money to be made in this new field of life science . 
do we as members of congress not have a right to know something more from the nonexistent transcript from the committee ? 
i found the timing of that announcement just all too convenient and asked myself , which companies were behind it ? 
in my opinion , the subcommittee and committees of jurisdiction have not met their responsibilities to this congress , by abdicating their hearing responsibility . 
where is the hearing record to which all members can refer which recounts the struggles of proponents and opponents with the ethical requirements that should be a part of this bill , and not merely leave it up to the national institutes of health ? 
on a matter of such magnitude , where some human embryos will be destroyed in the hope that new cures are made possible , the congress needs to be more responsible . 
mr. speaker , i am a strong supporter of stem cell research . 
the karmanos cancer institute , world renowned in our community and in michigan , and part of the former detroit medical center , is a leader in research . 
in many instances , 90 percent of the time , those cords are displaced and thrown away . 
what this bill will help us do is first of all gather those cords across america to save lives , to renew organs , and to continue life as we know it . 
so i rise in support of h.r. 2520 as another means for us to prolong life , to give life , from stem cords , umbilical cords of women that are heretofore thrown out . 
in our community , we are educating women and asking for their permission that medical research is able to use the cords , the umbilical cords of the fetus . 
umbilical cord blood units , typically discarded at hospitals , can be an unlimited source of stem cells with representation of all races and ethnicities . 
according to the national marrow donor program ( nmdp ) , african-americans have only a 30 percent chance of finding a stem cell match within their own families and often require healthy stem cells from an unrelated individual , typically another african american . 
of the nmdp 's registry of donors , only 8 percent are from african-americans . 
i support the use of embryonic stem cells , adult stem cells and cord blood research to find cures . 
i urge all of my colleagues to support this bill and h.r. 810 `` stem cell research enhancement act '' introduced by representatives mike castle and diana degette that would lift bush 's 2001 ban on the use of federal dollars for research using any mew embryonic stem cell lines . 
all avenues of stem cell research need to be explored . 
we can no longer tie the hands of our scientists and researchers when millions of lives are at stake . 
mr. speaker , i rise in strong support of this legislation . 
and just to be clear once again during this debate , this bill limits the use of only those embryos that will be discarded or destroyed from in vitro fertilization clinics with the consent of the donors . 
i rise in support of this legislation not because it promises cures for diabetes , parkinson 's , spinal cord injuries , alzheimer 's , but because it gives us yet another opportunity to discover cures for these ailments . 
the university of wisconsin has been at the forefront of this research ; yet our researchers are being held back because of current federal policy . 
we are already falling behind the rest of the world in this research in light of south korea 's recent announcement last week . 
i believe that we as the leader of the free world must provide important leadership on the ethical parameters , the ethical constraints that this research requires . 
mr. speaker , i rise today in strong support of h.r. 810 , the stem cell research enhancement act of 2005 . 
this bill would expand the current federal policy on embryonic stem cell research by allowing federally funded research on stem cell lines derived after august 9 , 2001 , while implementing strong ethical guidelines to ensure federal oversight of the research . 
most of the scientific community believes that for the full potential of embryonic stem cell research to be reached , the number of cell lines readily available to scientists must increase . 
just last month , a number of nih directors testified before the senate appropriations committee that the current policy is restrictive and hinders scientific progress . 
we are already at risk of losing our scientific and technological edge because of increasing competition around the world . 
other countries -- such as china , india , and the united kingdom -- are forging ahead with embryonic stem cell research because of less restrictive policies . 
india , for example , has an extensive stem cell regulatory system , yet allows the derivation of new stem cells from surplus embryos at fertility clinics . 
our restrictive policy not only puts us at risk of losing our scientific edge , we are also at risk of losing some of the best american scientists to other countries where policies are less restrictive . 
important advances in the science of embryonic stem cell research have been made since the august 2001 policy was set . 
earlier this year , researchers at the university of wisconsin in madison figured out how to grow human embryonic stem cells without using mouse feeder cells . 
this is exciting news since mouse feeder cells are thought to be a source of contamination if the cells are ever to be used therapeutically in humans . 
from its earliest days , stem cell research has been important to the people of wisconsin . 
james thomson , a researcher at the university of wisconsin , was the first to isolate and culture embryonic stem cells . 
in 2003 , this esteemed researcher received the frank annunzio award , given to recognize the innovative research of american scientists who devote their careers to improving the lives of people through their work in science . 
wisconsin has been at the forefront of embryonic stem cell research from the beginning . 
this legislation is essential to make sure the important work of our scientists is not unnecessarily sidetracked by politics . 
but this legislation is not only important because of the potential for advances in science and technology . 
however , the promise of this research may not be reached if the federal policy is not expanded . 
just yesterday , results from a survey of wisconsin voters were released showing overwhelming support for embryonic stem cell research . 
nearly two-thirds of those polled support expanding federal policies to support more research -- regardless of party affiliation . 
i strongly urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important legislation that will allow science to move forward unimpeded , has the potential to revolutionize the practice of medicine , and can offer hope to the millions of americans suffering from debilitating diseases . 
i ask myself this question : if we are going to deal with this debate on embryonic stem cell research , what are the ethics of this ? 
and i did that , and i found that there is a list of 10 things that have to be qualifiers for permissible medical experiments on human beings . 
the third one is results of animal experimentation must be proven successful prior to their experiments . 
the seventh one is there can not be even a remote possibility of injury , disability , or death . 
our constitution stands at its heart for the principle of the dignity of every individual and this idea is certainly central to our government and people . 
but there is a key american principle at the heart of our people that predates the constitution . 
nearly all of us are the sons and daughters of people who took risks to come to build a new life in a new world . 
we take risks , we try new things ; and for 200 years the future came first to americans , the most dynamic and forward-thinking people in all of human history . 
mr. speaker , i do rise today in strong support of h.r. 810 . 
over the past two decades , three-quarters of the scientists who have won the nobel prize in medicine have studied or taught in the united states . 
of course , there is more at stake in this debate than america 's global standing . 
i would argue that h.r. 810 is worthy of our support not just for what it allows but for what it restricts . 
the bill requires that embryos be in excess of clinical need . 
mr. speaker , i support h.r. 810 , the stem cell research enhancement act of 2005 . 
it just opposes the expansion of public stem cell research . 
h.r. 810 expands the number of frozen embryos to be used for stem cell research by the federal government . 
it could result in saving millions of lives . 
it could be the answer to the prayers of those who suffer from parkinson 's , diabetes , cancer , heart disease , spinal cord injuries and other debilitating conditions . 
recent studies have set back the case for the efficacy of adult stem cells . 
mr. speaker , i rise in strong support of h.r. 810 , and i want to acknowledge the bipartisan effort that has gone into this legislation and the incredible grass roots movement that has built support for this groundbreaking medical research . 
it has been inspirational to see so many members putting aside politics and partisanship to address this issue which affects the lives of millions of americans . 
mr. speaker , i am one of those americans . 
but it will take not only the talent of our scientists , but also the support of our government to realize its full potential . 
i believe one day a child with diabetes will no longer face a lifetime of painful shots and tests . 
we saw it with the discovery of antibiotics and the advent of organ transplants . 
mr. speaker , i believe that adult and embryonic stem cell research is another of these great moments . 
today we have a historic opportunity to make a difference in the lives of millions of americans and for people around the world . 
i urge my colleagues to vote in favor of h.r. 810 . 
mr. speaker , i rise today in support of h.r. 810 , the stem cell research enhancement act and h.r. 2520 , the stem cell therapeutic and research act that we debated earlier today . 
both bills would expand stem cell research , which holds tremendous promise to curing and treating some of the most devastating diseases and conditions facing americans today . 
in 2001 , president bush announced that for the first time federal funds could be used to support limited research on human embryonic stem cells , specifically `` existing stem cell lines where the life and death decision has already been made. '' under this policy , only 78 embryonic stem cell lines are eligible for use and according to the national institutes of health ( nih ) , only 22 of those lines are viable for human research . 
both bills -- the stem cell therapeutic and research act that would create a new federal program to collect and store umbilical-cord-blood cells and expand the current bone-marrow registry program and the stem cell research enhancement act that would increase the number of stem cell lines that can be used in federally funded research -- establish much-needed ethical standards and expand the possibilities of stem cell research for new treatments and cures . 
according to the nih , in the united states more than 4 million people suffer from alzheimer 's disease ; one in every four deaths is from cancer ; and every hour of every day , someone is diagnosed with juvenile ( type 1 ) diabetes . 
these brave individuals battling life-threatening and debilitating diseases are not responsible for policy or debate , but they will be the ones most affected by the outcome of today 's vote . 
the president was quoted by the associated press over the weekend saying , `` i made it very clear to the congress that the use of federal money , taxpayers ' money to promote science which destroys life in order to save life is -- i 'm against that . 
and therefore , if the bill does that , i will veto it. '' this legislation will not create life for the purpose of destruction . 
these bills will expand the scope of research that the bush administration has already approved . 
it is unfortunate president bush would dash the hopes of so many people looking for medical answers through research . 
congress and the administration must not withdraw from progress , but embrace the immense opportunities that expanded stem cell research can have for the future and wellbeing of our nation 's public health . 
mr. speaker , we do not know yet , but the possibility is very real that stem cell research may be the greatest breakthrough in the history of science . 
there are deep and profound moral and philosophic issues surrounding the research , but our government should be very cautious about coming down on the wrong side of science , especially when the scientific endeavor is designed to lengthen and ennoble life . 
using , for example , the microenvironment of human embryonic stem cells , dr . 
mary hendricks and her team of researchers at chicago 's memorial research center have developed a methodology to slow the aggressive properties of metastatic cancer cells . 
how in heaven 's name can we deny the promise of such research ? 
there is consensus at this time in this body and in the research community that scientists should not play god in attempting to clone human beings , but we are at a stage of human existence where there is a practical possibility that a blastocyst that would otherwise be thrown away as waste can , in a petri dish , be used to help solve these incredible diseases , from alzheimer 's to parkinson 's to diabetes to cancer . 
if one believes that life matters , the balance of judgment should be to carefully open the door , as this bill , led so beautifully by my good friends the gentleman from delaware ( mr. castle ) xz4000700 and the gentlewoman from colorado ( ms. degette ) xz4001010 , does . 
not to open the door is to put our heads in the sands and foreclose the prospect of a better life for many , many americans . 
mr. speaker , as an original co-sponsor of h.r. 810 , i rise in support of the stem cell research enhancement act . 
in my district in alameda county , approximately 13.4 percent of african americans have been diagnosed with diabetes compared to 4.5 percent of whites . 
and the diabetes death rates of latinos and african americans are as high as 2-2.5 times those of whites . 
expanding the number of embryonic stem cell lines available for research will assist scientists to develop therapeutic treatments and cures for diabetes and a range of other diseases . 
by passing this bill we will not only help to improve the health and well being of the public , but we will also help to eliminate future chronic health care costs and improve the health of our economy as a whole . 
mr. speaker , i rise in support of the stem cell research enhancement act . 
the national institutes of health has reported that of the 78 stem cell lines promised by president bush , only 22 lines meet the president 's criteria for use . 
a number of those lines have developed genetic mutations which will make research on them useless . 
the vast majority of the remaining usable lines are in other countries that have shown little interest in making them available to u.s. researchers . 
the stem cell research enhancement act expands the number of stem cell lines that are available for federally funded research . 
this is an issue that can impact families across america , crossing all lines of income , political persuasion or religious affiliation . 
furthermore , delay in effectively resolving this issue could for countless americans be a matter of basic health or indeed life . 
keeping in mind the essential federal role in critical basic health research , i believe that it is essential that we support this bill so our country can continue in the lead in exploring the frontiers of science and medicine . 
stem cell research holds the potential to improve the lives of millions of americans suffering from diseases like cancer , heart disease , and diabetes . 
nih said that u.s. scientists are falling behind because of the bush 2001 limitations on stem cell research . 
elizabeth nable of the national heart , lung and blood institute said , `` because u.s. researchers who depend on federal funds lack access to newer human embryonic stem cell lines , they are at a technological disadvantage relative to researchers funded by california , as well as investigators in asia and europe . 
my home state of california has already moved ahead of the federal government by establishing the institute for regenerative medicine , which will devote $ 3 billion to embryonic stem cell research over the next 10 years . 
i include their letter of support in the record . 
embryonic stem cells hold the potential for new cures and therapies for an array of life-threatening diseases affecting millions of americans across the nation . 
this potential will be enhanced by the bipartisan stem cell research enhancement act ( h.r. 810 ) , introduced by representatives michael castle ( r-de ) and diana degette ( d-co ) and co-sponsored by more than 200 members of the house of representatives . 
further , this legislation would ensure the development of ethical guidelines for research with embryonic stem cell lines . 
the provisions within h.r. 810 are more restrictive than those of the california initiative ; however , h.r. 810 is crucial because it will make a significant difference to nationwide federal research programs . 
furthermore , a number of the available lines are entangled with commercial interests making the cells too expensive or impossible for nih-funded investigators to obtain . 
embryonic stem cells offer the potential to reverse diseases and disabilities experienced by millions of americans . 
thus , we have a collective responsibility -- scientists , university leaders , and government leaders -- to support the exploration of the promising possibilities of both embryonic and adult stem cell research for curing and preventing disease . 
please support scientific advancement and the possibility of new cures by voting `` yes '' on h.r. 810 to expand federal stem cell research policy . 
sincerely , & lt ; center & gt ; robert c. dynes , & lt ; /center & gt ; & lt ; center & gt ; & lt ; em & gt ; president , university of california. & lt ; /em & gt ; & lt ; center & gt ; steven b. sample , & lt ; /center & gt ; & lt ; center & gt ; & lt ; em & gt ; president , university of southern california. & lt ; /em & gt ; & lt ; center & gt ; david baltimore , & lt ; /center & gt ; & lt ; center & gt ; & lt ; em & gt ; president , california institute of technology. & lt ; /em & gt ; & lt ; center & gt ; john l. hennessy , & lt ; /center & gt ; & lt ; center & gt ; & lt ; em & gt ; president , stanford university. & lt ; /em & gt ; 
mr. speaker , i am proud to be a cosponsor of h.r. 810 , and i rise in strong support of this critical legislation . 
embryonic stem cells have the potential not just to treat some of the most devastating diseases and conditions , but to actually cure them . 
at issue here is the fundamental value of saving lives , a value that we all share regardless of race , culture or religion . 
i also sit on the committee that funds the national institutes of health with the gentleman from florida ( mr. weldon ) xz4004271 . 
but as i sit on that committee and we hear the testimony , one after another , of people who are suffering , who have lost their loved ones , who are on the verge of losing another loved one , look at the 200 major groups who are supporting this legislation . 
i am proud to be a cosponsor of h.r. 810 , and i rise in strong support of this critical legislation . 
embryonic stem cells have the potential not just to treat some of the most devastating diseases and conditions , but to actually cure them . 
at issue here is the fundamental value of saving lives -- a value that we all share regardless of race , culture , or religion . 
like many of you , i believe that strong guidelines must be in place with vigorous oversight from the nih and congress before allowing federally-funded embryonic stem cell research . 
the legislation before us today would strengthen the standards guiding embryonic stem cell research and would ensure that embryos originally created for the purpose of in vitro fertilization could be made available for research only with the consent of the donor . 
this legislation retains the current restrictions on creating human embryos for the purpose of research . 
with the appropriate guidelines in place , we are closer than ever to remarkable discoveries and on the brink of providing hope to millions of individuals who otherwise have none . 
mr. speaker , i have never seen such a well-attended debate , which shows the importance of this issue ; and i rise today on behalf of my father who died of parkinson 's disease . 
i also rise today on behalf of the millions of americans like me who have watched their loved ones battle the ravages of some dreaded disease . 
embryonic research offers scientists the opportunity to extend life and the quality of life for future generations of americans . 
mr. speaker , i rise today in support of h.r. 810 , the stem cell research enhancement act of 2005 . 
as a founder and co-chair of the congressional working group on parkinson 's disease , i support this legislation that will expand the number of stem cell lines that are available for federally funded research . 
i am and continue to be an opponent of human cloning . 
and we owe this to scientists who are eager to explore new frontiers of science and medicine , but who are restrained by federal restrictions . 
mr. speaker , i have met with doctors , scientists , and researchers in my district 's leading medical institutions who warn of a `` brain drain '' as their best and brightest relocate to places where funding for embryonic stem cell research is not restricted . 
i have spoken with lawmakers in the state of new york , who have garnered $ 1 billion in embryonic stem cell research funding , but without federal funding , stem cell research will move forward without crucial oversight and guidelines . 
i have been persuaded by directors at the national institutes of health who have spoken out against the white house policy on stem cells . 
and i have been moved by the pleas of my constituents who are eager to find cures for suffering loved ones . 
in 2003 , over 900 , 000 americans died of heart disease and more than 550 , 000 succumbed to cancer . 
i am sure that many in this chamber have seen friends suffer through the misery of cancer and the indignities of chemotherapy . 
too many of us have watched as our children with juvenile diabetes hold back tears as they give themselves insulin injections each day . 
juvenile diabetes , lou gehrig 's disease , spinal cord injuries will wreak havoc on the daily lives of millions of american families . 
these diseases are going to bankrupt the health care system of our country unless we take action . 
stem cell research is the light of life , the way out of the darkness , the life-giving , life-enhancing , life-extending path to hope . 
we must vote for hope , vote for life , vote for a brighter future for all of our loved ones . 
vote for hope for a beloved mother whose loss of balance leads to falls in the night . 
vote for hope for a spouse who realizes that his memory of life and family are dissolving into a forgetful haze . 
vote `` yes '' so that the next generation of children will have to turn to the history books to know that there ever was such a thing as juvenile diabetes or parkinson 's or alzheimer 's or any of these plagues that affect our nation today and are going to turn into a crisis in the next generation . 
they have several of them ; so they use one . 
to watch somebody drown in their own secretions , someone that you know and care about , and then come in here and say we are not going to look for a way to relieve that kind of agony , we will not worry about a 13-year-old kid who gets diabetes and has to give himself thousands and thousands of shots and loses the length of life that most of us expect because of that disease ; we will say to them , well , jesus wanted us to do this . 
mr. speaker , i am pleased to support h.r. 810 , the stem cell research enhancement act of 2005 . 
this legislation takes the critical first step in expanding the number of stem cell lines that are eligible for federally funded research . 
for years , the united states has been the preeminent world leader in the field of biotechnology . 
we have made extraordinary advancements in the treatment , management and prevention of a wide range of disabilities . 
it 's nearly impossible to read a newspaper without hearing of some new breakthrough -- drug cocktails for aids patients ; gene therapy treatments ; new medical devices . 
despite some arguments that we have heard today , recent developments have proven that we are not far off from recognizing the true potential of this research . 
and in my home state of massachusetts , viacell and new world laboratories , two small biotech companies , have made notable progress in their research on spinal cord injuries and tissue regeneration . 
though no one can predict the outcome of embryonic stem cell research , what is certain is that without federal support , we will never fully recognize it 's potential . 
with federal support , this research could have a real and tangible impact on millions of lives in this country . 
mr. speaker , i support h.r. 810 , the `` stem cell research and enhancement act of 2005. '' let us be very clear about why we are here today . 
we are here to decide whether our nation will move forward in the search for treatments and therapies that will cure a multitude of dreaded diseases that afflict an estimated 128 million americans . 
today , millions of americans suffer from alzheimer 's disease , parkinson 's disease , spinal cord injuries or spinal dysfunction , and diabetes . 
and today , along with the tremendous number of americans living with cancer , approximately 1.5 million new cases were diagnosed in the united states last year . 
today , we can vote for h.r. 810 , and in doing so , choose to save lives and help to end the suffering of so many americans . 
embryonic stem cells , unlike adult stem cells , possess a unique ability to develop into any type of cell . 
embryonic stem cell research holds the potential for treating a variety of diseases such as lou gehrig 's disease , parkinson 's disease , alzheimer 's disease , autism , cystic fibrosis , heart disease , diabetes , multiple sclerosis , and osteoporosis , as well as spinal cord injuries . 
h.r. 810 does not allow federal funding for the creation or destruction of embryos . 
let us pass h.r. 810 , the `` stem cell research enhancement act of 2005 . '' 
mr. speaker , i rise in support of h.r. 810 , the stem cell research enhancement act , to put science and compassion ahead of ideology and fear . 
the promise of embryonic stem cells is that they alone have the potential to develop into any kind of body tissue , including blood , brain , muscle , organ , or nerve tissue . 
scientists believe that this unique ability might lead to breakthroughs in a number of illnesses that are now untreatable . 
for the very reason that we do not yet know what kind of treatments stem cell research will yield , it would be unwise not to explore the possibilities . 
as one researcher at harvard medical school and boston 's children 's hospital recently wrote in the new england journal of medicine , `` the science of human embryonic stem cells is in its infancy. '' restricting stem cell research now `` threaten [ s ] to starve the field at a critical stage. '' it 's critical to understand the science of stem cell research to weigh the moral and ethical issues involved . 
this bill allows funding of research on stem cells that are harnessed from fertility clinics . 
in vitro fertilization is a technology that has allowed millions of couples to share in the joy of childbirth . 
it results in the creation of embryos that are never implanted into the womb , never grow to be more than a handful of cells , and would otherwise be discarded . 
as one of the world 's foremost centers of medical research , massachusetts has much at stake in the stem cell debate . 
not only are our hospitals , research facilities , and institutions of higher learning on the cutting edge of conquering disease , they are also major economic drivers keeping us competitive in the global economy and employing tens of thousands of people . 
that is more than all of western europe combined . 
but it would put america -- the world 's most powerful engine of innovation and progress -- on the sidelines . 
mr. speaker , i rise in very strong support of the stem cell research enhancement act , which will expand the federal policy and implement stricter ethical guidelines for this research . 
embryonic stem cell research is necessary in discovering the causes of a myriad of genetic diseases , to testing new drug therapies more efficiently on laboratory tissue instead of human volunteers , and to staving off the ravages of disease with the regeneration of our bodies ' essential organs . 
president george w. bush 's policy on stem cell research limits federal funding only to embryonic stem cell lines that were derived by august 9 , 2001 , the date of his policy announcement . 
of the 78 stem cell lines promised by president bush , only 22 are available to researchers . 
according to the majority of scientists , if these stem cell lines were transplanted into people , they would provoke dangerous viruses in humans . 
what is even more disturbing is the fact that there are at least 125 new stem cell lines , which are more pristine than the lines currently available on the national institutes of health registry , which are ineligible for federally-funded research because they were derived after august 9 , 2001 . 
this restrictive embryonic stem cell research policy is making it increasingly more difficult to attract new scientists to this area of research because of concerns that funding restrictions will keep this research from being successful . 
the stem cell research enhancement act does not change the current policy on the use of federal funds ; this measure simply seeks to lift the cutoff date for lines available for research . 
h.r. 810 will also strengthen the ethical standards guiding the federal research on stem cell lines and will ensure that embryos donated for stem cell research were created for the purposes of in vitro fertilization , in excess of clinical need , would have otherwise be discarded and involved no financial inducement . 
contrary to what opponents have been saying , the stem cell research enhancement act will not federally fund the destruction of embryos . 
h.r. 810 is clear that unused embryos will be used for embryonic stem cell research only by decision of the donor . 
in february 2005 , the civil society institute conducted a nationwide survey of 1 , 022 adults and found that 70 percent supported bipartisan federal legislation to promote embryonic stem cell research . 
i urge all my colleagues to vote in favor of the stem cell research enhancement act . 
first of all , although many members and the public and the media seem to get this wrong , the truth is , i believe we will have probably close to unanimous support for using federal dollars for stem cell research , but it is important to understand the different types : adult stem cell , which has much promise to harvest and grow these , although it has some risk for infections and other problems . 
in the area of umbilical cord blood , one of the cases , because in my practice , i oftentimes dealt with children with developmental disabilities . 
one case of the new england journal of medicine reports 90 percent success rate with hurley 's syndrome , a developmental disorder , autosomal dominant one , which ends up in severe developmental delays and death . 
those are incredible results , incredible results that come from looking at the facts of what cord blood stem cell research is about . 
you are taking something that has been discarded in the normal process of pregnancy and birth . 
let us help support the continuation of this vital research which does not just show promise , but shows demonstrable results . 
and it does not involve the ending of any life in the process . 
now i have no doubts about the compassion and convictions of both sides on this issue , but i take issue with the direction of their convictions , because in the end a life without a name is still a life . 
while some may see this as scientific efforts of ingenuity and future nobel prize work , it does not take away the lethality of this research . 
further , let me state that president clinton 's bioethics council stated : `` embryos deserve respect as a form of human life. '' in 1999 the council said : `` funding of embryonic stem cell research should be done only if there are no alternatives. '' the research that we have reviewed today and has been reviewed by this congress in the past when these amendments have been looked upon over the last decade , is that there is still no alternative in the sense that the research is showing that cord blood stem cell research and adult stem cell research is where the results are found . 
if we say it is all right to use lethal methods in our research to remove the life of an embryo , what next ? 
i thought about little children that needed to be comforted when they were hurt , little children that wanted to be put to bed at night with a kiss and a story , their wonderful humanness , and i thought about what the american people think of babies and how we cherish them . 
when i see these little children , i know their intrinsic value ; and how we treat people , in whatever form of development , depends on how we perceive them . 
the embryo is a human being at an early stage of development . 
when we talk to many who have great knowledge about this , and i appreciate the doctors in our presence , we should never spend the american taxpayers ' dollars to take the life of an innocent human being . 
i believe in the transforming and the lifesaving power of research and science , and i have seen firsthand how cutting-edge research can make a big difference in the lives of americans who suffer with all sorts of diseases , and , i understand the value of federally funded research . 
however , this debate is not about the merits of scientific discovery . 
there is no ban on research for the limited number of ivf embryos on which such research would even be possible . 
this debate is about federal tax dollars and whether these dollars should be spent on the destruction of embryos , which i do not support . 
supporters of this bill say we have nothing to lose by destroying existing embryos with federal money because , after all , some of them will probably be discarded anyway . 
those who 've studied the implications of an embryonic stem cell research expansion know full well that federal funding for the destruction of existing ivf embryos is no silver bullet for disease treatment . 
h.r. 810 is merely the first step in an effort to spend federal money -- not only on the destruction , but on the creation of cloned embryos for research . 
mr. speaker , the debate on stem cell research challenges all of us to think carefully about the value we place on human life . 
many of us turn to our faith traditions for guidance and wisdom . 
none of us has the right to legislate our religious beliefs and impose them on others . 
but as members look to the teachings of their faiths for guidance , i ask them to remember that not all faiths hold that stem cell research is the enemy of life . 
the religious traditions of many of us do not tell us that a 14-day-old blastocyst has the same moral significance as a human being and do tell us that the obligation to preserve life , which includes the obligation to cure disease and alleviate human suffering , is paramount . 
i understand and respect the faith of all of my colleagues . 
i ask them to accord that same respect to the faiths of others . 
unfortunately , words have sometimes been used carelessly , and these words sometimes denigrate the faith of others . 
when the teachings of a faith are described as `` a culture of death '' because they hold that the potential to save and heal human lives is an integral part of valuing human life , that faith and its adherence are being slandered . 
how dare anyone slander the faiths of many americans as `` a culture of death. '' god does not speak to one faith alone . 
we hear lots of speeches about respecting people of faith and the need to bring faith into the public square . 
we should vote our consciences , but we should not denigrate the faith and consciences of the millions of americans who seek to preserve life and end suffering and who believe that embryonic stem cell research can save lives and therefore embodies the highest morality . 
mr. speaker , the issue of embryonic stem cell research places humanity on the frontier of medical science and at the outer edge of moral theology . 
on the side of science there is much hope , even expectation that extraordinarily effective therapies will be developed due to a wide range of maladies from diabetes to parkinson 's , spinal cord injury and a host of others . 
much has yet to be learned , however , about adverse outcomes , which is why scientists proceed cautiously without overpromising and with respect for moral considerations of their research . 
an editorial in america magazine said it well : `` the debate over embryonic stem cell research can not be fully resolved because it is ignited by irreconcilable views of what reverence for life requires. '' let us recall louise brown , the first test tube baby . 
each of us has to decide the morality of this unique aspect of the issue . 
but i can not get over the moral theology underpinning of this extraordinary research on the frontier of science that we are tinkering with human life . 
let us resolve any uncertainty in favor of life . 
i have been able to listen to most of what was said tonight . 
obviously , the gentleman has a tremendous depth of scientific understanding . 
as the gentleman has mentioned , those who are in favor of embryonic stem cell research , many of them are people who have children who have juvenile diabetes . 
yet , on the other side of the argument , as the gentleman has amplified so well , there are some other dilemmas . 
one thing that is of concern to me is when is a life a life ? 
probably , in many cases , most of us would say an 8-month-old fetus would not be appropriate to do some harm to . 
so therein lies the horns of the dilemma . 
so many of us are of the persuasion that you really can not draw that line . 
there is a certain sanctity of life . 
as the gentleman has pointed out so effectively here , some of that has to do with the length of time of research . 
if it is so promising , then why has the private sector not stepped up , because obviously there are huge profits to be made if you have some type of a cure for juvenile diabetes or alzheimer 's or whatever ; and yet we do not seem to see that afoot . 
then i guess the last thing that i would mention is that there is the ethical question , should we use public funds in doing research that is so divisive , that has so many people on both sides of the fence ? 
it seems we should have more unanimity in using public funds to do this type of research . 
so i applaud the gentleman for the proposed legislation that he has before us , because in this legislation is the prospect of using embryonic stem cells without destroying the embryo . 
of course , that removes the dilemma on both sides . 
i understand most of what is in there . 
one other thing that is also mentioned is the fact that when these frozen embryos are thawed out , many of them die , as the gentleman mentioned ; and some of those apparently will yield stem cells in the early stages . 
mr. speaker , the issue of government funding of embryonic stem cell research is one of the most divisive issues facing the country . 
the main question that should concern congress today is does the united states government have the constitutional authority to fund any form of stem cell research . 
unfortunately , many opponents of embryonic stem cell research are disregarding the constitution by supporting h.r. 2520 , an `` acceptable '' alternative that funds umbilical-cord stem cell research . 
federal funding of medical research guarantees the politicization of decisions about what types of research for what diseases will be funded . 
thus , scarce resources will be allocated according to who has the most effective lobby rather than allocated on the basis of need or even likely success . 
ironically , an example of this process may be found in h.r. 2520 ; some research indicates that adult stem cells may be as useful or more useful to medical science than either embryonic or umbilical cord stem cells . 
in fact , the supporters of embryonic stem cell research may have a point when they question the effectiveness of umbilical cord mr. speaker , there is no question that h.r. 810 violates basic constitutional principles by forcing taxpayers to subsidize embryonic stem cell research . 
this is important legislation because every family in america , every family in america is just one phone call away , one diagnosis , one accident away from needing the benefits of stem cell research . 
we want all of the research to proceed , the umbilical cord research that we talked about this morning , and adult stem cell research . 
i served for many years , probably 10 , on the labor-hhs subcommittee which funds the national institutes of health . 
what we are doing here today is recognizing the miraculous power to cure that exists at the national institutes of health and in other institutes of excellence in research throughout our country . 
and what we have said , what we are saying here today is nothing that should not be considered of value . 
what we are saying is when these embryos are in excess of the needs of in vitro fertilization , rather than be destroyed , they will be used for basic biomedical research . 
it is interesting to me because when i first came to the congress , some of the same forces out there that are against this embryonic stem cell research were very much against in vitro fertilization . 
i am particularly proud of my state of california where the people of california in a bipartisan way , as we are doing today , voted a commitment of resources to invest in embryonic stem cell research . 
we in california will become the regenerative capital of america , indeed , probably of the world . 
but this should be happening all over the country , and it should not depend on the local initiative of the state . 
that is good , but it should be coming from the leadership of the federal government with the ethical standards that go with it . 
indeed , with the great potential for medical research , science has the power to answer the prayers of america 's families . 
i believe strongly in the power of prayer ; but part of that prayer is for a cure , and science can provide that . 
many religious leaders endorse the castle/degette bill because of their respect for life and because they believe science , within the bounds of ethics and religious beliefs , can save lives and improve its quality . 
groups as diverse as the united church of christ , the union for reform judaism , the united methodist church , the episcopal church , and the union of orthodox jewish congregations of america all support this bill . 
the union of orthodox jewish congregations of america says the traditional jewish perspective emphasizes the potential to save and heal human lives is an integral part of valuing human life . 
the episcopal church in its letter in support of this legislation says : `` as stewards of creation , we are called to help men and renew the world in many ways . 
the episcopal church celebrates medical research as this research expands our knowledge of god 's creation and empowers us to bring potential healing to those who suffer from disease and disability. '' this is what they wrote , and much more , in support of this legislation . 
it is our duty to bring hope to the sick and the disabled , not to bind the hands of those who can bring them hope . 
this bill will enable science to live up to its potential to again answer the prayers of america 's families . 
i urge all of my colleagues to support this bill , thank all of our colleagues on both sides of this issue for their very dignified approach to how we are dealing with this legislation today , but also say that today is a historic day , that the gentleman from delaware ( mr. castle ) xz4000700 and the gentlewoman from colorado ( ms. degette ) xz4001010 have given us the opportunity to move forward , again to answer the prayers of america 's families , to meet their needs , to allow the science to use its biblical power to cure ; and for that i am deeply in their debt . 
even last october , a korean woman who had been paralyzed for 19 years took a few steps for reporters in seoul with the aid of a walker and ethical adult cord blood stem cells injected into her spine . 
i can tell you , having spoken to his parents , i would do anything to help that brave young man out of that chair . 
i would do anything except fund the destruction of human embryos for research . 
president kennedy said : `` to lead is to choose '' and today congress will choose and should choose to promote ethical healing by adopting the stem cell research act , to prevent the erosion of the principle that all human life , even embryonic human life , is sacred . 
say `` yes '' to ethical adult stem cell research and `` no '' to funding the destruction of human embryos for scientific advancement . 
mr. speaker , i rise today in respectful opposition to this sincerely conceived , but ill-founded , legislation known as castle-degette , a bill that authorizes the use of federal tax dollars to fund the destruction of human embryos for scientific research . 
as we begin this debate , i am confident we will hear the supporters of this bill argue in the name of president ronald reagan , that somehow this research is consistent with his long-held views on the sanctity of life . 
but it was ronald reagan who wrote : `` we can not diminish the value of one category of human , the unborn , without diminishing the value of all human life. '' the supporters will also argue that this is a debate between science and ideology , that destroying human embryos for research is necessary to cure a whole host of maladies , from spinal cord injuries to parkinson 's . 
physicians on our side of the aisle will make the case for the ethical alternative of adult stem cell research , and congress today has already voted to greatly expand funding in this area . 
but the debate over the legitimacy or the potential of embryonic stem cell research is actually not the point of this debate . 
we are here simply to decide whether congress should take the taxpayer dollars of millions of pro-life americans and use them to fund the destruction of human embryos for research . 
the proponents of this legislation do not just want to be able to do embryonic stem cell research . 
and like 43 percent of the american people in a survey just out today , i have a problem with that . 
i believe it is morally wrong to create human life to destroy it for research , and i further believe it is morally wrong to take the tax dollars of millions of pro-life americans who believe , as i do , that human life is sacred , and use it to fund the destruction of human embryos for research . 
this debate is about who we are as a nation , not will we respect the sanctity of life , but will we respect the deeply held moral beliefs of nearly half of the people of this nation who find the destruction of human embryos for scientific research to be morally wrong . 
this debate is not about whether we should allow research that involves the destruction of human embryos . 
this debate is about who pays for it , and it is my fervent hope and prayer as we stand at this crossroads between science and the sanctity of life that we will choose life . 
this morning on capitol hill i was surrounded by dozens of `` snowflake babies , '' some 81 children who were born from frozen embryos , the throw-away material we will hear about today . 
as i spoke over the cries and cooing of those little fragile lives , i could not help but think of the ancient text : `` i have set before you life and earth , blessings and curses , now choose life so that you and your children may live. '' let this congress choose life and reject federal funding for the destruction of human embryos for research . 
mr. speaker , i am a big supporter of stem cell research . 
but i do not support the dissecting and destruction of living human embryos to do so . 
the way that h.r. 810 would find those cells is through the destruction of ivf living embryos . 
they are living human embryos , and there are many of them that should be adopted , not dissected . 
the proponents of h.r. 810 can produce no such results . 
mr. speaker , i rise in favor of adult stem cell research , characterized by the gentleman from new jersey 's ( mr. smith ) xz4003801 bill , and oppose h.r. 810 , the castle legislation , that would propose federal dollars for destroying human embryos for embryonic stem cell research . 
in this one binder there are 67 successful treatments using adult stem cells , and stem cells from cord blood , adult stem cells for treatment of diseases . 
the simple fact of the matter is with the use of embryonic stem cells the only thing that you have today are dead embryos and dead laboratory rats with tumors . 
the ordering of genes in our body makes us unique . 
we have the color of our hair , skin , eyes , teeth , because of dna . 
and each person has his or her own set of dna , and that makes us each unique . 
i am a supporter of ethical stem cell research , mr. speaker . 
i do not support the dissecting and destruction of living human embryos to harvest stem cells for the purpose of experimentation and research , and that is because each of these living human embryos has its own genetic makeup , its own dna . 
she was a leftover embryo that proponents of this bill would destroy for her cells . 
zara is living proof that advocates of h.r. 810 are wrong on this issue . 
i would like to challenge the other side to put up in front of a camera one person treated for spinal cord injury with embryonic stem cells . 
adult stem cells are treating human patients today for the very diseases that the proponents of this bill claim might hopefully one day be treated through the destruction of living human embryos . 
the human being is in all stages of development , or disability , uniquely distinct and infinitely valuable . 
house resolution 810 is a tragic betrayal of that value . 
mr. speaker , i rise today to say that i will be casting my vote for h.r. 810 , the stem cell research enhancement act of 2005 . 
i am voting for this legislation with the face of ashley dahly on my mind . 
in fact , today she is at home missing her finals because of high blood sugars . 
ashley 's goal is to enter a health-related field such as a nurse or diabetes educator , because as ashley has said , `` i know the pain that children diagnosed with diabetes go through , and i think i could help in relieving that pain. '' there is currently no cure for juvenile diabetes , a disease that affects another child every hour of every day . 
particularly in the case of diabetes , embryonic stem cell research holds the greatest possibility for understanding and curing this disease , since adult stem cells are not present in the pancreas , the organ attacked by diabetes . 
the bill requires that research only be conducted on stem cells derived from embryos created for fertility treatments that were in excess of the need of the mother and would otherwise have been destroyed . 
my vote today is supported by over 200 major patient groups , scientists , and medical research groups , and i believe that my vote can provide hope to families in north dakota like ashley 's who are suffering through the illness of a loved one . 
mr. speaker , critics of embryonic stem cell research maintain that it is wrong to promote science which destroys life in order to save life . 
to reduce this issue to an abortion issue is a horrible injustice to 100 million americans suffering the ravages of diabetes , spinal cord paralysis , heart disease , parkinson 's and alzheimer 's disease , cancer , ms , lou gehrig 's disease and other fatal and debilitating diseases . 
i met with researchers from four of the main stem cell institutes in america . 
as one prominent researcher told me , and i am quoting , `` the real irony of the president 's policy is that at least 100 , 000 surplus frozen embryos could be used to produce stem cells for research to save lives . 
but instead , these surplus embryos are being thrown into the garbage and treated as medical waste , thrown into the garbage and treated as medical waste. '' only 22 of the 78 stem cell lines approved by the president remain today . 
as another leading researcher said , `` this limit on research has stunted progress on finding cures for a number of fatal and debilitating diseases. '' mr. speaker , it is too late for my beloved mother who was totally debilitated by alzheimer 's disease which killed her . 
mr. speaker , critics of embryonic stem cell research maintain it is wrong to `` promote science which destroys life in order to save life. '' as the leading pro-life legislator in washington , sen . 
`` to reduce this issue to an abortion issue is a horrible injustice to 100 million americans suffering the ravages of diabetes , spinal cord paralysis , heart disease , parkinson 's and alzheimer 's disease , cancer , multiple sclerosis , lou gehrig 's disease and other fatal , debilitating diseases . 
i have met with medical researchers from the university of minnesota stem cell institute , the mayo clinic , the national institutes of health and johns hopkins university . 
as one prominent researcher told me , `` the real irony of the president 's policy is that at least 100 , 000 surplus frozen embryos could be used to produce stem cells for research to save lives . 
instead , these surplus embryos are being thrown into the garbage and treated as medical waste. '' only 22 of the 78 stem cell lines approved by the president in 2001 remain today . 
as another leading medical researcher said , `` this limit on research has stunted progress on finding cures for a number of debilitating and fatal diseases. '' mr. speaker , the scientific evidence is overwhelming that embryonic stem cells have great potential to regenerate specific types of human tissues , offering hope for millions of americans suffering from debilitating diseases . 
embryonic stem cell research will prolong life , improve life and give hope for life to millions of people . 
i recall being taught that the mustard seed is the smallest of all seeds , and yet it grows into the mightiest of trees . 
and the same can be said of the human embryo , something so very small , so unseen by the human eye , and yet so special at the very beginning of life that it needs to be safeguarded . 
the real heart of this argument is whether something so innocent should be killed and whether americans should pay to facilitate the government-sanctioned experimentation on human life based upon a prospect , based upon a maybe , based upon a possibility , based upon the potential . 
the government already takes 285 million of our tax dollars each year and funnels it into pro-abortion organizations . 
the leadership of the gentleman from delaware ( mr. castle ) xz4000700 undermines my ability to love my country , undermines our patriotism . 
mr. speaker , as a proud cosponsor of h.r. 810 , the stem cell research enhancement act of 2005 , i rise in support of this legislation . 
those of us who have long supported the increased accessibility and possibilities of ethical stem cell research appreciate the opportunity the leadership has granted us by allowing a vote on this legislation today . 
by passing h.r. 810 , we have the opportunity to help all of those individuals who are living with these and many other illnesses and injuries . 
embryonic stem cell research holds the key to decreasing the pain and suffering of so many of our friends and family members . 
furthermore , we have a moral obligation to do everything we can to help the millions of americans , whose lives we hold in our hands , by allowing federal funding to be used for this promising research . 
the authors of h.r. 810 have gone to great lengths to guarantee that safeguards are in place to ensure the ethical use of embryonic stem cells . 
this legislation also directs the experts at the national institutes of health to define the boundaries of this research . 
the united states has long been the leader of groundbreaking health research . 
today we have the opportunity to ensure that the rest of the world does not continue to take the lead in health care advances . 
i urge all of my colleagues to vote in favor of h.r. 810 , not only because u.s. based researchers deserve to be at the forefront of the development of promising new treatments , but also for all of our constituents , friends , and family members who are counting on us to support the effort to find cures for so many different diseases and illnesses . 
mr. speaker , i rise today in strong support of h.r. 810 , the stem cell research enhancement act of 2005 . 
stem cells have tremendous promise to treat a myriad of devastating diseases and disorders . 
today , i would like to highlight how the reeve-irvine research center has made significant head way in making the promise of embryonic stem cells a reality . 
if un-differentiated stem cells are transplanted into the brain or spinal cord , they may become a teratoma , a tumor made of many different cells like bone , muscle , and hair . 
moreover , as report in journal of neuroscience , his group has been successful in transplanting these cells into an acute spinal cord injury . 
this finding is proof of principle that human embryonic stem cells can be a viable therapeutic agent . 
the reeve-irvine research center is one of a handful of places in the u.s. that has the know-how to use embryonic stem cells . 
with more lines available , we could readily address issues related to paralysis by developing new cell populations , like motor neurons , or by testing the therapeutic quality of other lines . 
in addition , more researchers would be able to devote their talents to this area of research . 
would the families of your constituents do any differently ? 
the stem cell research enhancement act of 2005 before congress today , if passed , would open the door to our country 's brightest scientists to find the treatments that dr . 
mr. speaker , i stand today in strong support of the bipartisan stem cell research enhancement act of 2005 . 
one of the few places this is really an extremely controversial bill is right here because the majority of americans strongly support embryonic stem cell research . 
one such life is that of clara livingston , a 9-year-old girl with diabetes . 
i do n't like going low and fainting. '' she continued , `` i would like to find a cure because finding a cure will help make america and the rest of the world not worry about diabetes. '' most scientists agree that embryonic stem cell research offers the greatest hope to patients like clara . 
there are limitations on the usefulness of adult stem cells when compared to embryonic stem cells . 
we do a grave disservice to millions of children and adults living with serious illness , as well as the millions who will develop these conditions in the future , by prohibiting promising research . 
this bill will lift these arbitrary restrictions and permit funding of cell lines regardless of where they were created . 
as steven teitelbaum of washington university in st . 
mr. speaker , the gentleman from delaware ( mr. castle ) xz4000700 and the gentlewoman from colorado ( ms. degette ) xz4001010 deserve our thanks for sponsoring the stem cell research enhancement act and working with so many families who have been impacted by diseases that may find cures as a result of this vital research . 
i also thank them for giving me the opportunity to cast one of the most important votes i will ever make in congress . 
i think of the grandmother , whom i never met , who died when her daughter , my mother , was only 16 . 
i think of my mother-in-law who never had the opportunity to know her grandchild who is now 25 . 
i think of my cousin , who was brilliant and never got to realize his full potential . 
embryonic stem cell research has the potential to cure disease and save lives in ways never dreamed of . 
i want history to look back at this congress and say that in the face of the age-old tension between religion and science , the members here allowed critical scientific research to advance while respecting important ethical questions that surrounded it . 
mr. speaker , i rise in strong support of the castle-degette amendment . 
i have a friend who is alive today because of stem cell research and injections that he has had . 
he is in the bloom of health . 
mr. speaker , a couple of years ago , a very close , longtime personal friend of mine , john mccaffery , was diagnosed with lymphatic leukemia . 
but this must complement , not substitute , scientific research on embryonic stem cells -- which is much more promising and will yield to advancements in the prevention and treatment of almost every disease american families face . 
the united states must be on the cutting edge of this important research . 
we have a responsibility to promote stem cell research which could lead to treatments and cures for diseases affecting millions of americans . 
without question , the u.s. should set high standards for moral and ethical use of stem cells . 
mr. speaker , i thank my good friend for yielding and for his leadership on this bill and for cosponsoring it , along with the gentleman from alabama ( mr. davis ) xz4000921 on the other side of the aisle for his leadership over the last 3 years as we crafted this legislation . 
it is finally on the floor after almost 3 years of work ; and again i thank my friend , the gentleman from alabama ( mr. davis ) xz4000921 for his leadership . 
one of the best kept secrets in america today is that umbilical cord-blood stem cells and adult stem cells are curing people of a myriad of terrible conditions and diseases . 
one of the greatest hopes that i have is that these current-day miracles , denied to many because of an insufficient inventory and inefficient means of matching cord-blood stem cells with patients , will now become available to tens of thousands of patients as a direct result of the stem cell therapeutic and research act of 2005 , h.r. 2520 . 
amazingly , we are on the threshold of systematically turning medical waste , umbilical cords and placentas , into medical miracles for huge numbers of very sick and terminally ill patients who suffer from such maladies as leukemia and sickle cell anemia . 
and because this legislation promotes cord-blood research as well , we can expect new and expanded uses of these very versatile stem cells . 
it also authorizes the national bone marrow transplant system and combines both under a new program , providing an easy , single-access point for information for doctors and patients and for the purpose of collecting and analyzing outcomes data . 
the new program created in our legislation is named for our distinguished colleague , the gentleman from florida ( mr. young ) xz4004391 , because of all of his great work on bone marrow transplantation over the last 2 decades . 
the new york blood center , for example , has treated thousands of patients with more than 65 different diseases , including sickle cell disease , leukemia and osteoporosis . 
some of those patients came and told their stories yesterday at a press conference , and they are in the gallery watching this debate right now . 
one of those men , a young man named keonne penn was here to tell his story of how he was cured of sickle cell anemia , and he said , `` if it was n't for cord-blood stem cells , i would probably be dead by now . 
it saved my life. '' stephen sprague , another man who was cured of leukemia , said he too was lucky to find a cord-blood match . 
and 22-year-old jaclyn albanese , who just graduated from rutgers university from my state , said , `` if the new york blood center had not been there , i do not know what kind of shape i would be in. '' she is thankful as well . 
mr. speaker , i say to my colleagues , cord-blood has also been used to treat hurler 's disease and krabbe 's disease , both neurological conditions , which blows away the idea that cord-blood stem cells are limited in the potential and the capacity to turn into other kinds of cells . 
that is not too surprising , i say to my colleagues , when you simply read the published literature on the flexibility of cord-blood stem cells . 
according to a july 2004 study published in the journal of experimental medicine , a research group led by dr . 
kogler found `` a new human somatic stem cell from placental cord-blood with intrinsic pluripotent differential potential , '' which means it can become any type of cell in the body . 
in addition , they found that the cells could expand to 10 quadrillion , or 10 to the power of 15 , cells before losing any pluripotent abilities . 
and cord-blood stem cells are not only ahead in treating real human patients , they are also able to turn into different kinds of cells for research . 
one company has already turned cord-blood stem cells into representatives of three germinal layers , including neural stem cells , nerve stem cells , liver/pancreas precursors , skeletal muscle , fat cells , bone cells and blood vessels . 
last month , celgene corporation announced that cord-blood cells `` are `pluripotent ' , or have the ability to become different types of tissue. '' so we are just on the beginning of realizing the vast potential of what was formerly medical waste and has now been turned into these medical miracles . 
during the entire period where research has been happening in this area of regenerative medicine , the idea that cells can change types and repair organs , both adult and embryo cells have been around in animals . 
mr. speaker , make no mistake about it , i support aggressive stem cell research and the judicious application of stem cells to mitigate and to cure disease . 
that is why i sponsored the stem cell therapeutic research act of 2005 and i have been pushing it for almost 3 years . 
that is why those of us who oppose h.r. 810 strongly support pouring millions of dollars into federal funds to support ethical stem cell research to find cures , to alleviate suffering , to inspire well-founded hope and to do it all in a way that respects the dignity and sanctity of human life . 
i strongly oppose the castle bill , however , because it will use federal funds to facilitate the killing of perfectly healthy human embryos to derive their stem cells . 
parents of human embryos are custodians of those young ones . 
they are not owners of human property , and the public policy we craft should ensure that the best interests of newly created human life is protected and preserved . 
the castle bill embraces the misinformed notion that there is such a thing as left-over embryos , a grossly misleading and dehumanizing term in and of itself , that they are just going to be destroyed and thrown away and poured down the drain . 
the cryogenically frozen male and female embryos that the genetic parents may feel are no longer needed for implanting in the genetic mother are of infinite value to an adoptive mother who may be sterile or otherwise unable to have a baby . 
mr. speaker , just one adoption initiative , the snowflakes embryo adoption program , has facilitated the adoption of 96 formerly frozen embryos with more adoptions in the works . 
i have met some of those kids . 
they are not leftovers , even though they lived in a frozen orphanage , perhaps many of them for years . 
they are just as human and alive and full of promise as other children . 
think of what we are doing . 
we are debating the best route for achieving wonderful , healing medical possibility , possibility that would have been unheard of not many years ago . 
by definition , good research is always about possibility , about the potential of finding the answers to that which we do not know . 
first , that of a friend . 
this is a picture of a family i know . 
this family has hope , realistic hope that sometime in the many years of life ahead of them , medical research may give them the possibility of cure or dramatic improvement in her diabetes and his spinal cord injury . 
my patients and i relied on past research done by many good scientists striving in an ethical manner to end the harsh realities of so many diseases . 
i know some of my friends in opposition to this bill today argue that embryonic stem cell research is junk science . 
i do not share this view , but to those of you pondering this view today i say , let our gifted researchers , not us legislators , answer the unanswered scientific questions for us . 
third , as patients , my wife and i have ventured into the world of fertility clinics . 
the ultimate decision on what happens to unneeded embryos should be up to that fully informed family , and fully informed consent is part of this bill . 
mr. speaker , i would like to share a letter from a young girl in my district : `` dear house of representatives : `` my name is kelsea king . 
it is also very difficult knowing what this disease makes us prone to , such as heart disease , liver problems , blindness and in extreme cases loss of limb . 
but the most difficult part of all is worrying about passing out due to low blood sugars , or being hospitalized . 
it is too large of a responsibility and too large of a burden for any 7-year-old and even for a 14-year-old . 
but i do not want a cure if it takes the lives of others . 
there are other ways of a cure . 
no one deserves diabetes but everyone deserves a cure through adult stem cell research. '' the campaign for federal funding of embryonic stem cell research has been a campaign of half-truths , and at times , outright deception . 
advocates of federal funding for destructive embryonic stem cell research do three things consistently : ( 1 ) obfuscate the fact that a living human embryo is killed in the process of extracting the cells . 
as chairman of the government reform subcommittee on criminal justice , drug policy and human resources , i sent a letter to the director of the national institutes of health in october , 2002 requesting a detailed report providing comprehensive information about the medical applications of adult and embryonic stem cells . 
it took almost two years to get a response from the nih , and the response omitted many of the advances , applications and trials for adult stem cell research that had already been reported in peer reviewed journals . 
the one thing that was complete in the nih response to our oversight request , was the listing of applications for embryonic stem cells : zero . 
the applications for embryonic stem cell research was zero then , in june of 2004 , and it 's zero now . 
there is no limit to the amount of private money that may be devoted to this research . 
but the public should not be forced to subsidize a speculative venture involving destruction of human life . 
fourteen-year-old kelsea king , an articulate young constituent of mine , has juvenile diabetes . 
her struggle with this disease is emotionally and physically challenging , but she is strongly opposed to the idea of developing a cure that would involve the destruction of human life . 
dear house of representatives , my name is kelsea king . 
it is also very difficult knowing what this disease makes us prone to , such as heart disease , liver problems , blindness , and in extreme cases , loss of limb . 
but the most difficult part of all is worrying about passing out due to low blood sugars , or being hospitalized for ketoacidosis ( which is caused by blood sugar being too high ) . 
it is too large of a responsibility and too large of a burden for any seven-year-old , and even for a fourteen-year-old . 
but i do not want a cure if it takes the lives of others . 
there are other ways of a cure ; we just need proper funding . 
my sister and i need this , as well as the millions of other children in america who are afflicted with this disease . 
mr. speaker , i rise in strong support of h.r. 810 . 
our research policies should be decided by scientists and doctors at the national institutes of health and not by karl rove and self-appointed religious gurus . 
if you believe it is morally superior to discard a single cell in a freezer rather than to use it to help millions of americans with parkinson 's , alzheimer 's , and diabetes , and you are asked to donate an embryo , then by all means refuse to do so . 
many in government already think they have the right to tell you whom you can marry , what kind of birth control you can use and how you die . 
beyond my outrage at this arrogance , i am saddened by this country 's precipitous decline in the estimation of the rest of the world . 
if this bill does not pass and scientists of the world meet to discuss this rapidly advancing field , many of our key researchers will be stuck here working with the few stem cell lines that are considered inoffensive . 
the flat earth society will tell you that the u.s. has to show moral leadership , and just because the overwhelming majority of the world 's scientific community supports research , it does not mean it is the right thing to do . 
i do not look to those that will not acknowledge the existence of global warming for scientific and ethical leadership . 
i stand proudly with millions of americans on behalf of this country 's tradition of scientific leadership , and i urge a `` yes '' vote for h.r. 810 . 
but we have spent a lot of money , and i think $ 60 million is the right number . 
i remind my colleagues that despite all this money , embryonic stem cell research has not resulted in any documented success whatsoever as compared to the astounding success of adult stem cells . 
he had to go to some obscure manuals publications to find notice of even the experiments . 
just last week , it was reported that scientists in south korea created scores of cloned human embryos that they then destroyed to produce 11 stem cell lines . 
the age of cloning is upon us . 
also recently in the news is the creation of man-animal hybrids , or chimeras , using animal sperm and human eggs , or human sperm and animal eggs . 
the apocalyptic creations are the inevitable result of what happens when man and government believes it can foster good medical ends from ethically dubious means . 
the least that we can do is prevent the further spending of taxpayer dollars on these ill-advised experiments . 
mr. speaker , had either , or both , of the respective stem cell research bills appearing before us for debate and been ruled amendable , i had intended to offer an amendment regarding another alternative to embryonic stem cell research : stem cells from teeth . 
another promising field of stem cell research comes from our very teeth : stem cells from human exfoliated deciduous teeth , shed , aka `` baby '' teeth . 
last week a constituent of mine , marc w. heft , dmd , phd , professor and interim chair , department of oral and maxillofacial and diagnostic sciences of the college of dentistry at the university of florida , pointed this out to me . 
the intramural program of the national institute of dental and craniofacial research , idcr , of the national institutes of health , nih , has been a leader in this exciting line of research . 
on april 21 , 2003 , nih scientists reported that for the first time , `` baby '' teeth , the temporary teeth children begin losing around their sixth birthday , contain a rich supply of stem cells in their dental pulp . 
the scientists said that `` this unexpected discovery could have important implications because the stem cells remain alive inside the tooth for a short time after it falls out of a child 's mouth , suggesting the cells could be readily harvested for research . 
according to the scientists , who published their findings online today in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences , the stem cells are unique compared to many `` adult '' stem cells in the body . 
they are long lived , grow rapidly in culture , and , with careful prompting in the laboratory , have the potential to induce the formation of specialized in addition to the studies of stem cells from dental pulps of deciduous , `` baby '' teeth , there are ongoing studies of stem cells from the periodontium , the region where teeth connect to bone . 
july 8 , 2004 , again , nih scientists also say these cells have `` tremendous potential '' to regenerate the periodontal ligament , a common target of advanced gum -- periodontal -- disease . 
the enthusiasm is based on followup studies , in which the researchers implanted the human adult stem cells into rodents and found most of them had differentiated into a mixture of periodontal ligament -- including the specific fiber bundles that attach tooth to bone -- and the mineralized tissue called cementum that covers the roots of our teeth . 
while most of this work is coming out of the intramural program of nidcr , dr . 
mary macdougall , university of texas health sciences center at san antonio -- also president of the american association for dental research -- and dr . 
paul krebsbach , university of michigan . 
mr. speaker , this debate we are having surrounding h.r. 810 , the stem cell research enhancement act , is really one of the most fundamentally important debates that this body can undertake . 
regrettably , this discussion will only last a few hours on the floor of the house of representatives today . 
those of us who believe in the sanctity of life from conception to our last breath , find the logic of the proponents of embryonic stem cell research flawed . 
we can not mask the efforts to manipulate human life under the guise of science or medical research . 
you and i , each of us , we all share one thing in common : we were all embryos at one time . 
whether an embryo , a human life , is or is not allowed to grow , to become a unique individual , is a discussion this country really should have , a meaningful discussion , not just a few hours of debate in this chamber . 
this is an ethical discussion i hoped would take place in the halls of congress , in the congressional committee rooms , in homes and workplaces all across america . 
the other body has just gone through public , political , and senatorial debate on the use of a filibuster in our democracy . 
because of this debate , a healthy discussion occurred in america . 
i , for one , do not wish to avoid the moral and ethical issues of stem cell research debate . 
why are proponents of h.r. 810 so adamant that we do research specifically using embryonic stem cells ? 
according to the proponents of this legislation , these stem cells are our best hope of finding cures . 
they can develop into all cells of the body . 
they argue we must create life and then kill it to unlock the mysteries of life for scientific medical research . 
create and clone the building blocks of life so we can manipulate and experiment ? 
we will hear today about other research with adult stem cells , cord and placenta cells , bone marrow , fetal tissue , and unraveling our dna through mapping of genome , all in the pursuit of finding medical cures for the dreaded diseases , illnesses , and injuries we all wish to cure . 
proponents of h.r. 810 will claim that their legislation will address the ethical manner in which this research will be conducted . 
yet their legislation is silent on the ethics , other than subsection c that directs the secretary of hhs to create guidelines within 60 days . 
if this nation , through its elected leaders , allows embryonic stem cell research , then we as representatives of the american people should have the courage to state unequivocally where we stand and answer the ethical questions presented before us here today . 
i know many members on both sides of the aisle , of all political philosophies , have struggled with questions of morality , questions of life and questions of faith this past week . 
many of us have asked ourselves that same question , and i have concluded that this legislation is unethical and unnecessary . 
congress should not take lightly the destruction and manipulation of human life . 
forty-three percent of the american public clearly opposes more federal funding for human embryonic research . 
the national academy of sciences ' guidelines recommends allowing them to grow for no more than 14 days . 
embryonic stem cell research is eligible for state funding in several states , california and new jersey , and is funded through millions of dollars in private research money , $ 100 million alone at harvard university . 
the national institute of health spent $ 24 million on embryonic stem cell research in fiscal year 2004 , the last year that data was available . 
former secretary of health and human services tommy thompson has said that these lines should be exhausted first before we move any further . 
instead of cures , embryonic stem cell research has led to tumors and deaths in animal studies . 
the gentleman from florida ( mr. weldon ) xz4004271 has had his staff scour the medical journals for real proof of therapeutic benefit of embryonic stem cell research , but has come up empty handed . 
while the promise of embryonic stem cells is questionable , the promise of adult stem cell research is being realized today . 
recognizing this , the national institutes of health spent $ 568 million in fiscal year 2006 on adult stem cell research . 
the inevitable truth is that if we pass this bill today , the cloning of a human baby will only come sooner . 
there is no room for shades of gray on this issue . 
we should not allow the creation of life for the purpose of destroying it . 
i am committed to funding scientific research that will unlock the origins of disease and develop cures that can help my constituents . 
it is clear that adult stem cell research has opened the door to the dreams of lifesaving treatments and cures for our most deadly and debilitating diseases , but i do not believe it is time to open the door to more embryonic stem cell research and open the floodgates to human cloning . 
mr. speaker , i reserve the balance of my time .

mr. speaker , i reserve the balance of my time . 
mr. speaker , i reserve the balance of my time . 
the embryonic stem cell research we are debating here today is controversial because of the means of obtaining these cells . 
research involving most types of stem cells , those derived from adult tissues or the umbilical cord , is uncontroversial except , as we saw , the second issue here today is , how effective is it ? 
so we sort of have a two-pronged argument here yet : how do you obtain the stem cells and , secondly , the effectiveness of adult versus embryonic stem cells . 
but i think in this whole issue here , we sort of lose questions . 
before we even get to those questions , i think we should look at it and say , what is the ethical consideration of the human nature , and that should be the first question we should ask , not what are the means we obtain it by , what is left over when we obtain the embryonic stem cells , or what is its effectiveness . 
in fact , i believe those ethical issues should really be the first question we should ask before we debate the means of obtaining , or even the effectiveness of the proposed treatment . 
mr. speaker , i reserve the balance of my time . 
mr. speaker , i reserve the balance of my time . 
mr. speaker , i yield myself the balance of my time . 
mr. speaker , there has been a lot of discussion today about the quality of adult stem cells and they are not as versatile as embryonic stem cells . 
there are a number of things that show adult stem cells are highly versatile and just as effective if not more effective than the predicted embryonic stems . 
the list of these studies is as follows : myth : adult stem cells are not as versatile as embryonic stem cells . 
fact : a number of studies show adult stem cells are highly versatile . 
professor alan mackay-sim of griffith university in australia published a study showing that olfactory stem cells could develop into heart cells , liver cells , kidney cells , muscle cells , brain cells and nerve cells . 
douglas losordo at tufts university showed that a type of bone marrow stem cell can turn into most tissue types , and can regenerate damaged heart . 
peter wernet found a type of umbilical cord blood stem cell , they call ussc 's ( unrestricted somatic stem cells ) , that they showed can turn into several different cell types , including brain , bone , cartilage , liver , heart , and blood cells .

school of medicine ( krause ds et al. ; `` multi-organ , multi-lineage engraftment by a single bone marrow-derived stem cell '' ; cell 105 , 369-377 ; 4 may 2001 ) mr. speaker , we have heard a lot of arguments . 
the proponents of h.r. 810 are so adamant that we do research specifically using embryonic stem cells . 
because they are the best hope according to proponents of finding cures . 
the proponents argue we must create life , the embryo , and then destroy the embryo through research to unlock the mysteries of life ; create and clone the building blocks of life so we can manipulate and experiment . 
we heard today about other research with adult stem cells , cord , placenta , bone marrow , fetal tissue , and how about unraveling our dna through the mapping of the genome , all in the pursuit of finding medical cures . 
we have heard all kinds of figures today . 
mr. speaker , it is important that i give voice to the important issue of stem cell research . 
life is precious in all forms , and it is important to do all that we can to ensure issues surrounding life and quality of life are given the highest priority . 
millions of americans suffer from debilitating diseases like juvenile diabetes , parkinson 's disease , alzheimer 's and a host of other diseases that reduce the quality of life or cause loss of life . 
stem cells derived from embryos have shown tremendous promise in the fight to rid society of many of these diseases . 
each day brings a different battle for tambrie ; she must constantly monitor the highs and lows of her condition . 
congressional oversight on this ethically sensitive issue is the right balance to ensure that our nation remains diligent in our approach to medical research , while taking important steps to improve the quality of life for those who suffer from debilitating diseases . 
the bill establishes strict standards for use of fertility clinic embryos . 
first , written permission is required of the couple donating the embryo . 
finally , the legislation requires the national institutes of health to establish strict oversight for the scientific community to ensure ethical guidelines are adhered to . 
embryonic stem cell research is a new form of research in the early stages . 
the adult stem cell research has been very successful compared to embryonic stem cell research , and this success was accomplished without the destruction of human life . 
mr. speaker , i rise today as a cosponsor and strong supporter of h.r. 810 , the stem cell research enhancement act . 
i am pleased that the house leadership brought this important legislation to the floor and am proud to be a part of the important debate occurring today . 
like many other issues facing us today , however , stem cell research forces us to confront the challenge of balancing long-standing ethical questions with the possibilities presented by scientific and technological advancements . 
however , the funding would be limited to `` existing stem cell lines. '' the national institutes of health ( nih ) has established the human embryonic stem cell registry , which lists stem cell lines that are eligible for use in federally funded research . 
scientists are concerned about the quality , longevity , and availability of the eligible stem cell lines . 
that is why i am a cosponsor of h.r. 810 , and strongly support its passage . 
this important legislation increases the number of lines of stem cells that would be eligible to be used in federally funded research . 
they also must have been created for the purpose of fertility treatment , but were in excess of the clinical need . 
mr. speaker , i have listened as member after member has come to the floor to tell a personal tale of a loved one suffering from a disease that , with additional research , stem cells could help cure . 
mr. speaker , i rise in support of this bipartisan bill , and i will submit today 's column in the wall street journal written by dr . 
i would call to the attention of my colleagues this column and particularly a couple of lines that he wrote today . 
i must say that i am one that will be voting for both bills today , the cord bill as well as the castle/degette bill ; but as you compare these two bills , let me note a couple of things that this noted researcher says . 
he says : `` presently , only the few lines established prior to the date , '' this is in reference to the president 's initial plan back in 2001 , `` are eligible for government support , a prohibition that has had a crippling effect on researchers in this emerging field. '' it further says , it relates to the cord bill , in essence : `` it seems extremely unlikely that adult blood cells or blood cells from the umbilical cord will be therapeutically useful as a source of anything else but blood. '' mr. speaker , there are few families that i know that have not been impacted by a myriad of these diseases . 
we need to find a cure , and that is why we need to support both pieces of legislation this afternoon . 
the stem cell debate perhaps themost underrated achievement of the modern conservative movement has been a renewed appreciation for the danger of `` junk science '' -- unsubstantiated scientific research that is exploited for political gain . 
how sad , then , that in the ongoing debate over stem cell research , many conservatives have chosen to abandon their well-founded skepticism and to embrace dubious but convenient data for the sake of advancing their cause . 
if this process of specialization could be achieved in the lab , scientists might be able to create replacement pancreas cells for diabetics , or neurons for patient with parkinson 's disease ; these treatments are likely many years away . 
for some opponents of embryonic stem cell science , the argument is fundamentally one of faith : the human embryo should be held as sacrosanct , and not used for the pursuit of any ends , regardless of how nobly intended . 
the trouble for such dogmatic critics of embryonic stem cell research is that most americans hold a less extreme position ; given a choice between discarding frozen , excess embryos from in vitro fertilization clinics or allowing the cells to be used for medical research -- specifically , the generation of new embryonic stem cell lines -- most of us would choose the second . 
first , the science : opponents of the castle-degette legislation assert that embryonic stem cells are unnecessary because adult stem cells , as well as umbilical cord blood stem cells , will perform at least as well as embryonic stem cells , and have already demonstrated their therapeutic value . 
this argument appears very popular , and has been articulated by almost every member of congress who has spoken out against the new stem cell bill . 
to be sure , one of the great successes of modern medicine has been the use of adult blood stem cells to treat patients with leukemia . 
the trouble is generalizing from this : there are very strong data suggesting that while blood stem cells are good at making new blood cells , they are not able to turn into other types of cells , such as pancreas or brain . 
thus , it seems extremely unlikely that adult bloodcells -- or blood cells from the umbilical cord -- will be therapeutically useful as a source of anything else by blood . 
for true believers , of course , these scientific facts should be beside the point ; if human embryonic stem cell research is morally , fundamentally , wrong , then it should be wrong , period , regardless of the consequences to medical research . 
in the process , conservatives seem to have left their usual concern for junk science at the laboratory door , citing in their defense preliminary studies and questionable data that they would surely -- and appropriately -- have ridiculed were it not supporting their current point of view . 
conservatives often speak of the need to abide by difficult principle ; acknowledging the limitations of adult stem cell research would seem like a good place to start . 
human embryonic stem cell research represents one of the most important scientific frontiers , and also one of the most controversial : our national debate on it deserves to be informed by our loftiest ethical aspirations -- but also grounded in our most rigorous scientific standards . 
mr. speaker , as a cosponsor of the stem cell research enhancement act of 2005 , i believe that stem cell research holds the promise of scientific breakthroughs that could improve the lives of millions of americans . 
this bi-partisan legislation would provide federal funding for a wider range of research while establishing ethical guidelines . 
the most compelling arguments for expanding federal funding for stem cell research can be heard in the heart wrenching stories of individuals suffering from debilitating diseases for which there are currently no cures or treatments . 
while it is too late for the countless americans who have passed away from terrible diseases , it is not too late for the millions of other americans hoping this house will support funding for this potentially life-saving resource . 
we need to ensure that scientists have access to all types of stem cells , both adult and embryonic . 
rather than opening the doors to research , the president 's policy of stopping this work at nih has set the united states back . 
it has meant that researchers who see the promise are leaving the national institutes of health . 
it means the edge that this country has had as a leader of research is now falling behind and we look to other countries who are going to take our place . 
for the sake of those who are suffering , for the sake of what science can bring to us , for the sake of life , i urge the adoption of this legislation . 
i do not think it is a good enough excuse to hold up a clump of cells and say , this we value and this we will protect , and then to look at our friends and our colleagues , people we know and people we do not even know , and tell them their lives we do not value . 
the united states is poised to assume a role of leading the world in this promising field . 
mr. speaker , i commend the chairman of the committee on energy and commerce and his staff , as well as the gentleman from new jersey ( mr. smith ) xz4003801 , for their diligent work on bringing this very , very good bill to the floor of the house . 
what we are going to be voting for here will help create a banking system so that if a patient comes in to see me with a particular illness that is amenable to treatment with stem cells , i can enter their genetic information in a computer , find a match of cord blood that would be kept in a freezer , and actually treat the patient . 
and for those of my colleagues who do not know about sickle cell anemia , sickle cell is a terrible disease . 
we now have 10 , 10 kids that have been cured of sickle cell anemia . 
i was reading the may 19 issue of the new england journal of medicine and , lo and behold , another research article , this one on transplantation of umbilical cord blood in babies with infantile krabbe 's disease , a rare disease , a terrible disease , the babies die ; and this cord blood study shows if you catch it early , you can actually cure these kids . 
i know there have been a number of members coming to the floor talking about the embryonic bill that we are going to take up later ; the embryonic stem cells have never been shown to be successfully useful in a human model . 
we have thousands of people who have been treated with adult stem cells and these cord blood treatments . 
he has implied some of us are against stem cell research . 
they can become all different cell types , and they have shown a tremendous amount of plasticity . 
this poster is of a young lady who was paralyzed for years and had an adult stem cell transplant . 
but i just want to clarify on the cord blood , it has been used to treat leukemia , adrenoleukodystrophy , burkitt 's lymphoma , chronic granulomatous diseases , congenital neutropenia , digeorge 's syndrome , fanconi 's anemia , and these are just some of them , gaucher 's disease . 
i used to see some of those . 
lymphoma ; lymphoproliferative syndrome ; myelofibrosis ; neuroblastoma , which is a form of brain tumor which has been successfully treated with cord blood . 
i think most of the hope and success is in this cord blood . 
mr. speaker , as most of my colleagues know , i practice general internal medicine and i still do it . 
i have treated a lot of patients with diabetes , parkinson 's ; indeed , my father died of complications of diabetes . 
my uncle , his brother , died of complications of parkinson 's disease . 
this body voted years ago , no federal funding for research that involves the destruction of a human embryo . 
and president clinton , towards the tail end of his administration , did an end run around the congressional prohibition , and they were having outside labs destroy the embryos , get the embryonic stem cells and send them over to nih . 
and i sent the president a letter telling him , you are violating the spirit of the law , if not the letter of the law . 
when president bush became president , a lot of us alerted him to this problem , and he came out with his policy . 
he said , we will not allow any more federal funds to be used that involve the killing of human embryos , but we will allow research to proceed on the existing cell lines . 
we have funded this research to the tune of $ 60 million over the last 3 years , embryonic stem cell research , what you are asking for more of . 
the plasticity that some of you extol in these embryonic stem cells make them genetically unstable . 
this was described at the american association of neurological surgeons annual meeting in april of 2002 . 
in 2003 , science-published harvard researchers announced they had achieved a permanent reversal of diabetes in mice . 
we have heard a lot of discussion of the three known forms of stem cell therapies that are hypothesized to treat all these diseases . 
one of the nice things about adult stem cell treatments and why i think they have been embraced , and part of the reason they have been so successful is , if you use a cell from your own body , there are no tissue rejection concerns . 
if you use a cord blood or placental blood stem cell , there are tissue rejection concerns ; but it is felt by the advocates of the gentleman from new jersey ( mr. smith 's ) bill , such as myself , that by obtaining the bank , we would be able to enter all of your genetic information and come up with a match . 
and one of the questions i have for my colleagues who have been an advocate for the castle/degette bill is , how , if these embryonic cells were ever proven to be useful , and that has yet to be demonstrated in the literature , how would you override the tissue rejection concerns ? 
mr. speaker , it takes us to a very important part of this debate that we really have not dwelled on very much . 
they say there are 400 , 000 embryos in the freezers , but the truth is the vast majority of those embryos are wanted , and their own studies suggest only 275 cell lines will be available if this bill becomes law . 
if you are going to go down the road of creating human embryos , you really only have two options . 
you are going to need tens of thousands of women to donate their eggs , or you are going to have to clone . 
no longer using the so-called excess embryos , but either exploiting women for their eggs or worse , we are going down the path of cloning . 
and i assure you , if you find those options objectionable , they will be cloaked with the same kind of arguments that have been used to support this bill . 
people will say it is for the purpose of helping the sick and suffering . 
and what i have been saying over and over again , if you actually read the medical journals , the promise and the potential appear to be in the ethically acceptable alternatives of adult stem research and cord blood research . 
i am cochairman of the congressional diabetes caucus . 
the gentleman from delaware ( mr. castle ) xz4000700 and the gentleman from massachusetts ( mr. langevin ) xz4002300 are very good friends of mine . 
but i can say , mr. speaker , that in the end it comes down to not eliminating any type of research , because that is allowable in this country ; it is whether or not we should use federal funds . 
i consulted with all four of my friends who are medical doctors in this chamber . 
i come down on the side of life . 
embryonic stem cell research is legal in america today , and nothing in the administration 's current policy has affected the legality of this research . 
this is a matter of conscience for millions of americans who are deeply troubled by the idea of their own funds being used to destroy another human life . 
for many of my colleagues , and for me , this is a vote of conscience . 
let the private sector go forward , if it must , with the destruction of embryos for ethically questionable science . 
mr. speaker , i rise today in support of this bill and all of the promise that comes with funding embryonic stem cell research . 
this bill represents an important step forward for the scientific and medical communities in our country , offering hope to the millions of americans who suffer from diseases that stem cell therapies may be able to cure . 
i am appalled that a president who talks so much about embracing a `` culture of life '' would deny funding for a possible cure that could save a child from suffering from juvenile diabetes ; repair a damaged spinal cord to allow a person to walk again ; save a grandparent from the onset of alzheimer 's disease ; or put a halt to the ravages of parkinson 's disease . 
the potential benefits from embryonic stem cell research are almost boundless and would certainly touch the life of a friend or family member of everyone in america . 
mr. bush 's ban on providing federal funds for stem cell research has seriously damaged our nation 's efforts to be a leading voice in the development of this new technology . 
i urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill that will certainly have long-lasting effects in improving the health and well being of millions of americans . 
mr. speaker , i rise in strong support of this stem cell research bill . 
these cells were created with the intention of creating human life , and the only alternate fate for them now is disposal . 
mr. speaker , i rise in strong support of h.r. 2520 , which combines legislation i introduced and passed in the 108th congress to reauthorize the national bone marrow registry with legislation by my colleague from new jersey , mr. smith xz4003801 to authorize a federal investment in building an inventory of 150 , 000 umbilical cord blood units . 
let me thank the chairman of the energy and commerce committee , mr. barton xz4000180 for providing the leadership to advance this important bill . 
his commitment to providing sound national policy in this area of stem cell transplantation has produced an excellent legislative design that will benefit thousands of patients immediately upon enactment . 
i would also like to thank my friend , mr. this legislation builds on the investment made by congress 18 years ago when we established a national bone marrow donor program to save the lives of patients with leukemia and many other blood disorders . 
with this legislation , transplant doctors and patients will have an enhanced , single point of electronic access to the full array of information on possible bone marrow matches , as well as matches with cord blood units from the new national inventory which would be created . 
in a matter of minutes , physicians can review the options and reserve the best possible sources for their patients . 
in addition , the new effort will facilitate accreditation of cord blood banks , stimulate research , and collect and share data on the outcomes of all transplants . 
last month , at the request of our appropriations committee direction , the institute of medicine released its report on cord blood and how the inventory should be built and integrated into the existing national registry . 
through the efforts of the national marrow donor program -- which this congress initiated in 1987 -- many lives have already been saved . 
that means 21 , 000 individuals -- both children and adults who are otherwise suffering from terminal disease -- received the gift of life through this national program . 
when the program first started , our goal was to build a national registry of 250 , 000 individuals willing to donate marrow . 
i am proud to say that as of this month , the national bone marrow registry has more than 5.6 million potential bone marrow donors signed up . 
in addition , the program has an additional 41 , 666 units of umbilical cord blood in reserve for transplant through its network of 15 affiliated cord blood banks throughout the country . 
these are true volunteers in every sense of the word . 
they have given of their time to take a simple blood test to be listed in the national registry . 
for more than 20 , 000 who have been called upon to donate bone marrow , they have undergone a relatively simple surgical procedure to donate their bone marrow to save the life of a man , woman or child with anyone of more than 85 different diseases . 
this legislation will provide the funding to greatly increase the number of cord blood units that can be collected and stored . 
nineteen million dollars has already been appropriated for this purpose over the past two years and this legislation will allow that immediate infusion of funds into building up reserves of umbilical cord blood . 
in addition , by building up the cord blood inventory , the overall resource will be much more likely to meet the needs of patients from genetically diverse , ethnic populations . 
it is estimated that adding 150 , 000 new cord blood units to the number of existing bone marrow donors will provide potential cell matches for about 95 percent of all americans . 
of these , 72 are international facilities . 
having had the great pleasure to meet with hundreds of donors and patients , i can tell you that donating bone marrow or cord blood can be a true life-changing experience . 
the experience of giving life to another human being is beyond mere words . 
the first is a little 10 year old girl who died of leukemia at all children 's hospital in my home district of st . 
donnell thomas -- all who helped perfect the science of marrow transplantation and who assisted us in our legislative quest to establish there have been many members of congress , past and present , who have stood together with me over the years to develop and fund the program that we reauthorize and enhance today . 
we must recognize the staff and members of the board of the national marrow donor program and the marrow foundation who have volunteered their time to establish and grow a finely tuned international registry program . 
joanne kurtzberg , the head transplant doctor at duke university 's blood bank center , is the epitome of a dedicated , caring and highly knowledgeable physician who works hard to save lives . 
we must recognize the pioneering cord blood research of dr . 
claude lenfant , the former director of the national heart , lung and blood institute at nih who initiated the major coblt study on cord blood banking and transplantation . 
the ultimate true heroes of the national effort are the patients and donors . 
and every donor who has rolled up his or her sleeve to sign up for the national bone marrow program , or every family that has decided to donate umbilical cord blood , are heroes for taking part in giving the ultimate gift of life . 
let me thank every member of this house for their support for the efforts we started 18 years ago on behalf of patients everywhere . 
with your support , we will provide hope -- and a second chance at life -- to thousands of patients today and into the future . 
mr. speaker , i rise today in opposition to h.r. 810 , but in strong support of adult stem cell research as it respects life . 
an embryo is a human at its earliest stage of life and deserves the same respect that we give infants , adolescents and adults . 
these are justifications based on definitions of life that are purely arbitrary . 
just as we find it unconscionable and unethical to exploit human life in the name of science during the latter stages of life , neither should we accept the exploitation of human life at its earliest stages . 
instead , we should focus our resources on supporting medical research such as cord blood and adult stem cell research that respect human lives and have an actual track record of creating cures . 
i rise in support of h.r. 2520 , which i really view as a noncontroversial , bipartisan piece of legislation that we should all be able to agree on . 
here we have a piece of legislation dealing with an emerging area of science , but one that has already proven itself to be effective in human application and one that also shows itself to be easily obtained , that is , we either throw away umbilical cords , throw away the umbilical cord and the placenta at the time of birth , or we save the blood that can be captured at that time to make it available such that the stem cells can be taken from that and utilized in this therapeutic fashion . 
we have been laggard in our approach to this particular area of science . 
mr. speaker , just in response to what was said on the floor , this is a statement that has appeared on the floor , and also in print , which says that the bill before us prohibits federal funding used for the destruction of embryos . 
by its very definition , it requires the destruction of embryos when it does the research . 
the process talked about requires the destruction of embryos . 
mr. speaker , i am one of seven children . 
my older brother john is 2 years and 2 days older than i. we grew up together closer than any other members of the family . 
i have learned a lot of things from my brother , but one of the things i learned most of all was there is a difference between right and wrong . 
there is a moral dimension in most of the serious issues that we must face . 
would i like to support embryonic stem cell research without a question of ethics because it might assist my brother ? 
would i like to see embryonic stem cell research in the area of cancer where it might have helped one of my sisters who has had cancer ? 
would i like to see it in terms of research of cancer that plagues 4-year-old children like my nephew ? 
of course . 
but can we divorce all of that from the ethical norm that we must present here ? 
the worst mistakes we have ever made in the history of this nation have been when we have defined a part of the human family as less than fully human and then done things to them that we would not allow done to ourselves . 
the commonality among all of those mistakes , the greatest mistakes in our nation 's history , has been the ease with which we defined members of the human family as less than fully human . 
we are talking about embryonic stem cell research that requires the destruction of the embryo , the destruction of part of the human family . 
we should resolve doubt in favor of life as we do in our criminal justice system , as we do in our civil law system . 
recent advancements in medical technology have created hope for the millions of people , and their families , who suffer from the effects of diseases like alzheimer 's , parkinson 's , and diabetes . 
many of us will have lasting images of president ronald reagan and christopher reeves as their frail bodies deteriorated over the years . 
their personal health battles took on a new meaning as the public debate heated up over the merits and ethics of embryonic stem cell research . 
as we look towards the future of medical research , we must always proceed with strict ethical caution . 
federal funding of embryonic stem cell research would mean that research could advance at a faster pace while providing stringent requirements and oversight of the research . 
however , h.r. 2520 will save lives and improve the quality of life for millions . 
and i know this because it will increase the use of a science that has already been proven . 
as a new member of congress , i am proud to stand before you and lend my support to a positive and productive piece of legislation that will bring sunlight to those who have experienced too many clouds , and it will do so in an unquestionable and ethical manner . 
mr. speaker , as a physician , i know that respected scientists believe that misrepresentations and exaggerated claims in this debate are not only scientifically irresponsible , they are deceptive and cruel to millions of patients and their families who hope desperately for cures . 
many in our society have sincere , heartfelt , passionate , ethical questions , worthy of our respect , regarding the scientific or medical use of embryonic stem cells . 
if our goal is truly to cure diseases and help patients , science tells us that today the use of adult and cord stem cells has successfully treated or holds real potential for treating nearly 60 diseases . 
the same can not be said for embryonic stem cells , and adult stem cells carry none of the ethical questions or dilemma of embryonic stem cells . 
if we do , we will recognize that stem cell research and treatment of disease should actively proceed with those adult and cord stem cells that are providing and will increasingly provide excellent and exciting cures for patients in need . 
mr. speaker , as a physician i 'm certain of one thing : science is not republican or democrat , science is not conservative or liberal . 
decisions in science should be based on the scientific method -- a standardized method of evaluation and implementation of a solution or treatment of a disease . 
when followed , it allows for the greatest amount of critical thinking about any issue . 
if not followed in a legislative body , then decisions tend to be made based upon who has the largest group of supporters or greatest passion and emotion . 
there has been significant misrepresentation of science today and in this debate , because `` science is not a policy or a political program . 
made regarding the purported medical applications of embryonic stem cells reach far beyond any credible evidence , ignoring the limited state of our knowledge about embryonic stem cells and the advances in other areas of research that may render use of these cells unnecessary for many applications . 
to make such exaggerated claims , at this stage of our knowledge , is not only scientifically irresponsible -- it is deceptive and cruel to millions of patients and their families who hope desperately for cures and have come to rely on the scientific community for accurate information . 
non-embryonic stem cells '' on the other hand have a history `` very different from that of embryonic stem cells. '' cord and adult stem cells are `` producing undoubted clinical benefits and ... .. 
receive any particular amount of federal funding , regardless of future evidence or the usual scientific peer review process -- is ... .. 
it is , in fact , a subordination of science to ideology . 
`` because politicians , biotechnology interests and even some scientists have publicly exaggerated the `` promise '' of embryonic stem cells , public perceptions of this avenue have become skewed and unrealistic . 
when desperate patients discover that they have been subjected to a salesman 's pitch rather than an objective and candid assessment of possibilities , we have reason to fear public backlash against the credibility of our profession . 
it seems to me that there is one unmistakable fact : many in our society have sincere , heartfelt , passionate , ethical questions , worthy of our respect , regarding the scientific or medical use of es cells . 
if our goal is truly to cure diseases and help patients , science tells us that today the use of adult and cord stem cells has successfully treated or holds real potential for treating nearly 60 diseases . 
and adult stem cells carry none of the ethical questions or dilemma of es cells . 
if we do , we will recognize that stem cell research and treatment of disease should actively proceed with those adult and cord stem cells that are providing and will increasingly provide excellent and exciting cures for patients in need . 
dear senator kerry : recently you have made the promotion of embryonic stem cell research , including the cloning of human embryos for research purposes , into a centerpiece of your campaign . 
when scientists make such assertions , they are acting as individuals , out of their own personal faith and hopes , not as the voice of `` science '' . 
if such scientists allow their individual faith in the future of embryonic stem cell research to be interpreted as a reliable prediction of the outcome of this research , they are acting irresponsibly . 
second , it is no mere `` ideology '' to be concerned about the possible misuse of humans in scientific research . 
federal bioethics advisory groups , serving under both democratic and republican presidents , have affirmed that the human embryo is a developing form of human life that deserves respect . 
indeed you have said that human life begins at conception , that fertilization produces a `` human being. '' to equate concern for these beings with mere `` ideology '' is to dismiss the entire history of efforts to protect human subjects from research abuse . 
third , the statements you have made regarding the purported medical applications of embryonic stem cells reach far beyond any credible evidence , ignoring the limited state of our knowledge about embryonic stem cells and the advances in other areas of research that may render use of these cells unnecessary for many applications . 
to make such exaggerated claims , at this stage of our knowledge , is not only scientifically irresponsible -- it is deceptive and cruel to millions of patients and their families who hope desperately for cures and have come to rely on the scientific community for accurate information . 
they proliferate rapidly and are extremely versatile , ultimately capable ( in an embryonic environment ) of forming any kind of cell found in the developed human body . 
yet there is scant scientific evidence that embryonic stem cells will form normal tissues in a culture dish , and the very versatility of these cells is now known to be a disadvantage as well -- embryonic stem cells are difficult to develop into a stable cell line , spontaneously accumulate genetic abnormalities in culture , and are prone to uncontrollable growth and tumor formation when placed in almost 25 years of research using mouse embryonic stem cells have produced limited indications of clinical benefit in some animals , as well as indications of serious and potentially lethal side-effects . 
based on this evidence , claims of a safe and reliable treatment for any disease in humans are premature at best . 
embryonic stem cells obtained by destroying cloned human embryos pose an additional ethical issue -- that of creating human lives solely to destroy them for research -- and may pose added practical problems as well . 
the cloning process is now known to produce many problems of chaotic gene expression , and this may affect the usefulness and safety of these cells . 
nor is it proven that cloning will prevent all rejection of embryonic stem cells , as even genetically matched stem cells from cloning are sometimes rejected by animal hosts . 
here the trajectory has been very different from that of embryonic stem cells : instead of developing these cells and deducing that they may someday have a clinical use , researchers have discovered them producing undoubted clinical benefits and then sought to better understand how and why they work so they can be put to more uses . 
bone marrow transplants were benefiting patients with various forms of cancer for many years before it was understood that the active ingredients in these transplants are stem cells . 
non-embryonic stem cells have been discovered in many unexpected tissues -- in blood , nerve , fat , skin , muscle , umbilical cord blood , placenta , even dental pulp -- and dozens of studies indicate that they are far more versatile than once thought . 
use of these cells poses no serious ethical problem , and may avoid all problems of tissue rejection if stem cells can be obtained from a patient for use in that same patient . 
clinical use of non-embryonic stem cells has grown greatly in recent in the case of many conditions , advances are likely to come from sources other than any kind of stem cell . 
therefore , to turn this one approach into a political campaign -- even more , to declare that it will be a `` top priority '' or receive any particular amount of federal funding , regardless of future evidence or the usual scientific peer review process -- is , in our view , irresponsible . 
it is , in fact , a subordination of science to ideology . 
because politicians , biotechnology interests and even some scientists have publicly exaggerated the `` promise '' of embryonic stem cells , public perceptions of this avenue have become skewed and unrealistic . 
politicians may hope to benefit from these false hopes to win elections , knowing that the collision of these hopes with reality will come only after they win their races . 
when desperate patients discover that they have been subjected to a salesman 's pitch rather than an objective and candid assessment of possibilities , we have reason to fear a public backlash against the credibility of our professions .

proponents of embryonic stem cell research are certainly aware of these problems , and that is why they view h.r. 810 as a stepping stone to human cloning . 
for example , heart disease , the number one cause of death in the united states , coronary artery disease , has been successfully treated with adult stem cell therapies ; and there have been 10 clinical trials that have been completed in human patients using bone marrow-derived adult stem cells to treat heart attack patients , damaged hearts . 
and in one trial , patients who were bedridden , not able to walk , were found to be jogging on the beach or climbing eight flights of stairs after successful treatment . 
mr. speaker , i have been a physician for 41 years ; and like my good colleagues who will not be supporting this bill , i would expect we could tell the members stories of all the blood and gore and problems that we have waded through in those years and done our very best . 
stem cell research , especially embryonic stem cell research , is going to go on apace very rapidly in all parts of the world , whether it is singapore or korea or japan or china or the united kingdom or canada , other places on continental europe . 
we have the finest universities in the world , the finest researchers , the ability to bring stem cell research to a point where we will , indeed , have cures for everyday problems such as diabetes , such as parkinson 's , such as alzheimer 's , and perhaps even being able to create neuronal cells to take care of people who have spinal cord injuries . 
can there be any doubt that the potential of relieving widespread suffering with embryonic stem cells is morally superior to simply destroying the excess embryos ? 
how can we call ourselves a culture of life when we ignore the living , when we ignore the infinite potential of embryonic stem cells ? 
like millions of american families , my own has been impacted by the loss of loved ones with debilitating diseases . 
my grandmother , alvana carpenter , died of cancer , and my first cousin betty stolz , to ms . 
that is one of the reasons i have joined this unparalleled and growing bipartisan coalition to cosponsor h.r. 810 , along with over 200 democrats and republicans in this house . 
people from the show me state were polled not too long ago , and three-fourths of them were in support of this research continuing . 
just like polls around the country , when nancy reagan called to lift the bush administration ban on this research in 2004 , three-fourths of americans have come to the support of this cause . 
since its isolation of the embryonic stem cell in 1998 , research has made dramatic progress in the u.s. we can not and we must not abandon our leadership role in the scientific community and in establishing strong ethical standards for this research , which are incorporated in this bill . 
i also became involved in this debate because of the extraordinary citizens that have come to advocate on its behalf , advocates like bernie frank , an accomplished st . 
mr. speaker , the promise of stem cell research is real . 
science , not politics , should determine the future of this vital research . 
we stand here with the tools in our hands to ease the pain and suffering of so many across the country and around the world . 
mr. speaker , in missouri 's 5th district there are two individuals , jim and virginia stowers , who did not seek a federal grant , but who used $ 2 billion of their own money to begin some very vital research . 
and so , mr. speaker , this nation has a wonderful opportunity right now to respond to the needs and the interests of its people . 
one fell out of the bed in the middle of the morning , and when the parents went in to see him and asked what happened , he said , as he looked up to the bed , i think i was sleeping too close to where i got in . 
but i told her , i am in favor of stem cell research , research that uses stem cells from cord blood and adult stem cell sources , research that is already showing great medical promise and avoids the ethically divisive issue of the destruction of an unborn human embryo , an unborn human person . 
mr. speaker , let us set a new standard , one that aggressively promotes good research to help the sick and injured , one that respects the consciences of tens of millions of americans who do not wish to see their tax dollars used in the destruction of unborn human life , one that supports a consistent life ethic and gives true hope to those who are suffering in our communities . 
mr. speaker , i rise in strong support of h.r. 810 , to provide for human embryonic stem cell research . 
the measure is a crucial first step toward helping millions of people who suffer today from diseases that are currently without treatment . 
according to the national institutes of health , this work may one day be used in gene therapy and to overcome immune rejection . 
heart disease , alzheimer 's , krabbe disease and stroke are just a few of the maladies that this research could help to treat and eventually cure . 
my region in western new york has a number of great research institutes that boast a rich history of tackling devastating health afflictions . 
rpci 's center for pharmacology and therapeutics is one of few in the nation capable of all phases of drug development , from the conceptual stage through manufacturing and testing . 
the institute has sponsored or collaborated on more than 350 clinical trials of promising new cancer treatments and its developing cancer genetics program will rival the world 's leading programs in that field . 
the institute has also made significant contributions to the landmark human genome project , and its new center for genetics and pharmacology will adjoin the university at buffalo 's center of excellence in bioinformatics and life sciences and the new 72 , 000 sq . 
western new york has made a commitment to curing disease , caring for the sick and preventing the needless loss of life wherever possible . 
our innovative institutes , led by some of the best researchers in the world , can make an immeasurable difference in people 's lives . 
mr. speaker , as stewards of hard-working americans ' tax dollars , we can not ask our constituents to fund the killing of human embryos . 
like the rest of my colleagues joining me today , i am strongly in support of scientific research to save and improve human life . 
while stem cell research has never been prohibited in the private sector , president bush permitted the usage of embryonic stem cell lines sufficient for extensive government-funded research nearly 4 years ago . 
the private sector has proven the superiority and promise of cord blood in adult stem cell research by choosing to fund those areas . 
mr. speaker , we do have the power of the purse , and we can not misuse it by funding the slaughter of human life . 
the embryonic stem cell research in this bill destroys human life , and i believe that we as the american people should not destroy human life with american taxpayers ' dollars , not even in the name of research . 
mr. speaker , i rise in support of h.r. 810 . 
mr. speaker , i rise today to speak on behalf of h.r. 810 , the stem cell research enhancement act of 2005 . 
today there have been bills presented that discuss , among other things , the merits of embryonic stem cell study versus cord blood cell utilization . 
this discussion , while interesting , misses the point of promoting stem cell research in general : scientific breakthroughs that may originate from stem cell examination have the power to better , and even save the lives of our fellow citizens afflicted with terrible diseases . 
stem cell research holds out hope for those suffering with , for example , diabetes , parkinson 's , and coronary heart disease , the number one killer of adults in this country . 
moreover , the stem cell research enhancement act promotes the establishment of ethical standards with regard to the procurement of embryos utilized in the research . 
the only embryos that can be utilized are ones that were originally created for fertility treatment purposes and are in excess of clinical need . 
the development of standards , both ethical and clinical , is an important aspect of stem cell research . 
this bill directs that the national institutes of health develop guidelines to insure that researchers adhere to the highest possible principles in scientific inquiry . 
by encouraging scientific breakthroughs while at the same time observing the highest possible standards of ethical and clinical behavior , we can go a long way towards battling genetically-based diseases that have ended the lives of so many . 
thank you mr. speaker , and i yield back the balance of my time . 
mr. speaker , on the birthday of my daughter , katy , who was born 8-10 weeks prematurely , but still lives and blesses my life . 
we , everyone of us in this body , want that . 
it is being said that no one will be harmed by the use or destruction of human embryos that were going to be waste anyway . 
dear friends , when you use the product of the callous mistreatment of life , even though you use sterilized gloves , you nonetheless are an accomplice after the fact in encouraging future such destruction and mistreatment -- even though you have the very very best of intentions . 
i thought i was just helping. '' in the recent past , we lost a great american who had been injured in an accident and who encouraged the use of embryonic stem cells . 
that man had a heart as big as all outdoors and is an inspiration to so very many of us . 
his strength and courage and perseverance in the face of unsurmountable odds should be an encouragement for all who face adversity . 
he is quoted as saying something that others have said , but as a justification for embryonic stem cell usage -- basically that we should be about doing the greatest good for the greatest number of people . 
it is worth noting that if a society only did what was the greatest good for the greatest number of people , that society would kill off the elderly who were no longer productive and kill off the young who were not likely to ever be very productive . 
to demand money from american taxpayers so that we as a congress can encourage the destructive use of life under the guise that it may be thrown away anyway , is not a direction that this america should go . 
our history has been that , rather than destroying life , we go to all kinds of extremes to save it . 
if a child is in a deep hole , america sends all the resources it has to try to save it regardless of cost . 
it is extremely offensive that some would come forward and say basically that in the name of religion , christian and jewish groups support the federal government 's certain destruction of embryos under the possibility that at some point it somehow may lead to possibly saving a life or lives . 
if we are going to invoke the thought of , as our forefathers ' put it , our creator , then let 's at least invoke our creator 's unwavering honesty . 
private pharmaceutical and health care industries would be in pursuit knowing that if they find a cure , they will be the most profitable company on the face of the earth . 
it is people wanting grants that will be torn from the pockets of taxpayers against the will of perhaps half of them or more ( polling data from those with an agenda is not all that trustworthy ) and putting it into someone else 's pocket in the name of destroying embryos . 
embryonic stem cell research can go on and has gone on with billions of dollars from some states and from some private money . 
what many of us are saying about this legislation is , if it is so promising , you go raise the capital privately by buying stock to use in embryonic stem cell research , and let our tax dollars go to the stem cell research that seeks to both save and make lives better . 
i know this is a matter of conscience , and i do so know and believe in the integrity and great intentions of many of those who disagree , but please do not take my tax dollars for money to destroy life . 
let those who feel so compelled , spend your own , but i would hope even then you would spend your own money on the lines with the most promise and not take life in the name of helping life . 
mr. speaker , i rise today in support of h.r. 2520 , as well as the stem cell research enhancement act , as both bills are part of today 's larger debate on stem cell research and the hope being offered with them . 
as samuel smiles said , `` hope is the companion of power and the mother of success ; for who so hopes has within him the gift of miracles. '' that is what today 's debate is about , because at its core , stem cell research is about the idea of hope and miracles , a hope which has become quite personal for me . 
as you know , my husband bob , who worked with all of you for so many years , suffered from a rare bone marrow disorder . 
but i feel strongly that the effects of federal dollars and involvement in stem cell research will make an unquestionable difference . 
our country has been a leader in so many areas of medicine . 
by doing so , we will not only diminish the contributions of americans , but also our ability to shape and impact the ethical debate . 
both bills are an important step in harnessing the power of optimism . 
the vote i missed was on agreeing to the watt of north carolina substitute amendment . 
mr. speaker , the constitutional amendment to ban the desecration of the american flag has become a ritual here in congress . 
since i started in the house of representatives this issue has come to the floor every congress . 
while i do understand the outrage that most of us feel towards those who make their points by trampling on our flag , the proposed constitutional amendment is unnecessary and counterproductive . 
on a serious note , we should not make changes to the bill of rights to deal with specific circumstances every time we are offended . 
no amount of rhetoric about flag burning will hide our failure to spotlight how congress is missing the point . 
this is not about free speech or the ability of our citizens to express displeasure at the actions of government . 
the supreme court was right in their rulings to prohibit the shouting of `` fire '' in a crowded theater ; and , equally , the supreme court was wrong to permit flag-burning . 
the burning of the flag is conduct that congress is justified in regulating , and that is what we are doing in this legislation . 
the stars and stripes is a powerful symbol of our nation and the ideals that we as a people hold dear : the freedom of american citizens , the courage of those who have defended it , and the resolve of our people to protect liberty and justice for all from enemies from within and from without . 
this symbol of liberty is so powerful that congress should have the right to prohibit its willful and purposeful desecration . 
it is not a piece of cloth that rose from the ashes of the fallen twin towers or that was draped from the pentagon in the aftermath of september 11 . 
after that day , the flag suddenly seemed to appear everywhere , overnight , across this land , any size of fabric , even those made by schoolchildren from construction paper , i suppose , flags stuck in flowerpots , pinned on lapels , decals posted on the back windows of our automobiles and trucks . 
across the river from here is a memorial to the valiant efforts of our marines to raise that flag on iwo jima . 
it was not just a piece of cloth that appeared in the sky on that day so many years ago , just as it is not a piece of cloth that francis scott key saw over baltimore harbor centuries ago . 
the flag was the physical embodiment of all we as americans cherish : the triumph of liberty over totalitarianism , the freedoms we enjoy ; our rights the government has an obligation to protect ; and the duty we have to pass the torch of liberty to our children undimmed . 
i urge the adoption of this constitutional amendment to protect the flag . 
mr. speaker , i rise in strong support of h. j. res. 10 , the flag protection amendment , and i would like to thank the distinguished gentleman from california ( mr. cunningham ) xz4000910 for his efforts to protect our country 's most sacred symbol , the american flag . 
i would also like to very briefly just address some of the allegations , particularly the one about not having hearings . 
as has been stated , we have had a number of hearings on this in the past . 
i would also invite those who might be following this debate to listen to where the inflammatory rhetoric , which side it comes from , allegations thrown against us that this is a crass exploitation of the flag when we have not done this , that , or the other thing . 
i think those of us on this side tend to want to keep this debate on a very civil level and i would encourage my colleagues to do that . 
since this country 's creation , nothing has represented the united states of america as honorably as has the american flag . 
from the top of this very capitol building to porches all across our country , the flag is synonymous with the principles on which this country was founded and the principles on which we still stand . 
each day it serves as a source of comfort and strength and holds the promise of a better future for all americans . 
since 1994 , and i want to emphasize this , there have been 119 incidents of such flag desecration , ones like the one that our distinguished chairman just indicated where somebody literally defecated on the flag . 
despite the will of both the federal and state governments to protect the flag from such abuse , the supreme court has struck down these efforts to protect our most sacred symbol and instead has protected these un-american acts . 
many of us believe very strongly in this . 
i also want to commend the gentleman from florida ( mr. hastings ) xz4001702 , the minority member of the committee on rules , for conducting such a dispositive examination of the rule and the substance of the measure that is before us today . 
today 's consideration of house joint resolution 10 will show whether we have the strength to remain true to our forefathers ' constitutional ideals and defend our citizens ' right to express themselves , even if we vehemently disagree with their method of expression . 
very few americans favor burning the flag as an expression of free speech . 
i personally deplore the desecration of the flag in any form , but i still remain strongly opposed to this resolution because this resolution goes against the ideals that the flag represents and elevates a symbol of freedom over freedom itself . 
if adopted , this resolution would represent for the first time in our nation 's history that the people 's representatives in this body voted to alter the bill of rights to limit the freedom of speech . 
while some may say that this resolution is not the end of our first amendment liberties , it is my fear that it may be the beginning . 
by limiting the scope of the first amendment 's free speech protections , we are setting a most dangerous precedent . 
once we decide to limit freedom of speech , limitations on freedom of the press and freedom of religion may not be far behind . 
it has been said that the true test of any nation 's commitment to freedom of expression lies in its ability to protect unpopular expression , such as flag desecration . 
in effect , we will be glorifying fringe elements who disrespect the flag and what it stands for while denigrating the constitution itself , the vision of madison and jefferson . 
concern about the tyranny of the majority led the framers to create an independent judiciary free of political pressure to ensure that the legislative and executive branches would honor the bill of rights . 
a constitutional amendment banning flag desecration flies in the very face of this carefully balanced structure . 
the fact that the congress would consider the first-ever amendment to the bill of rights without so much as a hearing in this congress makes this all the more objectionable . 
and , unfortunately , there is no better illustration of madison 's concern than the proposed flag desecration amendment . 
almost as significant as the damage this resolution would do to our own constitution is the harm it will inflict in our international standing in the area of human rights . 
mr. speaker , demonstrators who ripped apart communist flags before the fall of the iron curtain committed crimes against their country 's laws , yet freedom-loving americans applauded their brave actions . 
yet if we pass this action , we will be aligning ourselves with those autocratic regimes , such as in the former soviet union and iran , and diminish our own moral stature as a protector of freedom in all of its forms . 
those who oppose this amendment to the constitution prohibiting the physical desecration of the flag express the sentiment of many americans . 
in may 2005 , just last month , a majority of americans opposed such an amendment by 63 percent to 35 percent because of its first amendment restrictions . 
veterans for common sense and veterans defending the bill of rights , two organizations , do not want to see the first amendment unraveled and a desecration of what the flag represents . 
we do not consecrate the flag by punishing its desecration , for in doing so we dilute the freedom that this cherished emblem represents. '' i urge my colleagues to maintain the constitutional ideal of freedom and reject this resolution . 
mr. speaker , i reserve the balance of my time . 
mr. speaker , i stand before you today in strong and wavering support of the flag protection amendment . 
i 'm proud to be an original cosponsor of this important measure . 
our flag is more than just a piece of cloth . 
from lexington to gettysburg to falluja , more than a million brave americans have given their lives in defense of our flag and the american ideals it represents . 
we must honor their ultimate sacrifice , and the sacrifices made by the almost 60 , 000 veterans in my home state of wyoming , by defending our flag with the courage and resolve they proved possible . 
the flag protection amendment will protect from desecration the most widely recognized symbol of freedom and democracy worldwide , one that offers hope and comfort to the students and teachers , lawmakers , and military men and women who pledge allegiance to the flag every day across the nation . 
with that , i strongly urge final passage of the flag protection amendment . 
mr. speaker , 200 years of tradition was wiped out 16 years ago . 
i want to tell my friends on the other side of the aisle , some will oppose this amendment . 
but i would tell the gentleman that as of may , 81 percent of the american people oppose their arguments and their views . 
all of the veterans organizations , and my colleague mentioned the veterans organizations are opposed to this . 
this is from the citizen 's flag alliance and list all of the veterans organizations that support this amendment , and i include that list for the record .

i would ask those individuals , if they still try this trickster debate , which of those items would you place on the casket of one of our fallen soldiers ; it is not the american flag . 
in my district we had a group of hispanics that were protesting over a bill that we passed on this floor years ago and it was on bilingual education , english first . 
they also pointed out that more hispanics per capita have won the medal of honor and they support this flag and this country proudly . 
i have another friend who was a prisoner of war for 6 1/2 years . 
it took him 5 years to knit an american flag on the inside of his shirt when he was held prisoner in vietnam . 
he would display this flag at his meetings until the guards broke in one day and brutally beat the prisoner of war , ripped the flag to shreds in the middle of the floor , drug the prisoner out of the cell , beat him unconscious . 
that broken body prisoner of war had drug himself to the center of the floor and started gathering those pieces of thread so he could knit another american flag . 
this value is part of our tradition and was part of our tradition for 200 years , and that is what the gentleman from wisconsin ( mr. sensenbrenner ) xz4003650 and the 300 members who will support this amendment today are saying to my colleagues that are opposed to this . 
but when the majority of the american people support it , we will vote with it . 
mr. speaker , i am a little ashamed to confess my mother is around the age of the gentleman from north carolina ( mr. watt ) xz4004240 . 
my mother used to tell me stories when she was a young woman in the segregated south that she would drive through parts of rural and western alabama and that she would see crosses burned . 
my grandmother used to tell me stories that after brown v. board of education , she remembers riding through parts of rural alabama and seeing crosses burned . 
the interesting thing about that is the burning of those crosses did not keep a single black child out of a public school . 
the burning of those crosses , frankly , did nothing to slow down the march of justice in this country over the 40-or-so years i have been around . 
and here we stand 15 years later in a country that is still deeply patriotic , a country that is still full of love of americans toward each other . 
frankly , i would submit in this last 4 or 5 years we have seen a rising tide of patriotism . 
i wish advocates of this amendment understood we have won this battle . 
those of us who believe in this country , those of us who believe in its decency , and those of us who believe in its power , we have won . 
they are not a legitimate part of our political debate . 
they are not acceptable viewpoints to most of us . 
i wish we understood that every time we think about saying that one kind of speech is so obnoxious or so offensive that we ought to get rid of it , every time we even let ourselves think that , we would be so much better off if we trust in our better angels , because the best angels in our nature tell us that flag burners are wrong . 
it is because we have been strong enough and powerful enough and our values have been deep enough to withstand even the worst of ideas . 
i rise in strong opposition to the watt substitute and in support of h. j. res. 10 , which would amend the constitution to give congress the authority to prevent the physical desecration of the american flag . 
the gentleman from north carolina ( mr. watt ) xz4004240 says that the bill of rights has never been amended . 
it may be that the words have never been changed , but the united states supreme court on many , many , many occasions has amended the first amendment and other provisions in the bill of rights by changing the meaning of those words . 
this is one of those such occasions . 
for 200 years , many supreme court justices opined that flag desecration laws which were in effect in 49 states were not in violation of the first amendment of the constitution . 
this is in defiance of the will of the overwhelming majority of the american people , the will of the overwhelming majority of the state legislatures , and as we will see later today , the will of the overwhelming majority of the united states congress . 
clearly , free speech goes beyond the written or spoken word to include other forms of expression , including the wearing of symbols and other actions . 
in 1989 , the united states supreme court in texas v. johnson unilaterally invalidated flag protection laws in 48 states and the district of columbia , overturning 100 years of federal and state precedent , banning the physical desecration of the american flag . 
when that occurs , and when the people and the congress believe that is wrong , it is a constitutional amendment that corrects the error of the supreme court . 
the physical desecration of the american flag constitutes an assault on the most deeply shared experiences of the american people . 
our flag is more than a piece of cloth ; it a symbol of our freedom . 
it represents the sacrifices of those who gave their lives to win and preserve freedom . 
there have been those who have gone unarmed into battle carrying the flag , and many have died to keep the flag from falling into the hands of our enemies . 
to burn a flag in front of a veteran or someone else who has put his or her life on the line for their country is an act not deserving protection . 
our nation is unique in the world because our citizens represent a variety of heritages , religions , ethnicities , and political viewpoints . 
for over 200 years , our flag has flown proudly over our nation , a visible promise of our commitment to the preservation and expansion of democracy . 
we must act now to protect one of our nation 's most sacred symbols because the supreme court has struck down congress ' effort to protect the flag by statute . 
supreme court justices as varied as william rehnquist , warren burger , and hugo black have all recognized the appropriateness of these desecration statutes that were struck down by the court . 
of course , words or other forms of expression do not have to be correct in order to be protected . 
and clearly , free speech goes beyond the written or spoken word to include other forms of expression , including the wearing of symbols and other actions . 
`` i believe that the states and federal government do have the power to protect the flag from acts of desecration and disgrace , '' wrote former chief justice earl warren . 
this view is shared by many past and present justices of the u.s. supreme court across the ideological spectrum , including hugo black , abe fortas , byron white , john paul stevens , sandra day o'connor and current chief justice william rehnquist . 
`` surely one of the high purposes of a democratic society , '' wrote rehnquist , `` is to legislate against conduct that is regarded as evil and profoundly offensive to the majority of people whether it be murder , embezzlement , pollution or flag burning. '' free speech is n't the right to do anything you want to do anytime you want to do it . 
rather , it 's a precious liberty founded in law -- a freedom preserved by respect for the rights of others . 
to say that society is n't entitled to establish rules of behavior governing its members is either to abandon any meaningful definition of civilization or to believe that civilization can survive without regard to the feelings or decent treatment of others . 
to burn a flag in front of a veteran or someone else who has put his or her life on the line for their country is a despicable act not deserving protection . 
it 's well-established that certain types of speech may be prevented under some circumstances , including lewd , obscene , profane , libelous , insulting or fighting words . 
it simply corrects a misguided court interpretation of that amendment . 
as justice rehnquist eloquently observed in concluding his dissent : `` uncritical extension of constitutional protection to the burning of the flag risks the frustration of the very purpose for which organized governments are instituted ... .. 
the government may conscript men into the armed forces where they must fight and perhaps die for the flag , but the government may not prohibit the public burning of the banner under which they fight. '' i am proud to play a part in trying to right that wrong . 
i rise in support and as a cosponsor of h. j. res. 10 , an amendment to the constitution authorizing the congress to prohibit the physical desecration of the united states flag . 
our flag represents our country as a symbol of our nation and our veterans bravery throughout history . 
while i am a strong supporter of the first amendment rights to freedom of speech and expression , hallowed symbols like the flag deserve to be respected and protected . 
those who desecrate our flag undermine that powerful symbol that really unites millions of americans , both alive and those who have died trying to defend our nation . 
we have the right to protest and object to the policies of this administration or any other . 
at the start of the town hall meeting i host in my district , i always try take a few moments to lead those in attendance in the pledge of allegiance . 
i think this is an important and valuable portion of my town hall meetings when i can express my support for and share my deep respect of both our flag and our system of government-which our flag represents . 
what makes america a great and free society , is our system of government and our constitution . 
for over two centuries , the constitution -- the greatest invention of humans -- has allowed our diverse people to live together , to balance our various interests , and to thrive . 
the constitution does n't fly majestically in front of government buildings . 
yet , it is the source of our freedom . 
it secures the right and means of voting . 
as a member of congress , i took an oath of office in which i swore `` ... .. 
that i will support and defend the constitution of the united states. '' in fact , new citizens to our great nation make a similar pledge when they are sworn in as u.s. citizens . 
it is important to note that i am entrusted with the obligation to defend the constitution , not the symbols , of our nation . 
the founders knew that it is our system of government that is essential to who were are as a people and what we stand for . 
while i deeply value the flag as a symbol of our nation , what we need to ensure is that we protect the values and ideals of our country as contained within the constitution . 
with the exception of the eighteenth amendment , which was later repealed , these amendments have reaffirmed and expanded individual freedoms and the specific mechanisms that allow our self-government to function . 
this resolution before us today would not perfect the operation of our self-government . 
proponents of this constitutional amendment argue that we need to respect our flag . 
i believe that the vast majority of americans already respect our flag , and i am unaware of a flag burning epidemic in america . 
to me this resolution is a solution in search of a problem . 
what we should do , as a government and as american citizens , is promote civic values and a greater understanding of our democracy . 
people who value and understand the ideals of our country will also understand and value the symbols of our great nation . 
the issue before us is whether our constitution should be amended so that the federal government can prosecute the handful of americans who show disrespect for the flag . 
to quote james madison , is this a `` great and extraordinary occasion '' justifying the use of a constitutional amendment ? 
i oppose this amendment because i believe that while attempting to preserve the symbol of the freedoms we enjoy in this country , it actually would harm the values and ideals that created of these freedoms . 
mr. speaker , i rise today in opposition to h. j. res. 10 , the proposed constitutional amendment to prohibit the physical desecration of our flag . 
and , in this respect , i take no pleasure in doing so : like the vast majority of americans , i too condemn those malcontents who would desecrate our flag -- a universal symbol for democracy , freedom and liberty -- to grab attention for themselves and inflame the passions of patriotic americans . 
further , i fully appreciate and respect the motivations of those who offer and support this amendment , particularly the patriotic men and women who so faithfully served this nation in our armed services and in other capacities . 
however , i respectfully disagree with them and will oppose this amendment for the reasons so eloquently articulated by senator mitch mcconnell of kentucky . 
in opposing a similar amendment a few years ago , senator mcconnell stated that it `` rips the fabric of our constitution at its very center : the first amendment. '' he added , `` our respect and reverence for the flag should not provoke us to damage our constitution , even in the name of patriotism. '' those of us who oppose this amendment do so not to countenance the actions of a few , but because we believe the question before us today is how we the united states of america -- are to deal with individuals who dishonor our nation in this manner . 
we can imagine no more appropriate response to burning a flag than waving one 's own. '' furthermore , it troubles me that this amendment , if approved , would ensconce the vile actions of a few provocateurs into the very document that guarantees freedom of speech , freedom of religion , freedom of the press , freedom of assembly , and freedom to petition the government . 
that document , of course , is our constitution . 
in more than 200 years , our constitution has been amended only 27 times , and nearly all of those amendments guarantee or expand rights , liberties and freedoms . 
i simply do not believe that our traditions , our values , our democratic principles -- all embodied in our constitution and the bill of rights -- should be overridden to prohibit this particular manner of speech , even though i completely disagree with it . 
i remind my colleagues that if we approve this amendment , we put our great nation in the company of the oppressive regimes in china , iran , and cuba -- all of whom have similar laws protecting their flags . 
needless to say , when it comes to free speech , the united states of america is the world 's leader . 
our flag is far more than a piece of cloth , a few stripes , 50 stars . 
the inflammatory actions of a few misfits can not extinguish those ideals . 
and i submit that a constitutional amendment to restrict speech -- even speech such as this -- is the surest way to stoke the embers of those who will push for even more restrictions . 
mr. speaker , i rise to join in this serious debate over the first amendment and our nation 's flag , two of the most sacred institutions to this country . 
perhaps because we come from so many different backgrounds , cultural traditions , and ethnicities , we see the flag as a source of national unity . 
like the majority of americans , i have the utmost respect and reverence for our flag . 
for all of us , this reverence begins early on , when as school children we are taught the pledge of allegiance and recite it each day with our classmates . 
the times i have been most proud of my country have been during my two trips to iraq . 
mr. speaker , i believe one of our greatest freedoms is freedom of speech . 
our forefathers , in their wisdom , made this the first amendment to the bill of rights . 
in deference to our forefathers and out of respect for the brave patriots today who are serving overseas , i can not in good conscience support this amendment . 
i would like to close by quoting a man who knows much of patriotism and freedom . 
former soldier and secretary of state colin powell , when asked for his views on this issue , said , `` the first amendment exists to ensure that freedom of speech and expression applies not just to that with which we agree or disagree , but also that which we find outrageous . 
i would not amend that great shield of democracy to hammer a few miscreants . 
mr. speaker , today , i rise in opposition to h. j. res. 10 , proposing an amendment to the constitution of the united states authorizing congress to prohibit the physical desecration of the flag of the united states . 
as a combat veteran of the vietnam war , i know well the sacrifices that have been made by many generations of americans to protect our freedom . 
it is a symbol of our freedom . 
i am immensely gratified when i see all the flags flying in the face of terrorist attacks and in support of our troops fighting overseas . 
however , i am not at all comfortable with changing the bill of rights that guarantees our freedoms . 
the bill of rights guarantees freedom of expression including dissent . 
in the true spirit of america , freedom must be maintained for those with whom we agree and , yes , those with whom we disagree . 
i believe we , as individuals , should honor the flag as a symbol of that freedom . 
applying government coercion to prevent flag desecration actually chips away at that freedom of expression . 
it is a symbol of what protects us . 
the fondest memory i think i have of being a mother is standing on the school yard of the elementary school with my children and joining with them and the other mothers as they saluted our flag . 
one of those freedoms is freedom of speech . 
if enacted , this bill would for the first time in our nation 's history modify the bill of rights to limit freedom of speech . 
why are the republican leadership of the house pushing this amendment ? 
general powell : `` the first amendment exists to ensure that freedom of speech and expression applies not just to that with which we agree or disagree but also to that which we find outrageous . 
i would not amend that great shield of democracy to hammer a few miscreants . 
the flag will be flying proudly long after they have slunk away. '' jim warner , a vietnam veteran and prisoner of the north vietnamese from 1967 to 1973 , wrote this about the proposed amendment , and i quote this prisoner of war , this american hero : `` the fact is the principles for which we fought , for which our comrades died , are advancing everywhere upon the earth while the principles against which we fought are everywhere discredited and rejected . 
the flag burners have lost , and their defeat is the most fitting and thorough rebuke of their principles which the human could devise . 
an act intended merely as an insult is not worthy of our fallen comrades . 
it is the sort of thing our enemies did to us , but we are not them , and we must conform to a different standard ... .. 
now , when the justice of our principles is everywhere vindicated , the i think there is another reason why this amendment has been offered , and that is to divert attention from the shabby treatment of our veterans . 
the veterans of foreign wars estimates that as many as 220 , 000 men and women veterans could lose their benefits under the proposed veterans budget . 
our veterans went to war to protect our nation and to guarantee our freedoms , including freedom of speech and to ensure that those freedoms would be protected . 
mr. speaker , i rise today to defend the flag of the united states of america . 
throughout the history of our nation , our flag has stood as the ultimate symbol of our freedom . 
from yorktown to fort mchenry , from iwo jima to baghdad , our troops have fought behind our flag in the defense of liberty . 
their dedication and their sacrifice in defense of freedom demands that we take this action today . 
and who can forget on september 11 , 2001 , when firefighters in new york pulled our flag out of the rubble of the world trade center and hoisted it in defiance of terror ? 
that was draped over the scarred pentagon as a show of our nation 's resolve ? 
we should not , we must not , and we can not allow the desecration of our national and , mr. speaker , as was mentioned , 50 states have already passed resolutions indicating that they want to ratify this resolution we are debating today . 
let the majority of americans ratify their allegiance and pledge their allegiance to our flag . 
it is disturbing to see images of someone burning the flag of the united states , particularly when we reflect upon the countless men and women who have given up their lives defending this symbol of freedom . 
i did so for many of the same reasons that proponents of the amendment have expressed today . 
history reminds us that the strength of america is derived from its basic ideals , one of the most important of which is tolerance for the full expression of ideas , even the acts that we consider obnoxious . 
as our founding fathers originally intended , the first amendment to the constitution has safeguarded the freedom of expression . 
tested through times of war and peace , americans have been able to write or publish almost anything without interference , to practice their religion freely and to protest against the government in almost every way imaginable . 
it is a sign of our strength that , unlike so many repressive nations on earth , ours is a country that not only accommodates a wide-ranging public debate , but encourages it . 
mr. speaker , a friend of mine and former senator of virginia , chuck robb , is a man who sacrificed greatly for his nation , in both the vietnam war and in his political career . 
not having fought in a war , i should do no less than senator robb did in defense of die freedom he and so many of my peers were willing to defend with their lives . 
in our hearts and our minds we know that flag burning is not a threat to our freedom , limiting the exercise of individual liberty is . 
mr. speaker , i yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from michigan ( mr. conyers ) xz4000800 , the distinguished ranking member of the committee on the judiciary . 
mr. speaker , today we are enduring the republican rite of spring : a proposed amendment to the bill of rights to restrict what it calls flag desecration . 
it is easier than answering questions about the failure of this house to provide proper health care to our veterans , proper armor to save the lives of our troops , or proper support for their survivors . 
mr. speaker , i have heard a number of speakers invoke the rescuers and heroes and first responders at ground zero on september 11 and the few weeks after . 
i have seen the heroism and the self-sacrifice of the first responders . 
i have watched their betrayal by the government of the united states , by the federal and state and local governments which are not providing for their health care , which are not providing workers ' comp when they can not do their jobs because of world trade center health syndrome , which denies that they were present in the workers ' comp proceedings after they get medals for rescuing people . 
what they care about is being made whole , is having their health care taken care of and their lives restored , not this . 
the flag is a symbol of our great nation and the fundamental freedoms that have made this nation great . 
if the flag needs protection at all , it needs protection from members of congress who value the symbol more than they value the freedoms the flag represents . 
quite frankly , the crass political use of the flag to question the patriotism of those who value fundamental freedoms is a greater insult to those who died in the service of our nation than is the burning of the flag . 
i am certain we will hear speeches invoking the sacrifice of our troops in the field as a pretext for carving up the first amendment . 
that is a shameful exploitation of the patriotism and courage of these fine and courageous young people . 
it is the civic equivalent of violating the commandment against taking the lord 's name in vain . 
if members want to honor the sacrifice of our troops , protect the rights they fight for . 
protect our civil liberties , and protect the rights of veterans . 
that is why we have a bill of rights to protect minorities from the majority . 
if we do not preserve those rights , then the flag will have been desecrated far beyond the capability of any idiot with a cigarette lighter . 
current federal laws say that the preferred way to dispose of a tattered flag is to burn it , but there are those who would criminalize the same act of burning the flag if it was done to express political dissent . 
mr. speaker , the fact of the matter is i have seen motion pictures , i have seen movies reflecting the war of 1812 in which the british burned our capital . 
of course not . 
that is to say , they are not burning the flag as an expression of disdain for our values , as an expression of their opinions on political issues of their disagreement with the administration or with the government in power . 
no , they are doing it as part of a play , play-acting ; so the physical act does not mean anything , so we do not care . 
but under this amendment , if someone were to do the same thing , burn the flag at the same time as he says , i disagree with the policy of whatever it is , that would be a criminal act . 
not the act of burning the flag . 
what is really being made criminal is the act of burning the flag combined with the expression of a dissident , unpopular political opinion . 
the act of burning the flag to dispose of it is a praiseworthy act . 
the act of burning the flag as part of a movie or part of a play , that is okay . 
really , what we are getting at here is the core expression of first amendment protected ideas . 
we will arrest people who as part of expressing their opinion about something burn the flag . 
but if they burn the flag without expressing an opinion contrary to the government as part of a play or for some other reason , that will be okay . 
if we carve out this exception for the first amendment , if we make this the first time that we will limit rights protected by the bill of rights , it will be easier to do it in the future . 
how many members of congress , used car dealers , fast-food restaurants , and other seemingly legitimate individuals and enterprises have engaged in the act of using the flag or parts of the flag for advertising , an act which our unconstitutional law defines as flag desecration ? 
if ratified , i think there are more than a few people who will have to redesign their campaign materials to stay out of jail , except , of course , that probably no one will arrest them for that violation of the law because they will not be seen to be using it for dissident political speech , unless they are running on an unpopular platform , then maybe they will be . 
again , that is the danger of this amendment . 
as if this assault on the bill of rights is not enough , the judiciary committee once again did not even bother holding a hearing on this very significant constitutional amendment . 
there is no excuse for doing something or attempting to do something so significant to start tearing up the bill of rights without even a hearing to hear opinions on it just because prior congresses may have held hearings . 
this cavalier attitude toward the bill of rights is offensive and revealing . 
we 're only talking about the rights of a few malcontents for whom even opponents of this amendment have contempt . 
none of us think that those people are doing something praiseworthy . 
by the way , where is this epidemic of flag burning ? 
let us not destroy the way of life for which our troops have made the ultimate sacrifice . 
mr. speaker , i reserve the balance of my time . 
mr. speaker , i yield 6 minutes to the gentleman from virginia ( mr. scott ) xz4003641 , a distinguished member of the committee on the judiciary . 
mr. speaker , i yield 5 minutes to the distinguished gentlewoman from california ( ms. zoe lofgren ) xz4002450 , member of the committee on the judiciary . 
mr. speaker , i want to begin by reading excerpts of an article written in the `` retired officer , '' a veterans magazine , by a major james warner , who was a pow in vietnam for 6 years . 
he writes as follows : `` in march of 1973 , when we were released from a prisoner-of-war camp in north vietnam , we were flown to clark air base in the philippines . 
`` as i stepped out of the aircraft , i looked up and saw the flag . 
although i had received a silver star medal , and two purple hearts , they were nothing compared to the gratitude that i felt then for having been allowed to serve the cause of freedom . 
`` because the mere sight of the flag meant so much to me when i saw it for the first time after 5 1/2 years , it hurts me to see other americans willfully desecrate it . 
he says , `` i remember one interrogation where i was shown a photograph of some americans protesting the war by burning a flag . 
in my country we are not afraid of freedom , even if it means that people disagree with us . 
i have never forgotten that look , nor have i forgotten the satisfaction i felt at using his tool , the picture of the burning flag , against him . 
they burn the flag because they hate america and they are afraid of freedom . 
what better way to hurt them than with a subversive idea of freedom ? 
do not be afraid of freedom , it is the best weapon we have. '' this is , as i said , from major james warner , who was a pow in vietnam for 6 years who understands freedom , and therefore opposes this amendment . 
mr. speaker , the fact of the matter is , there have been thousands of amendments introduced , thousands of proposed amendments introduced to the constitution of the united states . 
only 17 have been adopted since 1791 after the bill of rights . 
amendments have been introduced after every unpopular decision of the supreme court . 
it is deliberately difficult to amend the constitution because the framers of the constitution were afraid of transient majorities . 
they were afraid of emotion , and they deliberately wanted it to be difficult to amend the constitution so it would not be amended very often , and only under dire necessity . 
most , however , have burned the flag to dispose of it , which is the approved method of disposing of it . 
so what is the real essence of the crime ? 
if you burn it in connection with popular speech , we respect the flag and we dispose of this , or this connection with popular speech because you are an actor playing the british burning washington in 1814 , that is okay . 
so this gets at the heart of free speech . 
we do not see any epidemic of people burning flags . 
we should not make it easier at times of emotion in the future on issues we can not now foresee for unpopular minorities to be bullied . 
but those of us who understand , i think , the meaning of liberty and the meaning of what this country stands for , perhaps in a way , i would want to say better than others , but that would be a little arrogant , but to understand that as we do , understand that the real meaning of this country is to permit free speech , to magnify free speech , to magnify free speech of those we do not agree with , of those we find obnoxious . 
the cloth of the flag is not what we revere . 
what we revere is the idea of the flag and the republic for which it stands . 
mr. speaker , i yield back the balance of my time . 
certainly the cross has special meaning for millions of people . 
the menorah , the koran , we saw that recently where false reports on desecration of the koran led to riots and hundreds of people dying . 
the symbolic meaning of the toppling of the statue of saddam hussein was not lost on the iraqi people or the other people around the world . 
and so for millions of americans , the flag symbolizes the very essence of this country . 
hundreds of thousands have died under the banner . 
and so for 200 years , this was a commonly accepted understanding of the importance of the flag , the symbolic meaning of the flag . 
and then came two 5-4 supreme court decisions in the 1980s which allowed flag desecration under the banner of free speech , which has really offended a great many people in this country . 
i think an overwhelming number of states , more than 80 percent of u.s. citizens , disagree with those supreme court decisions . 
so i urge my colleagues to support h.j. resolution 10 , which states , `` the congress shall have power to prohibit the physical desecration of the flag of the united states of america. '' mr. speaker , i thank the gentleman from wisconsin ( mr. sensenbrenner ) xz4003650 for his stand on this issue and for giving me this time to express my views . 
this is more like a solution in search of a problem . 
we are just looking for another job for the batf to enforce this type of legislation . 
there are a lot of state laws , such as laws against arson , disturbing the peace , theft , inciting riots , trespassing . 
we could deal with all of the flag desecration with these laws . 
but there is another solution that our side has used and pretends to want to use on numerous occasions , and that is to get rid of the jurisdiction from the federal courts . 
to me , why this is scary is because the flag is a symbol today of the state . 
i just do not see where that makes a lot of sense . 
mr. speaker , a question i would like to ask the proponents of this legislation is this : what if some military officials arrived at a home to report to the family that their son had just been killed in iraq , and the mother is totally overwhelmed by grief which quickly turns to anger . 
we do not need a new amendment to the constitution to take care of a problem that does not exist . 
another point : the real problem that exists rountinely on the house floor is the daily trashing of the court by totally ignoring act i sec . 
8. we should spend a lot more time following the rule of law , as defined by our oath of office , and a lot less on unnecessary constitutional amendments that expands the role of the federal government while undermining that extension of the states . 
i have myself served 5 years in the military , and i have great respect for the symbol of our freedom . 
under the constitutional principle of federalism , questions such as whether or not texas should prohibit flag burning are strictly up to the people of texas , not the united states supreme court . 
we all despise this behavior , but the offensive conduct of a few does not justify making an exception to the first amendment protections of political speech the majority finds offensive . 
according to the pro-flag amendment citizens flag alliance , there were only three incidents of flag desecration in 2004 and there have only been two acts of desecration thus far in 2005 , and the majority of those cases involved vandalism or some other activity that is already punishable by local law enforcement ! 
let me emphasize how the first amendment is written , `` congress shall make no law. '' that was the spirit of our nation at that time : `` congress shall make no laws. '' unfortunately , congress has long since disregarded the original intent of the founders and has written a lot of laws regulating private property and private conduct . 
you send an agent of the government , perhaps an employee of the bureau of alcohol , tobacco and flags , to arrest him . 
this is in many ways patriotism with a gun -- if your actions do not fit the official definition of a `` patriot , '' we will send somebody to arrest you . 
fortunately , congress has modals of flag desecration laws . 
for example , sadam hussein made desecration of the iraq flag a criminal offense punishable by up to 10 years in prison . 
it is assumed that many in the military support this amendment , but in fact there are veterans who have been great heroes in war on both sides of this issue . 
i would like to quote a past national commander of the american legion , keith kreul . 
he said : our nation was not founded on devotion to symbolic idols , but on principles , beliefs and ideals expressed in the constitution and its bill of rights . 
therein lies the beauty of our flag . 
secretary of state , former chairman of the joint chiefs , and two-time winner of the presidential medal of freedom colin powell has also expressed opposition to amending the constitution in this manner : `` i would not amend that great shield of democracy to hammer out a few miscreants . 
the flag will be flying proudly long after they have slunk away. '' mr. speaker , this amendment will not even reach the majority of cases of flag burning . 
one of the very first laws that red china passed upon assuming control of hong kong was to make flag burning illegal . 
our state department keeps records of how often the red chinese prosecute people for burning the chinese flag , as it considers those prosecutions an example of how the red chinese violate human rights . 
there is just a bit of hypocrisy among those members who claim this amendment does not interfere with fundamental liberties , yet are critical of red china for punishing those who burn the chinese flag . 
freedom of speech and freedom of expression depend on property . 
we do not have freedom of expression of our religion in other people 's churches ; it is honored and respected because we respect the ownership of the property . 
the property conveys the right of free expression , as a newspaper would or a radio station . 
some claim that this is not an issue of private property rights because the flag belongs to the country . 
but this whole idea that there could be a collective ownership of the flag is erroneous . 
finally , mr. speaker , i wish to point out that by using the word `` desecration , '' which is traditionally reserved for religious symbols , the authors of this amendment are placing the symbol of the state on the same plane as the symbol of the church . 
the practical effect of this is to either lower religious symbols to the level of the secular state , or raise the state symbol to the status of a holy icon . 
we must be interested in the spirit of our constitution . 
we must be interested in the principles of liberty . 
instead , my colleagues should work to restore the rights of the individual states to ban flag burning , free from unconstitutional interference by the supreme court . 
it is interesting that we are hearing about freedom of speech right now . 
i was interested because yesterday in my district the aclu , which holds itself as the arbiter of all freedom of speech in the nation and in the world , actually shut down all comments from their own local chapter because one person was speaking out on an issue that they did not want him to speak on with their name hooked onto it . 
so the aclu yesterday in the second congressional district of new mexico actually said no freedom of speech is allowed if you are an aclu officer . 
freedom of speech , we have also seen it compromised in our schools . 
why can we not defend this sacred symbol of our freedom ? 
when i see these world war ii veterans coming to me with tears in their eyes knowing they are in the last year or two of their lives and saying , why ca n't we do this finally , it is not a complicated issue . 
they do not see things in the complex legal arguments on the floor of this house or in the supreme court . 
it is being said by the same people who want the freedom of speech to desecrate the symbol of our flag that we should not have the freedom to desecrate the koran or even allege that it has been desecrated . 
mr. speaker , it is time that we recognize that a symbol is more important than the actual fabric that it is made of . 
it is time for the congress to speak in the way that the majority of americans would have them to speak . 
mr. speaker , i want to begin by commending the gentleman from california ( mr. cunningham ) xz4000910 for not only his extraordinary and courageous service to our nation in uniform , but for his ongoing service to our country in bringing this important legislation to the floor of the congress . 
i also want to thank the distinguished chairman of the committee on the judiciary on which i have the privilege of serving . 
the gentleman from wisconsin ( mr. sensenbrenner ) xz4003650 continues to provide leadership that reflects the values of the overwhelming majority of the american people to this congress . 
by entertaining this legislation and bringing this debate again to the floor , the gentleman from wisconsin ( chairman sensenbrenner ) demonstrates the quality of that leadership again . 
after surviving the bloodiest battle since gettysburg , a platoon of marines trudged up mount suribachi on sulfur island with a simple task : to raise an american flag above the devastation below . 
we will raise her above the decisions of a judiciary that was wrong on our law and our history and our traditions . 
we will raise the flag above the cynicism of our times . 
we will say to my generation of americans , those most unwelcome of words : there are limits . 
out of respect for those who serve beneath it and those who died within the sight of it , we must say that there are boundaries necessary to the survival of freedom . 
let us elevate out of dishonor our unique national symbol to its rightful place . 
let us pass this amendment to restore to old glory the modest protections of the law she so richly deserves . 
the president even proposed a $ 15 billion cut and copays for a significant number of our veterans . 
reserve components make up 50 percent of our forces in iraq and studies show that 20 percent have no health insurance . 
how can we ask these young men and women to serve on the front line and not even provide for them the basic necessity of health care ? 
there are , of course , exceptions . 
speech may be restricted if it creates an imminent threat of violence or threatens safety or expresses a patently offensive message that has no redeeming social value , but we can not restrict by content otherwise . 
so you can restrict the particulars of a march or a demonstration by what time it is held or where it is held or how loud the demonstration can be , but you can not restrict what people are marching or demonstrating about . 
of course , speech protected by the first amendment will always be unpopular . 
some have referred to the underlying resolution as the anti-flag burning amendment , and they speak about the necessity of keeping people from burning flags . 
in reality , the only place you ever see a flag burned is in compliance with the federal code at flag ceremonies disposing of a worn-out flag . 
ask any boy scout or american legion member how to dispose of a worn-out flag and they will tell you that the procedure is to burn the flag at a respectful ceremony . 
in fact , the only time i have seen a flag burned is at one of these ceremonies . 
so the proposed constitutional amendment is all about expression and all about prohibiting expression in violation of the first amendment principles . 
this is an absurd distinction and is a direct contravention of the whole purpose of the first amendment , especially when the real impact of the legislation will be to have political protesters arrested because they disagree and express that disagreement of government policy . 
mr. speaker , in addition to the violation of the spirit of the bill of rights , this amendment has practical problems . 
can one desecrate a picture of a flag ? 
can one desecrate a flag with the wrong number of stripes ? 
mr. speaker , during the vietnam war , laws were passed prohibiting draft cards from being burned , and protesters with great flourish would say that they were burning their draft cards and offend everybody , but then nobody would know whether it was a draft card or just a piece of paper . 
mr. speaker , let me just begin by saying our flag does not need protection from an occasional protester , we call them miscreants i think , who can not see how ridiculous it is to try to protest by destroying the symbol of his right to protest . 
now , as the gentleman from north carolina , sponsor of the amendment , points out , the underlying amendment does not repeal the first amendment . 
or if you are a member of a fringe political organization who burns his own flag on his own property , in private , can they be arrested if somebody finds out ? 
so the watt amendment makes it clear that we are still protecting freedom of speech . 
the message , that will be clear , that we if we do not support the watt amendment we just ought to acknowledge it is indeed the message , not conduct , which is the target of the underlying amendment . 
mr. speaker , pursuant to house resolution 330 , i call up the joint resolution ( h.j. res. 10 ) proposing an amendment to the constitution of the united states authorizing the congress to prohibit the physical desecration of the flag of the united states , and ask for its immediate consideration . 
mr. speaker , i rise today in support of house joint resolution 10 , which would amend the constitution to grant congress the authority to prohibit the physical desecration of the american flag . 
mr. speaker , the american flag represents the shared history and common future of all americans and our collective commitment to the preservation of the ideals enshrined in our constitution . 
the flag flies proudly in times of peace and war , prosperity and crisis , reminding the world of our unflinching resolve to protect the freedom and equality it symbolizes . 
in the early days of the republic through contemporary times , the flag has rallied and sustained the spirit of the nation . 
in world war ii , it was carried onto normandy beach by soldiers who liberated a continent from darkness , and raised on iwo jima to steel the resolve of embattled marines . 
during the cold war , it affirmed the universal values of human freedom and dignity for citizens of countries whose governments ignored both . 
following the attacks of september 11 , 2001 , the flag was unfurled at the pentagon and raised from the rubble at ground zero to unify the spirit of a shaken nation . 
unique among all american symbols , the flag captures the pride and spirit of the american people and serves as an international symbol of freedom and opportunity . 
for the first two centuries of our constitution 's existence , it was permissible to protect america 's preeminent symbol from desecration . 
however , in the same year , a closely divided supreme court invalidated those laws by holding that burning an american flag as part of a political demonstration was protected by the first amendment . 
since 1994 , over 119 incidents of flag desecration have been reported , and the flag of the united states remains vulnerable . 
mr. speaker , the framers of the constitution recognized that there would be circumstances necessitating changes to the constitution . 
toward that end , they provided the people with an amendment process embodied in article v of the constitution . 
while our courts have the authority to interpret the constitution , under our system of government , the american people should and must have the ultimate authority to amend it . 
as a result , house joint resolution 10 does not upset the doctrine of judicial review . 
rather , it utilizes a remedy envisioned by the founders to effectuate the will of the people . 
however , because of the narrowly divided johnson and eichman supreme court decisions , the constitutional amendment provides the only remaining option for the american people and their elected representatives to restore protection to our nation 's preeminent symbol . 
in december 1792 , james madison asked a question : `` who are the best keepers of the people 's liberty ? 
the sacred trust can be nowhere so safe as in the hands most interested in preserving it. '' all 50 state legislatures have passed resolutions calling on congress to pass a flag protection amendment , and polls demonstrate the overwhelming majority of americans have consistently supported a flag protection amendment . 
the congress must act with bipartisan dispatch to ensure that this issue is returned to the hands of those most interested in preserving freedom , the people themselves . 
mr. speaker , the flag of the united states is a critical part of america 's civic identity . 
millions of americans , including we as members of congress , pledge daily allegiance to the flag , and our national anthem pays homage to it . 
america 's soldiers salute the flag of the united states in times of peace , and generations of america 's soldiers have fought and died for it in times of war . 
mr. speaker , i reserve the balance of my time . 
mr. speaker , i yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from california ( mr. cunningham ) xz4000910 , the author of the legislation . 
mr. speaker , i have a deep respect for the arguments that have been advanced by the gentleman from new york and other opponents of this amendment . 
and i think the vast majority of the american people disagree with them as well . 
most of our criminal code , as well as certain types of civil provisions that contain penalties , do draw the line and have a clear demarcation of what goes over the line and thus should be punished . 
i think one of the reasons why we are here today as a result of both the johnson and eichman decisions was exemplified by a decision of the supreme court of my home state of wisconsin on april 9 , 1998 , in the case of state of wisconsin v. matthew janssen . 
using the precedent that was set by the supreme court in the johnson and eichman cases , the wisconsin supreme court unanimously affirmed the dismissal of the prosecution against mr. janssen and wrote an extensive decision that basically agrees with the arguments that were advanced by the gentleman from new york ( mr. nadler ) xz4002890 . 
but the last paragraph of that decision , i think , is very important ; and i am going to read it into the record . 
the wisconsin supreme court through justice john wilcox said : `` but in the end , to paraphrase justice frankfurter , we must take solace in the fact that as members of this court we are not justified in writing our private notions of policy into the constitution , no matter how deeply we may cherish them or how mischievous we may deem their disregard , '' quoting the barnette case with justice frankfurter dissenting . 
the supreme court of wisconsin concluded by saying : `` if it is the will of the people in this country to amend the united states constitution in order to protect our nation 's symbol , it must be done through normal political channels. '' today , we are doing it through those normal political channels . 
mr. speaker , i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from ohio ( mr. chabot ) xz4000710 , the chairman of the subcommittee on the constitution . 
mr. speaker , throughout the history of this republic , the congress has proposed constitutional amendments and sent them to the states to overturn supreme court decisions that were particularly onerous . 
the one that comes to mind as coming to the top of the list was the dred scott decision . 
there was a decision early in the country 's history under the constitution that related to the judicial power of the united states . 
and the supreme court also decided that levying income taxes violated the provision of the constitution on apportionment of taxes , and the 16th amendment was proposed and ratified to correct that problem . 
here we have had resolutions of all 50 state legislatures asking that we propose this amendment and send it to the states for ratification , and that is because the instances of flag desecration that have occurred have been deemed by them to be over the line and that the supreme court of the united states was wrong in its decision and it needs correction . 
i just go back to the quote that i made of the wisconsin supreme court when they effectively invalidated my state 's flag desecration amendment . 
mr. speaker , i yield myself the balance of my time . 
as all of the people who served as justices of the supreme court during the 20th century , i think everybody would recognize that the strongest first amendment absolutist was justice hugo l. black . 
let me read you what justice black said in the case of street v. new york , decided in 1969 : `` it passes my belief that anything in the federal constitution bars a state from making the deliberate burning of an american flag an offense. '' the court changed its mind twice at the end of the decade of the 1980s . 
i do not think that anybody 's free speech rights to express whatever they want to say about a policy , about the position of the american government , about a stand that a candidate makes , a vote that a congressman makes is going to be infringed by the passage of this amendment . 
what is going to be stopped is deliberately burning the symbol of our country or otherwise desecrating it . 
mr. speaker , i yield back the balance of my time . 
mr. speaker , i have listened attentively to the arguments made by the gentleman from north carolina ( mr. watt ) xz4004240 in support of his amendment , and he said that his amendment is redundant . 
it is redundant , but it also is a gutting amendment to the base text of the constitutional amendment that we are debating today . 
these decisions effectively invalidated the laws of 48 states and the federal government . 
in addition , based on these precedents , any law that prohibits the physical desecration of the flag will be struck down as an unconstitutional suppression of free expression , thus defeating the goal of our efforts to provide protection for the flag . 
adoption of the substitute would not only render h. j. res. 10 ineffective , but it would also constitutionally codify the supreme court decisions that a vast majority of the american public were erroneously decided , and which did not exist for the first 200 years of the constitution 's existence . 
mr. speaker , i reserve the balance of my time . 
mr. speaker , i yield myself the balance of my time . 
mr. speaker , the major argument that we have heard against the base amendment and in favor of the watt substitute is that if we do not pass the watt substitute , we will be amending the bill of rights for the first time in the history of this country . 
in the dred scott decision , chief justice taney claimed that the fifth amendment 's due process clause , which he interpreted to include a substantive right to the protection of property , prohibited restrictions on slave ownership . 
in a similar manner , house joint resolution 10 seeks to correct two supreme court precedents that repudiated 2 centuries of jurisprudence . 
we must vote against the watt substitute amendment which guts the thrust of house joint resolution 10 and then pass house joint resolution 10 by a two-thirds majority to send it to the other body . 
mr. speaker , i yield back the balance of my time . 
mr. speaker , i make a point of order against the motion to recommit . 
mr. speaker , the motion to recommit is not germane to the original text of the house joint resolution 10 . 
house joint resolution 10 proposes an amendment to prohibit the physical desecration of the flag of the united states . 
the material proposed to be inserted in the motion to recommit , sections 2 and following , has nothing to do with the subject of prohibiting the physical desecration of the flag and , thus , is not germane under the rules of the house . 
mr. speaker , i make a point of order against the motion . 
mr. speaker , the points of order that the gentleman from wisconsin has been raising have been pursuant to house rules , and we should not be waiving the rules relative to the germaneness of motions to recommit . 
should the gentleman from mississippi offer more nongermane motions to recommit , then i think it is incumbent upon me , as the manager of the bill , to raise a point of order , should the rules of the house be violated by the motion to recommit , as they have been in the past . 
mr. speaker , i rise today in opposition to h. j. res. 10 , which would amend the constitution to allow congress to pass laws banning the desecration of a flag . 
i find it abhorrent anyone would burn our flag , and if i saw someone desecrating the flag , i would do what i could to stop them , at risk of injury or incarceration . 
for me , that would be a badge of honor . 
keep in mind the constitution has only been amended 17 times since the bill of rights was passed in 1791 . 
this is the same constitution that eventually outlawed slavery , gave blacks and women the right to vote , and guaranteed freedom of speech and freedom of religion . 
i agree with secretary powell , who when he served as chairman of the joint chief of staffs , wrote , `` it was a mistake to amend the constitution , that great shield of democracy to hamper a few miscreants. '' when i think of the flag , i think about the courageous men and women who have died defending it and the families they left behind . 
what they were defending was the constitution of the united states and the rights it guarantees as embodied by the flag . 
mr. speaker , i rise today in strong support of house joint resolution 4 , the constitutional amendment to prohibit flag desecration . 
our flag is the strongest symbol of america 's character and values . 
it tells the story of victories won -- and battles lost -- in defending the principles of freedom and democracy . 
these are stories of men and women from all walks of life who put their lives on hold to serve our nation . 
many of those brave americans never returned home from distant battlefields . 
the flag reminds us of the sacrifices they made at gettysburg , san juan hill , iwo jima , normandy beach , korea , da nang , kuwait , afghanistan , iraq and other places where america 's men and women in uniform placed honor and duty above self . 
the american flag belongs to them as it belongs to all of us . 
critics of the amendment say it interferes with freedom of speech . 
it does not interfere with freedom of speech . 
americans can stand on the steps of their own city hall or on the steps of our nation 's capitol to demonstrate their cause . 
protecting the american flag from desecration does not deprive any american of the opportunity to speak clearly , openly and freely . 
our founding fathers protected free speech and freedom of the press because in a democracy , words are used to debate , persuade and to educate . 
a democracy must protect free and open debate , regardless of how disagreeable some might find the views of others . 
in 1989 , in the case of texas versus gregory lee johnson , the supreme court ruled that a state flag protection statute was unconstitutional . 
mr. johnson xz4002052 was free to speak his mind without fear of censorship . 
as a member of the american legion , i have supervised the disposal of over 7 , 000 unserviceable flags . 
more than 70 percent of the american people want the opportunity to vote to protect their flag . 
numerous organizations , including the medal of honor recipients for the flag , the american legion , the american war mothers , the american g.i . 
in the last congress , the house of representatives overwhelmingly passed this amendment by a vote of 298 to 125 , and will rightfully pass it again this year . 
mr. speaker , i am proud to be an original cosponsor of h. j. res. 4 and ask that my colleagues join me in supporting this important resolution that means so much to so many . 
mr. speaker , we are gathered here today to debate a constitutional amendment that would restrict the right of an american to make a foolish , foolish mistake with his or her own property . 
as secretary of state colin powell said in a letter dated may 18 , 1999 to senator leahy : `` if they are destroying a flag that belongs to someone else , that is a prosecutable crime . 
we should condemn them and pity them instead. '' mr. speaker , my primary objection to this amendment is not the effect it will have on those who physically desecrate their flags , because the numbers of people who physically desecrate the american flag are so small . 
my objection is that it will give government a tool with which to prosecute americans with minority views , particularly at times of great national division , even if their behavior would have been perceived as patriotic if done by the majority . 
unfortunately , our history has abundant examples of patriotism being used to hurt those who express views in disagreement with that of the majority . 
let me share some news stories taken from the new york times in years of great strife in america . 
there was much excitement in the main dining room at rector 's last night following the playing of the `star spangled banner. ' frederick s. boyd , a former reporter on the new york call , a socialist newspaper , was dining with miss jessie ashley and miss may r. towle , both lawyers and suffragists . 
the three alone of those in the room remained seated . 
the guests insisted upon the ejection of boyd and his companions , and they were asked to leave . 
before magistrate corrigan in night court , boyd repeated that he did not have to rise at the playing of the national anthem , but the court told him that while there was no legal obligation , it was neither prudent nor courteous not to do so in these tense times . 
boyd was found guilty of disorderly conduct and was released on suspended sentence. '' another one from the new york times , july 2 , 1917 , headline : `` boston `peace ' parade mobbed . 
the ranks of the marchers were broken up by self-organized squads of uniformed soldiers and sailors , red flags and banners bearing socialist mottos were trampled on , and literature and furnishings in the socialist headquarters in park square were thrown into the street and burned . 
the american flag at the head of the line was seized by the attacking party , and the band , which had been playing the `the marseillaise ' with some interruptions , was forced to play `the star-spangled banner ' while cheers were given for the flag. '' headline : `` forced to kiss the flag . 
nearly 100 industrial workers of the world , all of whom admitted they are anarchists , knelt on the ground at dawn today near san onofre , a small settlement a short distance this side of the orange county boundary line . 
`` the ceremony , which was unwillingly performed , was witnessed by 45 deputy constables and a large body of armed citizens of san diego. '' what do these stories have to do with this very important and heartfelt debate today , mr. speaker ? 
the decision we make today , it seems to me , is a balancing , weighing , of what best preserves freedom for americans . 
there may well be a decrease in public deliberate incidents of flag desecration , acts that we all deplore , if this amendment becomes part of our constitution , although they are already quite rare . 
on the other side of the ledger , if this amendment becomes part of our constitution , in my opinion , it will become a constitutionally sanctioned tool for the majority to tyrannize the minority . 
as evidenced by anecdotes from a time of great divisiveness in our nation 's history , a time much different from today , government , which ultimately as human beings with all of our strengths and weaknesses , may use this amendment to question the patriotism of vocal minorities and will use it to find excuses to legally attack demonstrations which utilize the flag in an otherwise appropriate manner , except for the fact that the flag is carried by those speaking for an unpopular minority . 
i knew these people thought this to be a patriotic part of their display . 
i was standing a few booths down the way and watched as one of the volunteers sat on the table , oblivious to the fact he was sitting on our american flag . 
i believe that had this group been a fringe group , these with views contrary to the great majority , and should we have laws prohibiting physical desecration of the flag , and had this been a time of great national division , such an action as i described would not be excused as an innocent mistake . 
instead , a minority group might be prosecuted out of anger , out of disgust , but make no mistake , the motivation for such a prosecution would be that they hold a minority view . 
mr. speaker , i do not think our constitution will be improved nor our freedoms protected by placing within it enhanced opportunity for minority views to be legally attacked , ostensibly because of their misuse of the flag they own , but in reality because of the views that many consider out of the mainstream . 
mr. speaker , i rise in opposition to h. j. res. 10 , which proposes a constitutional amendment to ban desecration of the flag , because what people do with a piece of fabric , however meaningful , is not worthy of congressional intervention . 
flag burning has as much to do with patriotism as weapons of mass destruction had to do with our invasion of iraq . 
this body could be focusing on providing health insurance to our nation 's 45 million uninsured , improving our public education system , addressing our swollen deficit , or any number of equally important issues . 
instead we are mired in the issues of terri schiavo , steroids in professional sports and flag burning . 
perhaps if the members of this body were so concerned with a symbol of democracy , an effort could be made by our leaders to hold themselves to the highest ethical standards . 
mr. speaker , how patriotic do you think the american people feel when a chief negotiator of the medicare drug bill leaves congress to become the head of the pharmaceutical industry 's lobbying group ? 
how should the american people feel when they learn the republican majority votes to cut health care for millions of impoverished americans and then boosts funding for no-bid defense contracts to halliburton ? 
mr. speaker , i will not vote to undermine our freedoms and make a mockery of our constitution . 
and the veterans groups supposedly are called the veterans for common sense , and veterans defending the bill of rights . 
now , frankly , i have never heard of these groups . 
i am sure most of you have not heard of those groups . 
but i would contend that the vast majority of american veterans do indeed support the proposed amendment . 
and i cite the support of groups such as the american legion and veterans of foreign wars , whose membership combined is well over 5 million veterans . 
before and after the ratification of the first amendment , the states prohibited the physical desecration of the american flag . 
then , over the next 200 years , everyone understood that any prohibition of physically desecrating the american flag was allowable under federal , state and common law , and understood to be consistent with free speech . 
so it was the supreme court 's decision in texas v. johnson in 1989 , and u.s. v. eichman in 1990 , that overturned two centuries of traditional and commonly accepted legal practice . 
this amendment does not really restrict freedom of expression , because no idea or viewpoints would be suppressed . 
we are merely looking at a very extremely narrow exception to prevent the desecration of the symbol that represents so many wonderful things to so many people at home and around the world . 
we also have the support of all 50 states and 80 percent of the american people . 
mr. speaker , given the nature of this motion , i ask unanimous consent that the clerk read it again . 
mr. speaker , i ask unanimous consent , given the gravity of this motion , that the clerk read the motion again since , apparently , no one on this floor , other than i , know what is in it . 
the text of the original bill is to give the 50 states the legal authority to , on a state-by-state basis , prevent the desecration of the flag , a symbol of our country . 
there is something a heck of a lot more serious going on than the desecration of the flag : it is the desecration of our nation . 
we have taken money out of the social security trust fund , $ 632 billion out of that trust fund , and used it to run the country , leaving nothing there but an iou . 
money has been taken out of the federal employees retirement system , now a total of $ 614 billion . 
mr. speaker , if any business in america had taken that money out of the employees ' trust fund -- -- 
mr. speaker , the point of order is , why would we take the time to protect the symbol of our country if we will not take the time to protect the financial future of our country as well ? 
mr. speaker , what is the procedure to appeal the ruling of the chair ? 
mr. speaker , i am appealing the ruling of the chair , and i would like to speak to that point . 
now , is that the net effect of that vote that just occurred ? 
if that motion to recommit was ruled out of order , does the minority still have the right to offer another motion to recommit ? 
mr. speaker , the underlying bill is to prevent the desecration of the flag , the trampling of our flag , the misuse of our flag . 
the amendment that i have offered is to prevent the wholesale theft and desecration of the social security trust fund . 
in the past 4 years alone , this congress , of which i am a part , has taken $ 632 billion out of the social security trust fund that we promised the citizens we would set aside just for social security payments and used to run the country . 
the president has gone all around the country saying we have a crisis , that by 2017 we will be out of money . 
the point of order is to my colleagues , if you think it is wrong to desecrate the flag , i would hope that you would think it is wrong to misspend money taken out of people 's wallets that we promised to spend on their social security and to protect that money in the constitution . 
mr. speaker , i appeal the ruling of the chair . 
mr. speaker , in the interests of moving things along , i ask unanimous consent to engage the gentleman from wisconsin ( mr. sensenbrenner ) xz4003650 in about a 3-minute colloquy . 
mr. speaker , to the gentleman from wisconsin , you have , using the power of the majority , blocked the vote on a constitutional amendment to balance the budget and the constitutional amendment to vote to protect the social security trust fund . 
mr. speaker , reclaiming my time , i would remind the members of this body that this bill came to the floor waiving all points of order . 
the medicare prescription drug bill that is going to increase the national debt by $ 1.5 billion came to the floor waiving all points of order . 
we have acquired $ 2.1 billion worth of new debt in just the past 4 years , waiving all points of order . 
i am not in support of burning the flag . 
but i am even more opposed to weakening the first amendment , one of the most important things for which the flag itself stands . 
i think that point was well put by bill holen of littleton , colorado , who wrote to express agreement with a recent denver post editorial against this proposed constitutional amendment . 
like colin powell , while i personally abhor the thought of anyone burning the american flag , the symbol under which i fought for this nation , i believe the principles embodied in the constitution and the bill of rights are far more important. '' i do not think there is a real need for this amendment . 
on that point , i agree with the rocky mountain news that `` flag-burning is not really a problem , as actual incidents of it are rare . 
and defining desecration is tricky , especially given the widespread commercial and decorative use of the flag. '' and , in particular , i share that newspaper 's view that `` more importantly , tampering with the first amendment opens the way to those laws of the kind that less democratic governments impose to shield themselves from criticism. '' mr. speaker , every day , at home and abroad , our brave men and women in uniform are on guard to defend our country and our constitution from those who have no respect for either . 
for the benefit of our colleagues , i attach the text of the newspaper editorial to which i referred earlier . 
flag-burning issue a waste of time today is the 217th anniversary of the signing of our constitution . 
to celebrate that happy event , the white house has announced that scholar and historian lynne cheney , the wife of the vice president , will speak at gunston hall plantation in northern virginia . 
gunston hall was the home of george mason , whom the white house properly described as `` father of america 's bill of rights. '' mason wrote the prototype of the bill of rights for virginia 's constitution in 1776 , and it was his intransigence that led to the adoption of those rights as the first 10 amendments to the constitution . 
the supreme court has ruled simply and correctly that flag-burning is political speech and as such has the absolute protection of the first amendment . 
flag-burning is not really a problem , as actual incidents of it are rare . 
and defining desecration is tricky , especially given the widespread commercial and decorative use of the flag . 
more importantly , tampering with the first amendment opens the way to those laws of the kind that less democratic governments impose to shield themselves from criticism . 
mr. speaker , this marks the sixth consecutive term of congress in which i have engaged in this debate . 
but over the years i have come to believe that this is a healthy debate ; and if we conduct it in a dignified way , the debate actually can be good for the entire country , and people can come away with a greater understanding and appreciation of how delicate our constitution framework is . 
this is about how individuals in our country perceive patriotism , the rights of free speech , the rights of protecting the views of people who quite often they may disagree with in content , but that is what our country has been about . 
and i hope that this amendment in the nature of a substitute does not get us off onto a different track , because this is the second or third time i have offered the amendment in the nature of a substitute , and i did it originally for the purpose of trying to get to a higher quality of debate and forcing my colleagues and whoever may be listening to the debate to think about some of these things . 
and i am confident that everybody in this body would think that desecration of the flag , burning of the flag would not be something that we would be supporting , so that is not what this amendment is about . 
my amendment simply says if we are going to do a constitutional amendment , it should not just say that congress has the authority to pass a law that prohibits the physical desecration of the flag . 
and the amendment under my version would read , not inconsistent with the first article of amendment to the constitution : `` the congress shall have power to prohibit the physical desecration of the flag of the united states. '' my amendment , i believe , recognizes the long-standing legacy of the bill of rights . 
in over 200 years of history , our constitution has been amended only 27 times and the bill of rights has never been amended , not once has the bill of rights been amended ; and this proposed resolution would be the first time to do that . 
i understand that the proposed resolution seeks to uphold the integrity of our flag ; but my amendment seeks to ensure that the principles for which the flag stands , particularly freedom of expression and freedom of speech , are also reserved . 
the first amendment to the united states constitution stands for the proposition that all voices of dissent should be heard without governmental suppression . 
disrespect for the flag is offensive to every member of this body , but this is not a debate about patriotism . 
and i think former secretary of state colin powell said it best when he said these words : & lt ; center & gt ; & lt ; pre & gt ; [ page : h4920 ] & lt ; /pre & gt ; & lt ; /center & gt ; `` the first amendment exists to ensure that freedom of speech and expression applies not just to that with which we agree or disagree , but also that which we find outrageous . 
i would not amend that great shield of democracy , the constitution , to humor a few miscreants , '' he said . 
`` the flag will be flying proudly long after they have slunk away. '' and that is the end of his quote for my purposes today . 
mr. speaker , following the horrific acts of terrorism against our country , our citizens were repeatedly cautioned not to cower in the face of terrorism . 
do not curtail our freedoms , we were told , for to do so would be to surrender our way of life , to give up and give in to the terrorists . 
i started by saying that i used to resent this debate and i would tell you , mr. speaker , that i came to congress thinking that , i guess , i thought i had a monopoly on what the meaning of the constitution was . 
and in that class with me was a student by the name of duncan kennedy who is now a professor at harvard law school and for whom a whole theory of law has been patterned . 
in that class with me , in that constitutional law class , was a guy named paul gewirtz , who is now a professor of constitutional law at yale university law school . 
so it was one of those law school classes that people would die for . 
i mean , there were good students in the class and then there were people like me who were sitting in the back of the room hoping that nobody would ever realize that we were there and i could avoid getting involved in that high level of debate . 
and one day my senior law partner , a gentleman by the name of julius chambers , called me in and said , i want you to go to eastern north carolina to one of the counties in which native americans represent a high portion of the population , because a number of the native americans in that county have been charged with parading , using tomahawks , parading around ; and they have been charged with resisting arrest and various other criminal offenses . 
i went and i started my interviews with the native americans , and during the course of my interviews with them , it became apparent that the reason that they had these tomahawks out there and they were demonstrating and parading was that they had a desire not to have to go to school with black people . 
i could not wait until the end of the day to get in my car and race back to charlotte , north carolina , and confront my senior law partner . 
his response taught me more about the first amendment than either robert bork or duncan kennedy or paul gerwitz or any of the discussions that i had participated in in law school . 
this is a difficult issue , and this is not about patriotism , and i have come to understand over the years of debate that we have had this amendment under consideration , i started out saying to people on the opposite side , people like the gentleman from california ( mr. cunningham ) xz4000910 and people who served their country , you are unpatriotic because you do not agree with me about my interpretation of the first amendment ; the first amendment was passed to protect the right of people to demonstrate and burn flags and you are unpatriotic because you do not agree with me . 
could it be that justice scalia and justice rehnquist , two conservative jurists , could be on opposite sides of this issue and it not be a difficult issue from a constitutional perspective ? 
they came down on opposite sides of the landmark case . 
well , there is one thing i want for sure my colleagues to acknowledge , that this amendment , when it was first offered , started out just saying there shall be no physical desecration of the flag . 
for a couple of years it said that , but then the more recent versions of what we are considering today say that congress shall have the power to prohibit the physical desecration of the flag . 
a principle of our nation is also to protect speech , whatever that is ; is it burning the flag , is it hollering `` fire '' in a crowded theater ? 
whatever it is , there needs to be some kind of balance . 
the proponents of this amendment who say that this is going to do something earth shattering or that my amendment is going to undercut their proposal , it is just not the case . 
some people might argue that it is more important than the piece of cloth . 
my colleagues might argue that it is , that it is equal in value , but we at least need to come to grips with that , and that is what the constitution , that is what the supreme court has been trying to do for a number of years . 
we have heard a lot of discussion about activist judges . 
this proposal encourages judges to be activists because it says you are giving congress the right to prohibit the physical desecration of the flag . 
do my colleagues think the supreme court is not going to exercise its constitutional responsibilities just because we said congress can prohibit the physical desecration of the flag ? 
mr. speaker , i reserve the balance of my time . 
mr. speaker , i yield myself 1 minute just for the purpose of responding to this . 
what it does is that it codifies and reaffirms and acknowledges the state of affairs that exists right now , that in the final analysis the supreme court is the ultimate arbiter of the constitution and laws of our country . 
after we pass my amendment or the underlying amendment , the supreme court is still going to be the ultimate arbiter of that , and so my amendment neither does that or does not do it . 
if the supreme court changes its mind , the composition of the supreme court changes , and they decide that burning a flag is prohibited , is not protected under the first amendment , then that is going to be the last word on it . 
so i do not think i can agree with him that i am doing anything different than preserving the state of affairs . 
let me respond to the comments of the gentleman from virginia ( mr. goodlatte ) that the supreme court has amended the bill of rights on a number of occasions . 
it did not amend the language of the bill of rights . 
it amended the interpretation of the bill of rights . 
on a number of those occasions i have been really unhappy about the way the supreme court ruled and took away a right that i thought i had . 
i suspect if there were ever anybody in this institution who would be , should be railing against the supreme court , either the current supreme court or supreme courts throughout history , it might be the members of the congressional black caucus who would have the highest standing and right to do that because in a number of cases the supreme court has ruled in ways that were absolutely counter to our interest . 
i just want my colleagues to understand that this document that our drafters crafted for us has survived so much the test of time , the comings and goings of members of the supreme court differing in interpretations , as the gentleman from virginia ( mr. goodlatte ) said . 
if you want to look at it , they rewrote the bill of rights , but never changed the words . 
i do not think that every time you get a supreme court decision that you disagree with in this country the way to resolve or to express your disagreement is to come to the congress of the united states and propose that we amend the entire constitutional framework that we are operating under . 
so one side of me says this is not a good idea to be amending the constitution in this way . 
the other side of me really says this amendment has been made out to be a lot more than it really is because by saying that congress can pass a statute that prohibits the physical desecration of the flag does not give us any more authority than we now have . 
we can pass a statute right now that prohibits the physical desecration of the flag . 
and if we pass this amendment , having amended for the first time in 200 years our bill of rights , gone through the whole process , the supreme court is still going to have the same right to do that . 
mr. speaker , i object to the vote on the ground that a quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not present . 
mr. speaker , i appreciate the opportunity to speak in favor of this amendment . 
most of them were survivors of the bataan death march . 
some of them had to be carried from the prison compound when it was taken by u.s. army rangers . 
what i will read now is the last paragraph of his narrative as told by its survivors . 
`` along the way we saw an american flag set in a turret of a tank . 
it was n't much of a flag , writhing in a weak breeze , but for the men of cabanatuan , the sight was galvanizing . 
` we wept openly , ' said abie abraham , `and we wept without shame. ' `` some say our flag is just a piece of cloth , mr. speaker . 
grown men , particularly combat veterans , do not typically cry at the sight of a piece of cloth . 
to us , desecrating our flag is not a demonstration of liberty ; it is an attack on liberty . 
if it were merely a piece of cloth , our enemies would not trouble themselves to desecrate it . 
all americans are `` endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights. '' among those rights enumerated in our constitution is the right of free speech . 
the constitution does not , however , afford absolute freedom of action . 
if one takes another person 's life in process of defending oneself , it is considered in a different context then if they took another person 's life to collect a life insurance policy . 
all actions are always taken in context , and i trust the juries of the united states to take this amendment in proper context when it is carried out . 
i would like to urge my colleagues to vote in favor of the flag protection amendment . 
mr. speaker , the resolution before us represents a promise , a promise by the house of representatives to the american people that not only are we aware of the hindrances to prosperity now existing in the national economy but that we are committed to removing them as soon as possible . 
we are aware those costs are passed along from american businesses to american consumers in higher prices to the tune of $ 8 , 000 per family per year . 
we are aware that exports account for one-sixth of our economic growth , and that one in five american factory jobs and one in three american crop acres depend on customers in foreign markets and that many markets are still closed to our goods . 
we are aware that 60 percent of american businesses are impeded in their growth by the lack of advanced training in the workplace . 
we are aware that our tax system is unfair and inefficient , and that it costs families and businesses billions of dollars and hours every year . 
we are aware that our economy is dangerously dependent on foreign sources of oil , and that it is overrun with frivolous lawsuits that abuse our legal system . 
we are going to take up major legislation addressing these eight sources of economic friction and tear down these eight walls now surrounding the american dream . 
mr. speaker , the issue of competition is one that is lived out and dealt with daily in my congressional district , silicon valley . 
this resolution identifies some of the challenges for u.s. competitiveness . 
one of the top issues in silicon valley today is stock options . 
what has happened is a decline in investment and a diminishment of innovation . 
this resolution correctly points to education as a critical issue of competitiveness , but once again this administration and the congressional majority have underfunded critical education programs . 
these figures do not meet the standards of a great nation serious about her technological and competitive future . 
the resolution states that energy is a major problem , yet the department of energy 's independent analysts have said that the provisions in the house energy bill will have a `` negligible '' impact on prices , production , consumption , and imports of energy . 
mr. speaker , i thank the gentleman from new york for his leadership in defense of our economy , workers ' rights , and our desire to build on an american economy that can provide opportunity for all . 
mr. speaker , if the congress were to take up legislation for the purpose of removing barriers to the competitiveness of the u.s. economy , i do not believe , respectfully , it would read like h. res. 352 . 
nafta caused a balanced trade scenario with mexico to become unbalanced , to the disadvantage of the u.s. ; whereas , exports create jobs ; imports destroy jobs . 
every state in the nation lost jobs due to nafta ; whereas , congress will soon be compounding the damage with consideration of cafta , which is modeled on nafta ; whereas , china 's seemingly endless supply of dollars to acquire ibm , maytag , and now unocal is supplied by america 's huge trade deficit with china . 
now , if congress was to take up legislation for the purpose of removing barriers to the competitiveness of the u.s. economy , it might read like this : whereas , america needs a new trade policy based on the principle that what the u.s. buys from a country should roughly match what it sells to that country ; whereas , the cost of private , for-profit health care is a serious impediment to competitiveness ; whereas , the u.s. paid $ 5 , 270 per capita for health care in 2002 , and two countries with the closest level of spending were germany at $ 2 , 820 and canada $ 2 , 930 , both of which provided universal health care ; whereas , the ceos of ford motor company of canada , gm canada , daimlerchrysler canada wrote in a 2002 letter that `` publicly-funded health care thus accounts for a significant portion of canada 's overall labor cost advantage in auto assembly versus the u.s. which in turn has been a significant factor in maintaining and attracting new auto investment to canada. '' the resolution that we need to hear would say : whereas , h.r. 676 , the u.s. national health insurance act , which has 50 cosponsors , would provide less expensive , high-quality , single-payer health care systems like many u.s. competitors ; whereas , the current course of u.s. economic and health policy is unsustainable , and a day of reckoning could involve the bursting of the housing price bubble , rise of interest rates , budget austerity and the shredding of the social safety net , mass unemployment , and a loss of economic sovereignty . 
mr. speaker , when i looked at today 's floor schedule , i was pleasantly surprised to see an item addressing the issue of declining united states competitiveness in the world . 
the fact is the issue of competitiveness has not been a priority for republican leaders in this congress or in any preceding one in the last 10 years , and i thought perhaps finally the republicans had woken up . 
unfortunately , i was very disappointed when i read the text of the proposal because this plan is nonbinding ; it has really nothing that will make the united states more competitive . 
as many know , i represent silicon valley , along with the gentlewoman from california ( ms. eshoo ) xz4001240 and the gentleman from california ( mr. honda ) xz4001850 , the most creative and innovative place on earth ; and if i were to bring your resolution back to the leaders of the silicon valley , the engineers , the techies , ph.d.s , venture capitalists , educators , ceos , i think i would be laughed all the way back to d.c . 
i suspect that you did not consult with any of the people in the tech industry because , if you did , we would have had something with a little meat on it that meant something . 
we need a sustained commitment to federal funding of r & amp ; d . 
it underfunds the national science foundation by billions of dollars ; and the fact is if we do not count weapons research , this administration has sharply reduced federally funded scientific research , and this nonbinding resolution will not do a darn thing to change it . 
with an exploding deficit , reduced support for education of americans , a door shutting on nobel-level scientists from abroad , no energy policy that will lead to energy independence , this proposal is worse than nothing because the right wing will not take action on competitiveness and will probably say they did something if this stupid and meaningless resolution is permitted to pass . 
they have controlled the house of representatives for 10 years . 
these words do not change those failed policies , and i hope that we turn down this resolution and tell the truth that our policies are threatening the competitiveness of our united states , and this mere meaningless resolution will do nothing , nothing , to solve that . 
mr. speaker , i voted for h. res. 352 because i agree that there are barriers to keeping and creating jobs within the united states and that federal agencies ought to review their rules and policies to improve the competitiveness of our economy . 
but i do not associate myself with the sense of the `` whereas '' clauses that america must adopt foreign values and standards in order to compete economically . 
i also note that the `` whereas '' clauses include partisan distortions and falsehoods that are an ill-considered disservice to the cause of american competitiveness . 
the heavy burden of needless governmental regulation is slowing down hard-driving americans , americans whose diligence and hard work is needed to secure our nation 's economic future . 
the small business administration says that complying with all of the government 's rules and regulations costs small businesses a staggering $ 7 , 000 per employee . 
simply put , the cost of doing business in america is quickly rising . 
it is unacceptable that the cost of frivolous litigation now exceeds $ 230 billion a year . 
we need to focus on eliminating some of the ones we have . 
and i must say that never have i seen a resolution that demonstrates so completely the lack of understanding by the other side of what is necessary to maintain and improve america 's competitiveness in the world economy . 
they go through all of their whereases , but when they get to the therefores , this resolution does nothing , does nothing . 
they ignore what those people who are on the cutting edge of trying to improve america 's competitiveness , those companies that are on the cutting edge of competing in a world economy , their recommendations , one of the first of which is to fully fund no child left behind . 
stop having the raids on the patent and trademark offices of the united states government to fund the general fund . 
the fact of the matter is that this provides nothing , provides nothing that the industries that are on the cutting edge identify as their most important objectives , their most important priorities , and that is to provide for a dramatic and sustained improved investment in education ; a dramatic and sustained improvement in the r & amp ; d of this country , nondefense related , basic r & amp ; d on a permanent basis , something you have not done in 6 years . 
that is the beginning , not the end of the story . 
that is the beginning , is the doubling of the national science foundation , then maintaining it . 
this resolution so completely misses the mark that we wonder why we would spend an hour of our time on the floor dealing with this when there are such important items . 
the problem is that the other side of the aisle already voted for a budget that does not make the r & amp ; d tax credit permanent , voted for a budget that cuts higher education , voted for a budget that cuts elementary secondary education . 
a budget that does not even get close to funding no child left behind , as , again , the companies who are out there competing , not the political rhetoric on the floor , but what they have made after years of discussion . 
finally , the protection of our intellectual properties . 
the protection of our intellectual properties is so terribly important . 
that is the report of what this republican-led congress has done . 
they give us a resolution with a lot of `` whereases , '' a lot of `` whereases. '' no action , just `` whereases . '' 
mr. speaker , none of us could be against removing barriers . 
however , the definition of barriers allows room for a lot of disagreement . 
it is very interesting that the thrust of this resolution is that regulations in the united states are barriers to competitiveness , and yet our economy is linked to a nation which has the maximum number of barriers in terms of regulatory procedures , the economy of china . 
i want to run through a few of the whereases in this very interesting resolution which covers a lot of territory . 
one can not disagree with some of the whereases : whereas our technology is driving economic growth around the world , as shown by the fact that the global market for high-technology goods is growing at a faster rate than the rate for other manufactured goods . 
whereas more than 1 million american jobs are dependent upon research and development ; whereas the cost of medical care in the united states regularly outpaces general inflation . 
whereas 90 percent of americans who are under age 65 and covered by health insurance currently obtain that insurance through employers . 
maybe that is a barrier we want to remove by having a national health care plan which takes some of the burden off employers . 
i would be in favor of that , certainly . 
whereas 85 percent of the jobs are classified as skilled jobs , and in 1950 , only 20 percent were so classified . 
whereas 80 percent of the 50 fastest-growing occupations require education beyond high school . 
is that fact going to lead to a recommendation that we expend more money to improve our education system , that we catch up with some of the nations in the world ? 
in terms of per capita income , ireland has the highest per capita income . 
why , because the irish decided a couple of decades ago to invest wholeheartedly into a state-of-the-art public school system . 
so an irish youngster can develop in the free system right up to the end of his higher education . 
so we agree that this is significant , that 80 percent of the 50 fastest-growing occupations require higher education beyond high school , and yet we are shortchanging our education . 
whereas , despite spending $ 60 billion per year on training , 60 percent of the united states companies are prevented from upgrading technologically by the low education and technical skills level of their workforce . 
whereas , in 2002 , trial lawyers received approximately $ 40 billion from litigation , more than the annual revenues of microsoft and intel , and twice the revenue of coca-cola . 
why did they take a swipe at the trial lawyers in the midst of the whereases ? 
you do not have a whereas about the corporate lawyers , or a whereas about the tremendous amount of corruption in corporate america that the republican party refuses to even hold hearings about . 
enron , worldcom , a whole series of criminal activities that have been unveiled by the attorney general of new york state , nobody wants to deal with that corruption . 
i hope that you will address some of these whereases that i have just mentioned in terms of some answers as to why we do not pursue the obvious , commonsense solutions . 
mr. speaker , in closing , i would like to just cite a few examples of how republican policies have shortchanged the initiatives which they talked about today . 
instead of having an aggressive policy on math and science education , the bush administration has underinvested in proven math and science instruction . 
and south korea , which has one-sixth of the population of the united states , graduates the same number of engineers as the united states . 
instead of keeping the republican promise on education , president bush has already underfunded no child left behind , his own legislation , his own innovation , he has underfunded by more than $ 40 billion . 
instead of investing in research and development to keep the u.s. on the cutting edge of technological advancement , republicans have cut $ 877 million in federal science and technology funding . 
instead of having a national broadband policy , the bush administration has allowed access to broadband to lag . 
instead of passing the 21st century bill to increase energy independence through advances in cutting-edge technology , the republicans have failed to enact any energy bill at all . 
if we were serious , we would have a long discussion of these items before we move on and prepare some real legislation to deal with the shortcomings . 
mr. speaker , i yield back the balance of my time . 
the vexing thing for me is this republican congress and white house has systematically unfunded almost all of those items . 
we heard the numbers from my colleagues , and i will not go back over them , except to remind folks of the recent debate we had over the appropriations bills . 
repeatedly , throughout the debate , as democrats talked about spending more money on a variety of different items , the republican appropriators said , you know , this is the money we have , this is the best we can do with what we have . 
well , let us look at the decisions that left us in the position where `` this is what we have. '' one of the consequences of those decisions is we do not have enough money to fund the research , education and innovation that is necessary . 
all of the items that are ticked off , the national science foundation , the national institutes of health , no child left behind , we all know what they are . 
yet the programs that fund those vital needs , vital needs particularly for blue-collar , middle-class and lower-class workers , are consistently cut , reduced , not funded like they should be because of the budget decisions of this congress . 
part of it certainly is the tax cut . 
that has been the decision of this congress ; supply-side tax cuts for people making a lot of money at the expense of all of these programs we are talking about today . 
at a minimum , i wish they would make a choice , they would say : supply-side tax cuts for people making a lot of money , that is what we support ; that is what we are going to do . 
we can look at the spending decisions of the last 6 years that have seen massive increases in overall federal spending while , at the same time , underfunding these critical items . 
the budget priorities of the republican congress are responsible , and an empty `` sense of congress '' resolution is not going to fix that . 
for almost two centuries , we have been the envy of the world : a dynamic economy ; a hardworking , motivated workforce ; truly the land of opportunity where innovation has thrived . 
it is the culmination of a generation of increased regulation , unsound tax policies , languishing emphasis on math and science education , unchecked health care costs , rampant lawsuit abuse , unfocused research and development funds and a weak trade policy enforcement . 
they are educating their students in math , science and technology , and pumping out record numbers of engineers . 
last year , we began the competitiveness legislative agenda on the floor , and over a period of 8 weeks , we discussed and voted on issues related to keeping and creating keeping jobs in america . 
he talks about a lot of issues that are more important to making america more competitive . 
but he does make an additional point , and that it is always easy to be against something instead of for something . 
and i would like to point out that we have doubled the funding for the national science foundation , and we continue the strong funding of that . 
the gentleman from new york ( mr. owens ) xz4003060 also mentioned a couple of things that i think are important to be addressed in this debate . 
they are trying to run american businesses out of business so that they can have a corner on the market , and that is why we need to have enforceable trade policy , which is part of this resolution . 
that is why education and lifelong learning is part of this resolution . 
but let me just tell the members what china is doing that i think is important to the debate and why i think they should understand why we need to address these issues today instead of putting them off . 
the gentleman from new york ( mr. owens ) mentions the trial lawyers , the $ 40 billion that came out of our economy for trial lawyers . 
one example is in 1995 when the statute of repose was passed , which put commonsense limits on the manufacture of airplanes , and the following year 4 , 000 jobs were created in kansas alone , plus additional jobs all across the united states . 
can we work together to create and keep jobs in america instead of seeing them slide off to other countries ? 
i think education is very important for the future of this economy . 
we need help from the other side of the aisle to get research and development tax relief permanent , and i think we can do that . 
we have more people working today than ever before in the history of our nation . 
the average wage is higher than it has ever been in the history of this nation . 
we have more people owning their own homes today than ever before in the history of this nation , and we have done it because we cut taxes . 
we have barriers that need to be removed so that we can increase the number of jobs and the number of opportunities in america in the future . 
mr. speaker , i thank the gentleman from louisiana ( mr. boustany ) xz4006360 for his leadership on the floor today and his help in these very important issues of making america more competitive tomorrow . 
and there are ways that we can work together to make a more solid economy in the future so that we can retain our number one status in the future instead of falling into a second or third-rate economy . 
we heard talk from the gentleman from ohio ( mr. kucinich ) xz4002270 that it is all because of nafta . 
yet we have more jobs than ever before in the history of our nation . 
why do you not come in on an announced basis , make a list of the violations , let the company have time to make the safe environment at the work area , and then come back and see how they are doing ? 
and they created a safe work environment by working together , working together instead of against each other in an adversarial relationship . 
now , this environment here on the floor of the house is an adversarial environment . 
the resolution correctly says there is a need to overcome barriers to health care security , but it does nothing to help the millions of americans who lack health insurance or to make good health care more affordable . 
the resolution mentions taxes and the complexity of the tax laws , but provides no useful suggestions as to how to reduce that complexity or to promote tax fairness . 
the resolution complains about `` lawsuit abuse '' and seems to support `` litigation management , '' but says nothing about the extent to which the courts can protect individual rights and the essential role of law in our society . 
while that actually is an improvement over the energy-policy bill the house passed earlier this year , with its many wrong-headed provisions , it falls far short of what is needed . 
mr. speaker , i move to suspend the rules and agree to the resolution ( h. res. 352 ) providing that the house of representatives will focus on removing barriers to competitiveness of the united states economy . 
there is a lot of talk about a nonbinding resolution , but this house today is going to take up four bills to reform osha that will help small businesses and their enterprises be more competitive and their employees be more competitive in the global economy . 
we recognize that the plight of the uninsured is a problem . 
this will help get people who are uninsured back on to the rolls of being insured . 
this is the future of health care . 
so to say this is a nonbinding resolution , surely it makes a statement about some of the needs that we need to work on , but at the same time this congress is addressing all of those issues ; and we ask our colleagues across the aisle to join us to pass these bills so that we can help those americans in need and we can increase our competitiveness on the global market . 
i mentioned , as a member of the committee on education and the workforce , that we are going to work on osha reform and ahps . 
yet because of the entrepreneurial spirit of these americans and many small businesses that we have out there , they do survive and even thrive despite all these adversities . 
today , it is a spirit that continues to grow our agricultural influence , despite many adversities , and build small businesses that are grabbing the eye of the global market . 
we have a port , the 11th largest port in the country , the port of lake charles . 
and as it continues to increase in size , it is moving larger numbers of products into the united states and out into the world . 
our economic developers are finding ways to attract businesses that have never before known the advantages of doing business in louisiana . 
lafayette economic development authority is a prime example of showcasing the educational and technological benefits of louisiana 's seventh congressional district to attract companies to our area . 
magazine named lafayette , louisiana , one of the best places to do business . 
and 3 months ago , entrepreneur magazine named lafayette one of the top technology centers in the south , based on its appeal and ability to attract high-tech companies . 
and he is hoping to build his business , employing hopefully in the near future 100 employees , so that he can improve his competitiveness and raise his revenue and contribute to the competitiveness of our country and our defense initiatives . 
there are many examples in louisiana and around this country that are competing , despite the regulatory burden , the tax burden and other added costs of doing business . 
mr. speaker , i reserve the balance of my time . 
i would remind the gentleman that these tax cuts have led to an economic growth of 3.8 percent and significant job growth , so i would remind him that these are pro-economic growth policies . 
mr. speaker , i yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from kansas ( mr. tiahrt ) xz4004050 , who has worked so hard to ensure the competitiveness of this country . 
as the gentleman just mentioned , i was a member of the committee on the judiciary on september 11 , 2001 . 
but as many of you recall , the work product of our committee was rejected at the eleventh hour in favor of a far more expansive act which has continued to raise concerns among those who cherish our constitutional liberties . 
through the patriot act and other anti-terrorism measures , we have become a country that permits secret surveillance , secret searches , denial of court review , monitoring of conversations between citizens and their attorneys , and searching of library and medical records of citizens . 
mr. chairman , reauthorization of this act is an opportunity ; it is an opportunity to restore the checks and balances that must exist in a free society . 
i abstained in the committee on the judiciary this year because i was hoping that some of my concerns could be addressed through a rule that would allow some of these issues to be brought to the floor . 
but i am very disappointed to say that the rule that was adopted for this very important bill is designed to look like it is fair , because it allows a number of amendments , but those amendments are either so sweeping that they will never get anywhere near and should not get a majority of the house to vote for them , or they tinker on the edges of some critical issues . 
there are , to my way of thinking , two critical things that need to be done ; and this rule does not allow them to be done . 
one is addressing the issue of sunsets . 
the chairman bemoans the fact that out in the nation so many people have such a misunderstanding of what the patriot act does or does not do . 
he may feel it is because of the bad motives of the people who talk about it . 
so people read about detentions of people without being indicted or without any deportation proceedings against them and wonder what is going on ; and he is right , many of the things we have read about have nothing whatsoever to do with the patriot act . 
but part of the reason why the chairman can say we had such rigorous oversight , 10 hearings on this subject , continued letters from the chair and the ranking member pushing for information from the justice department , is because of the sunsets . 
the failure of the rule to make the sunsets in order is a tremendous failure , not that all of them need to be reenacted , but on key sections at a time that is relevant for what the american people want , which is within the next 4 or 5 years there should be a chance to have those provisions sunsetted . 
i want to get to just as fundamental an issue , to my way of thinking and that is the issue of the standards for secret orders from fisa courts that allow our law enforcement agencies to pursue terrorist investigations and break up terrorist cells . 
you are allowing orders that are not based on criminal information to be issued by fisa courts , required to be issued by fisa courts , allowing any kind of tangible records to be seized , whether or not they are pertaining to a specific person , if it is connected with , or , in the case of the base bill here , relevant to a terrorist investigation . 
it would have dealt with the limitations that are imposed on law enforcement by too restrictive a standard and , at the same time , clarify that even if it has not yet been misused , it is wrong to provide such a broad standard that records can be swept up that have no connection whatsoever with any relevant target of any terrorist investigation . 
the standard says , if the target of the fisa order or the national security letter is an agent of a foreign power or is in contact with or known to an agent of a foreign power , a definition which deals with all the hypotheticals provided by my friend , the gentleman from california ( mr. daniel e. lungren ) xz4006170 , in criticizing the safe act and pre-patriot act standard , it provides every hypothetical created that i have heard about with the ability to be pursued under fisa orders . 
for these reasons , i am going to be forced to vote `` no '' on this bill for the lack of opportunity to sunset key provisions like the lone-wolf provision , like the issue of national security letters to provide a forcing mechanism for oversight and for our failure to deal with the overly broad standard in the existing law and in the base bill . 
i think underlying the gentleman from michigan 's question , is this not about the difference between the fbi and law enforcement using a national security letter to ask a bank to give it the financial records of all of its customers versus asking the bank to give it the financial records of the specific individuals it suspects might be involved or that it is interested in ? 
i think that is at the heart of the question of the standard . 
you want the focus on something specific , rather than all of the bank 's records of everybody who uses that bank . 
the bank is , not the customers of the bank . 
basically , this is an amendment supported , i am happy to say , by the chairman of the committee on the judiciary , that simply does one thing : it requires the attorney general to report to congress once a year on a survey that it seeks from other agencies of the federal government surveying data-mining technologies in use or in development at federal departments and agencies . 
the modification that i seek simply makes clear that , first of all , any classified information will be submitted in a classified annex and , secondly , that any information regarding data-mining technologies that deals with the sources , intelligence sources and methods , will be available only in the annex to the house permanent select committee on intelligence and the senate select committee on intelligence ; in other words , that to the extent this survey produces anything which should either be classified or deals with sources and methods , the traditional procedures for where that material goes will be maintained . 
mr. chairman , i have indicated to the body what my intention was , and it will be my intention and one to be part of the legislative history that we will ensure that , before this bill becomes law , information about sources and methods go just where they have always gone . 
secondly , this imposes absolutely no burden on any other agency of government other than the attorney general and the justice department . 
it does not encumber any sources or funds they do not want to spend , and it simply asks the attorney general to then compile whatever information those agencies have chosen to provide to the attorney general into a report which will be sent public in the case of information which is not sensitive and classified in an annex classified where it does involve such information . 
the reason , i would suggest to this body , that we will hear some people raising concerns is because the justice department has misrepresented the obligations of both it and other agencies under this amendment . 
the need for this amendment is that we have wasted millions and millions of dollars on implementing database-mining activities which , when they became public , produced such an outrage they were canceled . 
we do not want to tie the hands of our security agencies in gathering this information . 
mr. chairman , i reserve the balance of my time . 
mr. chairman , i yield 1 minute to the gentleman from wisconsin ( mr. sensenbrenner ) xz4003650 , chairman of the committee on the judiciary . 
mr. chairman , in the course of yielding to my next speaker , i just want to remind the body it is one report , once a year , with anything that would tip off anybody about anything that we would not want to happen to be in a classified form , even in the amendment form without modification . 
mr. chairman , i yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from california ( ms. harman ) xz4001660 , ranking member of the permanent select committee on intelligence . 
i offered an amendment to ensure that sources and methods only go to the permanent select committee on intelligence , and a member of the committee on armed services objects , and then the chairman says we are not protecting sources and methods so he has to oppose it . 
mr. chairman , i reserve the balance of my time . 
mr. chairman , i yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from massachusetts ( mr. delahunt ) xz4001020 , the cosponsor of this amendment . 
mr. chairman , the patriot act was enacted in the wake of the 9/11 terrorist attacks , rushed through the house as a suspension bill the day after it was introduced . 
the original bill was rewritten in the rules committee instead of the bipartisan bill that was unanimously passed out of the judiciary committee . 
the policy decisions we make affect the lives of everyday americans . 
it seems that the majority of congress has at least some reservations about this bill . 
i will continue working to give voice to the concerns and the experiences of oregonians , as together we fight against terrorism and protect the rights of each american . 
i am pleased with the efforts that are under way here on the floor to help try to deal with the shape of the patriot act . 
we saw one of these searches in oregon go sideways and devastate the life of a local attorney . 
it is critical both for the civil liberties of americans and for developing the right tools to fight terrorism . 
madam speaker , with the patriot act set to expire at the end of the year , congress has once again missed an opportunity to narrow and tighten the legislation.i opposed the original patriot act , as it was rushed into law in the wake of 9/11 , and i strongly oppose the current conference report . 
the conference report tries to appease both sides of the debate by extending sunsets on the two most controversial provisions , library records and `` roving '' wiretaps , while making 14 of the existing 16 provisions permanent thus limiting congress ' ability to exercise checks and balances . 
it puts the administration on too long of a leash and does not force congress to review and modify the act as needed . 
in terms of the review process , i think the attorney general today in some information he put out suggested that there were at least 23 separate hearings last year of oversight , this is last year alone , of oversight on this act ; witness after witness after witness called to testify about what was happening with the act . 
this oversight work that the chairman has been largely responsible for has made a difference in the way the law was implemented , has made a difference in the way we offer it to be extended today and has made a difference , frankly , in the safety and security of america . 
no one has come up with a single instance where someone 's rights were impacted by the patriot act , because of the patriot act . 
there is no evidence that there are problems , and we all could easily be aware of a number of instances , where there is no concern about the fact that the patriot act made a difference in the safety and security of america . 
another thing that the chairman worked hard to put in this act is some legislation that i originally introduced that deals with the problem of methamphetamine , and methamphetamine does become a security issue . 
people turn to this drug as the drug for funding of illicit activities , as the drug of choice when imported drugs are not available . 
but the patriot act with two provisions that need to be reviewed in 4 years , the patriot act with a judiciary committee and an oversight responsibility that will continue to be , as it has been , extensive in ensuring that the executive branch does what the patriot act intends it to do with the maximum protection for individual freedom and the maximum protection for the security of our nation . 
it is clear we can make reforms to better ensure we are giving law enforcement all of the tools they need while maintaining the appropriate safeguards to protect the very freedoms we cherish . 
last week as the ranking member of the subcommittee on human intelligence with the gentleman from california ( mr. cunningham ) xz4000910 as the chairman , i was able to include a reform so the patriot act ensures greater judicial oversight of government wiretaps . 
the so-called john doe roving wiretaps are a critical tool in our efforts to fight terrorism because they allow surveillance when neither the target 's identity nor location of the interception is known . 
this amendment allows these wiretaps to continue , but requires the government to report back to the courts with an explanation of the facts and circumstances surrounding the rationale of the wiretap . 
this will allow greater oversight of the wiretaps without impeding the government 's need to obtain information on potential terrorist plots quickly . 
this section of the patriot act authorizes expansive authority for john doe roving wiretaps , taps of phones and computers when neither the location nor the identity of the target are known . 
the issa amendment further improves the amendment that i offered during the intelligence committee markup of the patriot act reauthorization bill . 
i rise this afternoon in opposition to this measure which would perpetuate the invasions of civil liberties that are embedded within the 4-year-old patriot act . 
i have deep concerns about many provisions of the original law , such as the use of the appropriately named sneak-and-peek warrants that allow secret searches of homes with delayed notification to the homeowner that a search has occurred . 
the secret search can be in almost any kind of investigation , and the notification to the & lt ; center & gt ; & lt ; pre & gt ; [ page : h6223 ] & lt ; /pre & gt ; & lt ; /center & gt ; but i am going to focus my remarks this afternoon on the two provisions of the original law which i think cause the deepest civil liberties invasion and which the measure before us does not , in my opinion , appropriately reform . 
there is no requirement that the object of the search be an agent of a foreign power . 
the only requirement is that the seizure be relevant to a terrorism investigation , but there is no procedure by which a court would make that finding of relevance before the seizure occurs . 
frankly , there is no meaningful way through the use of this provision to ensure that privacy and fundamental civil liberties are protected . 
it is the unilateral ability of law enforcement to issue these letters and seize records without prior court review that i find to be the most troubling . 
i would note that one federal court has found the section 505 national security letter provisions to be an abridgement of both the first and the fourth amendments to the u.s. constitution . 
secondly , i strongly oppose the patriot act 's grant to law enforcement of the ability to go to the foreign intelligence surveillance court and obtain an order permitting the seizure of library , bookstore , bank , or medical records of a person who is not even the subject of an investigation . 
while the custodian of the records could challenge the seizure , the library , the hospital , the bookstore , or the bank in possession of those records has a lot less incentive to spend resources hiring a lawyer in order to resist the seizure than would the person whose records are about to be seized ; but that person , the real party of interest , never knows that the seizure is about to occur . 
the house recently voted by a margin of 238-187 to bar enforcement of this overly broad provision , but the bill before us with minor changes perpetuates it and , i think , in an inappropriate way . 
law enforcement could go before a court and present evidence of probable cause that a crime has been committed , and by that showing obtain the records that it needs in both of these situations . 
these powers conferred by the original patriot act under sections 505 and 515 are designed primarily for the convenience of law enforcement , but mere convenience should not be a reason for a deep abridgement of privacy and individual rights . 
the protection of our freedoms does not require surrender of our long-held civil liberties . 
in the past year , we have asked the department of justice how it is using the authority granted to it under the patriot act . 
some of our questions simply went unanswered . 
however , all of that changed in april of this year when the justice department realized that a straight reauthorization of the patriot act would not happen without serious answers to our reasonable questions . 
i have no doubt that if 16 provisions of the law were not scheduled to sunset at the end of this year , we would still have little information about how these authorities have been used . 
members of the majority have stressed today that the committee on the judiciary has held 12 patriot act hearings in recent months . 
all 16 of the sunsets that were contained in the original law would be reinserted through this motion to recommit . 
i think most would agree that the breadth of many of these provisions creates , at a minimum , the potential for abuse and we , therefore , have an obligation to conduct rigorous oversight to ensure that civil liberties are protected . 
madam speaker , i yield for the purpose of making a unanimous consent request to the gentleman from virginia ( mr. scott ) xz4003641 . 
madam speaker , i rise today in support of the boucher-rohrabacher-mack motion to instruct the conferees to recede to the senate with respect to sunsetting in 4 years the libraries and book stores , roving wire taps and loan wolf provisions of the usa patriot act . 
the most effective way for congress to maintain oversight of the most controversial powers that the patriot act conveys is to sunset those provisions within a reasonable period of time . 
in past years , well before the december 2005 sunsets contained in the original patriot act , we asked the department of justice how it was using the authorities that had been granted to the department by the original act . 
all of that changed in april of this year when the department of justice realized that straight reauthorization of the patriot act would not happen without serious answers to our reasonable questions . 
i have no doubt that if 16 provisions of the original act were not scheduled to sunset at the end of this year , we would still have little information on how these new authorities were being used . 
if we have learned one thing over the last 4 years , it is that we will not get answers to our questions unless the justice department is compelled to come before us and justify its use of the more dangerous and intrusive powers that the law confers . 
remember , sunsets do not in any way hinder law enforcement 's use of the powers the patriot act confers . 
section 215 of the law puts personal records , including library , bookstore and medical records , up for grabs by law enforcement with no requirement that the person whose records are sought be suspected of involvement in a crime . 
it could be an investigation of someone the person has never met and about whom the person has no knowledge . 
so people have no way of knowing when their privacy has been intruded upon . 
earlier this year , the house , by a wide margin , voted to bar enforcement of this overly broad provision . 
section 206 , john doe roving wiretaps , allows law enforcement to obtain a single court order to tap any phone it believes a foreign agent would use , instead of getting separate orders for each phone . 
moreover , the government is not required to name the target which allows wiretaps on phones of virtually anyone meeting the description of a john doe . 
the combination of allowing blanket tapping of , for example , all of the pay phones in a target 's neighborhood or the phones of all of his friends and relatives , combined with the ability to wiretap a vaguely described john doe , means that roving john doe wiretaps require so little specificity that they can easily be abused . 
madam speaker , i reserve the balance of my time . 
for basis of clarification , the motion to instruct that we have put forward applies to lone wolf , as the gentleman from wisconsin indicates . 
madam speaker , i reserve the balance of my time . 
madam speaker , i am pleased to yield 4 minutes to the distinguished ranking member of the house committee on intelligence , the gentlewoman from california ( ms. harman ) xz4001660 . 
madam speaker , i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from new york ( mr. nadler ) xz4002890 , a distinguished member of the house judiciary committee . 
madam speaker , i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from maryland ( mr. hoyer ) xz4001890 , the distinguished minority whip of the house . 
madam speaker , i rise in support of the motion to instruct . 
when it was passed , there were concerns that some of the authorities were too broad or too susceptible to abuse . 
the proposal emerged to sunset 16 of the most controversial provisions . 
the sunsets would allow the justice department and the public to evaluate the effectiveness of these provisions and decide whether there was a continuing need for them or a need to modify them . 
that is why i offered an amendment to extend the patriot act sunsets during the intelligence committee markup of h.r. 3199 . 
oversight and accountability is an essential element of the patriot act . 
mr. speaker , i yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from texas ( ms. jackson-lee ) xz4001990 , another distinguished member of the house judiciary committee . 
mr. speaker , i yield myself the balance of my time . 
mr. speaker , first of all , i want to commend the gentleman from california ( mr. rohrabacher ) xz4003430 and the gentleman from florida ( mr. mack ) xz4006220 for partnering with us and structuring this motion to instruct conferees . 
i want to express appreciation to the gentleman from wisconsin ( mr. sensenbrenner ) xz4003650 for his constructive comments and for his support of the motion to instruct . 
recent history clearly shows that in the absence of a near-term sunset we will not get answers to our questions about how controversial law enforcement powers are being used . 
in the absence of a near-term sunset , we can not ensure that civil liberties are being protected . 
this is not a matter about what the department of justice has done in the past , and i differ with the gentleman from wisconsin on this matter . 
this is all about what the department of justice may do in the future . 
adopt this motion , let us adopt the senate 's 4-year sunsets and , in doing so , further the cause of protecting americans ' civil liberties . 
mr. speaker , i urge approval of the motion to instruct . 
mr. speaker , i yield back the balance of my time . 
mr. chairman , i certainly want to thank the gentleman from wisconsin ( chairman sensenbrenner ) for putting together this excellent extension and reauthorization of the usa patriot act . 
mr. chairman , america faced a new kind of enemy on september 11 , one that mercilessly attacked civilians on our own shores . 
today , we have a great opportunity to send a strong message of support for several provisions of this bill which would have expired on december 1. i specifically want to mention the library section . 
the purpose of this legislation was when it was originally created and now as we extend it to protect americans . 
opponents have waged a campaign of misinformation . 
for that reason , i fully support the reauthorization of the expiring patriot act , and i thank the gentleman from wisconsin ( chairman sensenbrenner ) for his work on this issue . 
i would just like to reiterate and rise in support of this amendment . 
as the gentleman from north carolina ( mr. coble ) xz4000760 indicated , there are real cases that have been uncovered and have been tried in court in which known terrorist organizations such as hezbollah have been engaged in the illegal trafficking of cigarettes from low tax states into high tax states using that money to fund their terrorist activities . 
i rise today in support of the rule and the underlying legislation . 
the usa patriot and terrorism prevention reauthorization act of 2005 provides america with the necessary tools to protect our homeland from terrorist threats while maintaining our cherished freedoms . 
i think the patriot act is debated every day in the halls not only of congress but workplaces , certainly law enforcement officers ; and i think all of us are trying to strike that balance between protecting personal liberties and protecting the homeland . 
the amendment that i wish to address is extremely timely today , unfortunately , for those living in great britain in that it will reform the wrecking trains statute of 1940 to impose greater penalties for those who seek to terrorize individuals on mass transportation , particularly trains . 
we are seeing this morning the news out of london that another attack has been orchestrated , although i did not see the details of exactly who and what is accountable for that . 
but it sends shivers down the spine , i think , of every american knowing the pain and suffering that is going on in london as we speak . 
it is important in this amendment that i am going to be offering to realize that current legal practices are not punitive enough to be any kind of a deterrent to anybody who is considering a massive or a large attack on trains or mass transportation . 
i support this rule , i support the debate that we are going to see going forth , and i support the reauthorization of the patriot act . 
mr. chairman , millions of americans travel to work , school and other activities aboard trains , buses , planes , and other forms of mass transportation . 
our railways are also a primary method of shipping raw materials and manufactured goods across the country . 
the openness of our rail and mass transportation network makes it a target for terrorists who would attack our nation . 
richard reid , now known as the shoe bomber , actually had a charge against him dismissed because current law does not explicitly define an airplane as a vehicle for the purpose of prosecuting . 
this amendment would change that and bring updated and uniform protections to all forms of railroad carriers and mass transportation providers . 
my amendment establishes penalties of up to 20 years for a person who knowingly wrecks , derails , or sets fire to a rail or mass transportation vehicle or knowingly disables on-track equipment or signals . 
the penalty is increased with life imprisonment with death-penalty eligibility if an attack results in the death of a person . 
i first offered this amendment last october in the wake of the terrorist attack against the rail system in madrid . 
mr. chairman , i reserve the balance of my time . 
a person found guilty of a threat or conspiracy could face a sentence up to 20 years . 
certainly i agree we need to put money into port security around the nation , and we are doing that ; but we need to go at this problem of terrorism with a full frontal attack . 
mr. chairman , i reserve the balance of my time . 
i think in view of what is happening to the mass transit systems around the world , we have heard a lot of hue and cry about helping to protect our mass transit systems in this country . 
i urge passage of the amendment . 
mr. speaker , i rise today in support of the rule and the underlying patriot act reauthorization . 
i would like to take a minute to highlight two aspects of this legislation that we probably will not hear a whole lot about today , but are very important to me . 
this provision , section 110 of the conference report , will ensure that those who conspire to commit attacks against our rail systems or fund such attacks can be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law . 
while no penalties can deter some of these terrorists bent on causing death and destruction , these enhanced penalties on conspirators will hinder the efforts of terrorists to secure and finance their networks . 
i would like to thank chairman sensenbrenner and all the members who supported this important provision to add another layer of protection to america 's rail systems . 
in west virginia , meth labs have been found in neighborhoods , endangering children and innocent members of the community . 
provisions of this bill enhance penalties for those who run meth labs in the presence of children . 
this bill also places restrictions on the sale of meth precursor chemicals that are similar to those that the west virginia legislature passed earlier this year and other legislatures throughout the country . 
this program has already provided assistance to local law enforcement in many districts , including the metro drug task force in my hometown of charleston , west virginia . 
mr. chairman , i rise in support of h.r. 3199 , the usa patriot and terrorism prevention reauthorization act of 2005 . 
following the terrorist attacks on september 11 , 2001 , congress undertook a review of bush administration proposals to strengthen our laws relating to counterterrorism . 
the law took account of new changes in technology that are used by terrorists , such as cell phones , the internet , and encryption technologies . 
it vests the secretary of the treasury with regulatory powers to combat corruption of u.s. financial institutions for foreign money laundering purposes . 
indeed , the patriot act gives federal prosecutors many of the same tools to use against terrorists that congress has already granted them to use against drug traffickers , for example . 
the original act also creates judicial safeguards for e-mail monitoring and grand jury disclosures ; recognizes innocent owner defenses to forfeiture ; and entrusts enhanced anti-money laundering powers to those regulatory authorities whose concerns include the well being of our financial institutions . 
congress did not grant all of the authority the president sought in the first patriot act , and sunsetted much of the act 's authority in 2005 . 
many of the wiretapping and foreign intelligence amendments sunset on december 31 , 2005 . 
i believe that congress should exercise greater oversight of the use of new authority under the patriot act , as i have some misgivings about the administration 's use of the new powers under the patriot act . 
over the past few years i have continued to insist on greater oversight by congress of the justice department as it executes its new powers . 
i am disappointed that the house leadership did not make in order amendments that would have : exempted library and bookstore records from foreign intelligence surveillance act ( fisa ) searches ; reformed the roving wiretap authority in fisa cases to contain the same privacy safeguards as roving wiretaps in criminal cases ; established the traditional fisa standards for search warrants ; required individual suspicion for records orders ; allowed citizens to challenge secrecy orders in records requests ; and extended the sunset clauses for numerous other provisions of the patriot act . 
i voted in favor of a number of bipartisan amendments to limit the justice department 's power and increase congressional and judicial oversight of the executive branch , including : requiring the fbi director to personally approve searches of library or bookstore records ; additional reporting to courts by law enforcement when they change surveillance locations under a `` roving wiretap '' ; allowing recipients of national security letters to consult with an attorney and challenge the letters in court ; and increasing reporting requirements and making it more difficult to obtain `` sneak and peak '' search warrants , which entail secret searches of homes and offices with delayed notice . 
we must not repeat the mistakes of the past , when the united states sacrificed the civil rights of particular individuals or groups in the name of security . 
whether in times of war or peace , finding the proper balance between government power and the rights of the american people is a delicate and extremely important process . 
it is a task that rightly calls into play the checks and balances that the founders created in our system of government . 
all three branches of government have their proper roles to play in making sure the line is drawn appropriately , as we upheld our oaths to support the constitution . 
i support h.r. 3199 but i hope as this legislation works its way through congress , we will include sunsets on the provisions we are reauthorizing , so that congress will continue to oversee the executive branch 's use of these new powers . 
madam speaker , i rise in support of the conference report for h.r. 3199 , the usa patriot and terrorism prevention reauthorization act of 2005 . 
through the patriot act congress has attempted the essential task of modernizing law enforcement tools to effectively combat the 21st century terrorist , who can now use cell phones , the internet , and e-mails to plan and coordinate attacks in the united states . 
as originally enacted in october 2001 , many patriot act provisions are set to expire at the end of this month if congress takes no action . 
the conference report before us extends and improves many provisions of the patriot act . 
i do have significant concerns and misgivings about the administration 's use of the new powers of the patriot act , and i am pleased that this legislation addresses many of these concerns . 
this legislation : includes three sunset provisions for patriot act authorities ; requires greater oversight by congress and the judiciary of the justice department ; and gives new rights to subjects of a government investigation . 
given the complexity and importance of this measure , let me review these provisions in some detail . 
the 4-year sunsets adopted by the conference report apply to business records , roving wiretaps , and `` lone-wolf ' terrorist suspects who operate alone rather than as an agent of a foreign power . 
the conference report adopts the senate position of 4-year sunsets , and rejected the house position of 10-year sunsets . 
under the business records provision , section 215 of the patriot act , the bill provides that the government may seek a court order for `` any tangible item '' if law enforcement officials assert that the records are sought in an effort to obtain foreign intelligence or in a terrorism investigation . 
the application to the fisa court , the foreign intelligence surveillance act court , must provide a `` statement of facts '' proving that the information sought is `` relevant '' to the investigation . 
the bill requires new high-level approval by one of the top three fbi officials for certain records , including library records , medical records , educational records , and tax return records . 
the bill has several new requirements for the justice department , including : issuing `` minimization procedures '' which limits the retention of , and prohibits dissemination of , information concerning u.s. persons ; conducting two separate audits of the fbi 's use of section 215 orders , which will examine any improper or illegal use of this authority , and the manner in which such information is collected , retained , analyzed , and disseminated by the fbi ; and requiring the public reporting of the aggregate use of section 215 orders , and a breakdown of its use to congress -- comparisons of library , medical , educational records , for example . 
the roving wiretaps provision , section 206 of the patriot act , provides that the fisa court may issue `` roving '' wiretaps to conduct surveillance on a foreign power or their agent when the target of surveillance has taken steps to thwart the investigation by changing accommodations , cell phones , internet accounts , or other forms of communications . 
the bill requires court orders for roving wiretaps to describe in detail the specific target in cases in which the target 's identity is unknown , higher burden than current law , and requires more detailed and timely reporting by the fbi to the courts and congress on the use of this authority . 
congress also requires the justice department to report to congress finally , the conference reports places some new restrictions on delayed notice search warrants , commonly called `` sneak and peek '' , under section 213 of the patriot act . 
this type of search warrant , which existed before the patriot act was adopted , requires that a federal judge must find that there is probable cause to believe that : ( 1 ) a crime has been or is about to be committed ; ( 2 ) evidence of those crimes will be found at the location to be searched ; and ( 3 ) immediate notice would cause harm under certain specified criteria . 
the bill also requires new reporting to congress on the use of this provision . 
madam speaker , we must not repeat the mistakes of the past , when the united states sacrificed the civil rights of particular individuals or groups in the name of security . 
whether in times of war or peace , finding the proper balance between government power and the rights of the american people is a delicate and extremely important process . 
it is a task that rightly calls into play the checks and balances that the founders created in our system of government . 
all three branches of government have their proper roles to play in making sure the line is drawn appropriately , as we uphold our oaths to support the constitution . 
mr. chairman , i rise in support of my amendment , the terrorist death penalty enhancement act . 
many of these same provisions were overwhelmingly passed by this house last year as part of the 9/11 recommendations implementation act , but removed during conference with the senate . 
as a former state district judge for over 20 years i have presided over five capital murder cases , three of which resulted in the death penalty . 
i have a unique perspective on the criminal justice system and i understand the importance of safety and the need for america to be tough on its criminals . 
we must protect our neighborhoods from the threat of violent crimes which , unfortunately , in today 's world , includes the threat of terrorist attacks . 
i believe it is also an instrument that can deter acts of terrorism and serves as a tool for prosecutors in negotiating sentences . 
first , my amendment adds a new criminal provision to impose the death penalty to any terrorist who , while committing a terrorist offense , engages in conduct that results in the death of an individual . 
second , my amendment provides procedures for the death penalty prosecution of air piracy crimes committed before the 1994 federal death penalty act . 
third , my amendment treats terrorist offenses similar to treason and espionage cases so that the government need only prove that such offense created a grave risk of death and did not actually result in the death of a person . 
for example , consider a terrorist attack as we saw today in london , where a terrorist is carrying a deadly weapon , could be a radiological weapon or device , and prior to the total detonation of that bomb killing innocent civilians , he is caught by the authorities and they prevent that attack . 
under this bill he could face the ultimate penalty of death . 
in addition to these commonsense reforms , my amendment also authorizes the death penalty for killing that results from participation in nuclear weapons and weapons of mass destruction threats against the united states , missile systems to destroy aircraft , atomic weapons under the atomic energy act . 
now , with the authorization of these new death penalties i have added some commonsense clarification to the federal death penalty which is supported by the justice department . 
let me highlight three of these . 
first , my amendment adds a new statutory aggravating factor for obstruction of justice and in particular the killing of any person which is aimed at obstructing any investigation or prosecution . 
third , my amendment authorizes a judge to proceed with a death penalty case with less than 12 jurors if the excusal of the 12th juror is justified by good cause . 
mr. chairman , i reserve the balance of my time . 
mr. chairman , i would remind my colleague from virginia that a legislative hearing was held before the subcommittee on june 30 , 2005 on which the justice department testified in favor of this bill . 
mr. chairman , i am pleased that the president of the united states on two occasions has stated that we need to give our law enforcement authorities all the tools necessary to fight terrorism , and he agreed that he strongly supported the signal of a death penalty to deter this criminal acts , these criminal acts that are imposed upon our society . 
i thank the gentleman from wisconsin ( chairman sensenbrenner ) for allowing me to offer this amendment and for all the great work that he has done on this reenactment of the patriot act . 
mr. chairman , i yield back the balance of my time . 
madam speaker , as an original cosponsor of h.r. 3899 , the combat methamphetamine epidemic act , and as a committed member of the congressional caucus to fight and control methamphetamine , i rise in support of its passage , as title vii in h.r. 3199 , the usa patriot improvement and reauthorization act of 2005 . 
i would like to thank congressman mark souder , the chief sponsor of h.r. 3889 , for his leadership in addressing our methamphetamine epidemic . 
last year , congressman souder visited my district in order to fully understand first-hand the unique challenges we in hawaii face , to hear of our efforts to keep drugs out of our homes and communities , and to see our successes in our fight against the scourge of crystal methamphetamine , ice . 
and he just returned to address the 2nd annual national methamphetamine legislative and policy conference of the national alliance for model state drug laws , congressman souder has not just talked , but acted . 
we in hawaii share many of the same concerns as others in our nation in regard to the need to support drug control , education , prevention , and treatment efforts . 
however , our geographic isolation , not only from the contiguous united states but also from our neighbor islands to the island of oahu , must be taken into account as we work to end the scourge of crystal methamphetamine . 
general drug abuse , of course , has plagued many of our communities for decades . 
title vii of h.r. 3199 is essential in our efforts to address methamphetamine trafficking , both in the united states and abroad . 
it would classify pseudoephedrine , ephedrine , and phenylpropanolamine , the major methamphetamine precursor chemicals , as `` scheduled listed chemicals. '' it would repeal the federal `` blister pack exemption '' that currently allows unlimited sales of pseudoephedrine pills . 
the bill would also require information sharing from importers on the `` chain of custody '' from foreign manufacturer to u.s. shores of methamphetamine precursor chemicals . 
i look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle on initiatives to provide the federal resources and support we need in our fight against methamphetamine . 
mahalo , thank you , for this opportunity to express support for title vii of h.r. 3199 . 
madam speaker , today i rise in support of this conference report . 
and as a conferee , i want to specially thank chairman sensenbrenner for his leadership in negotiating the final details of this very important legislation . 
but significant threats continue to exist , endangering the lives of u.s. citizens . 
when the house first considered the original patriot act , i was one of several on the judiciary committee who sought to include sunset provisions that would require congress to reauthorize the legislation after conducting vigorous oversight . 
furthermore , the committee conducted a nearly 12-hour markup of this legislation , including consideration of 43 amendments . 
as chairman of the subcommittee on the constitution , we have held patriot act oversight hearings in my subcommittee , and we remain committed to monitoring the implementation of this legislation through aggressive oversight . 
i am pleased that another 4-year sunset of the more controversial provisions and several additional safeguards to further protect civil liberties were included in the conference report , and i thank chairman sensenbrenner for that . 
the goal of our enemies is to destroy america and its allies . 
we must remain steadfast in our resolve to eradicate the plague of terrorism . 
over the past 3 years , the patriot act has played a key role in the prevention of terrorist attacks right here in the united states . 
prior to the patriot act , the ability of government agencies to share information with each other was limited , which kept investigators from fully understanding what terrorists might be planning and to prevent their attacks . 
the u.s. attorney for the northern district of indiana , joseph van bokkelen , explained , `` if an assistant u.s. attorney learned through the use of a grand jury that there was a planned terrorist attack in northern indiana , he or she could not share that information with the cia. '' the patriot act brought down the wall separating intelligence agencies from law enforcement and other entities charged with protecting the nation from terrorism . 
and to date , there has not been one verified case of civil liberties abuse . 
mr. chairman , i urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the reauthorization of the patriot act and to give our government the tools it needs to succeed in the war on terrorism . 
mr. speaker , about 9 or 10 months ago , a constituent of mine approached me back home and he said , howard , we have got to get rid of this patriot act . 
i said , give me one example of how the patriot act has adversely affected you . 
i said , give me an example of how the patriot act has adversely affected anyone known to you . 
i am afraid , mr. speaker , that this is how the patriot act has been portrayed : accusations of compromising our freedoms , but virtually no hard facts or evidence to support these accusations . 
and at the conclusion of our conversation , my constituent said to me , well , i guess maybe i have heard wrong information . 
now , this is one dozen public hearings , mr. speaker , where the patriot act was the beneficiary or the target of an exhaustive , deliberate examination , in detail . 
one of those reasons , mr. speaker , in my opinion , is the presence of the patriot act . 
no evidence of it . 
the hearings indicated no abuse on the part of the federal government , the u.s. government , to protect us . 
i have the fear that one of these days these evil people driven by fanaticism will attack us again , but they have not since 9/11 ; and i think for that we should all be very thankful , and i think for that we should attribute some of that to the presence of the patriot act . 
i urge the passage of this rule , mr. speaker . 
i mentioned during the rule debate earlier , mr. chairman , about a constituent of mine who complained about the patriot act but he had no specifics . 
there has been some talk about sunsetting provisions of the act ; 216 and 206 will , in fact , be sunsetted . 
but in these two instances , mr. chairman , there was no evidence of abuse or any violation at all , but these two were sunsetted because , among the other sections in the act , these two seemed to attract most of the controversy . 
so these are the two that stood out controversially but , i reiterate , still no evidence of abuse . 
i think we in the committee on the judiciary have done a thorough job of exhausting and deliberating a very , very important act , and i believe that one reason why we have not been attacked subsequently from 9/11 is because of the presence of the patriot act . 
mr. chairman , i rise in support of the amendment to reduce crime and terrorism at america 's seaports . 
this amendment is long overdue and reflects the hard work and dedication of my colleagues , the gentleman from california ( mr. schiff ) xz4003610 , the gentleman from virginia ( mr. forbes ) xz4001370 and the gentleman from florida ( mr. stearns ) xz4003880 to an issue of critical importance to our nation 's safety . 
i want to thank all of them for their effort to this end . 
the amendment that we are offering today will protect our seaports by controlling access to seaports on sensitive areas , providing additional authority to the coast guard to investigate vessels , prohibiting use of dangerous weapons or explosives on a passenger vessel , protecting coast guard navigational aides on waterways , prohibiting transportation of dangerous materials by potential terrorists , prohibiting destruction or interference with vessels or maritime facilities , increasing penalties for illegal foreign shipments on vessels , increasing penalties for noncompliance with manifest requirements , increasing criminal penalties for stowaways on vessels , and , finally , increasing penalties for bribery of port security authorities and officials . 
the coble amendment reverses two statutes of federal indian policy . 
oppose the coble amendment. '' well , oftentimes in this body , mr. chairman , we engage in semantical wars , and i disagree with the choice of these words ; but in any event , we have resolved the differences . 
mr. chairman , i urge the support of the modified amendment before us to strengthen the contraband cigarette trafficking act , commonly known as ccta . 
a scheme that was uncovered illustrates the magnitude of this problem . 
in 2003 , a group of hezbollah operatives were convicted of buying cigarettes in my home state of north carolina and selling them in michigan . 
they were using the proceeds of their operation to fund the activities of hezbollah . 
law enforcement authorities across the nation believe these types of smuggling operations are a fast-growing problem . 
mr. chairman , my amendment would enhance the provisions of the ccta to enable law enforcement to prosecute more of these schemes . 
first , the amendment would lower the threshold requirements for a violation of the ccta from 60 , 000 to 10 , 000 cigarettes . 
it would apply the ccta to smokeless tobacco as well , and impose reporting requirements on those engaging in delivery sales of more than 10 , 000 cigarettes , or 500 cans of packages of smokeless tobacco within a period of 1 month . 
finally , it would authorize state and local governments and certain persons holding federal tobacco permits to bring causes of action against violators of the ccta . 
we must do everything we can to choke off this source of funding for criminal organizations which , in turn , subsidize terrorist organizations ; and i urge adoption of the amendment . 
mr. chairman , i reserve the balance of my time . 
mr. chairman , i yield the balance of my time to the distinguished gentleman from virginia ( mr. cantor ) xz4000600 . 
mr. chairman , i will just say that i look forward to working with the chairman of the full committee and the ranking member , as well as the ranking member of the subcommittee to resolve any other issues that may remain in conference . 
i spoke earlier on this floor , mr. speaker , of a constituent who urged me to lead an effort to repeal the patriot act . 
other opponents of the act have likewise been unable to document evidence of abuses . 
finally , mr. speaker , i am going to touch on a point that i think many americans have inadvertently ignored , and that is the fact that there are in excess of 360 ports in the united states and this bill provides basic and much-needed protection thereto . 
but it is a piece of legislation that should be enacted , and i urge support . 
mr. speaker , today , i rise in protest of rules committee 's refusal to make the sanders library amendment in order . 
it simply would have protected the reading habits of our own citizens from government snooping . 
it passed by a vote of 238-187 . 
consider this : the american library association has confirmed that the government , under some authority , has gone to a library , and asked for a list of everyone who checked out a book on osama bin laden . 
clearly , in the wake of the september 11 attacks , many innocent people are checking out books on osama bin laden . 
we must demand that they show some wrong doing on behalf of library patrons before they dive into their personal habits . 
let me also note that we tried to offer an amendment to increase the safety and security of our nation 's ports , rails , and mass transit systems by providing those segments of the transportation industry with the necessary tools and resources to reduce identified risks and vulnerabilities , but were shut down by the majority . 
in light of today 's bombing incident in london , it is all the more objectionable that the majority would foreclose critical amendments for the patriot act reauthorization on the floor . 
ladies and gentlemen of the house , let me say from the outset that every member of this body wants to make sure that law enforcement officials have the tools they need to protect the american people from terrorism . 
i also know that all of us want to make sure that we protect our civil liberties and freedoms as we fight terrorists anywhere in the world and in this country as well . 
i support the majority of the 166 provisions of the patriot act . 
in fact , in the first original patriot act , i helped write many of them in a version of the bill that passed the committee on the judiciary 36-0 , but a bill we never saw after it left the committee on the judiciary . 
it was replaced in the middle of the night in the committee on rules . 
in some sense this is not really about the patriot act , the debate that is going on here , or even most of the 16 provisions scheduled to sunset this year . 
the provision has been difficult to oversee since targets of fbi investigations under the law are not permitted to tell anybody about it , even their lawyer . 
the department of justice and the chairman of the committee on the judiciary say that this provision has never been used on libraries and bookstores . 
like section 215 , recipients are forever prevented from telling anyone they received a letter under penalty of law . 
it was not in the bill originally reported by the committee on the judiciary and was slipped in by the department of justice or the administration when the bill was first written a few years back . 
it has been used more than 240 times , and it has been delayed sometimes for over a year before anybody can be told what happened , that they were broken into , they were burglarized , they had things taken out of their home . 
worse yet , only 10 percent of these uses had anything to do with terrorism , which is the whole purpose of the patriot act . 
if we have learned anything over the last 4 years , the only thing that makes the administration give us any information on oversight on the use of these new powers was the sunset provision . 
we have also learned of abuses during our oversight that has led to us making modifications . 
the lessons of september 11 and london , and even today in london , are that if we allow law enforcement to do their work free of political interference , give them adequate resources and modern technologies , we can protect our citizens without intruding on our liberties . 
we all fight terrorism , but we need to fight it the right way consistent with our constitution and in a manner that serves as a model for the rest of the world . 
mr. chairman , i reserve the balance of my time . 
mr. chairman , i yield 4 1/2 minutes to the gentleman from virginia ( mr. boucher ) xz4000430 , a distinguished member of the committee on the judiciary . 
mr. chairman , to the gentleman from california ( mr. daniel e. lungren ) xz4006170 , i am preparing a list of 10 instances of where there have been abuses that have been reported . 
abuses of the usa patriot act while some have suggested that no abuses have occurred under the usa patriot act , the simple truth is that it appears that abuses have indeed occurred . 
the following are examples : section 215 , seizure of records or `` any tangible thing '' since 9/11 , the american library association found that libraries have received over 200 formal and informal requests for materials , including 49 requests from federal officers . 
abuse in the brandon mayfield case : the fbi used section 218 to secretly break into his house , download the contents of four computer drives , take dna evidence and take 355 digital photographs . 
abuse in lynne stewart case : a district court threw out charges of materials support against lynne stewart , holding that the law makes any action by a lawyer in support of an alleged foreign terrorist client illegal , including providing legal advice . 
abuse in sami al-hussayen case : a federal jury in idaho acquitted university of idaho graduate student al-hussayen on all charges of providing material support for a terrorist organization by running a website for the islamic assembly of north america . 
importantly , this group is not on the list of foreign terrorist organizations , and the links posted by al-hussayen were available on the government 's own website . 
bobby scott , doj said section 213 had been used 153 times as of 1/31/2005 ; only eighteen ( 11.8 % ) uses involved terrorism investigations . 
thus , almost 90 % of `` sneak and peek '' warrants were used in ordinary criminal investigations : 97 warrants were used in drug investigations and 38 were used in other criminal investigations . 
abuse of delays : in april 2005 , doj said 90-day delays are common , and that delays in notification have lasted for as long as 180 days . 
abuse of delays for `` unspecified times '' : delays may be sought for an unspecified duration , including until the end of the investigation . 
abuse of delay extensions : in may 2003 , doj reported it had asked for 248 delay notification extensions , including multiple extension requests for a single warrant , and that the courts had granted every single request . 
abuse of `` catch-all provision '' : in an april 4 , 2005 letter to chairman sensenbrenner , doj reports 92 out of 108 ( 85 % ) sneak and peek warrants were justified because notification would `` seriously jeopardize the investigation '' and in 28 instances that was the sole ground for delaying notice . 
the southern district of new york held section 505 violated the 1st and 4th amendments . 
oddly , new york law enforcement has begun using the provision of the patriot act that protects against attacks on mass transit to forcefully kick homeless persons out of the new york train stations . 
mr. chairman , i yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from california ( ms. zoe lofgren ) xz4002450 , a distinguished member of the committee on the judiciary . 
mr. chairman , i am pleased to yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from california ( mr. berman ) xz4000250 , a senior member of the committee on the judiciary . 
mr. chairman , i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from massachusetts ( mr. delahunt ) xz4001020 , a former prosecutor and a member of the committee on the judiciary . 
mr. chairman , i yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from california ( ms. waters ) xz4004220 , a distinguished member of the judiciary committee . 
mr. chairman , i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from north carolina ( mr. watt ) xz4004240 , the chairman of the congressional black caucus and a distinguished member of the judiciary committee . 
mr. chairman , i yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from wisconsin ( ms. baldwin ) xz4000130 , a former member of the committee on the judiciary . 
mr. chairman , i yield the balance of my time to the distinguished gentleman from massachusetts ( mr. meehan ) xz4002690 . 
could i ask the gentleman from virginia ( mr. scott ) xz4003641 or the gentleman from massachusetts ( mr. delahunt ) xz4001020 , is this not kind of unusual ? 
well , maybe i should ask the author of the bill , if he is on the floor , why this has not had committee consideration . 
is the author of the amendment here ? 
i was wondering if this was sent over to the chairman of the committee at some earlier point in time . 
normally i thought it was the jurisdiction of the subcommittee on criminal justice in the committee on the judiciary of the house that would be considering this matter . 
the major problem is that under this amendment the fbi can still compel personal records of anyone if they are relevant to an investigation , even if the person whose records they seek is not suspected of criminal or terrorist activities . 
may i ask the author of this bill whether or not that is true ? 
is it not true that the fbi can still compel personal records even if a person is not suspected of any criminal or terrorist activities ? 
mr. chairman , i would ask the gentleman from arizona if he feels that this cures the problem , or does he have some of the reluctance that the gentleman from new york , a co-author of the amendment , has about it not going far enough . 
but does the gentleman know there are new criminal penalties in this part of 505 now added as a result of this amendment ? 
mr. chairman , i would like to just point out that this is another one of the famous half-loaf amendments that we are being peppered with this afternoon . 
what we found out in our examination , the staff examination , is that 90 percent of the uses of the sneak-and-peak authority have been for nonterrorism cases . 
as initially drafted , the amendment by mr. coble could have had the unintended effect of targeting tribal governments who are legitimately involved in the retailing of tobacco products . 
with the help of mr. cole and other members , mr. coble has modified his amendment and has incorporated language that will go a long way to protecting tribal governments and tribal sovereignty . 
support for tribal sovereignty is a bi-partisan issue and collectively the congress will continue to defend that fundamental principal of law . 
i realize that there are other sections that may need to be fixed as well because there has not been much time to refine the entirety of the coble provision and that further refinements may be in order once we get to conference with the senate on this provision . 
i understand that the rule of law of enforcement in indian country will fall to tribal governments and the federal government will be protected through further amendment and i pledge to work in conference to ensure the rights of tribal governments are fully protected . 
it is like coming to a meeting and we have forgotten all the things that most of the members on my side of the aisle on the judiciary committee agreed with is wrong with the patriot act , but that we have ignored the fact that many other organizations are not for the patriot act . 
now , what safeguards are being preserved is very interesting for me because the opponents of the patriot act , including seven states that have passed resolutions opposing parts of the patriot act and a number of communities that have done so , represent over 62 million americans . 
additionally , numerous groups ranging across all parts of the political spectrum have come forward to oppose sections of the patriot act and demand that the congress conduct more oversight , including the american civil liberties union , the american conservative union , the american immigration lawyers association , the american library association , the center for constitutional rights , the center for democracy and technology , common cause , free congress foundation , gun owners of america , the lawyers committee for civil rights , the national association for the advancement of colored people , the criminal defense lawyers , people for the american way , and numerous other groups concerned about immigrants ' rights . 
and even worse has been the abuse of unilateral powers by the administration where since september 11 our government has detained and abused physically thousands of immigrants without time limits for unknown and unspecified reasons and targeted tens of thousands of arab americans for intensive interrogations . 
all this serves to accomplish , of course , is to alienate many of those muslim and arab americans that would be working with us . 
so , madam speaker , there are two pictures of what happened in the committee on the judiciary . 
one is that the bill was made clearly worse , and we have some 92 pages of dissent about the bill itself , and much of it is still of course valid in terms of the conference report that we are examining today . 
madam speaker , i reserve the balance of my time . 
may i bring to the attention of the chairman of the judiciary committee that section 505 of the patriot act expanded the use of national security letters , so to say they are not in the bill would not be accurate . 
madam speaker , i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from maryland ( mr. ruppersberger ) xz4003490 , distinguished member of the intelligence committee . 
at the time it passed , just 7 weeks after 9/11 , there were concerns that some of the authorities were too broad and susceptible to abuse . 
the sensible proposal emerged to sunset 16 of the most controversial provisions . 
they forced the justice department and the american public to evaluate the appropriateness of , and need for , the patriot act . 
without sunsets , congress probably would not have undertaken the same review of key provisions this year and considered significant changes to the law . 
for those reasons i offered an amendment to extend the patriot act sunset during the intelligence committee markup of h.r. 3199 . 
congress must engage in vigilant oversight of the patriot act , national security letters , and other authorities granted to law enforcement and intelligence agencies . 
i am committed to doing my part as a member of the house select intelligence committee to ensure proper oversight occurs . 
it says : `` dear mr. chairman , i am writing on behalf of the american library association to express our opposition to the conference report . 
we are deeply disappointed that the conferees did not take this opportunity to heed the concerns of library users across this country and to restore protections for records of library use that were stripped away by the patriot act '' itself . 
it `` does not seriously address any of the library community 's concerns with section 215 . 
`` the report also leaves in place the usa patriot act standards for national security letters '' and would `` allow the fbi to continue its unfettered reach into the personal electronic records of the public , including records of their use of the internet through computers in libraries . 
worse , it adds a criminal penalty for noncompliance with the order and for a knowing violation of the gag order . 
and while adding an ability to challenge the secrecy of a national security letter on the one hand , it takes it away with the other by requiring the court to accept , as conclusive , the government 's assertion of harm to national security ... .. 
`` madam speaker , this is the clearest description from the president of the american library association , supported by thousands of professional librarians from one end of the country to the other . 
please , let us not buy into the fact that this is a new and improved version of the patriot act . 
please join us in sending this bill back to committee and supporting my measure that would allow for a 3-month period of time for us to improve the bill . 
i want to give chairman sensenbrenner the benefit of the presumption of a doubt about this section 215 business . 
what happens in the report is it makes it easier to get library and other records under section 215 by creating a presumption that records of anyone to come into contact with a suspected terrorist even accidentally , innocently , is relevant to an investigation . 
madam speaker , what he has done is he has moved a part of section 215 to another part of the bill , and that is why it does not operate that way . 
madam speaker , i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from new york ( mr. nadler ) xz4002890 , a ranking subcommittee member of the judiciary committee . 
madam speaker , i yield myself the balance of my time . 
at the close of this debate , i will offer a motion to recommit the conference report with instructions to recede to the senate bill in its entirety . 
not that the senate bill is perfect , but it does a far better job at protecting civil liberties than the conference report by requiring that the documents and things collected through section 215 have some connection to a suspected terrorist and providing meaningful judicial review of uses of that authority . 
now , the senate bill also lacks a number of controversial and wholly unrelated provisions tacked on to the end of this bill . 
it does not have a lot of christmas tree in it . 
some 143 of the 216 pages of this bill have absolutely nothing to do with the patriot act . 
the chairman repeatedly admonished committee democrats that we were not permitted to consider matters falling outside of the 16 expiring provisions of the patriot act , but on the floor and in conference , this bill became a christmas tree for random drug laws , presidential succession amendments and federal employee benefit changes . 
some have argued that we must pass this bill now because it is the end of the session and it is so urgent . 
we should instead be fixing the problems of the patriot act . 
sunsets will be of no relief to those who will have their constitutional rights violated in the next 4 years and should prevent no one from voting against this bill and in favor of the motion . 
and listen to these non-patriot add-ons ; it is a virtual christmas tree : it alters the presidential line of succession , criminalizes peaceful protest behavior , changes employment qualifications and benefits for federal employees and expands the death penalty for non-terror related offenses . 
madam speaker , i yield back the balance of my time . 
mr. chairman , i rise in opposition to this bill , the usa patriot and intelligence reform reauthorization act of 2005 , h.r. 3199 . 
mr. chairman , after the tragic events of september 11 , every american knows , in every nuance of the truism , that freedom is not free . 
i firmly believe that in order to have security in our homeland we must have a reasonable expectation of infringement of some of our civil liberties . 
the stakes are too high to maintain a pre-9/11 mentality and the threats of terrorism are too real . 
subsequent to passage of the usa patriot act , a hastily devised bill brought to the floor 45 days after 9/11 , i received many letters from my constituents who applauded my voting against its passage . 
as the sunset date approached for the more troubling patriot act provisions , i received even more letters concerned about the prospect of extending or making permanent the more intrusive aspects of the usa patriot act . 
that is why i held a patriot act town hall earlier this ear to further examine the extent of the problem . 
some months ago , a maryland-based engineer of iranian descent was at work when the state police showed up at his employer 's doorstep and started questioning him . 
later , the engineer ( whom i 'll call `` mr. l '' ) was told that a former police officer had seen a group of people who `` looked middle eastern '' driving around an airport and `` acting suspicious. '' fortunately , mr. l had proof that he was nowhere near the airport during the time in question . 
he has since been cleared of any wrongdoing . 
far too many americans of ethnic descent can relate to mr. l 's story of being accused of wrongdoing based only upon a racial or ethnic `` profile. '' although our u.s. constitution protects us against unreasonable searches and seizures , we know that this guarantee has not always been uniformly assured . 
sadly , the governmental intrusion into mr. l 's life seems to be one of these cases . 
it was an erosion of his personal freedom clearly allowed under the patrlot act , which as americans the rest of us take lightly at our peril . 
mr. l 's story is not unique ; the danger his experience illustrates is not limited to islamic americans ; and the erosion of our freedom is not confined to investigations of terrorism . 
mr. speaker , the expressed purpose of the patrlot act was to assure that u.s. law enforcement agencies would possess the legal tools that they said they needed to protect us from acts of terrorism . 
from the time of its initial passage , however , there has been serious concern that the wider police powers granted to our law enforcement agents by the legislation -- as well as other assertions of executive power by the bush administration -- were not adequately balanced by sufficient constitutional safeguards . 
the purposes of this bill are the same and it suffers from the same infirmities as its predecessor . 
as the dissenting views to accompany h.r. 1399 reports , and i paraphrase , `` there are numerous provisions in both the expiring and other sections of the usa patriot act that have little to do with combating terrorism , that intrude on our privacy and civil liberties and that have been repeatedly abused and misused by both the justice department and the administration. '' these include , but are not limited to , the inadequate judicial oversight permitted by this bill and the roving wiretaps targeting innocent americans -- americans not involved in terrorism in any way . 
it should come as no surprise that since 2002 , 389 communities and seven states representing over 62 million people have passed resolutions opposing parts of the usa-patrlot act . 
it may come as a surprise however , that groups ranging the political spectrum from the aclu to gun owners of america are equally opposed to many sections of the bill . 
they are concerned , like my constituents and many other citizens around the country , that the patrlot act has been used more than 150 times to secretly search an individual 's home , with nearly 90 percent of those cases having nothing to do with terrorism . 
they are concerned that the patrlot act has been used to coerce an internet service provider to divulge information about e-mail activity and websurfing of its members . 
instead of thoughtfully considering the tough questions like : how much governmental power is truly required to protect us and what constitutional freedoms are we going to leave in place for our children and generations yet to be born , we consider a partisan bill of which the minority members inform they never received the facts necessary to fully evaluate . 
for this and other reasons , i decided to cosponsor the bipartisan bill spearheaded by butch otter and bernie sanders , the security and freedom ensured act of 2005 , h.r. 1526 , the safe act . 
among other corrections to the patriot act , this bill would require `` specific and articulable facts '' ( rather than a more generalized suspicion ) that a suspect is an agent of a foreign power when the government wishes to seize records . 
in addition , h.r. 1526 would re-define the new crime of `` domestic terrorism '' in far more narrow terms , making it clear that our traditional freedom to assemble and challenge governmental action must not be chilled . 
democrats and republicans alike are seeking to better protect the freedom of americans -- without reducing our ability to protect ourselves against terrorist threats . 
i do not think there is anybody in this body on either side of this issue that does not have concerns . 
god willing , there should be a day we will not need a patriot act , and it is easier to vote it back than it is to get rid of it . 
let me cite an example of what happened before 9/11 and how the patriot act , in my opinion , would have stopped an event , not just may have . 
agencies knew of an outspoken extremist group . 
they were outspoken in support of osama bin laden before 9/11 , and they were outspoken about their ethnic intolerance and raising money for al qaeda . 
agencies like cia , fbi and law enforcement had thousands of leads and limited manpower . 
i am conflicted , just like my colleague , the gentlewoman from california ( ms. harman ) xz4001660 and others , because there are things that all of us are concerned about . 
and some of the documents showed that it is only a matter of time , mr. chairman , until this country is hit , so we must be diligent . 
this act helps us do that , and weighing the concerns and is the reason i think all of us need to support the patriot act . 
however , i do n't believe we have to shred the constitution and bill of rights in order to fight terrorism . 
we must be vigilant that the rights and liberties we are fighting to protect are not jeopardized in the name of the war against terrorism . 
regrettably , h.r. 3199 , the usa patriot act and terrorism prevention reauthorization act , does not provide adequate protections for the civil liberties of law abiding citizens and i must rise in opposition to the bill . 
with that said , i support a number of provisions in h.r. 3199 . 
allow judicially approved wire-taps on cell phones and disposable cell phones , permit judicially approved seizure of voice mail and not make permanent the provision making it a federal crime to provide material support to terrorists , among other meritorious provisions . 
however , as i mentioned earlier , i also have very serious concerns with a number of other provisions in the bill . 
many of the provisions in the bill that expand law enforcement authority to conduct domestic intelligence gathering , either do not require judicial review , or require that law enforcement only assert relevance to an investigation , rather than show probable cause that the information is relevant to a terrorist investigation . 
these expanded powers go a long way toward tearing down protections that were put in place in the post-watergate era when we learned of presidential abuses of domestic intelligence-gathering against individuals because of political affiliation or citizen activism . 
i am particularly concerned with a provision authorizing national security letters , nsl 's , which allow law enforcement officials unlimited access to business and personal records without any sort of judicial oversight . 
this provision is extraordinarily broad and intrusive and could apply to any tangible records on any and all americans whether or not they are suspected of a terrorist act . 
prior to the patriot act , nsl 's could be used to get records only when there was `` reason to believe '' someone was an agent of a foreign power . 
according to the department of justice , this new power has been used hundreds of times since the usa patriot act was signed into law i am also concerned that the bill extends the government 's so-called `` sneak and peek '' authority which allows the government to conduct secret searches and seizure of property without notice , in violation of the 4th amendment . 
this authority has also been used hundreds of times since enactment of the usa patriot act , including against brandon mayfield in portland who was suspected of being involved in the madrid bombings . 
mr. mayfield was later exonerated of all charges related to the bombings because it was shown that the fbi based its investigation on incomplete and faulty information . 
but his life was changed forever as a result of the investigation and intrusive searches , and under this bill , it could happen to other law abiding citizens . 
i am disturbed that the bill extends many of these controversial provisions either permanently or up to 10 years , even though congress has not been properly provided information on the sue of many provisions of the act to date . 
without that information , it is difficult to know how this new law enforcement authority is being used , whether it 's necessary at all , or whether it needs to be modified to protect the civil rights and liberties of law abiding citizens . 
we know of some abuses that have occurred under the act , like the mayfield case . 
however , the administration has refused to provide information on some of the most broad and intrusive powers under the act , and the bill should provide for adequate disclosure and proper oversight of these provisions , but it does n't . 
215 of the act , which grants law enforcement officials the authority to seize business records without notification . 
a similar amendment was approved by the house of representatives earlier this summer by an overwhelming vote of 238-187 . 
i would like to be able to support this bill , and as i said earlier , i support a number of provisions in the bill . 
i also believe we could have reached an agreement on protections to address most of my concerns with the bill by providing for judicial review and shorter-sunset provisions . 
unfortunately , the leadership chose to bring a bill to the floor which simply gives too much broad , intrusive and unchecked authority to the federal government , and does not provide for adequate legislative oversight of how these powers are being used , therefore , i can not support the bill . 
listeners should realize that truth is not required in debate on the floor of the house . 
the chairman of the rules committee stood up here and said there has not been one complaint about the use of the patriot act , or the abuse . 
he should talk to brandon mayfield from portland , oregon , who was considered to be a perpetrator of the madrid bombing and they used the patriot act to accumulate the nonevidence about him . 
maybe we are not hearing the complaints because librarians , bookstore owners , and business owners can themselves be prosecuted if they tell anybody that there was an unwarranted gathering of records about innocent americans from them . 
so , yeah , i guess there is sort of a dearth of complaints . 
we heard that when we passed the first patriot act , which no member of the house of representatives had read , at 10 o'clock in the morning with one copy available on each side of the aisle . 
you are jamming this through on behalf of the white house and the attorney general . 
it threatens the civil liberties of americans , and i believe it will impinge on our investigation and finding of terrorists . 
these national security letters , 30 , 000 national security letters , gathering huge amounts of data about the lives of innocent americans . 
this is going to create such a huge haystack of irrelevant information about the lives of innocent americans that the fbi , who had one terrorist in hand , musawi , and had an agent in arizona pointing at the plot , could not even see their hand in front of their face . 
now we are going to create a huge mountain of irrelevant data about innocent people and this is somehow going to improve how they perform in finding terrorists in america ? 
then the most cynical thing about this bill is to take a meritorious bill that deals with methamphetamine precursors and trafficking , that passed separately in this house of representatives , which i supported , and they are going to include it as part of this legislation in a cynical ploy to somehow basically force , bully , or trick people into supporting the underlying legislation with its unwarranted attack on the bill of rights , the constitution of america , the foundation of our government , the gathering secretly of information about innocent americans , and the permanent retention of that information for no good purpose . 
mr. speaker , i was unavoidably absent from the vote today on h.r. 3199 , the `` usa patriot improvement and reauthorization act of 2005 '' due to a family medical emergency . 
had i been present and voting , i would have voted `` no '' on this bill as i have steadfastly opposed similar versions of the patriot act when they have come up in the past . 
one of our most precious values is the right to be free from unwarranted government intrusion . 
i voted against the original patriot act when it passed congress in 2001 because it went too far in creating the potential for government abuses and violations of civil liberties . 
the bill today makes permanent almost all of the provisions enacted in 2001 . 
for example , section 109 of h.r. 3199 makes some changes to section 215 of the original patriot act , which expanded what the government could seize under the foreign intelligence surveillance act , fisa , of 1978 to `` any tangible things. '' these include library , medical , tax , and gun records . 
the broad standard in current law makes it dangerously easy for the records of innocent americans to be viewed by government . 
additionally , recipients of requests for information under section 215 are prevented from telling virtually anyone about the request and they can not challenge this `` gag order '' in court . 
while this bill at least includes a 4-year sunset for section 215 , there is no sunset for section 505 , which expanded the power of government to obtain information via national security letters , nsls . 
the bill also fails to adequately reform section 213 of the original patriot act , which expanded `` sneak and peek '' warrant authority . 
these are just some examples of the problems with h.r. 3199 . 
i am confident that if we work together , we can develop laws which would allow us to combat terrorism without making it too easy for government to intrude into the private lives of americans . 
mr. chairman , i want to comment and express my appreciation for the remarks of the gentleman from iowa ( mr. king ) xz4002201 when he suggested that this has been a good process . 
there is no one , no democrat and no republican who wants to reconstruct that metaphorical wall that prevented the sharing of information . 
i do not know of anyone on either side . 
and that was the key and the linchpin , i would suggest , of the success of the patriot act . 
now , some have suggested that there has been no abuse discovered by the department of justice , and i will accept that premise . 
but i would also put forth that the reality of the sunsets were an encouragement on the part of the department of justice to ensure full compliance with the law as it was then written . 
if you will , one could argue that it served as a deterrence , that it encouraged good behavior ; and that is why some of us here on this side of the aisle are so passionate about the issue of sunsets . 
it is my understanding that this morning in the senate committee on the judiciary , there were a number of sunsets on various provisions that were approved , and they were full-year sunsets . 
i dare say , if various amendments relative to sunsets had been allowed and made in order , this debate could have been cut in half in terms of the time . 
i also want to speak to the issue of library records . 
i would further suggest that in terms of if there is no concern about libraries , if it is a red herring , why does the first amendment that we will consider that was made in order have to do with the issue ? 
i think that is an important point to make as a matter of record . 
mr. chairman , i want to associate myself with the remarks of the gentlewoman from california ( ms. zoe lofgren ) xz4002450 . 
and i also want to address the issue of oversight . 
the chairman has been most aggressive when it comes to oversight , and i want to publicly commend him , not just in terms of the patriot act , but many other issues that are within the jurisdiction of the judiciary committee . 
it is about the responsibility of future members of the judiciary committee to exercise that responsibility . 
just recently , i read where the vice chair of the government reform committee , looking into the expenditures of monies involving the development for the fund of iraq , expressed frustration with the lack of cooperation coming from the pentagon . 
i have served on an invitation basis under chairman dan burton investigating the misconduct of the fbi in the boston office , and again , it required the threat of a contempt petition to gain information from the department of justice . 
so that is why all of the discussions today about oversight are framed in that context . 
mr. chairman , i thank the gentleman for yielding me this time , and i applaud the cosponsors of this particular amendment because it is a significant amendment . 
in addition , it added a permanent nondisclosure requirement which , if violated , imposed severe sanctions on the recipient of the so-called national security letter . 
this was truly a profound expansion of government power where the subject of the order need not be suspected of any involvement in terrorism whatsoever , where there was no judicial review , where there was no statutory right to challenge , and where the order gags the recipient from telling anyone about it . 
a federal district court in new york has already ruled that the national security letters for communication records , as amended by the patriot act , are unconstitutional because they are coercive and violate the fourth amendment prohibition against unreasonable searches and the first amendment as a result of the gag order . 
this amendment , i would submit , attempts to salvage the use of national security letters in intelligence investigations so as to comply with constitutional standards . 
it gives the recipient of a national security letter his day in court . 
as i suggested , the current law is of dubious constitutionality , and i would suggest this amendment would permit appropriate use of so-called national security letters that would not only pass constitutional muster but would be sound policy . 
this is about domestic terrorism and the definition of domestic terrorism . 
and while it does not create a new crime under the patriot act , the definition triggers an array of expanded governmental authorities , including enhanced civil asset seizure powers . 
it is so broadly defined that it could include acts of civil disobedience because they may involve acts that endanger human life , one of the elements that goes into the definition of domestic terrorism . 
for example , they could implicate anti-abortion protesters who illegally block access to federal clinics , which could be interpreted by a liberal activist attorney general as endangering the lives of those seeking abortions , or environmental protesters who trespass on private land and climb trees to prevent logging , which could be interpreted by a conservative activist attorney general as endangering their own lives or the lives of the loggers . 
since such actions are usually undertaken to influence government policy , another of the elements that go into the definition of domestic terrorism , such activities could be treated in such a way as to have severe unintended consequences , particularly with regard to the government seizure of property and/or assets . 
for example , any property used to facilitate the acts , such as a church basement , or property affording a source of influence over the group , like a bank account of a major donor to a direct action anti-abortion group , could be seized without any criminal conviction and without a prior hearing notice under section 806 , which is implicated into the patriot act . 
this amendment curbs those unintended consequences and possibilities and appropriately limits the qualifying offenses for domestic terrorism to those that constitute a federal , substantive crime of terrorism , instead of any federal or state crime . 
it also limits the definition to actions that are actually intended to influence government policy on a civilian population by coercion or intimidation , instead of the current standard that the actions `` appear to be intended '' to have that effect . 
i would conclude by reminding my colleagues on the committee on the judiciary that this amendment is drawn from the version of the patriot act that was unanimously approved by the committee on the judiciary in october of 2001 , and i urge its passage . 
mr. chairman , i reserve the balance of my time . 
mr. chairman , i yield back the balance of my time . 
remember the so-called total information program that was the brainchild of the former national security administrator that we funded to the tune of $ 170 million , and then defunded it ? 
it is providing the tools to the united states congress to do its constitutional job of oversight . 
mr. chairman , there is no greater responsibility of government than to protect its people from harm . 
that was the intent of the patriot act -- legislation authored a month after the september 11th attacks 4 years ago . 
all that is understandable , but making the entire bill work well with the benefit of 4 years hindsight ought to be the challenge before us today . 
but this legislation is not the entire patriot act passed into law 4 years ago -- it is only 16 provisions of that law , most of which were set to expire or sunset . 
this year , we are failing to consider some of the most ineffective and overreaching provisions of the patriot act . 
and , in the case of the so-called `` sneak and peek '' provision , we are actually making matters worse . 
and even though it allows recipients of such subpoenas to consult an attorney , there is no requirement that law enforcement show that the information they are seeking is even part of a terrorism investigation . 
and while this provision will be revisited again in 10 years , almost all the others are made permanent -- access to e-mail and internet records , wiretap authority , the disclosure of internet records in emergencies , the use of search warrants to seize voice mail . 
these are all fundamental matters of privacy -- privacy we would all agree terrorists are not entitled to , but the average american is . 
by insisting 14 of the 16 expiring provisions in this bill be made permanent , we are essentially abdicating our responsibility as members of congress to make sure we strike the right balance of giving law enforcement the tools they need to catch terrorists while still upholding the basic rights to which every american is entitled . 
mr. chairman , this bill is a matter of security -- of homeland security , national security and the security of every american 's right to privacy . 
let us honor our obligations and uphold each of those responsibilities . 
mr. chairman , i rise in strong support of the reauthorization and extension of the usa patriot act , the provisions of which have protected the american people and our soil from terrorism since their enactment 4 years ago . 
the patriot act has been instrumental to our prosecution of the war on terror since 9/11 , and , specifically , instrumental to the prosecution of terrorists who have threatened our homeland . 
opponents of the patriot act suggest that we have an either/or choice when it comes to safety and civil liberties , but the patriot act -- the ultimate legislative boogey-man for conspiracy theorists -- has worked exactly as the american people were told it would be . 
to date , 4 years after big brother supposedly imposed this draconian usurpation of liberty on the american people , no one has suggested a single instance of a single person 's civil liberties being violated . 
this point bears repeating : on one , not the justice department , not the aclu , not even moveon.org has produced evidence of a single , verifiable patriot act civil liberties abuse . 
neither has the government 's abuse of the patriot act 's `` delayed notification search warrants , '' which since the act 's passage have comprised fewer than 2 of every 1 , 000 search warrants sought by the justice department . 
the usa patriot act , then , mr. speaker , has been a boon to the law enforcement and intelligence community , a crushing blow to our terrorist enemies -- 212 more of whom , i repeat , are now behind bars -- and a protector of security and freedom to the american people . 
of course , this law should be re-examined . 
that 's why we 've subjected it to such vigorous scrutiny : six inspector general reports ; 12 committee hearings , just since this april ; 41 witnesses , 15 of whom were called by the democrats ; 43 proposed amendments in committee , 8 of which were approved . 
this bill does very little other than to make permanent , onerous sections of an onerous law . 
substituted in the dark of night , the administration 's bill was inserted as the final bill and became law with very little congressional deliberation or consideration . 
we are considering making 14 of the 16 provisions in the patriot act permanent , and making the other 2 provisions semi-permanent . 
are we going to yield more of our institutional power by granting the permanency of these provisions ? 
we must remain vigilant against terrorism , but we must also remain vigilant against abuses of power that curtail americans ' civil liberties in a time of war . 
that we will fight tyranny with freedom and democracy , and the power of our ideas will prevail . 
yet , today , we are considering limiting american freedoms by extending these sections of the patriot act permanently . 
mr. chairman , i am reminded of a very wise saying by one of our founding fathers , benjamin franklin . 
instead of rushing to finalize a partisan conference report that dismisses concerns for americans ' civil liberties , we should pass a 3 month extension and try to find a bipartisan balance . 
we recently learned that over 30 , 000 national security letters are issued every year to businesses of all types without court approval . 
second , this conference report fails to address the very real issue that has been of great concern to many americans : section 215 secret court orders for library , medical , and other personal records . 
as i , along with several of my colleagues , said in a letter to chairman sensenbrenner and chairman specter , there is nothing in this standard to stop the fbi from asking a library to turn over its circulation list of everyone who had checked out a book on islam since the september 11th attacks . 
madam speaker , i have heard a lot of talk during the last four years that we will not yield to the terrorists . 
that we will fight tyranny with freedom and democracy , and the power of our ideas will prevail . 
i also know that those same tools can be used to curtail freedoms of innocent americans . 
we must provide common sense tools to prosecutors , but we must protect the liberty of all americans . 
as i asked in june of this year , and as i ask again now , `` what will generations to come think when they have seen we have permanently lowered the bar in protecting their civil liberties ? 
`` madam speaker , whenever we discuss the patriot act , i am reminded of a very wise saying by one of our founding fathers , benjamin franklin . 
we should go back to conference and craft a conference report that protects all of our civil liberties . 
mr. chairman , i rise in support of the amendment , but i do not believe it is a good enough cure to make this sick legislation well . 
i believe that most of what america needs to know about the patriot act is reflected in its deceptive title . 
its authors deliberately designed a name to question the patriotism of anyone who questions them . 
patriots demand accountability , restraint , and judicial review of encroachments on the freedoms that make our country unique . 
while some portions of this proposed renewal of the patriot act strike the right balance , other provisions simply strike out . 
we must balance the demands of keeping our nation secure with the freedoms that we cherish . 
wrapping this collection of misguided policies under the rubric `` the patriot act '' is a true mark of how really weak the underlying arguments are for this measure . 
this bill , i believe , is a step in the wrong direction , a step in the direction of suppressing our freedoms . 
mr. speaker , true patriots need not hide behind the flag nor apply phony titles to cover the misguided purposes of their legislation . 
from its origin , this grossly misnamed patriot act has cloaked its weaknesses by implying that its opponents are `` un-patriots '' as in `` unpatriotic. '' this is all part of a troubling pattern : secret prisons , sneak and peek searches , gag orders , redefining torture to exclude cruel and degrading punishment , extraordinary rendition , combing through library records , and even attempting to misuse our military to spy on religious groups . 
but intrusive , invasive powers in the hands of a few with little oversight and no accountability is a formula for wrongdoing . 
and all of this is occurring when the bipartisan 9/11 commission , the citizens ' commission that this administration fought every step of the way , is giving the administration and this republican congress one f after another for not protecting our families . 
instead , we get this kind of legislation . 
benjamin franklin understood when he said , `` those who would give up essential liberty , to purchase a little temporary safety , deserve neither liberty nor safety. '' this much is certain , each day of this administration brings more news of both deaths of true patriots abroad and more abuses of our values by those who claim to be patriots at home . 
to those who promote this misguided act , pull down your false colors ; raise the american flag of freedom . 
mr. speaker , i rise in strong support of this rule and the underlying legislation , the usa patriot act . 
i want to thank and congratulate my colleague from georgia for his fine management of this very important rule . 
september 11 changed the world for all of us here , and it changed the rest of the world . 
we have made a commitment that , because of the fact that we are in the midst of a global war on terror , we need to do everything within our power to redouble our efforts to ensure that we win that global war on terror . 
we passed the patriot act , mr. speaker , 6 weeks after september 11 of 2001 . 
in fact , i remember going at it with our former colleague , now the director of central intelligence , porter goss . 
he was not a strong proponent of sunset provisions at that time . 
and i said : we are so close to the tragic day of september 11 that it is absolutely essential that we ensure that we are doing the right thing with this legislation . 
and we are obviously passing it under the immediate shadow of september 11 , and so it seems to me that it is the right thing for us to do to sunset the provisions here . 
we have gone through this nearly 5-year period , and we have looked for the issue that my colleague the gentlewoman from sacramento ( ms. matsui ) xz4006631 raised as the number one priority concern , the civil liberties of the american people . 
i am very , very committed to the civil liberties of all the american people , and i believe , just as my colleagues have said , that that is at the core of what the united states of america is all about . 
if we had seen failure , if we had seen violations of civil liberties , then i believe that making modifications would be appropriate , but we continue to have report after report saying there are no instances of civil liberties being violated . 
we had 47 amendments that were submitted to us in the committee on rules , and i am very proud of the fact that we were able to work with our colleagues addressing concerns that they raised . 
the primary committee of jurisdiction here is the committee on the judiciary . 
the committee on rules chose to comply with the request of the primary committee of jurisdiction , the committee on the judiciary , on this issue . 
but now having looked at this rule with 47 amendments , nearly half of the amendments that were submitted to us , 11 of the amendments that are made in order under this rule are either amendments offered by democrats or offered by democrats and republicans , bipartisan amendments , and 10 of the amendments that are made in order are offered by republicans . 
that is something that we need to realize as part of the very important goal here . 
i believe this measure will go a long way towards protecting our homeland and ensuring the civil liberties of every single american . 
i listened very , very closely to the remarks offered by my good friend from massachusetts ( mr. mcgovern ) xz4002630 and i have to say that every member of this house is committed to the national security of the united states . 
but i will go so far as to say every single member of this house is committed to recognizing the civil liberties of the american people . 
when this issue came to the forefront just a few weeks after september 11 , 2001 , the now director of the central intelligence agency , former chairman of the house intelligence committee and vice chairman of the rules committee , our very good friend , mr. goss , argued that he believed we should begin with permanence at that point , and i argued then that i thought it important that we focus on sunsetting provisions in the usa patriot act . 
one of the reasons we did it is we wanted to see what kinds of civil liberties were being violated as we focused on our number one priority , that being our national security . 
and i am very happy to report that , as we look at what has transpired since implementation of the usa patriot act , it is the following : we have provided every opportunity for any american to raise concern , talk about violations of their civil liberties by going on the worldwide web , filing any kind of complaint . 
and there has not been one instance , not one complaint has been leveled , against the provisions in the usa patriot act as evidence of violating civil liberties . 
i want to do everything in my power to ensure that we recognize the rights of our individuals . 
it is a delicate balancing act between our goal of recognizing the importance of our national security and at the same time focusing on civil liberties . 
but , mr. speaker , there is nothing to say that we can not look at this again , as one of my staff members just said to me , next week if we so choose . 
i was shocked last night when the distinguished ranking member of the rules committee said that there had been no oversight by the judiciary committee of the usa patriot act . 
and chairman sensenbrenner , who has done a phenomenal job on this , went through the litany of oversight hearings that have gone on between first implementation of the usa patriot act and today and will continue , will continue as we see this measure pass . 
every single american who travels today has made a sacrifice , because of the fact that we are in the midst of a global war on terror , by virtue of going through the security to get on an airplane . 
professor harvey mansfield of harvard wrote about the need to make those sacrifices when we are in the midst of war . 
and we know that this is an ongoing global war on terror ; but we can not , as we pursue that war , move to undermine the great liberties and rights of the american people . 
mr. chairman , i voted for the first patriot act , and i strongly supported the creation of the homeland security department and have voted for every large increase in intelligence , homeland security funding , and defense funding . 
i am very troubled by the fact that the administration and the leadership here are just going full steam ahead without listening to the very sincere problems that many of us have with the erosion of civil liberties . 
one of the most prudent things , in my view , that congress did in passing the original patriot act was to sunset certain provisions , thus ensuring that a future congress would review and revise them and have a very healthy and sobering debate . 
rather than sunsetting these provisions again , this bill makes permanent 14 of the 16 provisions set to expire without addressing the important civil liberty issues . 
i am somewhat taken aback as i listen to different parts of the debate on the floor . 
the constitution is the soul of our nation . 
prior to the patriot act , these requests had to be directed at agents of a foreign power . 
the bill continues to allow the fbi to execute a search and seizure warrant without notifying the target of a warrant for 6 months if it is deemed that providing advance notice would interfere with the investigation . 
i offered an amendment in the intelligence committee to modify section 215 of the patriot act to prohibit the fbi from using this section to obtain library circulation records , library patron lists , book sales records , or book customer lists , but the amendment was not allowed by the rules committee . 
one such change was the lowering of the standard for issuing government requests for financial , telecommunications credit , and other business records . 
these requests commonly referred to as national security letters or nsls are issued directly by the government agencies in national security investigations without the approval of a judge . 
before the patriot act , the fbi and other issuing agencies had to show there was some nexus to an agent of a foreign power or terrorist . 
the lowering of this standard has resulted in an all time high in the number of nsls issued . 
even more disturbing , the article alleged that records collected pursuant to nsls are retained for an indefinite period of time , even when they are not of interest to investigators , and shared with other federal agencies and the private sector . 
as a member of congress , i am disappointed that we have missed a critical opportunity to get the nsl standard right . 
we have also missed the opportunity to ensure that nsl recipients have an opportunity to seek meaningful judicial review of the nondisclosure or gag requirements that accompany nsls and further tailor the statutory framework to ensure that privacy and civil liberties are better protected . 
i think the precious balance of civil liberties and security are damaged here . 
this bill tramples on the bill of rights in the name of patriotism . 
as thomas paine once said , `` it is the duty of the patriot to protect his country from his government. '' we are all patriots today in the finest sense of the word , but just because some of us want to ensure that congress retains its legislative oversight over these draconian provisions , some will call us unpatriotic . 
to quote thomas jefferson , `` dissent is the highest form of patriotism '' . 
while not one of us in the chamber takes lightly our oath to protect and defend the united states , the permanent extension of the patriot act , as the expense of our civil liberties , will not in and of itself make our country safer . 
the same concerns regarding the abuse of power still exist . 
with such broad , sweeping provisions as roving wire taps and sneak and peek searches , congress must retain its ability to exercise legislative oversight to ensure the civil liberties of the people are upheld . 
the provisions of the misnamed patriot act should be reauthorized periodically , not made permanent . 
this administration consistently hides behind the fear of terrorism to achieve their legislative agenda . 
in my district , the local governments of pacific grove , salinas , santa cruz , and watsonville , california have all passed resolutions expressing their concerns with the anti-privacy and anti-liberty portions of the patriot act . 
mr. chairman , homeland security means protecting the civil rights of americans . 
the democratic fabric of this country was founded on checks and balances but the patriot act contains neither . 
in 1775 , one of our nation 's true patriots , benjamin franklin , said `` they that can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety. '' this legislation tramples on the essential liberties that our founding fathers wanted to ensure . 
they understood that lowering our civil liberties standards would not ensure safety ; but it would undermine the relationship of this proud democracy with its citizens . 
i believe that the founders of this country would be rolling in their graves to hear the claims this administration and republican leadership make in the name of safety from terrorists . 
i can not with a clean conscience support this bill which gives government unnecessary access to the lives of innocent americans and tramples on their civil rights . 
madam speaker , i urge a `` no '' vote on this piece of legislation that flies in the face of our forefathers . 
i will tell my colleagues that over the last 8 months , we have had between 12 and 13 hearings in the committee on the judiciary and some 35 witnesses over an extended period of time ; and 50 members of the committee on the judiciary have had a chance to not just question those witnesses , but to go back in the secure intelligence records , which i have done , and review all the fisa reports and the other information that is very sensitive and an important part of our oversight . 
we have considered some 50 different amendments as part of this extensive hearing process . 
the fact of the matter is , congress has done a very diligent job balancing civil liberties during this time of great national threat . 
we now believe that three out of four of the terrorists that attacked london 2 weeks ago and killed 56 people visited frequently this bookstore . 
if the british authorities had known about the possible link and had a 215 clause , the main clause being attacked by the opponents of the patriot act , perhaps there would be 56 people alive today . 
we may not be able to prevent the next attack , but as long as americans ' liberties are protected by a judge ahead of time , as long as this is a reasonable provision affecting only non-americans or during an intelligence or ongoing terrorism investigation , it is absolutely appropriate . 
everybody who receives one of these warrants is guaranteed to see a lawyer , and , if they want to , challenge the warrant . 
mr. speaker , i just want to say that i am often critical of this process and have been known to be critical of the committee on rules on particular bills that have come through , but i have to say with this process and with the committee on which i sit , the committee on the judiciary , we have seen a very transparent , open process . 
we have had a series of 12 hearings over the past year , and we had a markup that went over 12 hours in which we considered more than 50 amendments , i believe , there . 
i was successful , with a few of my democrat colleagues , in attaching a few amendments at that time . 
a few of them have to do with section 215 . 
we will offer an amendment later , myself and the gentleman from california ( mr. schiff ) xz4003610 , that will require the director of the fbi to actually sign off on any request for documents from a bookstore or library . 
we formed the patriot act reform caucus , and a lot of us have worked very hard on these issues , and i am pleased to say that many of these amendments have been approved and will be offered today . 
mr. chairman , this amendment simply states that the director of the fbi must personally approve any library or bookstore request for records by the fbi under section 215 of the patriot act . 
this amendment provides a higher standard for the use of section 215 by the fbi . 
at a minimum , what it will prevent i think is some kind of fishing expedition that might be undertaken by an overzealous agent or official at the bureau . 
having the director of the fbi sign off on the request , it also sends a signal to the library and bookstore owners that a request for information from the fbi is well thought out and comes from the highest level . 
this amendment compliments other amendments i have offered in the committee on the judiciary , two of which were accepted by the chairman and the committee . 
with these two amendments on 215 combined , i think we have provided strong protections for the contested section of the patriot act . 
there has been a lot of attention , as has been noted here , across the country at this provision , which has been termed the library provision . 
mr. chairman , i reserve the balance of my time . 
mr. chairman , i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from california ( mr. schiff ) xz4003610 , the cosponsor of the amendment . 
mr. chairman , i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from indiana ( mr. pence ) xz4003150 , a valued member of the committee on the judiciary 
mr. chairman , i yield 1 minute to the gentleman from california ( mr. daniel e. lungren ) xz4006170 , another member of the committee on the judiciary . 
mr. chairman , i yield 1 minute to the gentleman from wisconsin ( mr. sensenbrenner ) xz4003650 , the chairman of the committee on the judiciary . 
when you combine that with what we already have in law , which is a requirement that the fbi director report to congress every 6 months about the use of this statute , you really have a strong provision and strong protections . 
think of it : you have the fbi director himself , or herself , saying , i want to use this authority for this specific purpose , and then having to report that every 6 months to congress . 
mr. chairman , i reserve the balance of my time . 
mr. chairman , i yield 1 minute to the gentleman from california ( mr. issa ) xz4001960 , another member of the committee on the judiciary . 
let me just conclude by thanking the chairman of the committee on the judiciary , the gentleman from wisconsin ( mr. sensenbrenner ) xz4003650 , for running a fair and thorough process . 
on each of these sections that we are dealing with , we heard excellent testimony from the administration , from other witnesses , from experts in the field ; and that is why these amendments have been crafted . 
we have sought to protect the civil liberties of americans every bit as much as we can here , while offering effective tools for the war on terrorism , giving the administration the tools that they need to fight this war . 
mr. chairman , i yield back the balance of my time . 
we have teamed up on a few of those items . 
we are also teaming up with other members of the patriot act reform caucus , the gentleman from idaho ( mr. otter ) xz4003050 and the gentleman from new york ( mr. nadler ) xz4002890 , on this amendment . 
first , this amendment specifies that the recipient of a national security letter may consult with an attorney and may also challenge national security letters in court . 
a judge may throw out the national security letter by request of the government `` if compliance would be unreasonable or oppressive to the recipient of the national security letter. '' the amendment also allows the recipient to challenge the nondisclosure requirement in the national security letter request . 
a judge could modify or remove the nondisclosure requirement of the national security letter `` if it finds that there is no reason to believe that disclosure may endanger the national security of the united states , interfere with criminal counterterrorism or counterintelligence investigation , interfere with diplomatic relations , or endanger the life or physical safety of any person. '' another important reform to this amendment is that it modifies the nondisclosure requirements so that recipients may tell individuals whom they work with about the national security letter request in order to comply with the national security request . 
the amendment also contains penalties for individuals who violate the nondisclosure requirements of a national security letter and requires that reports on national security letters by federal agencies to congress must also be sent to the house and senate committees on the judiciary so we can exercise proper oversight . 
it is important to strengthening the rights of average american citizens who receive these national security letters , and i urge my colleagues to accept this amendment . 
i reserve the balance of my time . 
mr. chairman , i reserve the balance of my time . 
mr. chairman , i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from california ( mr. daniel e. lungren ) xz4006170 , a member of the committee on the judiciary . 
there has to be a finding of relevance . 
mr. chairman , if the gentleman will continue to yield , there is a disagreement on what the court was actually ruling on , whether they were ruling on the access to counsel or , my understanding of it , whether or not the request itself was unconstitutional . 
mr. chairman , part of what we have done in this amendment is offer individuals the opportunity to challenge the scope of the request . 
that is part of what we are doing here . 
they are the recipient of the national security letter . 
mr. chairman , i have a great deal of respect for the gentleman from new york . 
i share many of his concerns about the overall patriot act , and we have worked to put many of the amendments in place to put ourselves at rest . 
we have had great involvement from both sides of the aisle here . 
these amendments that i am offering today , virtually all of them , are offered with democrat support and cosponsorship . 
my name is not even at the top of some of them . 
i appreciate those who have worked with us , and again my appreciation goes to the chairman of the committee for having such a thorough process and allowing us to have amendments . 
many of these amendments were discussed at length , as were other amendments . 
i appreciate that and urge support of the amendment . 
mr. chairman , i yield back the balance of my time . 
and nobody really believes that the death penalty would be imposed in that case ; however , the threat of something like that is out there , acts as a form of intimidation to people from engaging in lawful protest . 
so the overly broad definition does come up as a problem sometimes , and in this case it comes up as a problem when it has to do with seizure of assets . 
mr. chairman , i am offering this amendment today with the gentleman from idaho ( mr. otter ) xz4003050 , my fellow co-chairman of the patriot act reform caucus . 
this amendment addresses two important issues regarding delayed notification of the so-called sneak-and-peek searches . 
the amendment removes the clause that allows judges , when deciding whether initially to grant a sneak-and-peek search , to allow it for the reason that it would unduly delay a trial to notify the target of the search . 
this amendment strikes `` unduly delaying a trial '' because we believe it is too low a standard to allow for a delayed notification search under the adverse impact clause of section 2705 of title xviii . 
this amendment also requires on an annual basis that the administrative office of the courts must report to the house and senate judiciary committees on the number of search warrants granted and the number of delayed notices authorized . 
the aoc would also be required to indicate the cause of delay in each instance . 
mr. chairman , i reserve the balance of my time . 
mr. chairman , i yield myself the remaining time to conclude briefly , simply to say that the distinguished ranking minority member of the committee , the gentleman from michigan ( mr. conyers ) xz4000800 , mentioned that the amendment represents half a loaf , and i will freely concede that it does . 
i would urge support of the amendment . 
mr. chairman , i yield back the balance of my time . 
mr. speaker , i am probably the last person expected to speak on behalf of the committee or the leadership in general . 
i tend to be critical sometimes of committees and the leadership and the process here . 
but let me tell you , i have watched the process here in the committee on the judiciary over the past couple of years on this issue . 
i am often critical of the way we do business here , but here i saw it work . 
i was very supportive of the sunsets we had in the bill initially . 
i am very supportive of the sunset we have , the 10-year sunsets on the two controversial provisions . 
i got a few , and a few of the ones we did get were substantive . 
we have tightened up the requirements of national security letters . 
sometimes you make the best of a mixed bargain . 
i think we ought to make the best of what we have . 
my own amendments , virtually every one of them , had democrats on them . 
often we do not have a deliberative process when we pass major pieces of legislation . 
after the passage of the first patriot act , i and others formed the patriot act reform caucus because we felt we needed additional protections . 
that process yielded about a half dozen amendments which we offered during the house version of the bill , and each of those amendments was accepted and remains part of the legislation . 
one amendment that we dealt with during consideration of the house bill clarified that a recipient of an nsl , or national security letter , may discuss the nsl with his or her attorney and may disclose that request to an individual whose help is necessary for compliance with the nsl . 
it also , as the chairman mentioned , establishes additional reporting requirements to the house and senate judiciary and intelligence committees on the frequency and use of nsls . 
in addition to these safeguards on nsl authorities , the reauthorization also will add significant safeguards in a number of other areas , as the chairman mentioned . 
mr. chairman , i rise in strong support of the schiff-coble-forbes amendment to h.r. 3199 . 
i also want to thank the gentleman from north carolina ( mr. coble ) xz4000760 , the chairman of the subcommittee on crime , terrorism , and homeland security , as well as the gentleman from california ( mr. schiff ) xz4003610 , for their important work on this amendment . 
mr. chairman , the edge of my district is only minutes from the port of norfolk , one of the busiest international ports on the east coast of the united states . 
more than $ 37 billion worth of goods pass through norfolk every year to travel on to all of the lower 48 states . 
the interagency commission on crime and security in u.s. seaports concluded in their report that significant criminal activity is taking place at most of the 12 seaports surveyed by the commission . 
many of my constituents are shocked to learn that it is not a crime for a vessel operator to refuse to stop when ordered to do so by the coast guard . 
if you have spent as much time on the waterways of our harbors as i have , you know there are often only seconds that separate a vessel occupied by terrorists and one of our commercial or naval vessels docked at a pier . 
the amendment we are offering today will further protect our seaports by prohibiting the use of dangerous weapons or explosives on a passenger vessel , prohibiting the transportation of dangerous materials and terrorists , and further increasing penalties for bribery affecting port security . 
mr. speaker , by direction of the committee on rules , i call up house resolution 369 and ask for its immediate consideration . 
mr. speaker , for the purpose of debate only , i yield the customary 30 minutes to the gentlewoman from new york ( ms. slaughter ) xz4003780 , pending which i yield myself such time as i may consume . 
during consideration of this resolution , all time yielded is for the purpose of debate only . 
mr. speaker , h. res. 369 is a structured rule that provides 2 hours of general debate ; 1 hour and 30 minutes is equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the committee on the judiciary and 30 minutes equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the permanent select committee on intelligence . 
it waives all points of order against consideration of the bill . 
further , it provides that in lieu of the amendments recommended by the committee on the judiciary and the permanent select committee on intelligence now printed in the bill , the amendment in the nature of a substitute printed in part a of the committee on rules report shall be considered as the original bill for the purpose of amendment and shall be considered as read . 
it waives all points of order against the amendment in the nature of a substitute printed in part a of the committee on rules report . 
it makes in order only those amendments printed in part b of the committee on rules report which may be offered only in the order printed in the report , may be offered only by a member designated in the report , shall be considered as read , shall be debatable for the time specified in the report equally divided and controlled by the proponent and an opponent , shall not be subject to amendment , and shall not be subject to a demand for division of the question in the house or in the committee of the whole . 
it waives all points of order against the amendments printed in part b of the committee on rules report , and it provides one motion to recommit with or without instructions . 
mr. speaker , i rise this somber day in support of both house resolution 369 and the underlying bill , h.r. 3199 , the usa patriot and terrorism prevention reauthorization act of 2005 . 
mr. speaker , i would first like to extend my condolences and prayers to the people of britain who once again have fallen prey to terrorist bombs . 
i remain confident in not only the resolve of the british government led by tony blair , but also the resolve of the british people to stand firm against these cowards . 
as we consider our own measures against terrorism today , let us not forget our commitment to not only the protection of our homeland but also the protection of our allies . 
i would like to take this opportunity to thank the gentleman from wisconsin ( mr. sensenbrenner ) xz4003650 , the distinguished chairman of the committee on the judiciary and the author of h.r. 3199 , and , of course , the ranking member , the gentleman from michigan ( mr. conyers ) xz4000800 . 
i would also like to thank the chairman of the permanent select committee on intelligence , the gentleman from michigan ( mr. hoekstra ) xz4001820 , and the ranking member , the gentlewoman from california ( ms. harman ) xz4001660 , for their leadership on such an important piece of legislation . 
after 4 years of thorough hearings and extensive oversight , h.r. 3199 represents a collaborative effort to fine-tune our law enforcement needs and to ensure the continuation of necessary protections created by the 2001 usa patriot act . 
however , today 's world is sadly far from ideal and america faces a grave threat from a cowardly enemy that operates under the cover of shadows biding its time with the intent to kill innocent people in the name of an ideology of hate . 
these murdering terrorists lack any sense of decency . 
they have absolutely no respect for either human life or the rule of law . 
when congress first enacted the usa patriot act in 2001 , it did so of course in response to the attacks of 9/11 . 
congress included in this legislation many sunset provisions to ensure an opportunity to review and address the effectiveness of these additional law enforcement capabilities after their enactment . 
since the events of 9/11 , our american law enforcement and intelligence operations , along with our international partners , have identified and disrupted over 150 terrorist threats and cells with the help of the tools provided by the usa patriot act . 
additionally , h.r. 3199 reflects a continued need of law enforcement to respond to an ever-changing technological landscape . 
mr. speaker , terrorists are not relying on courier pigeons and rotary telephones to coordinate their acts of destruction . 
therefore , h.r. 3199 will make sure law enforcement and intelligence authorities still have the ability to track terrorists through the use of multipoint or roving wire taps that follow the terrorists rather than the telephone . 
mr. speaker , i must also say that i have heard from many people back home in the 11th district of georgia who express some concerns about this legislation . 
while they want our law enforcement to have the tools they need , they remain cautious , even dubious of additional government power . 
mr. nahmias is a united states attorney for the northern district of georgia . 
with respect to the usa patriot act he wrote : `` from my perspective as a prosecutor on the front lines of the fight against terrorism , it is difficult to overstate how important the usa patriot act has been to the government 's ability to preserve and protect our nation 's liberty in the face of continuing terrorist threats. '' his deputy u.s. attorney is my good friend , jim martin . 
with over 25 years ' experience as a federal prosecutor , he also assured me in a private conversation of the success of and the need to preserve the patriot act . 
mr. speaker , like many of my colleagues , including the distinguished chairman of the committee on the judiciary , i am also concerned and in all honesty extremely hesitant to grant additional powers to the government . 
that said , i would like to emphasize that since its enactment , there have been zero , and let me repeat zero , verified instances of civil liberty abuses under the usa patriot act found by the inspector general of the justice department . 
mr. speaker , i would again like to thank the gentleman from wisconsin ( chairman sensenbrenner ) ; the gentleman from michigan ( mr. conyers ) xz4000800 , the ranking member ; the gentleman from michigan ( chairman hoekstra ) ; and the ranking member , the gentlewoman from california ( ms. harman ) xz4001660 , all for their dedicated work and commitment to both the liberties of the american people and the needs of law enforcement and the intelligence community . 
i remain confident that this congress will continue to stay on top of our security needs and continue to work for a stronger , freer america . 
i want to encourage all of my colleagues to support this rule and the underlying bill for the sake of a secure nation and the safety of the american people . 
mr. speaker , i reserve the balance of my time . 
mr. speaker , i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from california ( mr. daniel e. lungren ) xz4006170 , a member of the committee . 
59 that was made in order and that will be debated later on this afternoon , stating that the director of the fbi must personally approve any library or bookstore request for records by the fbi under section 215 . 
mr. speaker , i yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from california ( mr. dreier ) xz4001150 , the distinguished chairman of the rules committee . 
mr. speaker , i am proud to yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from arizona ( mr. flake ) xz4001340 , who will speak about one of the bipartisan amendments made in order under this rule . 
mr. speaker , i am proud to yield 45 seconds to the gentleman from florida ( mr. feeney ) xz4001310 , a member of the committee on the judiciary . 
mr. speaker , reclaiming my time , i continue to reserve the balance of my time for the purpose of closing . 
i rise again in support of this rule and in recognition of the importance of the underlying bill . 
we can not , mr. speaker , and will not return to a situation that binds the hands of our intelligence and law enforcement communities . 
republicans , democrats , department of justice , the aclu , and various other organizations have been able to speak freely and openly during the development of this bill . 
mr. speaker , i yield back the balance of my time , and i move the previous question on the resolution . 
mr. speaker , by direction of the committee on rules , i call up house resolution 595 and ask for its immediate consideration . 
mr. speaker , for the purpose of debate only , i yield 30 minutes to the gentleman from massachusetts ( mr. mcgovern ) xz4002630 , pending which i yield myself such time as i may consume . 
during consideration of this resolution , all time yielded is for the purpose of debate only . 
mr. speaker , house resolution 595 waives all points of order against the conference report and against its consideration . 
i rise today in support of house resolution 595 and the underlying conference report for h.r. 3199 , the usa patriot and terrorism prevention reauthorization act of 2005 . 
mr. speaker , i would first like to take this opportunity to thank chairmen sensenbrenner and king for all of their work in shepherding h.r. 3199 initially in the committee and then on the floor and now through the conference . 
this conference report demonstrates this congress 's commitment to find common ground in order to move solid and important legislation for the good and safety of the american people . 
this conference report is the culmination of 4 years of thorough hearings , extensive oversight , representing a collaborative effort to strengthen and fine tune our law enforcement needs and civil security needs as originally provided by the 2001 usa patriot act . 
today , america faces a grave threat from enemies who cowardly operate in the darkness of shadows , waiting with the intent to kill innocent people in the name of their hateful ideology . 
with respect to the provisions of this legislation , mr. speaker , this conference report will make permanent many vital law enforcement tools made available for use against suspected terrorists by the usa patriot act while establishing 4-year sunsets on a few provisions such as section 206 , fisa , foreign intelligence surveillance act , multi-point wire taps , section 215 , fisa business record provisions and finally , the lone wolf provision . 
with respect to section 206 , it is important to recognize that the ability to track terrorists through the use of multi point or roving wire taps is essential because it allows law enforcement to follow a terrorist , rather than a telephone . 
mr. speaker , terrorists are not reliant on two dixie cups and a piece of string to coordinate and plot terrorist attacks . 
they have access to a universal and a vast array of communication technologies , and our laws must take this fact into account . 
if these are acceptable tools against some dope-pushing thug , then they should be acceptable tools against terrorists who seek to destroy american lives and rip apart the very fabric of this great nation . 
mr. speaker , i encourage all of my colleagues to support the rule and the underlying conference report , and i reserve the balance of my time . 
in regard to section 215 , i want to remind the gentleman that section 215 , relating to investigators ' access to business records , this reauthorization requires a statement of fact showing reasonable grounds to believe that the records or other things sought are relevant to an authorized investigation to protect against international terrorism or espionage . 
mr. speaker , i could continue with that , but i now yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from california ( mr. dreier ) xz4001150 , the distinguished chairman of the rules committee . 
mr. speaker , i would like to remind the gentleman that in the original bill that we considered , h.r. 3199 , which 43 of his colleagues supported , there were sunset provisions not in two , but in three , sections that were of 10 years ' duration . 
mr. speaker , i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from north carolina ( mr. coble ) xz4000760 , a member of the judiciary and transportation committees . 
i think this is very important for all of us to keep in mind . 
mr. speaker , i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from tennessee ( mr. wamp ) xz4004210 , a member of the appropriations committee . 
mr. speaker , i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from florida ( mr. keller ) xz4002120 , a member of the education and workforce committee . 
i want to remind the gentleman from texas that this latest 9/11 commission so-called report card gave us an f for failing to reveal the amount of intelligence spending to the terrorists . 
so if that is the kind of report card he is talking about , then i am proud of that f. mr. speaker , i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from california ( mr. rohrabacher ) xz4003430 . 
madam speaker , i reserve the balance of my time for the purpose of closing . 
madam speaker , i continue to reserve the balance of my time . 
conservatives , liberals , moderates , democrats , republicans , independents , the aclu , the department of justice and various other organizations have all had the opportunity to voice their thoughts and concerns on the underlying bill . 
again , i want to encourage all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support both the rule and the underlying bill . 
madam speaker , i yield back the balance of my time , and i move the previous question on the resolution . 
mr. chairman , i rise in support of the gentleman 's amendment . 
they are acts of war , war against our way of life . 
if a terrorist strikes on our soil we owe it to the victims of an attack to punish those responsible with the heaviest possible penalty , the death penalty . 
to do less would be a disservice to those who have lost their lives and would send a signal of weakness to those who are willing to use any means necessary to seek our destruction . 
but let me say that this amendment treats acts of terrorism just like treason or espionage because that is what these acts truly are , not only crimes against individuals but crimes against our nation . 
mr. speaker , as many have said , we are all watching events unfold in london this morning , hoping that this is not another gruesome act of terrorism . 
if they can strike twice in the heart of london , a city on high alert , then just think what they might try to do in any city in america . 
most of the act is not objectionable , but it is far from perfect , and there are several key provisions that allow the government to engage in unnecessarily broad searches and surveillance of innocent americans . 
the permanent select committee on intelligence tried to mend it , but the committee on rules did not make any of our amendments in order . 
nine of us offered responsible , common-sense amendments : to establish the traditional fisa standard for search warrants and trap and trace/pen register authorities , to ensure that the government can not seize your personal records unless they are related to a foreign power ; to tighten the ability of the fbi to conduct roving wiretaps , to ensure that only terror suspects and their enablers , not innocent americans , are wiretapped ; to re-sunset the key provisions in the act in another 4 years to assure accountability and effective congressional oversight , and specifically to sunset the lone wolf provision , enacted only 8 months ago , in 2010 ; finally , to prohibit the fbi from using the broad fisa powers to get bookstore or library documentary records , a provision which passed this house last month on a strong bipartisan vote . 
mr. speaker , the hastings amendment to sunset the lone wolf provision was accepted by the chairman of our committee , the gentleman from michigan ( mr. hoekstra ) xz4001820 . 
the gentleman from florida ( mr. hastings ) xz4001702 is a valued member of the committee on rules , but his own committee stripped out his amendment in the base bill and did not even allow him to offer it on the floor . 
the committee on rules should not be able to block the will of democrats and republicans on the permanent select committee on intelligence to improve the patriot act . 
mr. speaker , this rule undermines the will of the house and blocks us from mending and improving critical tools in this era of terror . 
mr. chairman , the london attacks this morning , be they copycat terrorism or yet another al qaeda attempt , are one more reminder of how vulnerable we are . 
instead , we face a loose network of home-grown terror cells , or what i call franchise terrorism . 
second , on the issue of reauthorizing the 16 provisions that are sunsetting , my view is `` mend it , do n't end it. '' the patriot act was passed 45 days after 9/11 , with little debate . 
the invasion of afghanistan had begun and capitol hill was hit with anthrax attacks . 
and if some of the amendments we will consider pass , it will be even better . 
the good news is that the senate judiciary committee , on a bipartisan basis , has just reported a bill that includes many of them . 
you either get more of both or less . 
the american people deserve more of both . 
mr. chairman , i reserve the balance of my time . 
mr. chairman , it is my pleasure to yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from texas ( mr. reyes ) xz4003370 , a member of our committee . 
mr. chairman , i yield 1 1/2 minutes to the gentleman from iowa ( mr. boswell ) xz4000420 , a valued member of the permanent select committee on intelligence and the only one of us successful enough to get his language adopted in the bill before us today . 
mr. chairman , i yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from california ( ms. eshoo ) xz4001240 , a member of the permanent select committee on intelligence . 
mr. chairman , i yield 1 1/2 minutes to the gentleman from new jersey ( mr. holt ) xz4001840 , another valued member of our committee . 
mr. chairman , i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from maryland ( mr. ruppersberger ) xz4003490 , the former rookie of our committee . 
mr. chairman , i yield the balance of my time to the gentlewoman from california ( ms. pelosi ) xz4003140 , minority leader and my predecessor as ranking member on the permanent select committee on intelligence . 
mr. chairman , i rise in support of this amendment on two grounds . 
this does tighten section 215 , which has probably been , more than any other section in the patriot act , the subject of intense worry for outside groups and especially those who use libraries . 
but , second , i support it because of the process involved . 
the gentleman from arizona ( mr. flake ) xz4001340 and the gentleman from california ( mr. schiff ) xz4003610 have worked on a bipartisan basis to craft something they could both support and to persuade the leadership of the committee on the judiciary and the committee on rules to embrace it . 
this is what we should see more of , and i wish we were seeing more of it in connection with this bill . 
there is an even better way to amend section 215 , and that way has just been embraced unanimously , obviously on a bipartisan basis , by the senate committee on the judiciary , and that is to connect section 215 orders to specific facts which show the target is connected to an agent of a foreign power . 
mr. chairman , i thank the gentleman for yielding me this time , and i rise in support of his amendment . 
as the chairman of the permanent select committee on intelligence just said , we did try to work out a unanimous consent request . 
the chairman of the committee on the judiciary is right . 
this is a modest amendment that will yield good information so that we will proceed to do data mining in an efficient way consistent with protecting the civil liberties of law-abiding americans . 
i agree with the chairman of the committee on the judiciary . 
and i am pleased to see that , so far , this debate has all been in favor of support of this motion to instruct , which i think is a very important statement for this house to make . 
madam speaker , i take my responsibilities as ranking member of the intelligence committee very seriously . 
i spend a lot of my day and a lot of my weekend , and most of my nights thinking and dreaming about how i can add value to protecting americans and american interests . 
however , consistent with statements that mr. rohrabacher has just made , as we give these expanded authorities , we also need to assure the law-abiding public of america that we will be vigilant in supervising these authorities . 
not just today , not just in the oversight hearings we held during this last year and , yes , we held a lot of them , but tomorrow and next year and the year after . 
such a world is not the stuff of hollywood movies . 
the horrific events of september 11 , and the more recent bombings in bali , britain , jordan , madrid , morocco , saudi arabia and turkey remind us that the terrorists are prepared to strike anywhere , at any time -- and with maximum destructive force . 
with this as a backdrop , it has been and remains my view that the patriot act tools are needed : to track communications by email and internet , including the use of internet sites in libraries ; and to prevent and disrupt plots against us . 
such powerful tools must be narrowly tailored to ensure that they do not violate the rights of innocent americans . 
many of us in both bodies worked hard to make this conference report better . 
in the end , we asked for three things of critical importance . 
third , modifying the `` conclusive '' presumption that disclosure of an nsl would harm national security . 
the legislation properly establishes that recipients of nsls have the ability to consult an attorney and challenge an nsl in a federal court . 
but the `` conclusive '' presumption language makes it virtually impossible to challenge the `` gag '' order on recipients of nsls . 
to remedy this , several of us will introduce legislation to replace the `` conclusive '' presumption language with a `` rebuttable '' presumption , and to incorporate critical checks and balances on the `` front end '' of the nsl process . 
another flaw in the report is section 215 , commonly called the library provision , which allows the government to gather a wide range of business materials , including library , medical and tax records . 
but the conference report should have explicitly required that the records be connected to a foreign power , or an agent of a foreign power -- the traditional fisa standard . 
instead of taking a few additional days to craft a strong bipartisan report that strikes the best balance , the majority rushed to file this flawed report . 
that is why i have co-sponsored h.r. 4506 , to provide a 3-month extension of the patriot act to give the conferees additional time to bring to the floor a more carefully tailored bill with strong bipartisan support . 
my view of the patriot act is we need to mend it , not end it . 
mr. chairman , i rise in support of the amendment . 
money is a key element of terrorist organizations . 
in order to thwart terrorists financing , president bush in september of 2001 signed an executive order freezing the assets of terrorist organizations and their supporters and authorizing the secretaries of treasury and state to identify , designate , and freeze the u.s.-based assets that financially facilitate terrorism . 
one of the most important lessons we have learned is exactly how terrorists and other criminal organizations transmit money through unregulated financial markets . 
like the patchwork of terrorist organizations themselves , terrorism funding does not come from a single source . 
terrorism networks are funded through rogue state sponsorship , corrupt charities , and illegitimate businesses fronting as legitimate businesses and using that money for terrorism , also through exploitation of our legitimate markets and financial networks . 
my amendment would address some of the loopholes . 
they must keep pace to help prevent financing of terrorist activities . 
as chancellor gordon brown stated last week , prevention of money laundering is the key element of stopping the financing of terrorist groups of the type suspected of planning and carrying out the london bombings . 
first , my amendment will add a predicate offense to the money-laundering statutes , such as operating illegal money laundering and transmitting businesses , misuse of social security numbers , military-style training of individuals , and a new terrorism financing offense . 
my amendment also clarifies the law so that a combination of transactions or parallel transactions can trigger money-laundering statutes . 
mr. chairman , our patriot act added a new forfeiture provision for individuals planning or perpetrating the act of terrorism against the united states . 
my amendment adds a parallel provision for individuals planning or perpetrating an act of terrorism against a foreign state or an international organization acting within the jurisdiction of the united states . 
this amendment builds on our current laws to address some of the shortfalls in our laws that we have learned about from our law enforcement since 9/11 . 
just to answer a couple of points : what we do in the amendment is to help to provide opportunities for a series of predicate offenses . 
so what you get is an opportunity to follow through a number of transactions to show that there is money laundering . 
and we have added a couple of new offenses , but there can be a mixture of some legal and illegal transactions to do that . 
it is very clear that there would have to be a series of transactions that are suspect in order for this law to be triggered ; and , obviously , there has to be some suspicion of financing terrorism before law enforcement would move forward with that kind of prosecution . 
mr. chairman , i thank the gentleman for yielding me this time , and i just want to thank the chairman of the committee on the judiciary , who supports the amendment , and also the chairman of the committee on financial services , who certainly would have been concerned if the concern of the gentlewoman from california were a legitimate one regarding our language . 
it is very clear that there would have to be a series of transactions . 
that series of transactions would have to lead law enforcement to believe that there is a financing of terrorism . 
madam speaker , i rise in support of h.r. 3199 , the patriot act reauthorization conference report . 
i want to thank chairman sensenbrenner for including a number of provisions from h.r. 3007 combating terrorism financing act . 
funding is the lifeblood of terrorist organizations -- if we are to prevent future attacks and continue to dismantle terrorist organizations we must deny them funding . 
terrorist analysts often note that it is fairly inexpensive to carry out a single act of terror -- for example , it is estimated that the attack on the world trade center cost only $ 500 , 000 . 
one of the most important lessons we have learned is exactly how terrorists and other criminal organizations transmit money through unregulated financial markets . 
like the patchwork of terrorist organizations and cells , terrorism funding does not come from a single source . 
terrorist networks are funded through state sponsorship , charities and businesses fronting as legitimate institutions , and exploitation of markets and financial networks . 
finally , the original patriot act added a new forfeiture provision for individuals planning or perpetrating an act of terrorism against the united states . 
the language in the conference report adds a parallel provision for individuals planning or perpetrating an act of terrorism against a foreign state or international organizations acting within the jurisdiction of the united states . 
the language in the conference report builds on our current laws , to address some of the shortfalls that we have learned about since september 11 . 
mr. chairman , i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from california ( mr. cunningham ) xz4000910 , a member of the committee . 
mr. chairman , i yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from new mexico ( mrs. wilson ) xz4004341 , another member of the committee . 
mr. chairman , i reserve the balance of my time . 
mr. chairman , i yield 1 minute to the gentleman from kansas ( mr. tiahrt ) xz4004050 , a member of the permanent select committee on intelligence . 
mr. chairman , i reserve the balance of my time . 
mr. chairman , as we close general debate on the u.s. patriot act , i yield 1 minute to the gentleman from wisconsin ( mr. sensenbrenner ) xz4003650 , the author of the bill , chairman of the committee on the judiciary . 
mr. chairman , i yield myself the balance of my time . 
the greatest responsibility of the intelligence community is to protect our country from attack . 
the full energies of the intelligence community are directed to finding and monitoring that enemy abroad , but our most pressing and immediate concern is with those foreign terrorists who may be even closer to home , those within the borders of the united states . 
the continued acts of alleged terrorism in london today should continue to highlight the urgency of these efforts and the critical nature of the patriot act authorities . 
within days of the first london bombings , british authorities were able to rapidly identify the bombers and follow their trail to other terrorists . 
by now , you have all seen the chilling photograph of the very first group of london bombers to gather in a rail station . 
in the united states the authorities of the patriot act likely would have been used to obtain that photograph . 
british investigators then obtained leads from a terrorist phone to tie them to the coconspirators of the first group of bombers . 
in the united states , the authorities of the patriot act likely would have been used to obtain those records . 
mr. chairman , our counterterrorism investigators in the intelligence community can do truly remarkable work to find terrorists and to piece together the puzzle of their networks , but to do that they need modern legal authorities to deal with modern threats . 
mr. chairman , i yield back the balance of my time . 
mr. chairman , i yield 1 minute to the gentleman from california ( mr. hunter ) xz4001910 , the chairman of the committee on armed services . 
mr. chairman , i yield myself the balance of my time . 
the amendment would require disclosure of data mining sources and methods used to collect information on terrorists and contains no exemption for national security purposes . 
the house has worked to increase the use of open source and other information against foreign terrorists and others who seek to harm the united states . 
the amendment applies onerous reporting requirements that could dramatically restrict the use of such technologies to use such resources to discover and respond to terrorist activities . 
mr. chairman , i yield back the balance of my time . 
madam speaker , i rise in strong support of the conference report . 
we are at war against a global enemy , the global enemy of terrorism . 
as chairman of the intelligence committee , i want to take this opportunity to remind my colleagues that the central purpose of this bill is to provide enhanced intelligence authorities to combat spies and terrorists within the united states . 
they are a crucial part of our efforts to build a strong domestic national security capability within the fbi . 
the conference report under consideration today will make 14 of 16 provisions of the patriot act permanent while also including sensible clarifications and improvements in many areas where there should be broad , bipartisan agreement . 
these include a clearer standard for obtaining certain business records , clarification that that authority may be subject to judicial review , and much more specific standards with respect to the use of national security letters and roving wire taps . 
even if all of the amendments before us today are passed , it will not bring this bill into the shape that it should be . 
i am sorry to say that most of our reasonable amendments were voted down on a party-line basis . 
the police and prosecution powers of government are among the most important powers for preserving life and liberty , but they are also among the most fearsome . 
now , the fbi in that case apologized , but this is something that hits home , and we have a responsibility to preserve the freedoms of people at home . 
mr. chairman , i rise today in opposition to the reauthorization of the patriot act . 
as you know , the patriot act was passed in the aftermath of the attacks of september 11 , 2001 . 
the act was an immediate reaction to the state of shock the country was in -- being drafted , briefly debated , approved , and signed into law by october 26 , 2001 , just weeks after the attacks . 
at the time i , and many other members of congress , voted for the act under the condition that a number of the provisions contained within it would sunset and thus would need to be reviewed and reauthorized . 
the police and prosecution powers of the government are important and necessary to preserving life and liberty , but they are also the most fearsome powers of government and , if abused , can rob us of life and liberty . 
for generations , thousands upon thousands of people have come to america 's shores to be free of the oppressive hand of authorities in other countries , to be free of the fear of the knock on the door in the middle of the night , to be free of the humiliation and costs and stigma of inappropriate investigations . 
as the only member of congress from new jersey , a state which suffered great loss on september 11th , on the house permanent select committee on intelligence , i looked forward to working within the committee during our mark up of the patriot act to address a number of valid concerns that have arisen over the last few years about the sun-setting provisions . 
however , most of the important amendments that were offered were defeated on party lines . 
i remain deeply concerned about many of the provisions in the patriot act as reported to the house , but i would like to specifically discuss two of them . 
investigators can take pictures and even seize personal items or records and unbelievably they do not need to tell you about it for an indefinite period of time . 
another provision of the patriot act , section 215 , allows investigators broad access to any record without probable cause of a crime . 
in other words , most of the records searched are of innocent people , but because there is a terrorist investigation underway or a terrorists records might be somewhere in the batch , they get swept up in the search . 
it is because of this that the patriot act must be understood as affecting all of us . 
a small number of unnecessary intrusions can have a broadly chilling effect . 
proponents of the patriot bill before us will say that it is directed at terrorists , not law abiding citizens , but they should try to tell that to mr. brandon mayfield of portland , oregon . 
more so called evidence was collected when his residence was searched , without his knowledge , under section 213 of the act . 
of course , some mistakes will occur , but this bill strikes the wrong balance and makes those errors more likely . 
in 2001 , i voted in favor of the patriot act with reservations , and my reservations have only increased over time . 
at the time , i said that in the anxious aftermath of the attacks of september 11 , 2001 , we were likely to get wrong the balance between freedom and security . 
and they would have provided the important sunsets that would force review of the bill in four years . 
he said , `` i believe there are more instances of the abridgement of the freedom of the people by gradual and silent encroachments of those in power than by violent and sudden usurpations. '' as madison said over 200 years ago , the liberty and freedoms we as americans cherish are being eroded today not at the barricade , but in the library , and at our local doctor 's office . 
madam speaker , i thank the gentleman from michigan for all of his good work and for yielding me the time now . 
these provisions and many others have a deep impact on the freedoms and civil liberties of all americans . 
it is because of that that the patriot act must be seen as something that affects all of us . 
searching business records can sweep up people , most of whom are innocent . 
a small number of unnecessary intrusions can have a broadly chilling effect . 
proponents of the patriot bill before us will say that it is directed against terrorists , not law-abiding citizens . 
but they should try to tell that to brandon mayfield of portland , oregon . 
of course , some mistakes will occur . 
it also allows the fact , the very fact of such a search to remain undisclosed to the subject indefinitely . 
i urge my colleagues to oppose this flawed conference report and protect the liberties and freedoms of our citizens that are central to what it means to be an american . 
simply stated , mr. speaker , passing this conference report today will institutionalize an abridgment of the bill of rights . 
like all of my colleagues , i support common sense measures that will help our law enforcement and intelligence organizations protect the american people . 
for example , i support the provisions of the patriot act that permit surveillance or physical searches in foreign intelligence investigations where the `` significant '' purpose of the action is to collect intelligence . 
i also favor the provisions that allow the sharing of foreign intelligence information with federal law enforcement agencies , or with intelligence , protective , immigration , or military personnel for their official use . 
these are useful and necessary provisions that have clearly benefited our intelligence and law enforcement counterterrorism efforts without endangering the civil liberties of americans . 
when this bill was on the house floor in july , i expressed grave concern about several provisions , including section 213 , which allows the so called `` sneak and peek '' searches in anyone 's home , as well as section 215 , which allows investigators broad access to any record without probable cause of a crime . 
how can any american feel `` secure in their persons , houses , papers , and effects , against unreasonable searches '' if the department of justice can send agents into one 's home without notice , either before or after the fact ? 
true , this new version of the act provides for a 90-day maximum for notification of a subject that her or his dwelling or business has been searched , but it is weak protection that in effect allows the fact of a search to be concealed from the subject indefinitely . 
there is simply no excuse for a state like new jersey to get a smaller percentage of homeland security grants than states that clearly are not at the same level of risk of being attacked . 
the house strongly supported changing the distribution formula so that states , like new jersey , that face greater risk of terrorist attacks or other catastrophic events would get a greater share of the grant money , a viewed shared by secretary chertoff . 
further , the members of the 9/11 commission recently reiterated their support for a change in the formula and said , `` it should be obvious that our defenses should be strongest were the enemy intends to strike -- and where we are most vulnerable. '' failing to distribute these vital homeland security grants according to risk is like sending hurricane preparedness funds to north dakota . 
they may be well-received , but sending them to a low-risk area comes at a price to parts of the country that need it more . 
the fbi and department of homeland security have repeatedly warned of the threat to transportation and economic infrastructure targets in new jersey , and we know from published press reports that al qaeda operatives have conducted surveillance activities against economic and other targets in new jersey . 
under this bill , new jersey will not receive the federal support it needs to harden these targets or full range of tools that our police and other first responders would require to respond should another 9/11-style attack occur . 
liberty has always come from the subjects of it . 
the history of liberty is the history of resistance . 
the history of liberty is a history of limitations of government power , not the increase of it. '' today , we have made the mistake of ignoring history and increased the government 's power at the expense of our citizen 's liberty . 
this is a grave error , and it is why i will vote against reauthorization of the patriot act . 
mr. chairman , i rise today in opposition to h.r. 3199 , the usa patriot and terrorism prevention reauthorization act of 2005 . 
while congress should be revising the flawed aspects of the patriot act , we are instead poised to make permanent the provisions that were supposed to sunset at the end of this year . 
my fear is that the actions of our government pursuant to the patriot act amount to nothing short of a taking , not a taking of property , rather of our rights and our liberties . 
for example , the house judiciary committee democrats have uncovered the following regarding the act : it has been used more than 150 times to secretly search an individual 's home , with nearly 90 percent of those cases having had nothing to do with terrorism . 
it has been used to deny , on account of his political beliefs , the admission to the united states of a swiss citizen and prominent muslim scholar to teach at notre dame university . 
these are just a few of the incidents we know of , yet they are enough to raise plenty of concerns in my mind . 
because of gag restrictions , we will never know how many times it has been used to obtain reading records from libraries and bookstores , but we do know that libraries have been solicited by the department of justice -- voluntarily or under threat of the patriot act -- for reader information on more than 200 occasions since the 9/11 terrorist attacks . 
rather than making the provisions in question permanent , we should be reviewing and amending the most intrusive of these provisions that are subject to the sunset clause such as : sec . 
215 : secret searches of personal records , including library records . 
the bill does not provide a standard of individual suspicion so that the court that examines these extraordinary requests can ensure personal privacy is respected , and also falls short by failing to correct the automatic , permanent secrecy order . 
the bill does nothing to correct this overbroad provision of the patriot act that allows the government to get `` john doe '' roving wiretaps -- wiretaps that fail to specify the target or the device . 
instead we are here today ignoring the more troubling provisions such as : the `` delayed notice '' of a search warrant , the intrusive `` national security letters '' power of the fbi , and the overbroad definition of domestic terrorism . 
by passing a bill that largely ignores the most serious abuses of the patriot act , that ignores the abuse of power by the bush administration , and which fails to give adequate resources and money to those on the `` front line '' in the fight against terrorism . 
madam speaker , i rise today in opposition to the conference report on h.r. 3199 , the usa patriot and terrorism prevention reauthorization act of 2005 . 
as part of the deal agreed to by house and senate republican conferees , federal law enforcement authorities will retain the right to : investigate american citizens without judicial oversight , a power that is invoked more than 30 , 000 times each year ; search individuals ' private property without notifying them ; access citizens ' library records , medical records , school records , and financial records virtually unchecked by the judiciary . 
the house-senate conference committee had an opportunity to revise the patriot act 's expiring provisions to protect the rights and liberties of all americans more effectively . 
the resulting conference report falls short of what the american people have every reason to expect congress to achieve in defending their rights while advancing their security . 
the conference report drops key protections in the senate-passed bill regarding `` national security letters. '' national security letters , nsls , are , in effect , a form of secret administrative subpoena . 
the conference report also fails to protect the records of innocent americans collected by means of these nsls . 
by passing a conference report that allows the troubling aspects of the patriot act to continue , we pursue a false sense of national security at the expense of our civil liberties . 
mr. speaker , i rise in opposition to this rule , but before i speak on the rule itself , let me say to our friends in great britain , one of our strongest allies in the fight against terrorism , we are with you . 
everybody on this floor views themselves and acts as a patriot on behalf of america , its values , and its people . 
all 435 members of this house . 
they will see things differently as we consider this bill , but they are all 100 percent committed to defeating terrorism , to ferreting out terrorists , to getting them off our streets , out of our country and incarcerated , as they should be . 
make no mistake about the commonality of that commitment . 
i know that the members of this house on both sides of the aisle are united in that commitment . 
what they will see today , however , mr. speaker , is an abuse of power by the republican majority , which has deliberately and purposefully chosen to stifle a full debate on this critical legislation . 
a republican rule that has been offered today is nothing less , and i use my words carefully , than a craven failure of our congressional oversight responsibility on legislation that involves the government 's power to intrude on the lives of americans . 
every single year , mr. speaker , this congress reauthorizes the department of defense programs . 
today , however , we are being asked to give up that oversight responsibility and permanently authorize many sections of this bill . 
now , let me make it clear to the public that the overwhelming majority of the patriot act is in law right now and will not be affected by this legislation . 
sixteen sections only are the subject of this legislation . 
why are you afraid to have a vote on the floor of the house of representatives on that provision ? 
you failed to offer that , yet 238 members of this house , just days ago , voted for that provision . 
are you afraid of the democratic process in this , the people 's house ? 
my friends , this rule is not consistent with the open democratic process in adopting one of the most important bills that we will consider . 
i simply do not understand the reticence to include sunset provisions on a law that affects the civil liberties of every american citizen . 
in fact , when we reauthorized the patriot act in july , the republican bill permanently authorized 14 of the 16 provisions . 
because when it comes to the government 's power to intrude on the private lives of citizens , the united states congress should not give the government unchecked power to do so . 
just last sunday the washington post documented , and it has been referenced here , the hundredfold increase in the issuance of national security letters seeking information about u.s. citizens and visitors who are not even alleged to be terrorist or spies . 
in fact , it was not until several sections of the patriot act were set to expire that the justice department began to respond to congressional inquiries and we had the opportunity to assess , examine , and recalibrate our policies . 
no matter how good the leadership is in the justice department , it is not a policy that we ought to pursue and would be an abdication of our congressional oversight responsibility and contrary to the interests of the american people . 
madam speaker , this motion would recede to the senate and create a 4-year sunset on the most controversial provisions in the patriot act , orders by the secret foreign intelligence court , blank wiretap orders and the surveillance of agents of a foreign power who act alone . 
as i said , and i will echo the comments of so many here , terrorism is an immediate and proximate threat , as we lawyers say ; and we need to respond effectively to keep america safe . 
but in the process , we must also protect the basic rights that our founding fathers knew were the bedrock of the united states democracy . 
i want to join with the chairman of the permanent select committee on intelligence in opposing this amendment and just making the point that sources and methods are important . 
his analysis and the analysis of his experts and ours is that this would indeed compromise those capabilities . 
mr. chairman , i yield myself 4 minutes , and i am very pleased to offer an amendment to the usa patriot reauthorization act which deals with the new reality of overlapping links between illicit narcotics and global terrorism . 
evidence of this deadly and emerging symbiotic relationship is overwhelming . 
the committee on international relations recently held a hearing on afghanistan in which our well-informed drug enforcement administration conservatively estimated that nearly half of the formerly designated foreign terrorist organizations have links to illicit narcotics . 
in colombia , the revolutionary armed forces of colombia and the auc , which are two of these ftos , thrive on the drug trade , supporting and sustaining themselves with illicit proceeds . 
the amendment provides very tough penalties , consistent with the serious nature of this crime . 
mr. chairman , i urge adoption of my amendment which will give the tools to our law enforcement personnel in their ongoing global fight against terrorism . 
mr. chairman , i reserve the balance of my time . 
it seems to me a modest sentence of 20 years for those two heinous crimes . 
there is a definite link between the illicit narcotics trade and the financing of terrorism . 
the gentleman from virginia uses the term `` common sense. '' i think it is the utmost of common sense for us to address the flourishing of illicit drug trade and its link with narcoterrorism , so i respectfully hope that the members will support this amendment . 
mr. chairman , i yield back the balance of my time . 
by renewing this measure , we are continuing to provide our law enforcement agencies and the administration with many of the critical tools needed to combat global terrorism and protect america . 
provisions of the patriot act have already been instrumental in warding off further terrorist attacks since 9/11 , and they are responsible for helping to keep us safe here at home . 
in addition , the bill includes an added provision , which i authored , offering a new tool to attack the growing phenomenon of narco-terrorism , with the proceeds of illicit drug funding and financing feeding the foreign terrorist organizations , ftos , and supporting acts of terrorism . 
passage of the patriot act conference report will enhance federal criminal law to effectively address the current reality , according to the drug enforcement administration , of illicit drugs being linked to nearly half of the designated ftos around the globe today . 
in this measure , my provision makes narco-terrorism , which involves both the illicit drug trade and support for terrorism , a federal crime , and provides tough penalties that match the nature of such deadly and dual criminal activity . 
our hardworking drug enforcement administration will no longer be challenged to produce evidence of a nexus of these illicit drugs to the united states , if there is proof that the illicit drugs support ftos or acts of terrorism . 
in afghanistan , most of the heroin from illicit drug production goes to europe , rather than here , and much of the profit then finances and supports anticoalition terrorists and attacks on our forces there . 
madam speaker , i urge my colleagues to support the passage of the patriot act conference report . 
i have the distinction of being one of the few members on the committee on the judiciary who is not an attorney , and i got a little applause on that , i think . 
but i came to congress from the business of automobile security . 
the one thing i know about what we are dealing with in terrorism is that if you leave an open window on an automobile , no amount of security will protect you . 
the recent bombings in london could have happened on american soil , and it is only through the vigilance of our many law enforcement entities that we can combat this occurrence . 
one of those tools was the expansion of roving wiretap authority . 
for that reason , i seek to amend h.r. 3199 to add a level of judicial oversight not in the current bill . 
my amendment requires law enforcement to report back to the court within 15 days of using the roving aspect of the warrant . 
my amendment also requires law enforcement to report on the total number of electronic surveillances that have been conducted . 
these are simple steps that will help guard against possible abuses in the future , while doing nothing to hamper the value of the roving wiretap . 
mr. chairman , i thoroughly appreciate the opportunity to offer this amendment ; but i also want to comment that we have , as a committee , worked like never before on a bipartisan basis to dramatically improve a law when it came to civil liberties that already had good teeth when it came to the security of our people . 
mr. chairman , i reserve the balance of my time . 
mr. chairman , it is with great pleasure that i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from wisconsin ( mr. sensenbrenner ) xz4003650 , the chairman of the entire judiciary committee . 
i want to assure the gentlewoman from california that her concerns on electronic data and the fact that in an era of voip that we do have to look at that . 
i serve with the gentlewoman in california on many of the caucuses that deal with that . 
i look forward to both in judiciary and , quite candidly , in other committees of jurisdiction here in the congress to continue to work on properly identifying and modernizing how that is going to be interpreted . 
i think it is beyond the scope of the patriot act today , but it certainly is not beyond the congress to have to bring things up to snuff , and i look forward to working with the gentlewoman from california . 
mr. chairman , i reserve the balance of my time . 
mr. chairman , i yield back the balance of my time . 
mr. speaker , i rise to join many of my colleagues in strongly opposing the restrictive rule set forth on h.r. 3199 , the `` usa patriot and terrorism prevention reauthorization act of 2005. '' as you know , in light of the world we live in now , this is a very important piece of legislation . 
having such a rule truly goes too far and limits the protections of the american people . 
let me take a moment to discuss an important amendment of mine that was not ruled in order . 
my amendment 141 , dealing with racial profiling , would have required the inspector general to appoint an official to produce a report to the house and senate judiciary committees showing a statistical breakdown of the race , nationality , or ethnic background of the subject of orders issued by the court under section 107 . 
every day , across the country , people of color are the victims of racial profiling and law enforcement brutality . 
as a matter of policy and law , this body must use this very clear opportunity to set the record straight with respect to exercising good faith law enforcement practices . 
this amendment seeks to allow the attachment of property and the enforcement of a judgment against a judgment debtor that has engaged in planning or perpetrating any act of domestic or international terrorism under the `` forfeiture clause '' of 18 u.s.c . 
the legislation , as drafted , fails to deal with the current limitation on the ability to enforce civil judgments by victims and family members of victims of terrorist offenses . 
there are several examples of how the current administration has sought to bar victims from satisfying judgments obtained against the government of iran , for example . 
while a federal the text of the amendment previously referred to by ms. slaughter xz4003780 is as follows : at the end of the resolution add the following new sections : `` sec . 
2. notwithstanding any other provision of this resolution the amendment specified in section 3 shall be in order as though printed after the amendment numbered 20 in the report of the committee on rules if offered by representative sanders of vermont or a designee . 
3. the amendment referred to in section 2 is as follows : at the end of section 8 add the following new subsection : & lt ; p & gt ; ( e ) library and bookseller records. -- section 501 of the foreign intelligence surveillance act of 1978 ( 50 u.s.c . 
1861 ) is amended by adding at the end the following new subsection : & lt ; p & gt ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; `` ( g ) ( 1 ) no application may be made under this section with either the purpose or effect of searching for , or seizing from , a bookseller or library documentary materials ( except for records of internet use ) that contain personally identifiable information concerning a patron of a bookseller or library. & lt ; p & gt ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; `` ( 2 ) nothing in this subsection shall be construed as precluding a physical search for documentary materials referred to in paragraph ( 1 ) under other provisions of law , including under section 303. & lt ; p & gt ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; `` ( 3 ) in this subsection : & lt ; p & gt ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; `` ( a ) the term `bookseller ' means any person or entity engaged in the sale , rental or delivery of books , journals , magazines or other similar forms of communication in print or digitally. & lt ; p & gt ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; `` ( b ) the term `library ' has the meaning given that term under section 213 ( 2 ) of the library services and technology act ( 20 u.s.c . 
9122 ( 2 ) ) whose services include access to the internet , books , journals , magazines , newspapers , or other similar forms of communication in print or digitally to patrons for their use , review , examination or circulation. & lt ; p & gt ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; `` ( c ) the term `patron ' means any purchaser , renter , borrower , user or subscriber of goods or services from a library or bookseller. & lt ; p & gt ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; `` ( d ) the term `documentary materials ' means any document , tape , or other communication created by a bookseller or library in connection with print or digital dissemination of a book , journal , magazine , newspaper , or other similar form of communication . 
mr. chairman , i hope we can characterize this debate in the manner that it should be , particularly as we rise in the backdrop of the tragedy of london , england . 
might i say that even though we would have preferred , many of us as democrats , a lengthier time for debate in committee , i want to thank the gentleman from michigan ( mr. conyers ) xz4000800 and the gentleman from wisconsin ( mr. sensenbrenner ) xz4003650 for the ongoing debate and allowing for amendments over a period of time to discuss the patriot act . 
it should be commented on that this is not a definition of patriotism , of who is more patriotic than the next person , for the underlying bill exists . 
but there also should be some concerns about limiting overreach and overbroadness , with americans understanding one of the issues that we are debating today , and that is the very premise of civil liberties juxtaposed against the responsibility of fighting the war on terror . 
then , i would have hoped my colleagues would have supported an increased funding , which has not been done by the majority , on rail security and port security and , of course , the idea of insuring our buses and other public transportation modes . 
these are also components of making sure that we are safe . 
mr. chairman , even though it is a different story , the voter rights act in 1965 , which goes to the core of our democracy , was sunsetted ; and it has to be reauthorized . 
we only argue that it is important to reauthorize or to sunset so that we can have these debates , so that the american people can understand the limitation of their rights or the enhancement of their rights . 
we also know that these items can be used against americans , not just a foreign power , or the national security letters that the fbi can get financial , telephone , internet , and consumer goods records relevant to intelligence investigations , not just against agents of foreign powers , but against americans . 
or what about the sneak-and-peek provision that allows someone to come into your home and take anything , of course , called search and seizure , without notice , suggesting that it is involved in an investigation , and most of you would not know , most of america would not know that this is not limited to terrorism . 
so the question on debate today , i hope that we can center it around the question of restraint , but yet be vigorous in our fight for the war on terror . 
3 mr. chairman , i join my many colleagues , many victims of terrorism , and many victims of racial and religious profiling in opposing this legislation , h.r. 3199 , for several reasons . 
first , we never have been given the facts necessary to fully evaluate the operation of the underlying bill , the usa patriot act . 
second , there are numerous provisions in both the expiring and other sections of the patriot act that have little to do with combating terrorism , intrude on our privacy and civil liberties , and have been subject to repeated abuse and misuse by the justice department . 
since 2002 , 389 communities and 7 states have passed resolutions opposing parts of the patriot act , representing over 62 million people . 
additionally , numerous groups ranging the political spectrum have come forward to oppose certain sections of the patriot act and to demand that congress conduct more oversight on its use , including the american civil liberties union , american conservative union , american immigration lawyers association , among these troubling provisions are those that : authorize the attorney general ( ag ) to arrest and detain non-citizens based on mere suspicion , and require that they remain in detention `` irrespective of any relief they may be eligible for or granted. '' ( in order to grant someone relief from deportation , an immigration judge must find that the person is not a terrorist , a criminal , or someone who has engaged in fraud or misrepresentation. ) when relief from deportation is granted , no person should be subject to continued detention based merely on the attorney general 's unproven suspicions . 
the laws punish those who `` endorse , '' `` espouse , '' or `` persuade others to support terrorist activity or terrorist organizations. '' rather than prohibiting speech that includes violence or criminal activity , these new grounds of inadmissibility punish speech that `` undermines the united states ' efforts to reduce or eliminate terrorist activity. '' this language is unconstitutionally vague and overbroad , and will undeniably have a chilling effect on constitutionally protected speech . 
authorize the ag and the secretary of state to designate domestic groups as terrorist organizations and block any noncitizen who belongs to them from entering the country . 
under this provision , the mere payment of membership dues is a deportable offense . 
these constitutionally dubious initiatives undermine our historical commitment to the fair treatment of every individual before the law and do not enhance our security . 
i co-sponsored the civil liberties restoration act ( clra ) , reintroduced from the 108th congress by representatives howard berman ( d-ca ) and william delahunt ( d-ma ) , that seeks to roll back some of these egregious post-9/11 policies and to strike an appropriate balance between security needs and liberty interests . 
the clra would secure due process protections and civil liberties for non-citizens in the u.s. , enhance the effectiveness of our nation 's enforcement activities , restore the confidence of immigrant communities in the fairness of our government , and facilitate our efforts at promoting human rights and democracy around the world . 
my `` safe havens '' amendment that was made in order by the committee on rules relates to the civil forfeiture provision of 18 u.s.c . 
it seeks to allow victims of terrorism who obtain civil judgment for damages caused in connection with the acts to attach foreign or domestic assets held by the united states government under 18 u.s.c . 
section 981 ( g ) calls for the forfeiture of all assets , foreign or domestic , of any individual , entity , or organization that has engaged in planning or perpetrating any act of domestic or international terrorism against the united states , citizens or residents of the united states . 
the legislation , h.r. 3199 , as drafted , fails to deal with the current limitation on the ability to enforce civil judgments by victims and family members of victims of terrorist offenses . 
there are several examples of how the current administration has sought to bar victims from satisfying judgments obtained against the government of iran , for example . 
the administration responded to this incident by sending 1 , 000 special forces officers to track down the perpetrators , and the eldest child of the victim was invited to the state of the union address . 
the family of the victim should have access to those funds , at the very least , at the president 's discretion . 
while a federal district court held iran to be liable , the u.s. government intervened and argued that the cause should be dismissed because iran had not been designated a terrorist state at the time of the hostage incident and because of the algiers accords -- that led to the release of the hostages , which required the u.s. to bar the adjudication of suits arising from the incident . 
similarly , american servicemen who were harmed in a libyan sponsored bombing of the la belle disco in germany were obstructed from obtaining justice for the terrorist acts they suffered . 
while victims of the attack pursued settlement of their claims against the libyan government , the administration lifted sanctions against libya without requiring as a condition the determination of all claims of american victims of terrorism . 
as a result of this action , libya abandoned all talks with the claimants . 
furthermore , because libya was no longer considered a state sponsor of terrorism , the american servicemen and women and their families were left without recourse to obtain justice . 
in addition , a group of american prisoners who were tortured in iraq during the persian gulf war were barred from collecting their judgment from the iraqi government . 
although the 17 veterans won their case in the district court of the district of columbia , the administration argued that the iraqi assets should remain frozen in a u.s. bank account to aid in the reconstruction of iraq . 
claiming that the judgment should be overturned , the administration deems that rebuilding iraq is more important than recompensing the suffering of fighter pilots who , during the 12-year imprisonment , suffered beatings , burns , and threats of dismemberment . 
while the judgment was sound , the second circuit court of appeals affirmed the lower court 's finding that the iraqi assets , now transferred to the u.s. treasury , were protected by u.s. sovereign immunity and were unavailable for judicial attachment . 
while the patriot act may not deserve all of the ridicule that is heaped against it , there is little doubt that the legislation has been repeatedly and seriously misused by the justice department . 
consider the following : it 's been used more than 150 times to secretly search an individual 's home , with nearly 90 percent of those cases having had nothing to do with terrorism . 
it 's been used to deny , on account of his political beliefs , the admission to the united states of a swiss citizen and prominent muslim scholar to teach at the notre dame university . 
because of gag restrictions , we will never know how many times its been used to obtain reading records from library and book stores , but we do know that libraries have been solicited by the department of justice -- voluntarily or under threat of the patriot act -- for reader information on more than 200 occasions since september 11 . 
even worse than the patriot act has been the unilateral abuse of power by the administration . 
since september 11 , our government has detained and verbally and physically abused thousands of immigrants without time limit , for unknown and unspecified reasons , and target tens of thousands of arab-americans for intensive interrogations and immigration screenings . 
all this serves to accomplish is to alienate muslim and arab americans -- the key groups to fighting terrorism in our country -- who see a justice department that has institutionalized racial and ethnic profiling , without the benefit of a single terrorism conviction . 
nor it is helpful when our government condones the torture of prisoners at home and abroad , authorizes the monitoring of mosques and religious sties without any indication of criminal activity , and detains scores of individuals as material witnesses because it does not have evidence to indict them . 
this makes our citizens less safe not more safe , and undermines our role as a beacon of democracy and freedom . 
right now , h.r. 3199 is the most appropriate and timely vehicle in which to address this issue and allow u.s. victims of terrorism to obtain justice from terrorist-supporting or terrorist-housing nations . 
mr. chairman , i yield 1 1/2 minutes to the gentleman from michigan ( mr. conyers ) xz4000800 , the distinguished ranking member of the committee on the judiciary , and thank him for his constant moral compass on civil liberties and civil rights for the american people . 
mr. chairman , it is my great pleasure to yield 1 1/2 minutes to the gentleman from rhode island ( mr. langevin ) xz4002300 , a former attorney general of the great state of rhode island . 
i thank the distinguished gentleman from wisconsin for his cooperation in working to have this amendment be included in the final legislation as it is a sense of congress amendment that i think makes a very important statement . 
the proposal relates to the civil forfeiture provision of 18 u.s.c . 
981 , and would add a section that would allow civil plaintiffs to attach judgments to collect compensatory damages for which a terrorist organization has been adjudged liable and from the pool of assets that have been forfeited under section 981 . 
this is distinctive , mr. chairman , because this pertains to circumstances of terrorism but not necessarily in circumstances when we are at war . 
my amendment seeks to allow victims of terrorism who obtain civil judgments for damages caused in connection with the acts to attach foreign or domestic assets held by the united states government under 18 u.s.c . 
section 981 ( g ) calls for the forfeiture of all assets , foreign or domestic , of any individual entity or organization that is engaged in planning or perpetrating any act of domestic or international terrorism . 
the administration responded to this incident by sending a thousand special forces officers to track down the perpetrators , yet the family of this decreased could not claim any compensation for the tragedy that occurred . 
the same thing occurred with the iran hostages , which many of us are familiar with , but are my colleagues aware of the situation with our american servicemen who were harmed in the libyan-sponsored bombing of the la belle disco in germany ? 
in addition , a group of american prisoners tortured in iraq during the persian gulf war were barred from collecting their judgment from the iraqi government . 
fortunately , in the opportunity we have today , by including this sense of congress in the patriot act we will finally get both our debate and we will get action . 
while the judgment rendered was sound , the second circuit court of appeals affirmed the lower court 's finding that the iraqi assets , now transferred to the u.s. treasury , were protected by u.s. sovereign immunity and were unavailable for judicial attachment . 
one major problem that frustrates the objective of my amendment is the fact that information is not publicly available regarding the amount and or kind of civil forfeitures made to date . 
so this amendment will allow the full discussion by a sense of congress of what would be the right process to proceed , balancing the needs of the government , balancing the needs of the victims of terrorism , balancing the question of justice , and , yes , balancing the responsible actions under the patriot act , protecting us against terrorism but then , when we are victims of terrorism , to give us the opportunity for relief . 
i would hope my colleagues would support this amendment so we can carry this forward into conference and be able to provide the kind of leadership necessary for the throngs of victims , those who have already suffered , and we hope not , but for those who may suffer in the future . 
i would say that absent this public disclosure of this very substantial information ; that is ; about the assets , it is very difficult for compensation even to be requested . 
so i think that we will have an opportunity to address these concerns , balance the needs of the government in its need to protect certain information , and give relief to many americans . 
this proposal relates to the civil forfeiture provision of 18 u.s.c . 
981 and would add a section that would allow civil plaintiffs to attach judgments to collect compensory damages for which a terrorist organization has been adjudged liable and from the pool of assets that have been forfeited under section 981 . 
my amendment seeks to allow victims of terrorism who obtain civil judgment for damages caused in connection with the acts to attach foreign or domestic assets held by the united states government under 18 u.s.c . 
section 981 ( g ) calls for the forfeiture of all assets , foreign or domestic , of any individual , entity , or organization that has engaged in planning or perpetrating any act of domestic or international terrorism against the united states , citizens or residents of the united states . 
the legislation , h.r. 3199 , as drafted , fails to deal with the current limitation on the ability to enforce civil judgments by victims and family members of victims of terrorist offenses . 
there are several examples of how the current administration has sought to bar victims from satisfying judgments obtained against the government of iran , for example . 
in the sobero case , a u.s. national , guillermo sobero of riverside county , ca , was beheaded by abu sayyaf , an al-qaeda affiliate , leaving his children fatherless . 
the administration responded to this incident by sending 1 , 000 special forces officers to track down the perpetrators , and the eldest child of the victim was invited to the state of the union address . 
the family of the victim should have access to those funds , at the very least , at the president 's discretion . 
while a federal district court held iran to be liable , the u.s. government intervened and argued that the case should be dismissed because iran had not been designated a terrorist state at the time of the hostage incident and because of the algiers accords -- that led to the release of the hostages , which required the u.s. to bar the adjudication of suits arising from that incident . 
similarly , american servicemen who were harmed in a libyan sponsored bombing of the la belle disco in germany were obstructed from obtaining justice for the terrorist acts they suffered . 
while victims of the attack pursued settlement of their claims against the libyan government , the administration lifted sanctions against libya without requiring as a condition the determination of all claims of american victims of terrorism . 
as a result of this action , libya abandoned all talks with the claimants . 
furthermore , because libya was no longer considered a state sponsor of terrorism , the american servicemen and women and their families were left without recourse to obtain justice . 
in addition , a group of american prisoners who were tortured in iraq during the persian gulf war were barred from collecting their judgment from the iraqi government . 
although the 17 veterans won their case in the district court of the district of columbia , the administration argued that the iraqi assets should remain frozen in a u.s. bank account to aid in the reconstruction of iraq . 
claiming that the judgment should be overturned , the administration deemed that the reconstruction effort was more important than recompensing the suffering of fighter pilots who , during their 12 year imprisonment , suffered beatings , burns , and threats of dismemberment . 
while the judgment rendered was sound , the second circuit court of appeals affirmed the lower court 's finding that the iraqi assets , now transferred to the u.s. treasury , were protected by u.s. sovereign immunity and were unavailable for judicial attachment . 
one major problem that frustrates the objective of my amendment is the fact that information is not publicly available regarding the amount and/or kind of civil forfeitures made to date . 
the executive branch of our government has suggested that it has no duty to disclose either the identity of the parties who own civilly forfeited property or the amounts forfeited to date . 
absent public disclosure of this very substantive information , it is very difficult for compensation to even be requested -- let alone expected for victims of horrific acts of terrorism . 
right now , h.r. 3199 is the most appropriate and timely vehicle in which to address this issue and allow u.s. victims of terrorism to obtain justice from terrorist-supporting or terrorist-housing nations . 
in closing , mr. chairman , let me thank the chairman of the full committee and the ranking member and the ranking member of the subcommittee for their leadership on this whole entire issue of protecting americans against terrorism and including in that protection of their civil liberties . 
this amendment will not only protect americans against the dangers of life and limb and the loss of life , but give them relief in our courts . 
i ask my colleagues to support this amendment sponsored by myself and my colleague , the gentleman from texas ( mr. poe ) xz4006520 , a sense of congress amendment to provide relief to americans victimized by terrorism . 
mr. chairman , i yield back the balance of my time . 
mr. speaker , i thank the gentleman from the judiciary committee for the wisdom of this motion , and i applaud the joining by the chairman of the full committee and offer an explanation for the reason our colleagues should join us in supporting this motion to instruct , and frame it in the context of the crisis of the recent weeks , asking congress to accept its responsibility to investigate the cia leaks and now to investigate further the leaking of the cia sites , some call it sites of torture , incarceration , of individuals around the world who have been charged or are alleged to have committed acts of terrorism . 
it now brings the american people into the focus of being the priority of the actions of this congress . 
there were aspects of the patriot act that i did support . 
the 4-year sunset gives us that opportunity so that we can begin in 4 years to assess whether authorizing secret intelligence , going into libraries and getting a list of your library books helps or hurts the american people ; whether the authorizing of a blank wiretap helps or hurts the american people ; whether or not the lone wolf , where you can be one individual , not part of a terrorist organization or an association or to be part of a large massive group , but one individual who may be part of , words may have suggested that they are giving some comfort to those whose views we disagree with can be hauled in as a terrorist . 
many of us are familiar with the recent film that said `` good night and good luck. '' it reminded us of the days of the mccarthy era when no one seemed to want to rise to support the rights of the american people . 
i ask my colleagues to support this motion to instruct and sunset in 4 years so congress can have the ability to protect the rights of the american people . 
madam speaker , i join my many colleagues , many victims of terrorism , and many victims of racial and religious profiling in opposing this legislation , h.r. 3199 , for several reasons . 
first , we never have been given the facts necessary to fully evaluate the operation of the underlying bill , the usa patriot act . 
second , there are numerous provisions in both the expiring and other sections of the patriot act that have little to do with combating terrorism , intrude on our privacy and civil liberties , and have been subject to repeated abuse and misuse by the justice department . 
since 2002 , 389 communities and 7 states have passed resolutions opposing parts of the patriot act , representing over 62 million people . 
of particular concern to me are a number of immigration-related provisions that cast such a broad net to allow for the detention and deportation of people engaging in innocent associational activity and constitutionally protected speech and that permit the indefinite detention of immigrants and noncitizens who are not terrorists . 
among these troubling provisions are those that : authorize the attorney general , ag , to arrest and detain noncitizens based on mere suspicion , and require that they remain in detention `` irrespective of any relief they may be eligible for or granted. '' ( in order to grant someone relief from deportation , an immigration judge must find that the person is not a terrorist , a criminal , or someone who has engaged in fraud or misrepresentation . 
the laws punish those who `` endorse , '' `` espouse , '' or `` persuade others to support terrorist activity or terrorist organizations. '' rather than prohibiting speech that incites violence or criminal activity , these new grounds of inadmissibility punish speech that `` undermines the united states '' efforts to reduce or eliminate terrorist activity. '' this language is unconstitutionally vague and overbroad , and will undeniably have a chilling effect on constitutionally protected speech . 
authorize the ag and the secretary of state to designate domestic groups as terrorist organizations and block any noncitizen who belongs to them from entering the country . 
under this provision , the mere payment of membership dues is a deportable offense . 
these constitutionally dubious initiatives undermine our historical commitment to the fair treatment of every individual before the law and do not enhance our security . 
i cosponsored the civil liberties restoration act , clra , reintroduced from the 108th congress by representatives howard berman and william delahunt , that seeks to roll back some of these egregious post-9/11 policies and to strike an appropriate balance between security needs and liberty interests . 
the clra would secure due process protections and civil liberties for noncitizens in the u.s. , enhance the effectiveness of our nation 's enforcement activities , restore the confidence of immigrant communities in the fairness of our government , and facilitate our efforts at promoting human rights and democracy around the world . 
my `` safe havens '' amendment that relates to the civil forfeiture provision of 18 u.s.c . 
981 and would add a section that would allow civil plaintiffs to attach judgments to collect compensory damages for which a terrorist organization has been adjudged liable , fortunately , was included in the text of the conference report as section 127 : it is the sense of congress that under section 981 of title 18 , united states code , victims of terrorists attacks should have access to the assets forfeited . 
this language seeks to allow victims of terrorism who obtain civil judgment for damages caused in connection with the acts to attach foreign or domestic assets held by the united states government under 18 u.s.c . 
section 981 ( g ) calls for the forfeiture of all assets , foreign or domestic , of any individual , entity , or organization that has engaged in planning or perpetrating any act of domestic or international terrorism against the united states , citizens or residents of the united states . 
the legislation , h.r. 3199 , as drafted , fails to deal with the current limitation on the ability to enforce civil judgments by victims and family members of victims of terrorist offenses . 
there are several examples of how the current administration has sought to bar victims from satisfying judgments obtained against the government of iran , for example . 
the administration responded to this incident by sending 1 , 000 special forces officers to track down the perpetrators , and the eldest child of the victim was invited to the state of the union address . 
the family of the victim should have access to those funds , at the very least , at the president 's discretion . 
while a federal district court held iran to be liable , the u.s. government intervened and argued that the case should be dismissed because iran had not been designated a terrorist state at the time of the hostage incident and because of the algiers accords -- that led to the release of the hostages , which required the u.s. to bar the adjudication of suits arising from that incident . 
similarly , american servicemen who were harmed in a libyan sponsored bombing of the la belle disco in germany were obstructed from obtaining justice for the terrorist acts they suffered . 
while victims of the attack pursued settlement of their claims against the libyan government , the administration lifted sanctions against libya without requiring as a condition the determination of all claims of american victims of terrorism . 
as a result of this action , libya abandoned all talks with the claimants . 
furthermore , because libya was no longer considered a state sponsor of terrorism , the american service men and women and their families were left without recourse to obtain justice . 
in addition , a group of american prisoners who were tortured in iraq during the persian gulf war were barred from collecting their judgment from the iraqi government . 
although the 17 veterans won their case in the district court of the district of columbia , the administration argued that the iraqi assets should remain frozen in a u.s. bank account to aid in the reconstruction of iraq . 
claiming that the judgment should be overturned , the administration deems that rebuilding iraq is more important than recompensing the suffering of fighter pilots who , during their 12-year imprisonment , suffered beatings , bums , and threats of dismemberment . 
while the judgment was sound , the second circuit court of appeals affirmed the lower court 's finding that the iraqi assets , now transferred to the u.s. treasury , were protected by u.s. sovereign immunity and were unavailable for judicial attachment . 
while the patriot act may not deserve all of the ridicule that is heaped against it , there is little doubt that the legislation has been repeatedly and seriously misused by the justice department . 
consider the following : it 's been used more than 150 times to secretly search an individual 's home , with nearly 90 percent of those cases having had nothing to do with terrorism . 
it 's been used to deny , on account of his political beliefs , the admission to the united states of a swiss citizen and prominent muslim scholar to teach at notre dame university . 
because of gag restrictions , we will never know how many times its been used to obtain reading records from library and book stores , but we do know that libraries have been solicited by the department of justice -- voluntarily or under threat of the patriot act -- for reader information on more than 200 occasions since september 11 . 
even worse than the patriot act has been the unilateral abuse of power by the administration . 
since september 11 , our government has detained and verbally and physically abused thousands of immigrants without time limit , for unknown and unspecified reasons , and targeted tens of thousands of arab-americans for intensive interrogations and immigration screenings . 
all this serves to accomplish is to alienate muslim and arab-americans -- the key groups to fighting terrorism in our own county -- who see a justice department that has institutionalized racial and ethnic profiling , without the benefit of a single terrorism conviction . 
nor is it helpful when our government condones the torture of prisoners at home and abroad , authorizes the monitoring of mosques and religious sites without any indication of criminal activity , and detains scores of individuals as material witnesses because it does not have evidence to indict them . 
this makes our citizens less safe not more safe , and undermines our role as a beacon of democracy and freedom . 
right now , h.r. 3199 is the most appropriate and timely vehicle in which to address this issue and allow u.s. victims of terrorism to obtain justice from terrorist-supporting or terrorist-housing nations . 
madam speaker , i rise today to address the many troubling issues associated with the reauthorization of the patriot act . 
following the 9/11 terrorist attacks , this congress was faced with the difficult task of revamping our intelligence system . 
most of the provisions within the patriot act are positive measures that successfully protect american citizens . 
these include : permitting large-scale investigation of americans for `` intelligence purposes. '' having minimal judicial supervision on wiretaps . 
allowing the indefinite detention of non-deportable aliens , even if they are not terrorist suspects . 
the power to conduct secret searches without having to notify the target of the search . 
america was built on the notion of strong protection for our privacy and civil liberties . 
mr. speaker , i rise in support of this motion to instruct . 
our system of government is made up of checks and balances and this motion to instruct only expands these checks and balances . 
mr. speaker , reauthorizing the patriot act before it expires on december 31 is literally a matter of life or death because it is helping us to win the war on terrorism . 
passing the patriot act is purely a matter of common sense . 
now , some members of congress want to postpone this legislation or even filibuster it . 
in reality , a prosecutor seeking this information must go before a federal judge , get a court order and prove that it is a matter of international terrorism . 
mr. chairman , i rise in support of this amendment . 
combating terror finance is a nebulous , often difficult aspect of our fight against terrorism . 
that 's why i created with a number of my colleagues the bipartisan congressional anti-terrorist financing task force , to bring focus on the multitude of policies , agencies and jurisdictions which have a bearing on our effort to combat terror finance . 
like the task force , this amendment offered by my colleague from pennsylvania is representative of the continuing need for improvement . 
it sets out severe penalties for terror financiers and clarifies the authority of law enforcement to investigate and prosecute illicit financial transactions . 
importantly , this measure acknowledges the vulnerability of informal value transfer systems such as hawalas to terrorist finance and money laundering . 
madam speaker , from keeping our children safe to winning the war on terrorism , we face many challenges , but few are like meth , which threatens lives , safety and health , at great cost to all of us . 
it also contains a drug certification provision of mine that will stop the flood of meth from international superlabs . 
we must send a signal to the pushers of this poison that they are not welcome in our communities . 
madam speaker , this bipartisan legislation deserves the support of both bodies because it is a comprehensive response to the methamphetamine problem in america . 
it will send a strong signal that congress is serious about fighting the scourge of meth . 
while the criminal penalties in this bill would be more effective if they were as tough as what were originally introduced , chairmen sensenbrenner and souder showed tremendous leadership in moving this bill to the floor , and i urge the swift passage of this important legislation . 
additionally , this conference report reauthorizes the usa patriot act , which fulfills the high responsibility of protecting our citizens while ensuring their fundamental privacy rights are not abused . 
extending the provisions of the patriot act that are scheduled to expire on december 31 will allow law enforcement officers to monitor suspected terrorists ' communications and share critical intelligence information . 
these are vital tools for law enforcement that we need to help keep america safe , tools that carry with them strict safeguards to prevent the abuse of our civil liberties . 
these safeguards will ensure that the patriot act is used only for its intended purposes , catching terrorists before they can do us harm , and not to curtail the strong tradition of personal privacy that americans have long enjoyed . 
madam speaker , i urge all of my colleagues in both bodies to support this reauthorization of the patriot act , which contains important provisions in this nation 's fight against meth . 
there is evidence that profits from the illegal sales of tobacco products have been funneled to groups whose interests are inimical to the safety of our country and its people and the congress should do all we can to ensure that source of revenue is cut off . 
however , indian tribal governments that are legally involved in the retailing of tobacco products are clearly not the types of entities we are targeting with this provision . 
as initially drafted , the coble amendment would have had the unintended effect of targeting tribal governments who are legitimately involved in the retailing of tobacco products . 
with the great help of the gentlemen from oklahoma ( mr. cole ) i understand an amendment has been incorporated that will go a long way to protecting tribal governments and tribal sovereignty . 
i also understand , however , that we have not had much time to refine the entirety of the coble amendment and that further refinements need to be made . 
i want to emphasize at the outset that i share the concern of my house colleagues that it is essential to protect our nation and its citizens from terrorists seeking to harm our homeland and its citizens . 
i am alarmed about the scope of a number of provisions in the bill that are likely to lead to the abuse of personal freedoms enjoyed by americans . 
section 215 , seizure of records , causes me great concern . 
this provision allows the fbi , based on the premise of conducting a terror investigation , to obtain any record , after receiving approval from a secret foreign intelligence surveillance act , fisa , court . 
my concern is that law enforcement agencies can engage in such activity without meeting the standard legal threshold of `` probable cause '' , thereby leading to potential cases of abuse . 
i am also very concerned about the ability of law enforcement agencies to conduct `` roving john doe wiretaps '' . 
the problem with this provision is that 90 percent of the searches are used for drug and fraud cases and not for terrorism . 
i am concerned about the lack of oversight that could apply to these types of investigations . 
i recognize that some of the provisions of the patriot act have served a useful purpose and are scheduled to end . 
the process of reviewing provisions and determining whether to extend them allows the house to evaluate the effectiveness and appropriations of the provisions . 
two of the provisions in this bill are now being scheduled to extend for 10 years as opposed to the 4 years in the expiring legislation . 
fourteen sections of h.r. 3199 bill will become permanent , and will have virtually no oversight . 
i continue to have great reservations about the use of national security letters , nsls . 
the nsls deny individuals due process by barring targets of investigations access to court and the right to challenge the nsls . 
mr. chairman , i content that it is essential to protect the constitutional rights of american citizens as we engaged in the ongoing war on terrorism . 
i urge my colleagues to stand up for the bill of rights and resist the temptation to curtail those rights in our collective pursuits to develop legislation to counter the threats posed by terrorists . 
my review of h.r. 3199 causes my great concern that we are undermining the civil liberties of americans . 
mr. chairman , i sit here and listen to this debate , and i have been through a number of the 12-or-so hearings that we have had in the committee on the judiciary on the patriot act ; and i want to compliment this congress , this bipartisan congress , that met almost with a sense of urgency and almost a sense of emergency to write this patriot act just 3-plus years ago . 
and throughout all of those hearings , we needed to put security in place , we needed to be able to access information . 
one of the standards was , why can we not access information in an international terrorist investigation as we can in a criminal investigation ? 
there is not a name of an individual who had their rights violated by the patriot act . 
i hope we have a serious consideration of these amendments and final passage of a very good patriot act . 
mr. speaker , in response to my good friend from california who said there must be sacrifices and sacrifices have been made , i would remind members of the words of benjamin franklin who once said that those who would give up their essential liberties to achieve a measure of security deserve neither . 
the tragedy of 9/11 led to the patriot act , and then it led to a war against iraq . 
we have become a nation of leaders , some of whom who have condoned torture and illegal detentions . 
we need a different type of leadership so the american people could have been spared the effects of 9/11 . 
we are here today trying to appeal to people to let go of their fear and suspicion because an open , honest review of the fbi 's use of the patriot act would surely find many areas in need of reform . 
today we are set to pass a whole new round of democracy rollbacks . 
american citizens are losing more of their free speech rights and privacy rights . 
the authors of today 's bill inserted a very weak and loophole-ridden right to judicial review of government actions . 
the bill retains 4-year sunsets for only two of the 16 patriot act provisions and only one of two expiring provisions in the 2004 intelligence reform act . 
this bill continues to allow roving wiretaps that permit federal agents to tap communications of a target where neither the target nor the phone is identified . 
the bill continues to permit sneak-and-peak searches of a person 's home or business to remain secret indefinitely . 
it drops a senate provision supported by the chamber of commerce , conservatives , libraries , civil liberties organizations that set limits on secret court orders for library , medical , and other personal records . 
a recipient must challenge before a preselected group of three court judges and go to the expense of hiring a lawyer with a security clearance who the fisa court agrees can appear before it . 
so people have to essentially fight for their rights to be free of the scourge of wiretaps and to be free of the scourge of having the fbi reach into their library records , their reading records , their medical records . 
i rise in support of the flake-otter sneak-and-peek amendment to drop this provision . 
keeping america safe is not a partisan issue ; but , unfortunately , several provisions of h.r. 3199 are . 
this amendment addresses one of those changes by preventing the use of sneak-and-peek searches when the sole purpose of the delayed notification is to postpone a trial . 
however , providing these tools need not come at the expense of the liberties and freedoms that we hold so dear . 
i urge the senate to take a more bipartisan approach to the renewal of the usa patriot act , and i hope that they are more open to sunsets which require congress to review the act , extend what is working , and change what is not . 
while i do not advocate permitting many of these important terrorism-fighting tools to expire at the end of the year , the american people would be better served by a bill that strikes a more reasonable balance between protecting civil liberties and fighting the war on terrorism . 
since the usa patriot act was enacted shortly after 9/11 , i have met with many constituents and countless groups to discuss the details of this controversial legislation . 
while some agreed that the act was necessary to prevent another terrorist attack , most of the crowd , as well as most rhode islanders , believed we have already ceded too much ground with respect to our civil liberties . 
in my state , seven cities and towns have passed resolutions opposing parts of the usa patriot act , and my constituents understand what this bill means to them and their freedom . 
last week , the 9/11 commission released a report card on the implementation of the group 's recommendations . 
by making 14 of the 16 expiring provisions of the usa patriot act permanent , i worry that congress will be less likely to engage in vigorous oversight to protect the civil liberties of law abiding americans . 
their legislation made permanent the less controversial portions of the act , but implemented commonsense changes to add a layer of protection for liberties while keeping america safe . 
unfortunately , most of these improvements were not incorporated into the conference report . 
however , providing these tools need not come at the expense of the liberties and freedoms that we hold so dear . 
there are large gaps that still remain in critical areas that leave americans vulnerable to the threat of terrorism . 
for example : our greatest threat remains an attack by a weapon of mass destruction . 
of the 2 , 000 border patrol agents called for in the intelligence reform act , the republican majority has funded only 500 this year . 
funding for first responder programs , our front line defense against terrorists at home , has dropped 27 percent in the past three years , from a high of $ 3.3 billion in 2003 to $ 2.4 billion in 2006 -- funds which help our towns and cities hire , train and equip our police , firefighters and medical responders . 
this leaves our buses , trains , subways , highways and bridges dangerously vulnerable to the kind of attacks we saw in london . 
almost four years after 9/11 , only five percent of incoming cargo containers are inspected for hazardous materials . 
ninety-five percent of american trade comes through our 361 seaports every year , yet there is no dedicated funding steam for port security . 
however , most of the cargo loaded onto passenger and cargo airplanes still goes uninspected . 
protecting america is not a partisan issue , it is a matter of priorities . 
this version of the patriot act may be slightly improved over the last one , but let 's not take our eye off the ball . 
it is about the reauthorization of 16 highly controversial provisions of the original patriot act scheduled to expire at the end of the year . 
this sunset was critical to earn support for such sweeping legislation , when in the shadow of the september 11th terrorist attack , the administration pushed congress to quickly pass legislation that would provide vast new powers to law enforcement . 
the sunset provisions would ensure congress would be able to take a closer look how this authority was implemented and at its effectiveness of balancing security and liberty . 
i was hopeful that that an open amendment process would allow the house to address the many concerns of the members of this house and the american public have with the patriot act . 
in fact , most of the amendments they have allowed to be considered have very little to do with the provisions that are up for reauthorization . 
this means some of the most controversial provisions of the bill would become permanent , including section 213 , the `` sneak and peek '' provision that allows secret searches and seizures . 
only two of the most controversial provisions , such as section 215 , the `` library provision '' that allows access to library and bookstore records , the single most alarming part of this bill is that it would remove the protection of sunsets to most of the patriot act . 
oversight , review and debate are all the result of a healthy democracy . 
congressional oversight over one of the most fundamental challenges of our time would not hinder our society but enhance it . 
therefore , while protecting our homeland , americans should be mindful of threats to vital personal and civil liberties . 
mr. chairman , i rise in strong support of the waters ' amendment and in strong opposition to h.r. 3199 , the usa patriot and intelligence reform act of 2005 . 
the waters ' amendment protects the rights of those individuals who are mentally incompetent , under undue stress , at risk for bodily harm or losing their employment from being forced to disclose information . 
it makes fourteen of the most egregious components of the patriot act permanent . 
this bill damages fundamental freedoms : by invading medical privacy by allowing the fbi to search in any location showing minimal justification by allowing for sneak and peak , national security letters , and roving `` john doe '' wire tap provisions by forcing libraries to police their patrons ( an act that this body just voted to overturn i might add ) and by stripping congress of the right to review and amend these provisions . 
mr. chairman , all of us understand the need to balance civil liberties with national security . 
the waters amendment protects the rights of those who are the overlooked victims of national security letters -- upholding the constitution is patriotic , even in times of national security crises . 
when the congress approved the patriot act four years ago , we recognized that the serious nature of the threat required giving law enforcement broad new powers to help prevent it . 
i support most of the 166 provisions of the patriot act ; indeed , today 's debate has nothing to do with the vast majority of these provisions , which are already the permanent law of the land . 
the bill before the house today concerns only the 16 provisions of the patriot act subject to sunset -- the provisions that have the most serious potential impact on the fundamental liberties of innocent americans if they are abused . 
these 16 provisions involve the power of the government to enter and search people 's homes without notice , to tap people 's communications with roving wiretaps , and obtain people 's library and health records . 
because these provisions touch on the most basic liberties of citizens , we included sunsets so congress would the bill before the house takes away the sunset provisions for 14 of these sensitive provisions , and sets ineffectively long ten-year sunsets for the other two provisions . 
many of us voted for the patriot act four years ago with the assurances that there would be meaningful oversight by congress . 
for much of the past four years , the rigorous oversight we were promised simply did n't happen . 
the experience of the last four years shows that without sunsets , there is no oversight and no accountability . 
i had hoped that the serious shortcomings in this bill could be corrected on the floor today , but the majority has blocked a number of important amendments democrats sought to offer . 
i believe that many of these amendments would have been adopted had they been put to a vote . 
i understand that the senate judiciary committee has unanimously approved its own version of the patriot act today that contains many of the improvements that the house leadership denied us the opportunity to debate . 
i regret that the leadership of the house has not embraced a similar bipartisan process . 
i will vote for the motion to recommit the bill , which would correct the most serious shortfalls in the legislation ; in particular , the lack of sunsets of key provisions -- sunsets that were contained in the original patriot act . 
i will therefore oppose passage of this legislation today in the hope that the bipartisan senate judiciary committee 's version will prevail in the senate . 
when the congress approved the patriot act 4 years ago , we recognized that the serious nature of the threat required giving law enforcement broad new powers to help prevent it . 
indeed , nearly all of the 166 provisions of the patriot act are already the permanent law of the land . 
four years ago , the bush administration and the leadership of the house rushed the original patriot act through the house without full debate or the chance to make improvements to the bill . 
while the conference report makes a number of improvements to the measure the house approved last summer , further improvement is needed . 
just last week , the bipartisan members of the former 9/11 commission awarded congress and the bush administration a grade of f for our failure to distribute homeland security funds on the basis of risk . 
in a number of other areas , the senate-passed version of the bill included key safeguards that were removed from the conference report . 
in particular , the senate bill contained important protections relating to the business and library records provisions of the act that have been so controversial with our constituents . 
it would allow the government to compel the production of business or library records merely by showing that the records are `` relevant '' to a terrorism investigation . 
in addition , unlike the senate-passed bill , the conference report fails to protect the records of innocent americans collected by means of national security letters . 
these national security letters are issued without the approval of a judge and permanently bar recipients from telling anyone besides their lawyer that they have been served . 
unlike the senate-passed bill , the conference report does not provide for meaningful judicial review of the national security letter nondisclosure requirement . 
i will vote against passage of this legislation today because i am convinced that we can write a better bill that safeguards both our vital security interests and basic american liberties . 
to that end , i have cosponsored legislation that calls for a three-month extension of the current patriot act to give congress additional time to perfect this legislation . 
mr. chairman , after 9/11 , i worked on the drafting of the patriot act in the committee and in the weekend drafting session , and i voted for the act on the floor . 
i think it is important to know that most of what is in the patriot act is not actually before us today . 
i think it is worth noting that there are some things that disturb americans that are happening in the united states relative to the arrest of american citizens and the holding of american citizens without charge , without access to counsel ; but they have nothing whatsoever to do with the patriot act . 
for example , section 505 of the act grants law enforcement the authority to issue national security letters , which are essentially administrative subpoenas , for all sorts of personal records about anyone without judicial oversight . 
in addition , we enhanced this section in subsequent legislation to ensure that even more records could be subpoenaed from travel agencies , pawn brokers , casinos , car dealers and more ; but all of this is without oversight of a court . 
prior to the act , national security letters could only be used to get records when there was reason to believe that the subject of the record was an agent of a foreign power . 
not only did the patriot act remove the requirement that the subject of the record is a foreign power ; it lowered the standard by which those records could be obtained to the relevancy standard . 
we have not had meaningful oversight , in my opinion , on this provision of the act . 
assuming that law enforcement does need the ability to get some of these records , and i do not dispute that , we do need to have some standards in place . 
as has been mentioned by the gentleman from virginia ( mr. boucher ) xz4000430 , one court has already struck down this section of the act as violative of the constitution . 
we know from our inquiry to the justice department that this provision has been used hundreds of times . 
we got six pages back of redacted records , but we really do not know the full impact ; and we need to know more than we do today before we allow this sweeping tool to be renewed . 
i also want to mention section 215 of the act . 
before the patriot act , the government could obtain only limited records from hotels , storage facilities and car rental companies , and only if those documents pertained to an agent of a foreign power . 
now , the justice department has told us that they have never once used section 215 relative to libraries , and i have no reason to disbelieve them ; but the american library association reports that they have received 200 formal or informal requests for materials , presumably under some other section of the law , perhaps grand jury subpoenas , i do not know . 
the fact is that americans are aware of this issue , and i believe this is having a chilling effect on first amendment rights in terms of reading and speaking . 
so while i will support the amendment , it falls short of what is necessary . 
mr. chairman , i support this amendment although it does not make some of the changes recommended by mr. scott xz4003641 in committee about ascertainment and minimization that we believe are important . 
it would allow for the requirement of oversight , which i think is important . 
one of the things that i hope we will take a look at that has not been discussed is section 209 relative to obtaining electronic information with a subpoena . 
the reason why we need to look at it before 10 years from now is that as technology changes and all telephone communication becomes voice over internet protocol , theoretically every phone call would be subject to seizure by subpoena , which is not something i think any of us would agree we intend to do . 
we spent nearly $ 25 billion on air security and a couple of hundred million on rail . 
we are well aware of how deficient our efforts have been in this regard . 
that is the crux of this problem , not threatening suicide bombers with the death penalty . 
mr. chairman , many of us , when we think about terrorism , feel exactly the way the proponent of the amendment does , that we want to exert maximum force against the offender . 
i also want to say i am a member of the committee on the judiciary . 
if there was a hearing in the subcommittee that i am not a member of all well and good , but i think this amendment poses some new things that the full committee would benefit from going through . 
the reduced number of jurors that is being proposed , the procedural changes that are quite new , i think , deserve the attention of the full committees . 
and i think we would be better served to sort through that in a thorough way than to expose these elements of the patriot act to court challenge . 
as a member of the committee on homeland security , i am acutely aware , and we are on both sides of the aisle , i can tell you of the shortfallings that we have in our protection against terrorism . 
i understand what the intent is , and perhaps if this passes we can clarify this in a conference committee ; but i wonder about the liabilities of the banking industry that acts innocently to help immigrants transmit funds home . 
we talk sometimes about illegal immigration , and that is not anything that any of us approve of ; but it is not the same as terrorism , and it is also not the same as those immigrants . 
but i do want to raise that on behalf of the california banking industry that has really stepped up to avoid the fraud and crime that has occurred with remittances before they did . 
section 208 of the social security act apparently states it is illegal to use a false social security number for activities to obtain employment . 
and if so , if i deal with a bank , is the bank falling afoul of this terrorism statute ? 
mr. chairman , i yield back the balance of my time . 
although the gentleman from texas ( mr. paul ) xz4003110 and i do not always vote together , i think he speaks wisdom this evening on the need to move beyond the narrow confines of this act . 
we need to do a much better job of protecting america from terrorists by taking those steps we can . 
he is right to offer this sense of the congress amendment . 
we need to have more vigorous action in addition to the sense of the congress activity . 
all of us believe we ought to fight terrorism . 
many of us are concerned that we have failed to do the balance of privacy and the constitution in some parts of the 16 provisions that are before us this evening . 
as we know , most of the patriot act is actually not before the house of representatives this evening . 
it is only 16 provisions , and of those 16 provisions , there are concerns about a few of them . 
we are hopeful that , as this process moves forward , that the senate that has taken these issues of civil liberties more to heart on a bipartisan and i would add unanimous basis may in the end prevail so that those who are troubled by the failure to really deal with some of the constitutional issues will in the end be able to support a bill at least at the end of a conference process . 
mr. chairman , i yield back the balance of my time . 
mr. speaker , i would just note the most important thing in the patriot act is the sharing of information between law enforcement and intelligence . 
i am a member of the judiciary committee , a member of the homeland security committee . 
the department of justice has stonewalled congress on telling us how they are using these powers . 
i am a member of the conference committee . 
mr. speaker , i think it 's clear that the primary benefit of the usa patriot act we passed in 2001 has been the sharing of information between criminal investigators and intelligence officials it enabled . 
but this conference report on reauthorization of the usa patriot act fails in important ways . 
following the attacks of 9/11 , this congress passed the usa patriot act to give our law enforcement and intelligence agencies new powers to fight terrorism . 
congress has not done its job in providing the thorough review we need of the patriot act . 
i have repeatedly sought access from the department of justice to the national security letters or nsls it has issued under section 505 of the act , and underlying materials regarding its use of the material witness statute . 
this is vital information about doj 's actual use of patriot act powers , information which doj steadfastly refuses to provide . 
yet with this conference report congress blindly reauthorizes and makes permanent many of these same powers . 
in fact , through the cracks in doj 's veil of secrecy , we 've begun to find some information about the patriot act . 
these are tens of thousands of letters , never reviewed by a judge , demanding information on countless people , the vast majority of whom may be americans innocent of any terrorist activity . 
there are no requirements for law enforcement to `` minimize '' its collection of nsls ; that is , there 's no requirement for doj to segregate the vast amount of information collected on innocent americans unconnected to any terrorist activity . 
this bill also adopts too weak a standard for law enforcement to engage in business records searches under section 215 of the patriot act . 
the senate required that these searches actually be relevant to an ongoing terrorism investigation and related to the activities of an agent of a foreign power . 
but the conference report adopts a presumption of relevance that would essentially tie judges ' hands and force them to grant any requested searches . 
adoption of 4-year , rather than 7-year , sunsets on three provisions regarding business records searches , roving wiretaps , and so-called `` lone wolf '' terrorists acting as agents of foreign powers is positive . 
frankly , i would have liked to see 4-year sunsets applied to more provisions of the patriot act , such as the provisions regarding nsls . 
given how reluctant doj has been to share information with us , these sunsets really provide the main source of leverage congress has over the department of justice to obtain information we should be provided as an equal branch of government . 
this is vitally needed funding that local first responders need in the event of another terrorist attack or other disaster . 
this conference report drops all of these provisions passed by the house . 
instead of rushing this bill to conclusion , we should give ourselves the time we need to get the patriot act right . 
i , along with some of my colleagues , have introduced legislation that would allow us to reauthorize the existing patriot act authorities for another 3 months , to take the time we need to correct the many deficiencies still remaining in this conference report . 
i urge that , instead of voting for a bad bill in order to meet an arbitrary deadline , my colleagues join me in voting for more time to turn this into a better bill . 
mr. chairman , i yield back the balance of my time . 
this provision would have allocated precious homeland security resources on the basis of risk . 
under the original patriot act , zero percent of formula grants are distributed on the basis of risk . 
under the house proposal , at least 84 percent and up to 100 percent of funding would be risk-based , ensuring that we spend our resources to address the greatest threats our nation faces . 
this long overdue change has been approved by the house on three separate occasions , including in a stand-alone bill that passed by a vote of 409 to 10 in may . 
madam speaker , i thank the gentleman from the great city of worcester , massachusetts , for yielding . 
madam speaker , i rise in opposition to the conference report on h.r. 3199 , the so-called usa patriot act , because we have not taken meaningful steps to eliminate or correct the most egregious sections of this act . 
given that the power that today 's surveillance technology gives to government and given the broad powers that we have given to intelligence agencies under this act , the absence of post-execution judicial review in today 's conference report constitutes one of its most critical shortcomings . 
after all , it is the maximum transparency and active judicial review which is our ultimate weapon in combating both governmental abuse and overreaching by governments to restrict the individual freedoms of our citizens . 
for these reasons , i ask my colleagues to oppose the this version of the patriot act reauthorization . 
i am disappointed that this rule is preventing many of us from even offering amendments that are very important to any discussion of the patriot act . 
currently the board needs the permission of the attorney general to issue a subpoena . 
currently the board is in the executive office of the president . 
require that all 5 members of the board be confirmed by the senate . 
currently members will serve at the pleasure of the president . 
create the chairman as a full-time member of the board . 
restore the qualifications of board members that were originally included in the senate bill . 
in fact , the board that we have right now has never even met and we are still waiting on confirmation of the chair and the vice chair . 
the 9/11 commission got it exactly right when they wrote : we must find ways of reconciling security with liberty , since the success of one helps protects the other . 
my other amendments dealt with humanitarian relief that we owe the victims of the attacks of september 11 , 2001 . 
i could think of no better time than now , during reauthorization of the act that gave many temporary relief , to make this relief permanent . 
the maloney/peter king amendment , provides adjustment in immigration status to `` an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence '' and a stay of removal to the surviving spouses and children of individuals who died in the terrorist attacks of september 11 , 2001 . 
to receive this adjusted status , the individual must be either lawfully present or be deemed a beneficiary of the september 11th victims compensation fund . 
these families have already suffered once , suffering the loss of a loved-one in the attacks of 9/11 , we should not prolong their suffering . 
madam speaker , i rise in opposition to the conference report to h.r. 3199 , the usa patriot and terrorism prevention reauthorization act of 2005 . 
unfortunately , this bill does not do enough to protect the civil liberties of innocent americans . 
however , it should not be done at the expense of the basic rights guaranteed by the constitution , and that is what i fear we are doing today . 
like the version of this legislation i voted against in july , this conference report would make permanent 14 of 16 provisions included in the original patriot act passed in 2001 . 
many of these provisions should still have sunset clauses , and congress should not be abrogating its responsibilities to review how these laws are being implemented . 
while i applaud the efforts of the conferees to reduce the extension of two key provisions relating to roving wiretaps , which allows taps on multiple phones and computers of a suspect , and business and library records from 10 years to 4 years , this legislation is woefully inadequate . 
law enforcement should spend its time going after the terrorists , not using valuable resources reviewing the library records of innocent people . 
to make matters even worse , there are entirely new provisions in the conference report to expand the secret service 's ability to restrict free speech by creating `` exclusion zones. '' these provisions were included in neither the house nor the senate version of this bill . 
i would think that this expansion of the secret service 's authority at the very least deserves serious consideration by this body , and should not be slipped in at the last minute without any hearings or markups . 
my constituents have legitimate concerns about the lack of independent , judicial oversight over the provisions included in the patriot act . 
we all want terrorists to be apprehended before they commit horrific acts of violence against innocent people . 
but this new provision is just the most glaring example of the lack of diligence that this congress appears to have on protecting our rights . 
i am incredibly disappointed that throughout the entire debate on this legislation , the leadership of this house has refused even to discuss the topic of civil liberties , the very issue that makes this legislation so divisive . 
today , 3 days before the 1 year anniversary of the signing of the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act , the privacy and civil liberties board has yet to i urge my colleagues to vote against this conference report . 
as a member of the homeland security committee since its creation almost 3 years ago , i understand the importance of providing our nation 's counter-terror and law enforcement officers with the capabilities to act aggressively to detect and deter terrorist attacks . 
as co-chairman of the congressional privacy caucus , i remain concerned about government encroachments into the private lives of innocent americans , which can undermine the principles of liberty , freedom of association and protection from unjust searches and seizures that have been embedded in our constitution and culture . 
clearly , the interests of security and privacy must be balanced . 
the conference report fails to include essential privacy protections that had been included in the senate version of this legislation . 
specifically , the senate-passed bill contained key safeguards not included in the conference report regarding the patriot act 's use of so-called `` national security letters '' and `` business and library records '' . 
madam speaker , as you know , national security letters are , in effect , a form of secret administrative subpoena . 
unlike the senate-passed bill , however , the conference report does not provide meaningful judicial review of a national security letter 's gag order . 
under the conference report , the government can compel the production of business and library records merely upon the showing that the records are `` relevant '' to a terrorism investigation . 
the house-senate conference committee had an opportunity to adjust the patriot act 's expiring provisions to protect the rights and liberties of all americans more effectively . 
i believe that this bill sacrifices too much of our liberty . 
i know there is a lot of anguish in the house today about this bill . 
it takes the courage to say to the terrorists , you will not succeed in changing our way of life . 
mr. speaker , i hear all the time from all types of people that 9/11 has changed everything . 
i hope that those terrible attacks have not served to undermine our constitution , to weaken our respect for civil liberties , to chip away at the values that not only make this country unique but also make us a beacon of hope for the rest of the world . 
while the government should be provided with the necessary resources to protect the homeland , it should not be given a free pass to threaten and abuse the rights and liberties of our own citizens . 
safeguards are key , and congress in its vital function of oversight is one of government 's most important safeguards . 
many of the provisions in the patriot act were sunsetted back in 2001 so that congress could evaluate and fix them if necessary . 
we know from our own history that abuses of law enforcement powers are all too common . 
some of the powers granted to the executive branch in this bill are simply too broad : secret surveillance of library and bookstore records ; roving wiretaps ; sneak-and-peek searches ; and overly broad subpoena power . 
however , i realize there is little chance of removing the majority of these dangerous provisions from this bill . 
at the very least , i urge my colleagues to fulfill their responsibilities and vote to sunset all of these provisions again for a short period of time . 
how can we make these provisions permanent when the department of justice , fbi , and other government agencies will not report to congress or the american people how these provisions are being implemented ? 
we need a bill that achieves the appropriate balance between liberty and security , a bill that combats terrorism vigilantly , but that is also consistent with the rights and liberties provided in the constitution of the united states . 
i fear that if this bill becomes law , a part of our tree of liberty will die . 
the original intent of the patriot act was to provide our law enforcement officials with the necessary tools to make our country more secure . 
while maintaining national security is absolutely a necessary responsibility of congress , it can and must be achieved without compromising our civil liberties . 
unlike the proponents of h.r. 3199 , the american people do not believe that security and liberty are mutually exclusive goals . 
mr. speaker , back in 2001 , when the patriot act was enacted , 16 provisions were sunsetted or authorized for a certain period of time because of their controversial nature and also due to the hurried manner in which they were drafted ; 14 of these 16 provisions are made permanent by this conference report . 
and while three of the most contentious provisions have been sunsetted for 4 years , even that is too long . 
section 206 , dubbed the roving wiretaps provision , grants the government the power to perform so-called john doe wiretaps in which they do not have to disclose the phones that will be tapped or even the names of the suspected person . 
section 6001 , known as the lone wolf provision , broadly redefines the foreign intelligence surveillance act 's , fisa , standard for the agent of foreign power . 
sunsets alone do not fix the severe substantive flaws of these sections , and they do nothing to address the deficiencies of the 14 other provisions that are being made permanent by this report . 
instead of opting to apply shorter sunset dates to these misguided provisions , congress should be exploring appropriate ways to fix them . 
after all , giving the government the power to violate civil liberties is wrong regardless of whether we give the government that power for 1 year or 4 years or for 100 years . 
most notable of the deficient provisions , which was made permanent by the original patriot act , is section 505 , known as the national security letters provision , nsls . 
these nsls are administrative subpoenas , issued by high-ranking department of justice officials , which force a person to turn over a wide range of personal records . 
essentially , nsls allow the fbi to conduct secret , warrantless searches of any records they deem relevant to national security . 
what is most concerning about nsls are the rate in which they are being issued and the eventual relevancy of the retrieved records . 
more than 30 , 000 nsls are being issued a year , a hundred-fold increase since the enactment of the patriot act . 
meanwhile , only a handful of nsl investigations have ever gone through the judicial process . 
moreover , the fbi has surreptitiously gathered information on tens of thousands of americans . 
and instead of deleting information on nsl recipients once an investigation is completed , the fbi is abusing this power and holding onto personal information of americans who have never been accused of any crime . 
mr. speaker , while this conference report does require the department of justice to report the number of national security letters they issue , it fails to address the abuse of power and the unconstitutionality of the provision . 
so instead of reevaluating this provision or at the very least sunsetting it , the nsl provision remains permanent and continues to infringe upon the civil liberties of the american people . 
shorter sunsets and minimal regulations imposed on the department of justice do not cure the serious problems with these provisions . 
that is why , mr. speaker , i am a cosponsor of h.r. 4506 . 
this legislation , introduced by the ranking member of the judiciary committee , mr. conyers , extends by 3 months the 16 provisions of the patriot act set to expire at the end of this year . 
extending the patriot act in its current form for 3 months would give lawmakers the opportunity to reevaluate these contentious provisions , fix them , and then issue a conference report that actually protects the civil liberties of the people of this country and not hinders them . 
i would like to share a quote from an article entitled `` going down in history with usa patriot act , '' which appeared in the november 27 edition of the massachusetts republican : `` unless lawmakers are prepared to revise the usa patriot act to include modest protections to safeguard civil liberties , they will go down in history as the authors of remarkably bad legislation. '' mr. speaker , when we in congress authorize federal agencies , it is our responsibility to grant them with an appropriate level of power so that abuse will not occur . 
we are all , every single member of this house is committed to protecting our country from terrorism . 
but we must not undercut or undermine the protection of our civil liberties . 
in our recent history , we have seen abuse of power . 
we have seen civil rights leaders in this country , people who have advocated equal treatment under the law for all of our citizens , we have seen these people put under surveillance . 
that is my fear today , that we are going too far , that we are paving the way for abuse , and that if we enact this bill as written , a little bit of the liberty tree will die . 
mr. speaker , i reserve the balance of my time . 
madam speaker , may i inquire of the gentleman from georgia how many more speakers he has ? 
i understand the urge of some to embrace this legislation ; but let me remind you that every time you chip away at our civil liberties , you give the terrorists a victory . 
madam speaker , i yield back the balance of my time . 
democrats and republicans agreed on the need to update the tools necessary for law enforcement to address the threat of terrorism on american soil . 
what started as an effort to protect our country from terror has become a virtually uncontrolled vehicle for government to invade the privacy of every american . 
it is evident to me and to many americans that the patriot act is inadequate in its protection of civil liberties . 
section 206 's blanket , roving wiretaps , section 213 's sneak-and-peek searches , and section 215 's expansive power allowing the government to obtain any piece of information on any american are just three examples of how the patriot act is out of control . 
democrats on the committee offered dozens of amendments in an attempt to control this bill and bring balance to it . 
virtually every single one of these amendments was rejected on a party-line vote . 
most troubling was the extension of sunsetted provisions that should have been allowed to expire or at least require reauthorization in the next 4 years . 
to preserve our commitment to making the best and most up-to-date assessment of our law enforcement and intelligence policies , we should include more , not fewer , sunsets and make them shorter , not longer . 
today we are asking not to hinder the pursuit of terrorists , but to return some sanity and balance to the law . 
mr. chairman , i rise today in very strong support of the renewal of the usa patriot act . 
these changes that were enacted in response to the horrific terrorist attacks on our nation of september 11 , 2001 provided critical tools to our law enforcement in bringing the terrorists to justice and to stopping future attacks , and the result of this law can not be disputed . 
worldwide we have captured or killed nearly two-thirds of the al qaeda 's top leadership . 
we have broken up terrorist cells in buffalo , in seattle , in portland , northern virginia and in detroit , my home state of michigan . 
these tools have been critical in gathering knowledge on the activities and the targets of the terrorists . 
however , i have never heard from one man or woman in my district who has said that their constitutional rights have been violated by any aspect of the patriot act . 
and while i care deeply about protecting the civil rights of law abiding americans , i do not care one iota about the civil rights of terrorists bent on destroying our way of life . 
just yesterday over 300 members of this house voted for an amendment that supported the capture and the detention and the interrogation of international terrorists . 
mr. chairman , today we face a new type of enemy , an enemy who preys on the innocent , an enemy who lives in the shadows , an enemy whose tactics are the tactics of cowards . 
and as we saw in london on july 11 and as we are seeing again today , the terrorists are still out there targeting the murder of the innocent . 
and in fact i will predict that other countries will follow the lead of america and what we are doing on the floor of this house today as they enact similar protections for their citizens against these murderers . 
mr. chairman , the devastation of 9/11 shook our collective consciousness to the core ; but it should not have shattered the foundation that defines who we are as a people and serves as a beacon of individual rights and liberties throughout the world . 
our nation has been able to overcome the challenges of the past by proving to ourselves and to the world around us that our rights and our values are the indispensable conditions of being an american . 
if we allow the threat of fear and terror to undermine our civil liberties , we will have failed not only the founding fathers who bestowed upon us the philosophical foundations of this great nation , but more importantly , we will have failed the future of america as the last great hope of mankind . 
mr. chairman , an unforeseen consequence of these infringements on american citizens ' civil liberties is the erosion of our standing as the international leader of the rights of people . 
with each fundamental mistreatment of our own citizenry , we broadcast an image around the world that will , in fact , come back to haunt us . 
we will become what we deplore : a hypocritical pseudo-democracy of freedoms granted from the government down instead of from the people up . 
mr. chairman , do not rewrite our precious bill of rights . 
mr. chairman , war has been declared on this country by the islamic terrorists , and we must protect the citizens of this country . 
but before commenting on the specifics of the patriot act , i would be derelict if i did not mention that the majority party in this house and the bush administration have really been derelict by not dealing more directly with the threats that we face . 
the biggest threats we face are sabotage , bombings in our mass transit systems , sabotage of our chemical farms , our nuclear plants that could kill thousands of people , yet we do not see funds to deal with this . 
the patriot act was an attempt to do several things , some of which were very necessary . 
breaking down the wall between intelligence and police information was very necessary and was in the patriot act and is not before us today because most of the patriot act is not before us today . 
most of the patriot act is permanentized . 
but when we are expanding police powers and when we are expanding surveillance powers , the power of government to pry into the private affairs , the books , the records , the medical histories of individual citizens , sometimes it may be necessary for security to do so . 
we should always be nervous about expanding police and surveillance powers , and that is one of the greatest weaknesses of this bill . 
we were only able to pass the patriot act 4 years ago because most , not all but most of the sections of the patriot act that expanded the powers of the police to pry into the privacy of ordinary americans , to go into their home , into their papers , into their internet records , their telephone records , their bank records , were sunsetted . 
what is the point of sunsetting ? 
because of the sunset . 
we must have that oversight and we should have had all of these things sunsetted , continued another 4 years , another 4 years . 
the powers granted in section 215 of the patriot act , which is hardly modified by this bill , to look into anybody 's library and medical records in secret and not tell anybody that they have done so , not tell the person whose records are pried into is a very disturbing invasion of liberty , and amendments to limit it were not made in order . 
section 505 of the bill , which enables any fbi agent , any fbi field office director , to issue a national security letter to let them go and see their internet records , their phone records , and so forth without even going to a judge and telling them it is relevant to a national security investigation is wrong , and it was declared unconstitutional by a federal court . 
mr. chairman , i ask unanimous consent to claim the time in opposition to the amendment , though i am in support of the amendment . 
mr. chairman , section 505 is one of the most , perhaps the most egregious provision of the patriot act , and it provides essentially , as was said before , that any director of an fbi field office can issue a national security letter directing the production of financial , telephone , internet and other records , period , without a court order , without any judicial approval , and there is no provision for going to courts to oppose that . 
furthermore , they are prevented by the gag order provision of section 505 from ever telling the person whose privacy is affected or anyone else about this . 
one , you can not issue this kind of what amounts to an intrusive search warrant without any judicial approval or provision for getting judicial approval . 
that is a violation of the fourth amendment . 
it allows the recipient of a national security letter to ask that the gag order be set aside , and it sets limits on the gag order and says it has to be renewed after a certain time period and you have to apply to a court to extend it . 
it fails , in my opinion , in that second provision to reach constitutional status by saying that the showing the government has to make to get an extension of the gag order , the affidavit by the government officer asking for the extension , shall be treated as conclusive unless the court finds that certification was made in bad faith . 
so that is not really up to the judgment of the judge , and i do not think that would satisfy the court on the first amendment . 
but it goes a long way , as i said , toward making this less egregious a violation of civil liberties and towards making it more constitutional . 
because section 505 , like some of the other sections we have talked about , is a great expansion of surveillance and police powers , and it may be a necessary one , although i do not agree with that , but even if it is necessary we should be nervous about the expansion of surveillance and police powers and we should revisit that and force congress to revisit it through using a sunset every so often . 
mr. chairman , i reserve the balance of my time . 
madam speaker , i rise in support of the motion to instruct . 
this bill makes permanent the most dangerous and intrusive provisions of the patriot act , 14 of the 16 previously sunsetted provisions . 
these provisions are particularly worrisome because they expand the powers of the police to pry into the privacy of ordinary americans , to go into their homes , into their papers , into their internet records , their telephone records , their medical records , their bank records . 
the breadth of these provisions providing for roving wiretaps , for sneak-and-peek searches , for invading library privacy and section 505 , expanding the use of national security letters invites abuse . 
these tens of thousands of invasive government demands for sensitive and private information which never even go before a judge have resulted in the collection of probably hundreds of millions of personal facts regarding innocent americans , innocent american residents , citizens , and businesses . 
sunsets have been the major check , albeit probably inadequate checks , on abuse of the patriot act . 
they mean that at least every 4 years congress is required to look at the law again , to revisit it , and has the opportunity to ask tough questions on the use or abuse of these powers , and most important , the administration can not stonewall these questions except for every 4 years . 
i call on all my colleagues , democrats and republicans , liberals and conservatives , to begin to safeguard the national security , not adequately , but to begin to safeguard the civil liberties of all americans by voting for this very , very skimpy motion to instruct . 
we are searching 2 percent of the 6 million shipping containers that come into our country 's ports every year , any one of which may contain a weapon of mass destruction ; but to search them would cost money . 
we are not doing much about what the 9/11 commission said was one of the most important things we should do , providing for intercommunicability between the first responders so police can talk to the fire and military . 
we are violating the civil liberties of our people and making them think that we are protecting ourselves . 
madam speaker , this country has a great heritage of liberty . 
it also has an unfortunate history of violating that liberty whenever we get into a war , from the alien and sedition act of 1798 to the espionage act of 1971 , the palmer raids of 1919 , the japanese american internment act of world war ii , the fbi 's egregious cointelpro program against opponents of the vietnam war . 
and now in this war , this administration has resorted to torture , to indefinite detention without trial , to evasions of the great writ of habeas corpus , to going back in some respects to before magna carta . 
let me focus on two of them . 
section 215 , the so-called libraries provision , allows the government to get orders from a fisa court to search any records of any business of a library regarding a third party who never knows about the search . 
it does not require a showing of a particularized suspicion of the target as the fourth amendment would seem to require . 
it simply says that the government has to come up with a statement of fact showing there are reasonable grounds to believe the tangible things sought are relevant to an authorized investigation . 
moreover , it says that the government 's statements that the information sought is necessary to protect against international terrorism or clandestine intelligence activities are presumptively relevant if the person they pertain to may be an individual in contact with a subject or agent of a foreign power . 
this is like the writ of assistance the british granted in 1761 which this is very similar to . 
to pass this bill with no sunset of section 505 , with no procedural safeguards on these very intrusive provisions is to disregard our entire history of ordered liberty . 
i very much urge defeat of this bill so we can do it properly after further consideration . 
if you do not pass the bill as is today , if it expires , there will be blood on your hands , because he and his side of the aisle will not allow a 3-month extension . 
well , if there is fault , if there is real danger by not extending the patriot act , it is on that side of the aisle by refusing a 3-month extension so that we can get it right . 
this country should not be subjected to that kind of blackmail . 
that is not respectful of the constitution . 
it is not respectful of the people of this country . 
it is not respectful of the members of this house . 
madam speaker , the crippling reach of methamphetamine abuse has become the nation 's leading drug problem today , and this is according to a survey by 500 sheriffs departments in 45 states . 
so it is currently replacing cocaine and heroin in many parts of the country . 
in many parts of the country , almost 40 to 50 percent of the jail population is due to methamphetamine abuse . 
right now 60 to 85 percent of the meth in the united states is coming from superlabs in mexico , and this is really hard to trace . 
h.r. 3199 includes language the house passed earlier as part of the foreign operations authorization bill . 
it identifies and publicizes the five countries which have the highest rate of diversion of pseudoephedrine to manufacturers of meth . 
the department of state could then use its existing authority to reduce or eliminate u.s. foreign aid to those countries which are most contributing to the meth problem . 
it gets to the source of the problem . 
i want to thank chairman sensenbrenner and particularly chairman souder for their hard work on this bill , and i urge support of the underlying legislation . 
this is a very difficult time for me because i have been a republican all my life , and one of the things that i have fought for more than anything else is fairness . 
the interesting thing that was brought up earlier in the debate , as i watched it from my office on this rule , was that the very thing that the patriot act is supposed to give to this country , that the proponents of it say gives to this country , is being denied on this floor today , and it is being denied because i think people are afraid to be exposed to the truth . 
let us not prove to ourselves because of temporary panic or momentary discouragement or in a fit of enthusiasm for an individual , we are suddenly unworthy of our founding fathers ' efforts in order to provide liberty to the folks first , not from the government , but from our birthright . 
so i am embarrassed to be on this side of the aisle from this aspect today . 
certainly , i know that there are well-intended people on both sides , and i tried to work out a lot of things on both sides of this aisle on the patriot act . 
but i can tell my colleagues that with this rule and the lack of full and complete discussion , we have put a gag rule , the same gag rule that the fbi and the cia and the nsa or any other government agent can put on the folks at the library or down at your local business and say , i want all of those records , but you are not allowed to use them . 
but there are a couple of thoughts that i would like to add to the discussion that have already been provided . 
mr. chairman , i thank my colleague , the gentleman from arizona ( mr. flake ) xz4001340 , who is cochair of the patriot act caucus with myself . 
mr. chairman , i rise in support of this amendment , and i appreciate the opportunity to discuss this issue today as we engage in one of the most important debates that we will have during the 109th congress -- that is , how to ensure that neither our national security nor the individual liberties guaranteed by our constitution are sacrificed to the threat of terrorism . 
the amendment we are offering today narrows the scope of so-called `` sneak-and-peek '' delayed notification search warrants and reins in the far-reaching power that we hastily gave the federal government in the frightening and chaotic days following the 9/11 attacks . 
we have often heard that `` sneak and peek '' warrants were used before the passage of the usa patriot act , and i recognize that the courts have upheld their use in limited and extraordinary circumstances . 
our amendment today is an important step toward reinstituting those precious checks and balances that make this a valuable tool for protecting security instead of a threat to the liberties that are given by our creator , recognized by the framers and embodied in our constitution . 
one of my basic concerns with the way that sneak-and-peek was crafted under the patriot act is the extraordinarily broad list of situations in which the power can be used . 
section 213 of this act lists circumstances , including threat to life and destruction of evidence , in which notification of the execution of a search warrant may be delayed . 
however , the last provision of this list is so vague , so broad , and so all-encompassing that it essentially expands the use of this tool to any investigation in which it would be easier for law enforcement to deny suspects the constitutional right of notification . 
our amendment today takes one of the first steps toward rectifying this serious flaw in the original patriot act language by eliminating part of this `` catch-all '' provision . 
armed with this knowledge , we will be better able to conduct proper oversight to ensure that this tool is used to protect personal freedoms while it advances the cause of preventing and prosecuting terrorism . 
this idea of individual rights -- that each person is created uniquely and with certain inalienable rights that government can not take away -- is the most basic expression of who we are as a nation and a people . 
while i confess that i would have liked to see stronger language protecting our fourth amendment rights included as part of this bill , i am pleased that with this amendment we have the opportunity to reinstate some of the constitutional safeguards that were compromised during passage of the patriot act . 
such a move would strengthen rather than weaken our ability to fight against those who wish to destroy the essence of what it means to be an american . 
madam speaker , i rise in support of the motion to instruct . 
as a result of the opportunity to debate , deliberate , and discuss , we made important changes to the original usa patrlot act in h.r. 3199 , changes that enable law enforcement to continue to investigate and prosecute crime while protecting civil liberties . 
this sunset served us well , and so i am perplexed that in the same bill where we made vital revisions to the usa patrlot act we also eliminated many of the sunsets and extended others for a decade or more . 
i am glad that , in respect to sections 206 and 215 of the usa patrlot act , the senate did not act as rashly as we did . 
i strongly urge conferees to see the wisdom of four-year sunsets for these sections , as passed by the senate , and i ask my colleagues to join me in supporting this motion to instruct . 
we watched television in horror as the world trade center collapsed , and then were rushed out of the u.s. capitol when flight 77 crashed into the pentagon . 
president bush immediately challenged us to provide u.s. citizens with protections against the new threat of worldwide terrorism , and within weeks we responded with the usa patriot act . 
as chairman of the house financial services committee , i was proud to help author the antiterrorist financing provisions in the act . 
my committee has held numerous oversight hearings on the implementation of the provisions since then . 
the u.s. has broken up suspected terrorist financing networks , including one in my home state of ohio . 
our terrorist financing tools were further augmented by the intelligence reform act approved in the wake of the 9/11 commission report . 
as a former fbi agent , i have found other parts of the patriot act just as vital in the defense of our freedoms . 
as we have been reminded by the two rounds of bombings in london , the reality of terrorism remains very much with us . 
to that end , today we are working to make permanent 14 of the 16 expiring provisions of the patriot act . 
i would note that one of the two provisions being extended for only ten years rather than permanently concerns the use of `` roving wiretaps. '' as one of the only members of congress who has conducted undercover surveillance , i can tell you now that the need for this authority will not go away . 
tying intercept authority to an individual rather than a particular communication device is simply common sense in this era of throwaway cell phones and e-mail . 
i support the reauthorization of the patriot act and hope that we can continue to work on remaining issues -- including making the roving wiretap provision permanent . 
i am particularly concerned about the burdens the amendment would place on two law enforcement entities within the jurisdiction of committee on financial services . 
under this amendment , both the office of foreign assets control ( ofac ) and the financial crimes enforcement network ( fincen ) , which are components of the treasury department that are on the front lines of our country 's efforts to detect and combat terrorist financing , would be required to divert already scarce resources away from law enforcement in order to comply with the amendment 's overly broad and unrealistic reporting requirements . 
instead of monitoring suspicious financial activity and following money trails that can lead investigators to terrorist plots the committee i chair has extensive experience in the financial services area with regimes that permit individuals to `` opt out '' of information sharing arrangements . 
such regimes require careful balancing of personal privacy and law enforcement and national security priorities and can not be drafted on the fly without extensive consultation with all interested parties . 
this amendment , in my judgment , falls far short of the mark . 
within weeks after the horrendous terrorist attacks of 2001 , congress responded with the patriot act , providing our law enforcement and intelligence communities with much-needed tools to track down terrorists , sever their communications and funding networks , and prevent future attacks on our citizens . 
as chairman of the house financial services committee , i was proud to help write the antiterrorist financing provisions of this act . 
millions of dollars in terrorist assets have been frozen or seized since 9/11 . 
we have broken up suspected terrorist financing networks , including one in my home state of ohio . 
the terrorist financing tools included in the act were further supplemented by the intelligence reform legislation approved in the wake of the 9/11 commission 's report . 
as a former special agent of the fbi , i know that other sections of the patriot act have proven just as vital in assisting law enforcement combat the new threat of international terrorism . 
i am pleased that this reauthorization makes permanent all but a few of the act 's expiring provisions , but regret that the 4-year sunset for the remaining authorities was made a part of this final product . 
one of the provisions still subject to a sunset deals with the use of roving wiretaps . 
as one of the few members of congress who has conducted undercover surveillance , i can tell you now that the need for roving wiretap authority will not expire in 7 years . 
tying intercept authority to an individual suspect rather than a particular communication device is simply common sense in this era of throwaway cell phones and e-mail . 
further , there is absolutely no evidence that wiretap authority or any other usa patriot act provision has been used to violate the civil liberties of americans . 
i support the reauthorization of the usa patriot act , and hope that congress will work toward making the roving wiretap and other temporary provisions permanent . 
`` it is the sense of congress that the federal government should not investigate any american citizen for alleged criminal conduct solely on the basis of citizen 's membership in a nonviolent political organization or the fact that the citizen was engaging in other lawful political activity. '' it seems like this should go without saying . 
in the 1960s we remember that there was wiretapping of martin luther king and other political organizations . 
in the 1970s we know about the illegal wiretapping and other activities associated with watergate , and also in the 1990s we are aware of irs audits of a political and religious organization based only on the fact that they were religious and political . 
so this is a restatement of a fundamental principle that should be in our minds and in our law , but i think it is worthwhile to restate . 
and i do recognize that in the patriot act they recognize that the first amendment should be protected , and in this case i think it is an additional statement that we should be respectful of people 's rights to speak out and not be singled out for political or religious viewpoints . 
mr. chairman , i reserve the balance of my time . 
there have been reports in the paper of different times when the fbi has actually intimidated some people at national conventions . 
we are aware of the fact that there are at least reports that federal officials have encouraged local police to actually monitor certain political groups , and we also are aware of the fact that , because of political activity , they have been placed on no-fly lists . 
at the same time we do want to have enforcement of the law . 
but very briefly , i would like to say that the full thrust of this bill bothers me in the fact that i think we are treating a symptom and we are really not doing dealing with the core problem of why there are suicide terrorists willing to attack us , and i think as long as that is ignored we could pass 10 patriot acts stronger than ever and it will not solve the problem unless we eventually get to the bottom of what is the cause . 
there is no evidence whatsoever to show that that is the motivation of terrorist attacks . 
and we are driven to want to protect our people , which i understand it is well motivated , but it will not solve the problem unless we eventually address that subject of why does it happen . 
and , ironically , in many ways we are making ourselves less free with some of the provisions in this bill . 
so i would suggest that ultimately we will have to have another solution because this will not solve all of our problems . 
mr. chairman , the usa patriot act and terrorism prevention act ( h.r. 3199 ) in no way brings the patriot act into compliance with the constitution or allays concerns that the powers granted to the government in the act will be used to abuse the rights of the people . 
much of the discussion surrounding this bill has revolved around the failure of the bill to extend the sunset clauses . 
even if the claims of h.r. 3199 's supporters that there have been no abuses of patriot act powers under this administration are true , that does not mean that future administrations will not abuse these powers . 
h.r. 3199 continues to violate the constitution by allowing searches and seizures of american citizens and their property without a warrant issued by an independent court upon a finding of probable cause . 
the drafters of the bill of rights considered this essential protection against an overreaching government . 
for example , section 215 of the patriot act , popularly known as the libraries provision , allows foreign intelligence surveillance courts , whose standards hardly meet the constitutional requirements of the fourth amendment , to issue warrants for individual records , including medical and library records . 
h.r. 3199 does reform this provision by clarifying that it can be used to acquire the records of an american citizen only during terrorist investigations . 
however , this marginal change fails to bring the section up to the constitutional standard of probable cause . 
requiring a showing of probable cause before a warrant may be issued will in no way hamper terrorist investigations . 
for one thing , federal authorities would still have numerous tools available to investigate and monitor the activities of non-citizens suspected of terrorism . 
second , restoring the fourth amendment protections would in no way interfere with the provisions of the patriot act that removed the firewalls that prevented the government 's law enforcement and intelligence agencies from sharing information . 
preparations can be made for the issuance of a warrant in the event of an emergency and allowances can be made for cases where law enforcement does not have time to obtain a warrant . 
in fact , a requirement that law enforcement demonstrate probable cause may help law enforcement focus their efforts on true threats , thus avoiding the problem of information overload that is handicapping the government 's efforts to identify sources of terrorists ' financing . 
the requirement that law enforcement demonstrate probable cause before a judge preserves the founders ' system of checks and balances that protects against one branch gathering too much power . 
the founders recognized that one of the chief dangers to liberty was the concentration of power in a few hands , which is why they carefully divided power among the three branches . 
i would remind those of my colleagues who will claim that we must set aside the constitutional requirements during war that the founders were especially concerned about the consolidation of power during times of war and national emergencies . 
however , it still leaves in place large chunks of legislation that threaten individual liberty by giving law enforcement power to snoop into american citizens ' lives without adequate oversight . 
mr. chairman , i yield back the balance of my time . 
mr. chairman , i thank the gentlewoman for yielding me this time , and i salute her for her extraordinary leadership on issues relating to the national security of our country , her excellent leadership as the ranking member on the permanent select committee on intelligence , and her important comments today . 
i also salute the gentleman from michigan ( mr. conyers ) xz4000800 and commend him for being such a guardian of our constitution . 
mr. chairman , we take an oath of office to protect and defend the constitution . 
i join them and each and every one of our colleagues in expressing our admiration for the people of great britain for their strength and their courage . 
mr. chairman , as we close debate on this important bill , i want to thank again the gentleman from michigan ( mr. conyers ) xz4000800 , the gentlewoman from california ( ms. harman ) xz4001660 , and so many other colleagues on both sides of the aisle for their thoughtful consideration of this very important matter . 
i am very impressed by the comments of the gentleman from virginia ( mr. boucher ) xz4000430 , who has contributed enormously to this debate . 
and we can not , because of any negligence in terms of protecting the american people in terms of homeland security , take it out on their civil liberties . 
the war was fought on our shores and continued into the war of 1812 here . 
today we are considering the extension of certain provisions of the usa patriot act . 
i want to add my voice to those who have made it clear to this body that the patriot act is the law of the land . 
ninety percent of it is in the law . 
about 10 percent of it , 16 provisions , are what we are considering today . 
i supported the bill because of these sunset provisions and because of the rigorous oversight that was promised . 
and today there is an attempt on the part of the republicans to eliminate the sunset of 14 of the 16 provisions and on the two remaining provisions to have a sunset of 10 years . 
that is a very , very long day when you are curtailing the liberties of the american people . 
and for this reason , i will join the gentleman from virginia ( mr. boucher ) xz4000430 in opposing this legislation but with the hope that it will be improved in conference and then , when it comes back to this body , that we will be able to all support a patriot act extension that protects the american people , gives law enforcement the tools they need without seriously curtailing the privacy and civil liberties of the american people . 
in fact , the attorney general has admitted that the information on its use of the patriot act has not been forthcoming to congress in a timely manner . 
today we are deciding whether the government will be accountable to the people , to the congress , and to the courts for the exercise of its power . 
it is about whether broad surveillance powers that intrude on americans ' privacy rights contain safeguards and actually materially enhance security to target terrorists and those who wish to harm the united states , not needlessly intrude on the constitutional rights of innocent and law-abiding american citizens . 
perhaps they thought that these amendments would have been too appealing to the many members of this house on the republican side who are strong supporters of privacy rights for the american people and they did not want these amendments to pass . 
these amendments should have been considered as a minimum part of any effort to improve the patriot act and this bill . 
again , our founding fathers left us with the ever present challenge of finding the balance between security and liberty . 
it is the story of america . 
all members should honor their oath of office and carry out their duty to protect and defend our nation while protecting and defending our constitution and our civil liberties . 
i thank all who have participated in this very important debate and hope that at the end of the day , and i hope it is not a day with a very long sunset , but at the end of the day that we can all get behind a patriot act extension that does respect the civil liberties of the american people . 
madam speaker , i thank the gentleman for yielding , and thank you , mr. conyers , our ranking member on the judiciary committee , for being such an outstanding leader in protecting our civil liberties and also the national security of our country . 
we are not voting for the reauthorization of the patriot act in general . 
more than 90 percent of the patriot act is permanent law and includes many noncontroversial provisions that give law enforcement the tools they need . 
what is before us on the floor today is the extension of certain provisions which are controversial and have the potential for abuse . 
madam speaker , all of us support providing law enforcement officers with the tools they need to combat terrorism . 
in doing so , we must also preserve the balance between security and civil liberties and to recognize that not all of the tools law enforcement officers want are tools that they legitimately need . 
our founding fathers knew well the importance of the balance between security and liberty . 
as we consider this conference report , i ask every member of congress , indeed , every american , do you know if a national security letter has been issued about you , a letter to your phone company , your internet provider , your bank , for wholesale collection of records that may include your personal information ? 
this is the same for every american , and any information , including your most sensitive personal data , along with that of thousands of american citizens gathered by these national security letter requests , will be held in perpetuity by law enforcement . 
just think of it : you do not know , the recipient of the letter who is in possession of your information can not tell you . 
this is a massive invasion of the privacy of the american people . 
unfortunately , the bush administration and the republican congress have been delinquent in the oversight of the patriot act . 
as we have seen with this massive and unprecedented scope of national security letters , the implications of the republican failure of oversight are glaring and have a direct impact on every american . 
this conference has missed an opportunity to address the revelation of the widespread use of national security letters . 
that is why i strongly support the request of mr. conyers xz4000800 for a 3-month extension so that conferees can reconvene , adopt the senate bill , fix the national security letters and get it right . 
another part of this legislation that requires the government to show some connection between the records sought is under the library provision and an individual suspected of being a terrorist or spy . 
the list of failures goes on . 
nothing less is at stake than the privacy , the civil liberties , really the essence of our democracy . 
we must always remember as we protect and defend the american people , we must honor the oath of office we take here when we are sworn in to protect and defend the constitution and the civil liberties that it contains . 
mr. chairman , i thank the distinguished chairman for yielding me time , and especially i rise to thank the gentleman from wisconsin ( chairman sensenbrenner ) for his tireless efforts on behalf of the security and the liberty of the american people in developing this reauthorizing legislation . 
today in london we have seen yet again the work of terrorists on the soil of a freedom-loving people . 
the explosions in that city today , while less lethal than a few weeks ago , follow the deadly attacks that took place on july 7 , and the anguish in london is a vivid reminder of why we can not relent in taking the steps necessary to defend our homeland from a present terrorist threat . 
i saw the evil of our enemies written in the smoke rising above the pentagon . 
and we are reminded yet today that their desire to do such violence in our homeland and in the homeland of our allies is real . 
in the last 4 years under the patriot act , we have seen a great increase in the ability of law enforcement officials to investigate and track terrorists . 
for example , aided by provisions of the patriot act , law enforcement officials in ohio were able to arrest iyman faris , an ohio truck driver who authorities said plotted attacks on the brooklyn bridge and a central ohio shopping mall . 
in 2003 , he pleaded guilty to charges of aiding and abetting terrorism and conspiracy , acknowledging that he had met with osama bin laden in the year 2000 at an al qaeda training camp and then was provided assistance by al qaeda . 
while 16 provisions of the patriot act are set to expire at the end of this year , the threat of terrorism to our families and our cities will not . 
therefore , the usa patriot and terrorism prevention reauthorization act of 2005 is as necessary today as the patriot act was when it was originally signed into law in october of 2001 . 
this reauthorization legislation does make permanent 14 of the 16 sections from the original patriot act that were set to expire this year . 
but under the bill , those sections of the act that have caused the greatest concern in the hearts of many millions of americans are set to sunset , sections 206 and 215 , within 10 years , thanks to the leadership of this committee and of this congress . 
with over 4 years of oversight hearings and six department of justice inspector general reports , there is no evidence of abuse under the patriot act . 
i know what the people of london are feeling today . 
i thank the gentleman from arizona ( mr. flake ) xz4001340 and the gentleman from california ( mr. schiff ) xz4003610 for their tireless advocacy of the liberties of the american people , and i rise in strong support of the bipartisan flake-schiff amendment . 
president harry truman , i am told , had a plaque on his desk that simply read `` the buck stops here. '' it seems to me that the flake-schiff amendment is all about saying that when it comes to that sacred relationship that the american people feel between their local library and their local bookstore , that the fbi director himself or herself must be directly involved if that relationship is to be intruded upon in the name of an investigation into the war on terror . 
the flake-schiff amendment requires the director of the fbi to personally approve any library or bookstore request for records under section 215 of the patriot act . 
currently the law permits a designee of the director whose rank can not be lower than an assistant special agent in charge to approve section 215 orders , and that will change . 
also under this amendment , the director of the fbi can not delegate the duty to personally approve a section 215 request for library and bookstore records . 
this amendment , as the gentleman from arizona ( mr. flake ) xz4001340 said earlier , will prevent section 215 from being abused or used in a fishing expedition intruding upon the privacy of ordinary americans in the name of the war on terror . 
again i quote president harry truman 's famous plaque or missive , `` the buck stops here. '' the flake-schiff amendment is simply about saying if the war on terror demands it , when it comes to intruding upon that sacred relationship between the american people and a bookstore or a library , we have to have those who are of the highest accountability in our political system to answer to that . 
as we all learned on september 11 , 2001 , terrorists will use any and all means available to them to attack the united states of america . 
since its passage following the september 11 attacks , the patriot act has played a key role in a number of successful operations to protect innocent americans from terrorists . 
now fbi agents , federal prosecutors , and intelligence officials can protect our communities by mr. chairman , the simple truth is that while key provisions of the patriot act are set to expire , as we have learned twice in the past two weeks from events in great britain the terrorist threat that faces the world will not expire . 
southern nevada is visited by over 35 million people each year ; many of these tourists are our friends from foreign countries . 
this sentiment is supported by the fact that we now know that planning meetings of the 9/11 hijackers took place in las vegas . 
while this may not be a perfect bill , i do believe that the legislation before us today reflects a compromise that includes the proper balance between security and privacy to face the challenges of the current world we live in as well as the necessary safeguards to protect our fellow citizens against an over-encroaching government . 
i also rise , like my colleagues , understanding that we face a situation that is potentially very dangerous , especially given the events of this morning again in london . 
his amendment would have extended until 2010 the sunset date of section 6001 of the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act , also known as the `` lone wolf '' provision . 
it has only been in effect for 7 months , which is , in my opinion , an inadequate amount of time for the government and the public to assess the impact this significant expansion of government authorities has . 
these sunsets are key to ensuring individual rights and liberties as well as allowing congress to continue to evaluate the effectiveness of this act . 
mr. chairman , i thank the gentleman for yielding me this time and for his great work on this , and i want to thank my friends on the democrat side of the aisle for the work they have given for the patriot act . 
mr. chairman , as a former fbi agent , i had occasion to work some pretty bad folks in the city of chicago in working organized crime and public corruption . 
there was a case of a child pornographer who was producing child pornography tapes where we used the legal system , a legal instrument , through due process of law , to get records that we needed from businesses , from his home , from other places to make sure that we could find the entire network of distribution of criminals who were preying on our children . 
the people of america said , you know , agent rogers , at the time we trust you , but we trust our constitution more , so you have to follow the law . 
there is no subversion of the constitution , no suspension of the constitution . 
mr. chairman , it is maddening to me that somebody in america and in england and around the world is getting up in the morning thinking , i am going to kill somebody in an act of terror , and that we somehow fiddle while rome is burning and argue should it be 10 years or 5 years on a renewal or a sunset . 
this bill helps protect america and does not suspend the constitution of the united states . 
you should get up and argue against the criminal code every day on this floor , and you should put in bills to remove our ability as agents of the fbi to do that . 
we must do it today for the future safety of the united states of america . 
in 2001 after an attack on the united states and the slaughter of innocent civilians , this congress passed the patriot act , which i supported at that time . 
it gave our investigative agencies a wide variety of special powers to fight terrorism and to win this war on terrorism . 
you do not make policy for the united states government protecting the rights and freedoms of our people in an extraordinary time as this , a time of war , and then mandate it so it is going to be the rule of our country once we live in peacetime . 
our country was founded on the idea of limited government and individual liberty . 
i gladly supported patriot i. now they have taken all but two of the sunset provisions which would make those extraordinary new powers that we gave the government lapse once we have peace in this country . 
any real patriot will vote against this expansion of government at the expense of the individual even when peacetime comes . 
i would suggest that we do not have to sunset all the legislation going through this congress , but we have to pay particular attention to that legislation that affects the civil liberties of our people . 
and if we are going to in some way expand the power of government over our people in time of war because it is necessary , that should be sunsetted once the war is over . 
by permanently changing america , we are not furthering the cause of freedom in this country . 
mr. speaker , i rise in support of this motion . 
after 9/11 , the united states congress gave our investigative agencies a wide variety of special powers to fight a war on terrorism , an expansion of powers that we would have never approved in peacetime . 
this included the right to break into homes of american citizens without court order , seize documents , copy computer files , and evidence without ever telling the owner . 
i supported this dramatic expansion of federal power because our country was at war . 
in times of emergency , it is responsible to increase the power of our government , yet we recognize that these powers should contain sunset provisions . 
the first patriot act had 16 of its sections sunsetted , so after the emergency was over the government would again return to a level consistent to a free society . 
our republic was founded on the idea that the powers of government should be limited . 
we should not be required to live in peacetime under the extraordinary laws that were passed during times of war and crisis . 
emergency powers of investigation should not become the standard once the crisis has passed . 
i am seriously concerned about the use of emergency conditions to permanently alter our constitutional legal rights . 
until now , the members of this body have been denied the ability to vote their conscience on the issue of sunsets . 
now , each of us will have that opportunity . 
i was here yesterday fighting for a very important provision that put me against my friends on the other side of the aisle . 
but today i am asking all of my friends , on both sides of the aisle , let us be patriots . 
let us stand up for those principles that our founding fathers talked about , and that is limiting the power of government . 
but , please , let us keep faith with those people who founded our country on limited government and the protection of civil liberties . 
madam speaker , first and foremost , i yield myself a moment here to thank the gentleman from virginia ( mr. boucher ) xz4000430 for the time that he has yielded us and shown good faith with us in having an honest discussion of this very significant issue . 
madam speaker , i yield for the purpose of making a unanimous consent request to the gentleman from idaho ( mr. otter ) xz4003050 . 
madam speaker , i rise in strong support of this motion to instruct conferees on the patriot act . 
let me note that i am one of several , if not many , members of congress who feel that it was an act of bad faith on the part of those in this body who turned the temporary sunsetted provisions of the patriot act into permanent law for the united states of america . 
i supported the patriot act and would have again voted for the patriot act as it was when we first voted for it , except now we end up with a patriot act that permanently changes the balance of power in the united states between the police power and the limitations of power of the policing authorities of the federal government . 
that , i do not believe , should be tolerated by those of us who love liberty and justice and feel that limited government is vital to the protection of freedom . 
second of all , let me note that any , any investigation or hearings that we have had so far into the patriot act are irrelevant to the issue at hand , the issue at hand as to whether or not we have permanently changed this law and whether in the future there could be abuse . 
i would say , along with many others , that by permanently granting these excessive powers , or extended powers , to the federal government in a time of war and then permanently extending it so that now it is the norm for a time of peace is asking for abuse . 
on september 11 , our country was attacked and we saw 3 , 000 americans slaughtered before our eyes , and it totally justified the major expansion of the police and investigative powers of our government . 
i voted for the patriot act , as i just said , and i continue to support its provisions as a necessary expansion of police powers in order to prosecute this war on islamofacism . 
however , as i said in the original bill , sunset provisions were placed in all of these expanded police powers that were going to enable us to protect our people in this time of war . 
the expanded authority we are talking about in terms of eliminating these sunsets in the current bill , this has nothing to do with fighting the war or winning the war on terror . 
i support the expansion of those powers until we win that war . 
but we can not , and this is what we have been handed , a bill that permanently does it so our way of life is changed after the war is over . 
the special grants of police power that we have approved we believe should only last for the duration of the war , and we must demand at least a forced reexamination of these provisions to ensure that winning the war on terror does not result in a permanent change of our way of life . 
of course , we are not here to debate the patriot act again . 
today , we are limited to instructing conferees to adopt the senate 's version of the bill , which would sunset in 4 years the same two provisions that the house bill would sunset in 10 years . 
the rest of the expansion of the police powers , such as the sneak-and-peak searches , internet and credit card seizures , the lowering of standards for logging all calls dialed from one particular phone , and the rules against discussing property seizure , all without the traditional warrants that would be required for those activities , have been made permanent in u.s. law . 
the two provisions being allowed to sunset , as one might expect , are the most questionable of the lot . 
specifically , section 206 of the house version of the patriot act extends to federal authorities for 10 years until 2015 the right to employ roving wiretaps , whether they have the name of a specific suspect or location notwithstanding . 
this section allows for law enforcement to examine library and financial records of any person in connection with a federal investigation . 
my colleagues on one side of the aisle say that this is an unconscionable invasion of privacy , never justified , even in wartime . 
well , let us be frank and admit that searching library and financial records of our citizens is hugely intrusive , even if it is rarely used . 
nonetheless , this section 215 may be needed in a time of war to secure our country and to make sure our people are safe . 
while granting the expansion of this police power with a reasonable time limit , such as the expansion of a shorter term of years to ensure section 215 is not abused , that seems reasonable . 
we do not want to have that kind of power in the hands of the federal police authorities after this war is over . 
they hate the openness of our society . 
they hate our tolerances , our belief in the equality before the law , the right of those of other faiths to worship , and the right of us to express our beliefs . 
in short , radical islam is the enemy of freedom ; thus , they are our enemy . 
if we permanently alter the traditional limitations of our government here in america , the terrorists have won . 
they have changed our way of life . 
during no war in the past , whether world war ii or the cold war , were the police powers of the federal government permanently changed so that after the war a new standard of government would exist . 
well , ronald reagan would never have supported such an expansion of federal power and neither should we . 
i ask my colleagues to vote on this motion to instruct conferees , and i would ask them to search their consciences about voting for a new patriot act at all that threatens to permanently change the american way of life . 
madam speaker , i reserve the balance of my time . 
madam speaker , i yield myself the balance of my time . 
and i voted for that expansion of the police power , just as most of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle and all of my colleagues on this side of the aisle did , almost all of my colleagues on this side of the aisle voted . 
that is not the question , because when we voted for those expansions , we put in a sunset clause that after a certain number of years , 4 years , that the issues of those expanded authorities would be re-examined . 
the only question at hand in the debate today is whether or not those expanded powers for wartime expansion in the war against radical islam should be made permanent even now in this time of crisis . 
this is not a good strategy for free government to change permanently its law during a moment of crisis . 
i would vote for the patriot act again because i think that these powers that were just described are needed at this moment , even the ones that were just described by my friends on the other side of the aisle . 
our founding fathers understood limitations on government is a guarantee of freedom . 
mr. speaker , i rise in support of this rule but in opposition to the underlying bill , the so-called patriot act , the usa patriot act . 
but my original support was based on the inclusion of 4-year sunsets in those sections of the patriot act , those sections that drastically expanded the police and investigative powers of the federal government . 
instead , the current legislation before us makes permanent the expansion of police powers which were meant to be only temporary until this war was over . 
of the 16 sunset provisions , sections sunsetted in the original 2001 bill , the current conference committee report establishes 4-year sunsets on only two of those 16 . 
the rest of the expanded police powers are being made permanent , the most drastic permanent expansion of these powers being section 213 , the sneak and peek section ; the section 205 , the secret search section ; and section 214 , which permanently eliminates probable cause needed for the use of eavesdropping devices . 
however , this effort to use the war as a way to alter forever the balance of personal liberty and legitimate restraints on government power should be defeated . 
long after the threat of islamic extremism is over , under permanent secret search rules , americans will have their business records , phone records , credit records and computer files seized without a judge issuing a warrant based on probable cause . 
my central theme has always been based on the need for periodic review by congress of all those dramatic expansions of police power that we are giving our government now in order to win this war on terrorism . 
we should not live in peacetime under the extraordinary laws passed during times of war and crisis . 
emergency powers of investigation should not become the standard . 
madam speaker , i rise in opposition to this conference report which would reauthorize the patriot act by making permanent the expansions of federal police powers that were temporarily put into the original bill and sunsetted in that bill . 
let me note that the people in the pro-life movement should take note of what is happening here because the expanded police powers of the federal government will be used against them . 
when you expand the police powers of the federal government , no matter how much oversight we might have today and say that power is not being abused , we have opened the door to abuse . 
mr. chairman , i rise in opposition to h.r. 3199 , the reauthorization of 16 expiring sections of the patriot act , which weakens the safeguards currently in place to protect innocent americans from sweeping searches and surveillance by the government . 
these will remain intact , and today 's vote will not affect such core provisions of the patriot act . 
whether or not h.r. 3199 passes , 90 percent of the patriot act will continue to be enforced . 
my objection , however , is that h.r. 3199 retains numerous objectionable provisions of the patriot act that intrude on our privacy and civil liberties , have been subject to repeated abuse and misuse by the justice department , and have little to do with combating terrorism . 
since 2002 , 389 communities , including los angeles , have passed resolutions opposing parts of the patriot act , representing over 62 million people . 
this outcry from america is due to the repeated and serious misuse of the legislation by the justice department . 
consider that the patriot act has been used more than 150 times to secretly search an individual 's home , with nearly 90 percent of those cases having had nothing to do with terrorism . 
furthermore , because of gag restrictions , we will never know how many times it has been used to obtain the reading records of average americans from libraries and bookstores . 
h.r. 3199 also extends or makes permanent 16 provisions of the patriot act concerning the government 's expanded surveillance authorities , which are otherwise scheduled to sunset on december 31 , 2005 . 
it is simply irresponsible to make these provisions permanent when there continues to be wide spread concern that these sections of the patriot act can lead to violations of individual civil liberties , as well as tread on our country 's professed support of basic civil rights for all individuals . 
preserving a 4-year sunset for these 16 provisions in the patriot act is one of congress 's strongest mechanisms for maintaining oversight and accountability over expanded government controls that could potentially undermine civil rights and civil liberties . 
we are talking about critical issues that will set the precedence for the rights of people in our country for many years to come . 
one amendment would have tightened the ability of the fbi to conduct roving wiretaps to ensure that only terror suspects -- not innocent americans -- are wire-tapped . 
even though some in our government may claim that civil liberties must be compromised in order to protect the public , we must be wary of what we are giving up in the name of fighting terrorism . 
history has taught us to carefully safeguard our civil liberties -- especially in times of fear and national outrage . 
the lessons of september 11 are that if we allow law enforcement to do their work free of political interference , if we give them adequate resources and modern technologies , we can protect our citizens without intruding on our liberties . 
we all want to fight terrorism , but we need to fight it the right way , consistent with the constitution , and in a manner that serves as a model for the rest of the world . 
unfortunately , h.r. 3199 does not meet those tests and , without the critical safeguards of sunset provisions , does not warrant reauthorization . 
sunset provisions hold congress accountable for reexamining and determining the effectiveness and impact of the patriot act . 
as a member of the permanent select committee on intelligence , i hold this oversight responsibility as one , if not my most , important function . 
additional time is needed to assess many of these provisions ' effectiveness and impact on civil liberties , and that is why we need to call for sunsets . 
it is clear to me that we still face serious threats and we need some of the powers of the patriot act . 
i rise in opposition not just because an important amendment that i offered , along with the gentleman from michigan ( mr. conyers ) xz4000800 , the gentleman from texas ( mr. paul ) xz4003110 , the gentleman from new york ( mr. nadler ) xz4002890 , the gentleman from new mexico ( mr. udall ) xz4004122 , and the gentlewoman from california ( ms. eshoo ) xz4001240 was not accepted by the committee on rules , but because this very same amendment has already been passed on the floor of this house by a 51-vote margin just a few weeks ago . 
on june 15 , by a vote of 238-187 , this body voted overwhelmingly for the exact same amendment which would stop the fbi and other government agencies from going into our libraries and book stores without probable cause . 
this , my friends , is an outrageous abuse of power and denies the majority of members here the right to put into the bill what they want . 
number one , every member of this body is pledged to do everything that he or she can to protect the american people from the horrendous scourge of terrorism , but some of us have more confidence in our law enforcement agencies and the american people than others do . 
let all of us remember that in the 1940s innocent japanese americans , without any pretext , were herded into internment camps . 
in the 1960s , a president of the united states had a file on him , president kennedy , by the fbi . 
in the 1960s , martin luther king , jr. , who some of us consider to be one of the great heroes of the 20th century , was hounded and investigated by the fbi . 
tell me why you will not allow that amendment to come up for a vote , despite the fact that the majority of the members support it . 
all of us are in agreement that the united states government must do everything it can do to effectively fight terrorism and protect the american people from another terrorist attack . 
but some of us believe that with strong , well-trained and well-funded law enforcement , we can in fact protect the american people without undermining the constitutional rights that make us a free country . 
in that regard , i am happy to say that there has been a very strong coming together of members of congress and americans from very different political perspectives , people who usually agree on nothing but who have come together to protect the constitutional rights of the american people as we fight terrorism . 
we should be very proud that , on this issue , such diverse groups as the aclu , the american conservative union , the gun owners of america , the u.s. chamber of commerce , the american library association and the american book sellers association have come together to say to congress , please support the senate version . 
the simple fact of the matter is that the original senate bill is a far better piece of legislation than what we are looking at today , and that is the legislation that we should pass . 
mr. speaker , day after day , we hear the republican leadership telling us about the virtues of small and limited government , about how we have got to deregulate almost everything and get government out of our lives . 
the underlying amendment makes unnecessary disclosure of very sensitive information . 
it is burdensome upon each of the departments that it requires this disclosure to be brought forward , and as a matter of fact , the explanation that the gentleman just gave saying that makes it only available to hpsci and ssci , the two intelligence committees , does not include the committee on armed services , which has great responsibility for military defense intelligence . 
mr. chairman , although not in opposition , i ask unanimous consent to control the balance of the time in opposition to the amendment . 
i am sure that every member of congress has heard from their constituents regarding this very provision of the patriot act . 
even if possibly based on misplaced fears , some of the public are now apprehensive about going to their local library or bookstore . 
instead , our amendment would aim to restore some measure of public confidence that this provision will not be abused . 
the flake-schiff amendment says that vis-a-vis the records that pose the greatest concern for all of our constituents , library records or bookstore records , the existing authority which allows lower level fbi agents to seek those records should be significantly amended . 
as of the latest public disclosure , the justice department has reported that section 215 has never been used in a library . 
the fact , however , that this provision may never have been used in a library to date does not alter the fact that it affects the behavior of all of our constituents who are concerned that their records may one day be the subject of a search . 
given the sensitivity of this section , i believe it is worthwhile and necessary to make changes to existing law and that this added protection is warranted . 
i think our amendment provides an even stronger safeguard and strikes a balance that will restore a measure of public confidence in this area . 
as you know , last month the house decisively adopted the sanders amendment during consideration of the science , state , justice and commerce appropriations bill . 
i supported that amendment , which prohibited the use of funds for a section 215 search of a library record patron list , book sale record or book customer list . 
i expect and encourage the gentleman from vermont ( mr. sanders ) xz4003570 to bring his amendment before the house floor each year to further limit the use of section 215 with respect to specific lists and records in libraries and bookstores . 
mr. chairman , i reserve the balance of my time . 
mr. chairman , i yield 30 seconds to the distinguished ranking member of the subcommittee on crime , the gentleman from virginia ( mr. scott ) xz4003641 . 
the fact that the library provision has not been used as of the last public disclosure does not affect the fact that many americans are concerned about their expectation of privacy when they go to the library , when they check out books on family matters , on health matters , on other matters . 
and because this has an impact on the behavior of americans , on the freedom to use libraries , it is an important issue , merely that fear . 
this amendment , i think , takes a small , but important , step to provide at least the confidence to the people of this country that no less than the director of the fbi himself or herself can authorize the use of this provision for library and bookseller records . 
mr. chairman , i yield back the balance of my time . 
mr. chairman , earlier this year i introduced the reducing crime and terrorism at america 's seaports act of 2005 along with my colleague the gentleman from north carolina ( mr. coble ) xz4000760 , chairman of the committee on the judiciary subcommittee on crime , terrorism , and homeland security . 
today , i offer the text of this important legislation as an amendment to the patriot reauthorization bill , joined by my colleague the gentleman from north carolina ( chairman coble ) of the committee on the judiciary , as well as the gentleman from virginia ( mr. forbes ) xz4001370 , another colleague on the committee on the judiciary . 
there are 361 seaports in the united states that serve essential national interests by facilitating the flow of trade and the movement of cruise passengers , as well as supporting the effective and safe deployment of u.s. armed forces . 
these seaport facilities and other marine areas cover some 3.5 million square miles of ocean area and 95 , 000 miles of coastline . 
millions of shipping containers pass through our ports each month . 
a single container has room for as much as 60 , 000 pounds of explosives , 10 to 15 times the amount in the ryder truck used to blow up the murrah federal building in oklahoma city . 
when you consider that a single ship can carry as many as 8 , 000 containers at one time , the vulnerability of our seaports is alarming . 
many seaports are still protected by little more than a chain link fence and in far too many instances have no adequate safeguards to ensure that only authorized personnel can access sensitive areas of the port . 
if we allow this system to continue unchecked , it may be only a matter of time until terrorists attempt to deliver a weapon of mass destruction to our doorstep via truck , ship or cargo container . 
this amendment makes common sense changes to our criminal laws to deter and prevent terrorist attacks on our ports , our sea vessels , and cracks down on the theft and smuggling of cargo . 
a substantially similar bipartisan version of our legislation has already been reported favorably by the senate judiciary committee and is awaiting action by the full senate . 
mr. chairman , i reserve the balance of my time . 
mr. chairman , i am proud to yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from north carolina ( mr. coble ) xz4000760 , the chairman of the subcommittee and a lead cosponsor of this amendment . 
mr. chairman , i am happy to yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from virginia ( mr. scott ) xz4003641 , the ranking member of the subcommittee on crime , terrorism , and homeland security . 
i want to take this opportunity to thank the chairman of the full committee , the gentleman from wisconsin ( mr. sensenbrenner ) xz4003650 , and thank the chairman of the subcommittee . 
i want to thank the gentleman from north carolina ( chairman the numbers are quite startling : 141 million ferry and cruise ship passengers , more than 2 billion tons of domestic international freight , and 3 billion tons of oil move through the u.s. seaports . 
millions of truck-sized cargo containers are offloaded on to u.s. docks . 
as a part of the homeland security authorization bill , the house took some important steps to improve the screening of cargo by expanding the container security initiative and refocusing it based on risk . 
but the truth is that not every container can be inspected , and we need to use other tools at our disposal to deter and punish those who would use our seaports as a point of attack . 
mr. chairman , i yield back the balance of my time . 
the patriot act is part of a pattern of lacking checks and balances . 
military tribunals , not part of the patriot act but part of a pattern of reduced checks and balances . 
military tribunals were presented with no public trials , no presumption of innocence , no guilt beyond a reasonable doubt . 
part of that pattern is the enemy combatant where the administration designates someone as an enemy combatant , can arrest them and hold them indefinitely without charges , never having an opportunity to contest the allegations . 
we considered a bill on the same day of the second bombing in great britain with no money for port security , no money to secure our rails or bus transportation , no money for first responders . 
we can have plenty of privacy without threatening security , and we missed an opportunity to require standards for wiretaps and `` sneak and peak '' searches . 
we missed an opportunity to require probable cause of a crime before invading people 's privacy . 
ninety percent of the `` sneak and peak '' searches have nothing to do with terrorism . 
during our deliberations , we got a lot of cooperation on those provisions that are sunsetting . 
some of it came in right before the hearing , but because of the sunset we got a lot of cooperation . 
because of the sunset we found no abuses in the libraries . 
that is because of the sunset . 
although government agencies have gone to at least 200 libraries for information , that has not been abused because they know if they abused it they would lose the benefit of that provision . 
there has not been any unnecessary sharing of sensitive information of a personal nature . 
we have not run criminal investigations without probable cause using the provisions of the patriot act . 
they could have , because of the broad discretion in the bill , but they did not , because of the sunset . 
fourteen of the 16 sunset provisions are removed , and the two that are left , 10-year sunsets , which will get us through this administration , clean through the next presidential term and most of the way through the next . 
mr. chairman , we need to defeat this bill , go back to the committee on the judiciary and establish a much better piece of legislation that will protect our privacy and ensure our safety . 
mr. chairman , there are a lot of problems with section 215 . 
this amendment does not take care of many of them ; but by requiring the fbi director to personally approve the warrant , that will significantly reduce the chance that there will be abuses . 
so far as the ability to contest these , it is very unlikely that someone receiving one of these warrants will go through the cost of actually contesting it for someone else 's rights . 
mr. chairman , just to acknowledge that as the chairman has indicated , some of these roving wiretaps do put us into the 21st century with the use of cell phones and disposable cell phones . 
mr. chairman , i yield 1 1/2 minutes to the gentlewoman from california ( ms. zoe lofgren ) xz4002450 , a member of the judiciary committee . 
mr. chairman , i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from massachusetts ( mr. delahunt ) xz4001020 , a member of the judiciary committee . 
mr. chairman , i yield back the balance of my time . 
mr. chairman , as it has been indicated , this amendment involves a lot of new definitions . 
this is a complex rewrite of two different sections , 18 u.s.c . 
mr. chairman , i reserve the balance of my time . 
mr. chairman , i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from michigan ( mr. conyers ) xz4000800 , the ranking member of the committee on the judiciary . 
mr. chairman , i yield the balance of my time to the gentlewoman from california ( ms. zoe lofgren ) xz4002450 . 
mr. chairman , i yield back the balance of my time . 
i would like to join my colleague from virginia in his interest in the security of the port of hampton roads . 
mr. chairman , this amendment is well drafted to target the problem of port security . 
it has death penalties , some of which push the envelope on constitutionality , because some can be imposed even if there is no intent to kill ; they are broad enough to even include deaths which result from violating the stowaway statute . 
mr. chairman , death penalties can not be a deterrent to suicide bombers , so that part of the bill i think would not be helpful in terms of port security . 
that is the kind of thing that will make us safer . 
as to the other parts of the bill , i would like to thank the gentleman from california ( mr. schiff ) xz4003610 and the other cosponsors for their hard work in focusing us on port security , which is desperately needed . 
mr. chairman , i yield back the balance of my time . 
it provides for the enactment of extremely controversial provisions which we have had inadequate time to consider . 
we have not had the opportunity to hear critical testimony on controversial aspects of this bill such as the provision to apply the death penalty to offenses where no death results , the change in alternative jury rules and peremptory challenge rules , another change of the number of jurors needed to impose the death penalty and other changes which could constitute constitutional problems . 
another problem with the bill , it provides for expansion of the federal death penalty , both for crimes that the supporters of the death penalty might think warrant the death penalty , as well as crimes that most people would not expect to be associated with the most severe of penalties . 
the bill is so broad that it includes offenses such as those related to protection of computers , property offenses and financial or other material support provisions . 
the provisions of this bill create a death penalty liability tantamount to a federal felony murder rule , and it presents constitutional issues as well as questions of the appropriateness of the death penalty in certain cases . 
the provisions of this bill will be duplicative of state jurisdiction laws in many instances and actually conflicting with others . 
another concern we always have to consider is expansion of the death penalty when we know that there is a frequent error rate in applying the death penalty . 
one study showed that 68 percent of the death penalty decisions by the trial court were eventually overturned . 
we are already experiencing difficulties in securing the cooperation of the rest of the civilized world in bringing terrorists to justice due to our existing proliferation of death penalty offenses when other countries will not extradite criminals to the united states if they will be subject to the death penalty . 
mr. chairman , i reserve the balance of my time . 
mr. chairman , the sponsor of the amendment mentioned that hearing we had . 
i would remind him that the hearing was a hearing on habeas corpus , also the same hearing we heard the issue of the question of whether the death penalty deters murder or other crimes , and this bill . 
we were given one witness to cover all of that . 
we did not have the opportunity to invite a witness to discuss this bill and the policy implications of death penalty where no death occurs and alternate jury rules , peremptory challenges , the number of jurors needed to impose a death penalty , all of these death penalties involved . 
so to suggest that that was a fair hearing , i think , does not do justice to actually what happened on that day and the consideration of this bill . 
mr. chairman , i yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from california ( ms. zoe lofgren ) xz4002450 , a member of the committee . 
mr. chairman , i yield myself the balance of my time . 
as the gentleman said , we had a little piece of a hearing , but it was not much ; and we did not have the opportunity to discuss this bill . 
the committee elected not to make it part of the bill , and i would hope that we would make the same decision and defer this until it can be appropriately considered . 
mr. chairman , i yield back the balance of my time . 
despite the name of the title , the title of the amendment is `` combating terrorism financing act of 2005 , '' but if you read the provisions , it is not limited to terrorism financing but for all violations of economic sanctions imposed under the international emergency economic powers act . 
it talks about misuse of social security numbers so if somebody misuses a social security number to get a job , having nothing to do with terrorism , just is cheating to get a job , they could get caught up in this . 
all of this is implicated in this amendment . 
i would hope we would defeat the amendment so we could have some time to make sure it could be limited to terrorism financing and just not every violation of the international emergency economic powers act and other kinds of money-laundering statutes . 
mr. chairman , i yield myself such time as i may consume to note that these are the kinds of questions which cause me to hope we would defeat the amendment . 
mr. chairman , i yield the balance of my time to the gentlewoman from pennsylvania ( ms. hart ) xz4001680 . 
this amendment is unnecessarily confusing and duplicative of current law . 
it is already a crime punishable by 20 years in prison , or life in prison in some circumstances , to provide material support of any kind to a terrorist organization or to support a person in carrying out terrorist acts regardless of how the money came about , whether it was from drug proceeds or otherwise . 
if anyone is engaged in drug trafficking of any significance in order to support terrorism , they can already be charged with both a drug offense and the material support of terrorism . 
this might , unfortunately , bring in some small-time dealer that did not know what he was doing and all of a sudden he is subjected to 20-year mandatory minimums when he was not much of a dealer at all . 
we did not put it into the bill in committee when we would have had an opportunity to ensure it did not conflict with various other provisions of the law or was unnecessarily duplicative . 
mr. chairman , i reserve the balance of my time . 
mr. chairman , i reserve the balance of my time . 
mr. chairman , i reserve the balance of my time . 
mr. chairman , i yield back the balance of my time . 
madam speaker , i rise in support of the motion to instruct . 
the 4-year sunsets worked to make the justice department responsive to congress in providing the information needed to properly perform its oversight responsibility for the extraordinary powers extended under the patriot act , but only in the last year of the sunset . 
for most of the 4-year period leading up to the sunsets , the justice department refused any meaningful oversight of their patriot act powers and other war on terror authorities . 
even with chairman sensenbrenner threatening a subpoena because he was not getting answers to his patriot act questions , it was n't until the powers were set to expire that we got real answers -- hard numbers and at least anecdotal evidence of their use . 
take , for example , the effort to try to get information about library record requests under the secretive section 215 powers where the recipient of the order is gagged from disclosing any information about it : first we were told that information about even the number of these orders was secret , so it could n't be disclosed . 
it was only in the last year of the sunset that we were finally told that there had been no 215 orders issued to libraries , then we learned that this was misleading because most libraries cooperated with fbi requests for information without requiring a 215 order , and with all the secrecy and gag orders in effect , we still do n't know what the full story is . 
perhaps some of the pending lawsuits will finally reveal what has been going on in this area . 
the problem with a 10-year sunset is that it will have no impact on the current administration , or the next one and only have an impact in the last year of the 3rd administration from now . 
moreover , with a 20-year retirement period for most career officials , in 10 years most of today 's officials will have retired . 
so , that 's really of little oversight value if we have to wait that long to get the kind of responsive information for oversight we were finally able to get in the last year of the current sunsets . 
accordingly , we should accede to the senate sunset provisions which call for 4-year sunsets on the three most controversial and worrisome patriot powers -- secret acquisition of library and other business records , roving wiretaps , and the `` lone wolf '' provision for terrorism investigations , which allows a single individual to fall under the extraordinary , secretly administered foreign surveillance powers otherwise reserved for use against agents of foreign governments or organizations . 
mr. chairman , i yield myself such time as i may consume , and i rise in strong support of h.r. 3199 , the usa patriot and terrorism prevention reauthorization act of 2005 . 
mr. chairman , the attacks of september 11 , 2001 , tragically affirmed the urgency of updating america 's laws to address the clear and present danger presented by international terrorism . 
on that day , foreign terrorists maliciously and without provocation attacked the united states , murdered thousands of our citizens , and destroyed symbols of our freedom in a failed effort to break the spirit and resolve of the american people . 
we must also recall that these terrorists exploited historic divisions between america 's law enforcement and intelligence communities that had limited the dissemination of vital and timely information and increased america 's vulnerability to terrorist attack . 
in the wake of the 9/11 atrocities , broad bipartisan majorities in both houses of congress passed the patriot act that lowered the wall that prohibited our law enforcement and intelligence communities from effectively sharing information , and to enhance investigatory tools necessary to assess , detect , and prevent future terrorist attacks . 
u.s. law enforcement and intelligence authorities have utilized the expanded information sharing provisions contained in the patriot act to gain critical knowledge of the attentions of foreign-based terrorists before they occur , while preempting gathering terrorist threats at home . 
exactly 2 weeks ago , innocent citizens in london were murdered in a series of ruthlessly coordinated attacks . 
last year , the madrid bombings brought unprecedented terror to the people of spain , and ongoing terrorist operations around the globe demonstrate the imperative for continued vigilance . 
when the house committee on the judiciary reported the patriot act in october 2001 , i pledged to rigorously examine its implementation and the conduct of the war against terrorism . 
in my words and in my actions as committee chair , i have maintained this commitment and emphasized the importance of better protecting our citizenry from terrorist attack while , at the same time preserving the values and liberties that distinguish us as americans . 
h.r. 3199 is based upon 4 years of comprehensive bipartisan oversight consisting of hearing testimony , inspector general reports , briefings , and oversight letters . 
since april of this year alone , the committee has received testimony from 35 witnesses during 12 hearings on the patriot act . 
of no less importance , and notwithstanding the vague and general suspicion expressed by some of its detractors , the record shows that there is no evidence whatsoever that the patriot act has been abused to violate americans ' civil liberties . 
to further allay concerns expressed by some , this bill makes important revisions to section 215 of the patriot act , which pertains to business records obtained through the foreign intelligence surveillance act , or fisa . 
i would note that section 215 is probably the most misunderstood and deliberately misrepresented provision of the patriot act . 
the legislation also explicitly clarifies that a section 215 order will issue only `` if the judge finds that the requirements have been met , '' and provides the committee on the judiciary last week conducted a nearly 12-hour markup of this legislation , at which 43 amendments were offered and debated . 
the reported version of this legislation extends for 10 years the sunset on sections 206 and 215 of the patriot act . 
this crucial provision updates the law to reflect contemporary communications technology by making a suspected terrorist , rather than a communications device , the proper target of a wiretap . 
this sunset provision was approved by the committee by an overwhelming bipartisan vote of 26 to 2. however , while the legislation sets expiration dates on certain provisions of the patriot act , congressional oversight of the entire patriot act must be perpetual . 
let me conclude with the following point : for too long opponents of the patriot act have transformed it into a grossly distorted caricature that bears no relationship whatsoever to the legislation itself . 
our constituents expect and deserve substantive consideration of this vital issue , and i hope that today 's debate reflects the bipartisan seriousness that this issue demands . 
mr. chairman , the security of the american people is the most solemn responsibility of all entrusted to the congress . 
passage of the usa patriot and terrorism prevention reauthorization act of 2005 is vital to maintaining the post-9/11 law enforcement intelligence reforms that have reduced america 's vulnerability to terrorist attack . 
we must never return to the pre- 9/11 mindset that ignores the painful lessons of that day as well as the tragic experiences of our friends and allies . 
i would urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this vital legislation . 
mr. chairman , i reserve the balance of my time . 
they were caused by existing legislation , and we should deal with that , not in the context of this bill but elsewhere . 
mr. chairman , reclaiming my time , yes , that is an accurate reading of the bill . 
mr. chairman , further reclaiming my time , again , that is an accurate reading of the bill . 
mr. chairman , i reserve the balance of my time . 
the delayed notification or so-called `` sneak-and-peek '' warrants were authorized in the late seventies for purposes of racketeering and drug-trafficking investigations and were held constitutional by the supreme court in the early eighties as not violative of the fourth amendment . 
but all of the other investigations that the gentleman from north carolina referred to would have been legal under existing practice which have been held constitutional . 
mr. chairman , i reserve the balance of my time . 
mr. chairman , effective oversight is a function of effective congressional leadership and not as a result of legislative sunsets . 
if we restricted oversight to legislative sunsets , only about 5 percent of the laws that we pass are sunset , and most of those are appropriations bills . 
now , the gentleman from california ( mr. rohrabacher ) xz4003430 is the chairman of an oversight subcommittee on the committee on international relations . 
i do not see any sunsets coming on bills coming out of the committee on international relations because i have faith in the gentleman from california 's ( mr. rohrabacher ) xz4003430 being able to do effective oversight . 
the committee on the judiciary has done a huge amount of oversight . 
there has been more process and more hearings and more witnesses on more sides of the issue on the patriot act than practically any other piece of legislation that i have faced in my 26-plus years as a member of congress . 
i wish i had brought all of the paper that has come about as a result of the committee on the judiciary 's oversight , because it would stack this high off the table here in the house chamber . 
mr. chairman , the following is a listing of the oversight activities so that the american public and everybody can see that this committee has done its job . 
it has done its job effectively , and it has made sure that the civil liberties of the people of this country have not been infringed upon .

oversight : house judiciary committee oversight of the usa patriot act & lt ; p & gt ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; & amp ; nbsp ; oversight through letters to the department of justice house judiciary committee sent the attorney general , john ashcroft , a letter on june 13 , 2002 , with 50 detailed questions on the implementation of the usa patriot act . 
the questions were a result of extensive consultation between the majority and minority committee counsel . 
assistant attorney general , daniel bryant , responded to chairman sensenbrenner and ranking member mr. conyers xz4000800 on july 26 , 2002 , providing lengthy responses to 28 out of the 50 questions submitted . 
on august 26 , 2002 , mr. bryant sent the responses to the remaining questions , after sending responses to six of the questions to the house permanent select committee on intelligence . 
then , on september 20 , 2002 , mr. bryant sent the minority additional information regarding the department of justice 's responses to these questions . 
on april 1 , 2003 , chairman sensenbrenner and ranking member mr. conyers xz4000800 sent a second letter to the department of justice with additional questions regarding the use of pre-existing authorities and the new authorities conferred by the usa patriot act . 
once again , the questions were the product of bipartisan coordination by committee counsel . 
acting assistant attorney general , jamie e. brown , responded with a may 13 , 2003 letter that answered the questions she deemed relevant to the department of justice and forwarded the remaining questions to the appropriate officials at the department of homeland security . 
on june 13 , 2003 , the assistant secretary for legislative affairs at the department of homeland security , pamela j. turner , sent responses to the forwarded questions . 
on november 20 , 2003 , chairman sensenbrenner and congressman hostettler , chairman of the subcommittee on immigration , border security , and claims , sent a letter to the comptroller general of the government accountability office ( gao ) requesting a gao study of the implementation of the usa patriot act anti-money laundering provisions . 
on may 20 , 2003 , the committee 's subcommittee on the constitution held an oversight hearing entitled , `` anti-terrorism investigations and the fourth amendment after september 11th : where and when can government go to prevent terrorist attacks. '' on june 5 , 2003 , the attorney general testified before the full committee on the judiciary at an oversight hearing on the united states department of justice . 
both the hearing on may 20 and the hearing on june 5 discussed oversight aspects of the usa patriot act . 
the subcommittee on crime , terrorism , and homeland security of this committee requested that officials from the department of justice appear and answer questions regarding the implementation of the usa patriot act . 
in response to our request , the department of justice gave two separate briefings to members , counsel , and staff : during the briefing held on august 7 , 2003 , department officials covered the long-standing authority for law enforcement to conduct delayed searches and collect business records , as well as the effect of the usa patriot act on those authorities . 
during the second briefing , held on february 3 , 2004 , the department of justice discussed its views of s. 1709 , the `` security and freedom ensured ( safe ) act of 2003 '' and h.r. 3352 , the house companion bill , as both bills proposed changes to the usa patriot act . 
the department of justice has also provided three classified briefings on the use of the foreign intelligence surveillance act ( fisa ) under the usa patriot act for members of the judiciary committee : on june 10 , 2003 , october 29 , 2003 , and june 7 , 2005 the justice department provided these briefings . 
a u.s. district judge in washington state executed or authorized a delayed-notification warrant to look into a building on the u.s. side of the northern border . 
shortly thereafter , a u.s. district judge authorized the installation of cameras and listening devices in the home to monitor the activities in the home . 
ninety-three pounds of marijuana were found in these bags when the washington state patrol stopped the car . 
and if they can bring 93 pounds of marijuana in , they can bring terrorists in as well . 
mr. chairman , i yield back the balance of my time . 
after listening to the speech of the distinguished minority leader , i have reached the conclusion she has not read the bill . 
we have an oversight record of bipartisan letters sent to the justice department , inspector general 's reports , and hearings that have a stack of paper that is about 2 feet high . 
in this bill we have had 12 hearings with 35 witnesses , people who have come from all over the spectrum ; and 13 of the 16 sections of the patriot act that are sunsetted are not controversial . 
the three controversial sections , two of them are sunsetted ; the third one , as a result of some of the testimony , has been amended , and that is the delayed notification warrants . 
the fact of the matter remains that no federal court has found that any of the 16 sunsetted sections are unconstitutional , and the inspector general , who is required by the patriot act itself to report to the congress twice a year , has not found any civil liberties violations . 
let us stick to the result of the oversight . 
and let us stop the scare tactics that seem to surround the debate of those who are opposed to this law for whatever purpose . 
mr. chairman , i believe this amendment is a good one because it centralizes responsibility in the hands of the director of the fbi in signing off on 215 applications for bookstore and library records . 
but in the context of the overall debate , what i think is missing from this debate is not whether there is a potential for abuse by the justice department , but whether there is an actual record of abuse . 
and there has been no record of abuse by the justice department with bookstores and libraries . 
they have publicly responded repeatedly that they have not used the 215 order to look at the records of people checking out books or buying books at either bookstores or libraries . 
now , what this bill does is it makes an improvement to the law where there is a specific method of contesting a 215 order by the recipient . 
but to say that all of these records should be exempt from law enforcement scrutiny is to turn our bookstores and libraries into a sanctuary . 
mr. chairman , i rise in support of his amendment . 
and this increases judicial supervision and accountability and protects the civil liberties of the american people . 
that , frankly , insults what both democrats and republicans have done on oversight of the patriot act on a bipartisan basis . 
right here is the result of the oversight that the judiciary committee has done in the last 3 1/2 years on this law . 
this is a stack of paper that is almost 2 feet high . 
i doubt that any other committee of congress has done as much oversight on a single law as my committee has done on the patriot act . 
first , we should not have different crimes and different penalties depending upon which type of mass transportation system is attacked . 
we should have uniform penalties and uniform definitions of criminal activity so someone who attacks a railroad will get the same penalty as someone would in a similar attack against a subway system or a bus or an airplane . 
secondly , i think we have to broaden the definition of what is `` attacked '' to make sure that attacks against support systems for mass transportation systems are treated the same way as an attack against the transportation system itself . 
the gentlewoman 's amendment does all of these things , and i would urge its support and unanimous adoption by the house . 
mr. chairman , i thank the gentleman for yielding to me , and , mr. chairman , i rise in support of the amendment offered by the gentleman from arizona ( mr. flake ) xz4001340 . 
one of the things that the bill did in section 215 was to provide a procedure for challenging a section 215 order . 
what this does is it codifies procedures for challenging the receipt of national security letters , and i think that this is a step in the right direction . 
let me say that a national security letter is never issued to the target of an investigation . 
a place where it would be issued would be to get records that are in the custody of someone who may have information relative to the target of the investigation . 
for example , it appears that one of the people who was involved in the london bombing 2 weeks ago studied at the university of north carolina . 
to get the records of this person 's attendance at the university of north carolina would be a subject of a national security letter . 
now , i do not know whether one has been issued or one has not been , but that is an example of the type of information that the nsls are used for . 
mr. chairman , i think every member of this congress , liberal or conservative , republican or democrat , takes seriously the oath that we took at the beginning of this congress to preserve , protect , and defend the constitution of the united states against all enemies , foreign and domestic . 
the amendment that the gentlewoman from california has introduced is going to make it very difficult to conduct any type of criminal or terrorist investigation using a national security letter because it basically eviscerates the nondisclosure rules that national security letters and literally all other tools in criminal investigations have attached to them . 
and if john doe is really involved in criminal or terrorist activities , that is going to be a tip-off that the feds are on the heels of john and maybe he ought to flee the country or do other things to eliminate the evidence that would be used to convict that person of the crime that he has either committed or a crime that he is in a conspiracy with others to commit . 
let me say that by their very nature national security letters involve our national security , and the national security letters are usually not issued against the targets of investigations but to get records that would establish evidence that could be used against the target of the investigation . 
and if that evidence that was being collected ended up being disclosed and became a matter of discourse in the public press , i do not know how law enforcement would be able to complete its investigation to go after those that are suspected of criminal or terrorist activities . 
because of the nature and threat of terrorism , when there is a tip that is sent to law enforcement , law enforcement is obligated to investigate it . 
so i think that the amendment of the gentlewoman 
mr. chairman , i yield back the balance of my time . 
they found a very sophisticated tunnel , and took a picture of it . 
there were various camera devices and listening devices that the agents put into this tunnel , and they ended up finding that the tunnel had been used to transport 93 pounds of marijuana from canada into the united states . 
this is a picture of the u.s. entrance to the tunnel on our side of the border , very close to canada . 
but on the canadian side of the border the entrance to the tunnel was in a building . 
all this ended up being exposed as a result of a delayed notification warrant . 
mr. chairman , i rise in support of the berman-delahunt amendment . 
at the end of the last decade , before 9/11 and before the patriot act was even considered , the fbi had set up a data-mining operation that went far beyond criminal and intelligence investigations and compromised the privacy of literally millions of americans , and this was done without the knowledge of the congress of the united states , and it was only as a result of the fact that it did not work and they wasted all of this money that the congress found out about it . 
so i think that before any of the agencies go down this route , there ought to be at least a tip-off to the members of congress . 
i grant the members that the amendment probably is not properly drafted and we can fix this in conference , and i appreciate the commitment of the chairman of the permanent select committee on intelligence to do that , but i do not think we should turn it down and send a message to the agencies that they can data mine all they want and we are not going to do anything about it . 
what this amendment does is simply add the following predicates to allow law enforcement to go to a judge to seek a wiretap order : crimes of terrorism such as arson , plastic explosives , attacks on a federal facility with firearms , and conspiracy to harm persons or property overseas . 
i think all of these are legitimate predicates . 
mr. chairman , i yield back the balance of my time . 
when he was testifying on the reauthorization of the patriot act , deputy attorney general james kolbe testified that the first material support for a terrorism case to be tried before a jury involved a group of hezbollah operatives who had been operating a massive interstate cigarette smuggling scheme . 
i would also say that as a result of the modification that the gentleman from north carolina has proposed , there is no longer a question of tribal sovereignty . 
that has been taken care of in the modification . 
so anybody who has read the `` dear colleague '' letter that was sent out earlier today , that is now out of date , and it is about as accurate as last year 's calendar . 
mr. chairman , i rise in support of the amendment and thank the gentlewoman from pennsylvania ( ms. hart ) xz4001680 for yielding to me and for introducing this amendment . 
let me say that this amendment makes important improvements in the financial provisions of the patriot act with regard to those who try to prevent terrorists from financing their operations . 
first of all , i think that trying to disrupt the terrorism operation is a legitimate issue to add to the list of predicate offenses covered under the rico statute . 
mr. chairman , i withdraw my reservation of objection . 
i think people who shine lasers into cockpits of planes should have to face the music with criminal charges whether the planes are carrying passengers or not , and i think the amendment is a good one and ought to be adopted . 
mr. chairman , i support this amendment , and just let me give a little bit of the history of this . 
the gentleman from new york ( mr. sweeney ) xz4003930 is correct that the first responder grants were a part of the original patriot act . 
well , it ended up that the formula had some anomalies , and it ended up being out of date . 
as a result , in the last congress the committee on the judiciary and the select committee on homeland security worked out an agreement where the formula would be modified , where there would be certain floors for states , a lot of the money would be threat-based and the types of grants were consolidated so that there would be a simpler application process . 
by adopting this amendment , we are going to be in a stronger position to actually make the needed changes in the formula law of the united states of america this year without further delay . 
mr. chairman , i yield back the balance of my time . 
the committee on the judiciary has spent a lot of time overseeing the justice department , with oversight letters , questions that the gentleman from michigan ( mr. conyers ) xz4000800 and i have sent jointly to the justice department , inspector general reports , and this is the result of it : almost two feet of responses . 
first of all , there has been no provision , of the 16 sunsetted provisions , that have been found unconstitutional by any federal court in the nation . 
the inspector general 's report has found no civil liberties violations under the patriot act , and i think that the question we ought to ask ourselves today is whether we should weigh the potential for abuse of this law against the actual record of abuse . 
there is no actual record of abuse with all of the oversight that we have been doing . 
thirteen of the 16 provisions are noncontroversial . 
we ought to look at the actual record of abuse . 
only 5 percent of our legislation is sunsetted . 
why sunset legislation where there has been no actual record of abuse and there has been vigorous oversight ? 
mr. speaker , i yield back the balance of my time . 
the lone wolf provision was not passed as a part of the patriot act in october 2001 , but was included as a part of the intelligence bill which was enacted into law a little bit less than a year ago . 
so as a result , the committees and the public have not been able to have as extensive oversight and for as long a period of time as the other 16 provisions that were sunsetted in the act which the president signed in october 2001 . 
so i think it is appropriate to have a sunset on the lone wolf provision simply because we do not have the experience of being able to examine what the justice department has done with this new and expanded authority . 
on the other hand , let me say that we are negotiating with the senate at the present time on what the length of the sunset is , and i think that the sunset on this provision will be longer than 4 years , and the sunset on the other two provisions that were contained in the house-passed bill will be shorter than the 10 years that the house of representatives placed in the bill , which was passed and sent over to the other body . 
having said all of this , i would like to make a couple of points . 
first of all , finding out what a department or an agency of the executive branch is doing is entirely the prerogative of the committee that has the responsibility for the oversight and of its chair . 
i have been extremely vigorous , since the enactment of the patriot act , in doing oversight over what the department of justice has done relative to that law , and i am happy to say that most of the oversight letters that have been sent to the attorney general have been cosigned by the gentleman from michigan ( mr. conyers ) xz4000800 , ranking member of the judiciary committee . 
we have been kind of like tough school marms with the department of justice because when they were late and when they were nonresponsive to the questions , we required the department of justice to come up with responsive answers , and those responsive answers we placed on the committee 's web site so that anybody with internet access could be able to find out what the questions were and what the answers were , with the exception of responses that were classified and which were sent to the intelligence committee rather than to the judiciary committee . 
in addition to the oversight which was done , the original patriot act requires the inspector general of the department of justice to report twice a year to the relevant committees of congress the number of civil liberties violations that have been found against the department of justice as a result of its exercising the increased and new requirements and powers in the patriot act . 
we have received those reports by the inspector general of the department of justice on a regular and on a timely basis , and the answer to how many civil liberties violations have been proven is none . 
further , i resisted a premature repeal or extension of the sunset prior to this congress because i felt it was important that the oversight be done for as long a time as possible so that the congress will be able to look over the shoulder of the department of justice and find out whether or not they were doing it the right way or whether or not they needed a tap on the shoulder from capitol hill for improvements in their methods of operation . 
when we did get to this congress with the oversight being completed and the sunset approaching , i fulfilled the promise that i made to the public and anybody who asked that we would be doing a section-by-section review of the expiring sections of the patriot act . 
there were minority witnesses at all of the hearings except the one where the attorney general and the one where the deputy attorney general appeared to testify . 
there was plenty of time for questions by every member of the committee . 
as a result of all of those hearings , we found that all but two or three sections of the patriot act were essentially noncontroversial . 
nobody was complaining about an abuse of power . 
nobody had proved abuse of power . 
nobody had alleged an abuse of power . 
and as a result , the house-passed bill eliminated the sunsets for those sections of the patriot act for which there was no complaint at these extensive series of hearings , and that is good policy . 
getting rid of the 14 of the 16 sunset provisions that were contained in the original patriot act does not mean that the justice department is not going to have the committee looking over its shoulder . 
we will do that ; but , again , that depends upon the priorities of the committee and the priorities of its chair . 
and as long as i am the chairman of the committee , there will be vigorous oversight of the department of justice , not only on how they are handling the patriot act but how they are handling all of the other laws that the committee has oversight jurisdiction over . 
because the motion to instruct only relates to the lone wolf provision and i believe that because we have had a much shorter period of time in viewing how they have dealt with the lone wolf provision because it was passed 3 years after the original patriot act was enacted into law , i think this motion to instruct is a proper one , although i do think that the difference between 4 years and 7 years still should be negotiated with the senate . 
madam speaker , i reserve the balance of my time . 
because what he is saying is that the results of that oversight and the results of those hearings really do not make any difference when we are dealing with the extension of the patriot act . 
because if you accept the argument that he has made , then the congress should never do oversight because the results of the oversight are not going to make any difference in the policy . 
secondly , of the 16 provisions where law enforcement powers were expanded , there were no allegations of misuse by the justice department in 14 of those 16 provisions . 
now , the way we make sure that there is not government overreaching in our system of government is to give the courts the power to declare unconstitutional overreaching by government agencies . 
the fourth amendment is alive and well , and the supreme court of the united states will never allow the congress or state legislatures to ignore the provisions of the fourth amendment . 
there has been not one of the 16 expanded powers in the patriot act , signed by president bush in october of 2001 , that has been declared unconstitutional . 
there has been no declaration of unconstitutionality of any of those powers . 
but what has been declared unconstitutional was a provision on national security letters that was put in the patriot act as a renumbering , but which was enacted as a result of a bill that originated in the other body in 1986 . 
madam speaker , i reserve the balance of my time . 
madam speaker , i am the author of the sunsets that were put in the patriot act that was signed by the president in october of 2001 because i agreed with what i heard from the gentleman from maryland ( mr. hoyer ) xz4001890 , that we ought to look at what the justice department had done with these expanded powers . 
we have looked at how those expanded powers have been utilized ; and in 14 of the 16 cases , nobody had any complaint about how those expanded powers have been utilized . 
i am proud of the fact that i put the sunsets in almost 4 years ago . 
but what i will say is that we do not sunset a whole host of other programs . 
and i have , i am looking at the federal criminal code and the national security letters that have been complained of by people on the other side of the aisle ; they are not sunsetted . 
the authority for the national security letters was passed in 1986 when , i recall , the current minority party had a significant majority in the house of representatives . 
now , if sunsets were so important when we are dealing with the civil liberties of the people of the united states of america , why did you forget about them 19 years ago ? 
madam speaker , i reserve the balance of my time . 
mr. speaker , i yield myself the balance of my time . 
i would point out that there is a potential for abuse of practically everything law enforcement does . 
there is a tremendous amount of discretion that the law and the constitution have given to our law enforcement personnel , to our prosecutors , to those who apply for search warrants as well as other tools that law enforcement utilizes to keep us safe and to try to track down those who commit crimes or who conspire to commit crimes or acts of terrorism . 
i do not know why there seems to be a greater suspicion that law enforcement already abuses provisions under the patriot act rather than other provisions of law which are not sunset , including the national security letters , because the facts simply are not there that there has been abuse . 
and where there has to be a greater scrutiny on it , such as the two provisions in the house-passed bill and the lone wolf provision that are being talked about , we can talk about future sunsets ; and i support the concept of doing that . 
but simply going around and painting with a broad brush the justice department for the potential of abuse which has not happened , i think , is unfair and does not go to the debate of whether the patriot act has actually served to protect the people of the united states without trampling on their civil liberties . 
mr. speaker , i yield back the balance of my time . 
madam speaker , my staff has prepared for me an opening statement on this bill , and i am going to put the opening statement in the record and not read it , because after listening to the debate on the rule that was just concluded , the amount of misinformation and misleading information that has been placed in the & lt ; /em & gt ; & lt ; em & gt ; congressional record relating to the usa patriot act is just absolutely astounding . 
first of all , let me say that when the original patriot act was enacted in october of 2001 , there were expanded powers that were given to law enforcement in 16 sections , and i was the person that insisted upon a 4-year sunset being placed on each and every one of the powers of law enforcement that were expanded . 
i have heard allegations that have been made on the other side of the aisle that there has been no oversight by the judiciary committee and that we were lacking and that we were negligent in doing the oversight . 
madam speaker , this is the written record of the oversight that has taken place over the last 4 years . 
i would submit that there has been no other provision of current law that has been subjected to as extensive oversight as the judiciary committee has done on a bipartisan basis on the usa patriot act . 
we have done this oversight through letters to the department of justice , usually cosigned by the gentleman from michigan ( mr. conyers ) xz4000800 and myself . 
and when the department of justice has been nonresponsive , we have been like the crabby professors asking them to do it again and again until they get it right and to disclose the information that congress is entitled to . 
those briefings have been open to members of both parties . 
and when we came up to the reauthorization process , i would remind you , madam speaker , and the members of the house of representatives , that i strongly opposed a premature striking of the sunset or extending the sunset in the last congress . 
there were 12 hearings , and i am going to insert into the record the chronology of those hearings and who testified at those hearings , many of whom were witnesses that the minority asked to have testify and who did . 
now , what came out of this ? 
it came out of the testimony , including participation by minority witnesses , that 14 of the 16 sunsetted sections were noncontroversial , and as a result , both the committee and this house and the other body made those sections permanent because there was no need for a sunsetted review . 
and if anybody is interested in going into detail as to what those additional protections consist of , i will be happy to do that at a later time . 
that is also subjected to a 4-year sunset so we can see what happens in terms of how the justice department and law enforcement deals with the issues . 
now , what did all of this oversight disclose ? 
first of all , it disclosed that none of the 16 provisions where law enforcement powers were expanded has been declared unconstitutional by any federal court whatsoever . 
there was a finding of unconstitutionality relative to the national security letters provision of law . 
but the national security letters provision of law was not passed in the patriot act . 
it was passed in 1986 , 15 years before september 11 , in a bill that was written by a member of the other body who has been very critical of this conference report . 
and in the case of the last two matters , the organized crime and racketeering and drug trafficking , the united states supreme court has upheld delayed notification warrants as constitutional and not in violation of the fourth amendment . 
this conference report provides additional civil liberties protection in the area of the business records section , in the area of the delayed notification warrants section , in the area of the roving wiretap section , and in the area of national security letters . 
if it is voted down , all of these protections for civil liberties will go down with this conference report , and we will be back to the existing patriot act under the proposal that has been advocated by my distinguished ranking member from michigan ( mr. conyers ) xz4000800 and members on the other side of the capitol building . 
the patriot act has been a vital tool in the interception and prevention of terrorist activities , and if it is allowed to expire , the first consequence will be that the wall that prevented the cia and the fbi from exchanging intelligence information prior to 9/11 will go back up . 
and if there is one thing the 9/11 commission said repeatedly , it is that the stovepiping of intelligence information between various agencies of the federal government prevented our government from being able to try to connect the dots to see what the terrorists were doing before 3 , 000 people were killed on september 11 , 2001 . 
the consequence of letting the patriot act expire will be a boon to terrorists because they will be able to exploit all of the vulnerabilities in our legal system that allowed them to pull 9/11 off . 
we can not try to get business records of terrorists doing business , whether it is at libraries or elsewhere . 
the second thing is to extend the existing law , whether it is for 3 months , as mr. conyers xz4000800 has proposed , or for a longer period of time , which means that all of the civil liberties protections that i have just described will not be in the law , and they will all be lost . 
now , since the beginning of this country 's history , we have given law enforcement and prosecutors a lot of discretion . 
and anybody who has a lot of discretion , whether it is the attorney general of the united states or the cop on the beat , has the potential of abusing the discretion . 
there has not been an abuse of discretion in the patriot act . 
the inspector general 's reports to congress on abuses of the patriot act that are required by the original law have said that there are none . 
madam speaker , i rise in strong support of the conference report accompanying h.r. 3199 , the `` usa patriot improvement and reauthorization act of 2005. '' in the wake of the attacks of september 11 , 2001 , congressional and independent investigations showed that terrorists exploited historic divisions between the law enforcement and intelligence communities that prevented authorities from `` connecting the dots '' in time to avert the attacks . 
since its enactment , u.s. law enforcement and intelligence authorities have utilized these tools to gain critical knowledge of the intentions of foreign-based terrorists while preempting terrorist threats on our own soil . 
without congressional passage of this conference report , key provisions of the patriot act will no longer be available to our law enforcement on january 1 , 2006 -- two weeks away . 
it is crucial to note at the outset that h.r. 3199 , which passed the house by a vote of 257-171 , and the amendment to this legislation unanimously approved by the other body , underscore bipartisan and bicameral support for core provisions of the patriot act . 
there was broad agreement to make fourteen of the sixteen expiring provisions permanent , and the conference report does so . 
the patriot act breached the `` wall of separation '' between law enforcement and the intelligence community ; the conference report we consider today ensures that it will not be rebuilt . 
it restricts internet and mobile vendor sales of the precursors necessary to produce methamphetamine , enhances criminal penalties for its sale and manufacture , targets large meth kingpins , and enhances tools necessary to stop meth trafficking across the southwest border . 
when the house judiciary committee unanimously reported the patriot act in october of 2001 , i pledged to rigorously examine its implementation to ensure that new law enforcement authorities did not transgress civil liberties . 
h.r. 3199 , which passed the house by a wide margin on july 21 , 2005 , reflected bipartisan congressional consideration consisting of legislative and oversight hearings , inspector general reports , briefings , and committee correspondence . 
this extensive record , a chronology of which i ask unanimous consent to submit for the record , has demonstrated that the patriot act is an effective tool against terrorists and other criminals . 
of no less importance , the record shows that there is absolutely no evidence that the act has been used to violate civil liberties . 
however , to curtail the potential of government overreach , the conference report contains important amendments and revisions . 
specifically , the conference report contains additional judicial and congressional oversight of the use of multipoint wiretapping authority contained in section 206 of the patriot act . 
the conference report also clarifies and refines the use of delayed notice search warrants in section 213 of the legislation . 
it ensures that information likely to be obtained through section 215 of the patriot act are subject to a judicial review process that authorizes the judge to set aside or affirm a 215 order that has been challenged . 
the conference report establishes additional requirements on the utilization of national security letters , including congressional disclosure of the frequency of their use , and enhances congressional oversight of electronic and other types of surveillance . 
many of these changes were requested by minority conferees , and the absence of any of their signatures on this vital conference report is disappointing . 
i also regret to note that in many ways , the bipartisanship that characterized passage of the patriot act in 2001 has yielded to the desire of some to engage in political hyperbole and partisan brinksmanship . 
madam speaker , the security of the american people is a fundamental responsibility of congress and an obligation that each of us swears an obligation to uphold . 
i urge my house colleagues to support passage of this critical antiterrorism initiative and encourage the other body to send the conference report to the president for his signature before vital antiterrorism provisions contained in the patriot act expire at year 's end . 
i wish to recognize the important contributions of the following staff who spent much of the last several months working on this historic legislation . 
from the department of justice , william moschella , elisabeth cook , jim baker , matthew berry , and david blake . 
madam speaker , i provide for the record the following document , which is a detailed listing of oversight hearings held on the usa patriot act : oversight of the usa patriot act from october , 2001 , to november , 2005 ( 1 ) november 9 , 2005 , department of justice classified briefing for committee on the judiciary staff on press accounts of fbi use of nsls ; ( 2 ) october 25 , 2005 , department of justice classified briefing for house & amp ; senate committees on the judiciary and committees on intelligence staff on press accounts of fbi use of nsls ; ( 3 ) october 6 , 2005 , department of justice classified briefing for committee on the judiciary members and staff on press accounts of mistakes in fbi applications to the foreign intelligence surveillance court under the usa patriot act ; ( 4 ) july 12 , 2005 , letter from assistant attorney general william moschella to the house committee on the judiciary responding to july 1 , 2005 , letter regarding use of the usa patriot act ; ( 5 ) july 12 , 2005 , letter from assistant attorney general william moschella to the house committee on the judiciary responding to may 19 , 2005 , letter regarding use of the usa patriot act ; ( 6 ) july 11 , 2005 , letter from assistant attorney general william moschella to rep .

madam speaker , i reserve the balance of my time . 
madam speaker , i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from michigan ( mr. hoekstra ) xz4001820 , the distinguish chairman of the intelligence committee . 
madam speaker , the issue of national security letters was not in the patriot act that was enacted in 2001 . 
this conference report puts procedural safeguards into national security letters even though they are not a part of the patriot act that was passed in 2001 . 
it permits disclosure of nsls to legal counsel and those necessary to comply with the letter . 
it creates explicit access to judicial review of the government 's request for records . 
it permits judicial review of the nondisclosure requirement . 
it creates a 5-year felony criminal penalty for unauthorized disclosures of nsls with intent to obstruct an investigation or judicial proceeding , just like the obstruction of justice statute . 
it requires the doj inspector general to conduct two audits of the fbi 's use of national security letters . 
it requires the attorney general and the director of national intelligence to submit to congress a report on the feasibility of applying minimization procedures to nsl to ensure the protection of constitutional rights of united states persons , and it requires an annual public reporting on national security letters , including the aggregate number of requests made by the justice department for information concerning different u.s. persons . 
if the argument that has been advanced by the gentleman from new york succeeds , all of the protections i have just described go down the drain with the rest of the bill . 
madam speaker , i reserve the balance of my time . 
madam speaker , i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from ohio ( mr. chabot ) xz4000710 , the distinguished chairman of the subcommittee on the constitution . 
it permits extensions of up to 90 days unless the facts justify a later date and only upon the showing of need . 
and it has new reporting requirements on the use of delayed notification warrants . 
the delayed notification was determined it could be for a long period of time by a magistrate judge , a judicial officer , not by law enforcement , but by a judicial officer in determining when the notification would take place . 
it is limitations on how long a magistrate judge , a judicial officer , can delay notification of the warrants . 
with respect to section 215 , i wish that the library association had read it , because it requires the statement of facts in an application to the court that issues the 215 order to show reasonable grounds to believe that the records are relevant to an authorized investigation . 
then it creates a presumption in favor of records that pertain to a foreign power or an agent of a foreign power , activities of a suspected foreign power who is the subject of an authorized investigation , or an individual in contact with or known to a suspected agent of a foreign power who is the subject of an authorized investigation . 
now , all of these people are presumably bad folks that want to commit a terrorist attack , and i do not think we should make the libraries or any other place off limits to an investigation to try to see who is trying to blow innocent people up . 
madam speaker , i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from indiana ( mr. souder ) xz4003850 , who is the author of the methamphetamine section of this bill . 
madam speaker , i yield myself the balance of my time . 
that means that there will be no provisions relative to control of methamphetamine . 
the inspector general 's audits that are contained in the conference report will not go to the president , and the minimization procedures to get rid of extraneous material that might come into the presence of the government will also not be in the bill that goes to the president . 
listening to the litany that has come from the gentleman from michigan and folks on the other side of the aisle , you would think that halloween is tomorrow , because there is an attempt to scare the american public . 
the patriot act had nothing to do with the detention of immigrants , indefinite intentions , invasion of habeas corpus , writs of assistance and warrantless wiretaps . 
the brandon mayfield case which has been cited by others on the other side of the aisle was relating not to the patriot act but a mistake in fingerprint identification . 
that is irresponsible , as are most of their arguments . 
madam speaker , i yield back the balance of my time . 
i offer a thanks to the gentleman from wisconsin ( mr. sensenbrenner ) xz4003650 , chairman of the committee on the judiciary , and the gentleman from california ( mr. dreier ) xz4001150 , chairman of the committee on rules , who made in order my request for an amendment . 
mr. chairman , the patriot act currently makes it a federal crime to interfere with any person operating a mass transportation vehicle with the intent to endanger any passenger or with a reckless disregard for the safety of human life . 
the consequences of this oversight were recently exposed by a widely reported new jersey laser beam incident . 
on two separate occasions , an individual directed a laser beam at the cockpit of a small passenger airplane and at a port authority police department helicopter . 
pilots nationwide increasingly are reporting laser-beam interference during landing approaches , and although no reports have been terrorist-related to date , there is evidence that terrorists are exploring the use of similar laser tactics as weapons . 
regardless of intent , we must communicate to the public that aircraft interference of any kind is unacceptable and will not be tolerated . 
just as it is entirely unacceptable to interfere with the pilot of a passenger aircraft , it is equally unacceptable to interfere with a pilot of a government or private aircraft . 
additionally , this amendment would ensure the protection of everyone engaged in the operation of an aircraft from those in the air to those navigating on the ground . 
mr. chairman , reclaiming my time , i appreciate the kind words of the gentleman from wisconsin and also his words about the need for this body to adopt this amendment . 
mr. chairman , we owe it to the pilots to offer them every extension of protection possible , and i am asking all of my colleagues to protect aviation in america by supporting this amendment . 
mr. chairman , i reserve the balance of my time . 
mr. chairman , i want to thank the gentlewoman from california for not only her words in support of this amendment but also thank this body for carefully looking at the provisions and amendments adding to this patriot act to help keep america safe . 
i am very proud of this product that we are working on . 
mr. chairman , i yield back the balance of my time . 
the strategy that we used to have of containment , react and mutually assured destruction went out the window on 9/11 . 
we can have more people , dogs , cameras , lights , we can do a lot of things to help , but we can not stop it unless we have the tools . 
and , it creates several new federal crimes , such as laws outlawing terrorists ' attacks on mass transit and increases penalties for many other violations of the law . 
as is true of any law that empowers the government to collect security-related information domestically , evaluating the patriot act requires us to weigh a wide range of competing interests , like the ability of our government to detect and thwart terrorist attacks and the constitutional rights of the american people . 
of course , proper oversight of the patriot act by congress is essential to guaranteeing our constitutional rights are not trampled . 
important for missouri , the patriot act conference report also includes bipartisan language that helps fight the scourge of methamphetamine abuse in america . 
the bill bans over-the-counter sales of cold medicines that contain ingredients commonly used to make methamphetamine , allowing the sale only from locked cabinets or behind the counter . 
it limits the monthly amount any individual could purchase , requires individuals to present photo identification in order to purchase such medicines , and requires stores to keep personal information about these customers for at least 2 years after the purchase of these medicines . 
i urge my colleagues to support reauthorization of the patriot act . 
mr. speaker , i rise today in defense of nothing less than our national security , but national security is not just about protecting our borders . 
all of my colleagues understand that the patriot act has provided the law enforcement agencies with many valuable tools which facilitate their work in the struggle against terrorism . 
but with these new tools comes a very real danger that the liberty we seek to protect could be easily compromised in the overzealous pursuit of greater security . 
this struggle strikes at the heart of the debate over the legislation before us today . 
and while the restrictive rule we are debating this morning has allowed us to improve the patriot act in several important ways , the leadership has chosen to prohibit open debate in consideration of the most sensitive , controversial , and important issues that surround this bill . 
it is ironic that on consideration of a bill which seeks to protect our freedoms , our freedom to debate and amend the legislation has been strictly curtailed , as is too often the case in this body . 
mr. speaker , when the patriot act was passed in 2001 , 16 provisions were set to expire in 5 years because some of them could possibly be used to violate the very freedoms our young men and women in uniform too often die to protect . 
these provisions provide the executive branch of this government with unprecedented powers of search , seizure and surveillance , too often without the due process we are guaranteed under our constitution . 
by party line votes , the republicans on the committee on rules at the direction of the leadership refused to allow consideration of critical amendments that address these issues , and there are four particular issues i want to discuss this morning , reforms which democrats believe are critical . 
second is the fact that the important work of the permanent select committee on intelligence was cast aside by the house leadership . 
the version of the bill voted out of the committee on a near unanimous vote in that committee included a provision which allowed for a sunset review of the lone wolf provision of this bill , which was not included in the final version . 
but perhaps most importantly , we are not even allowed to consider an amendment that would require congress to do its job and fulfill our responsibility to the american people by going back and taking a look at these laws every few years because the leadership decided that none of them can be considered today by the congress , even though they deal with the most sensitive and important security and civil liberty issues we face in this country today . 
the chairman of the committee on the judiciary stated last night in the committee on rules that sunset review is not necessary in the future because he and his staff are providing all the oversight needed of the justice department , the fbi , and the patriot act . 
with all due respect to the esteemed chairman , i do not think that is enough of a safeguard for the american people to accept in this case . 
after all , we will not have the benefit of his leadership and wisdom forever , and this congress has a duty to consider and provide for the future . 
our ability to ensure the proper oversight and protection of liberty must be larger in scope than the career or judgment of a single individual . 
the chairman has even acknowledged that the justice department has been uncooperative in his attempts to conduct the appropriate reviews and oversight of the bill thus far . 
we have evidence which suggests , in contrast to information coming out of the justice department , that many of these measures have resulted in the violation of the civil liberties of american citizens . 
in addition , we understand that some of the extended search and seizure powers used by the law enforcement are apparently not being used for their intended purpose , which is strictly to fight terrorism , and that is unacceptable . 
the idea of these measures was always that they would be temporary , and yet they are seeking to make them last forever . 
we would do well to remember that they were passed into law in the frantic weeks after september 11 , hastily , without our understanding of their potential impact or benefit , and that is why we created a sunset review in the first place and why we need a sunset review as long as these incredible powers are in place . 
mr. speaker , i reserve the balance of my time . 
mr. speaker , i yield 3 1/2 minutes to the gentleman from massachusetts ( mr. mcgovern ) xz4002630 , a member of the rules committee . 
mr. speaker , i am pleased to yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from california ( ms. matsui ) xz4006631 , a member of the rules committee . 
mr. speaker , i yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from california ( ms. harman ) xz4001660 , the ranking member of the permanent select committee on intelligence . 
mr. speaker , i am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from mississippi ( mr. thompson ) xz4004021 , the ranking member of the committee on homeland security . 
mr. speaker , i am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from california ( ms. woolsey ) xz4004360 , the head of the progressive caucus . 
mr. speaker , i yield myself the balance of my time . 
this amendment would exclude booksellers and libraries from the scope of section 215 of the patriot act , which allows law enforcement to conduct broad searches of the records of bookstores and libraries without demonstrating probable cause , and it forbids libraries and bookstore owners from even telling their patrons that their records have been searched . 
mr. speaker , an identical version of this amendment was passed in the house a month ago during consideration of the science , state , justice , and commerce appropriations bill . 
by a substantial vote of 238 to 187 , the members of this body expressed their support for the provisions of the sanders amendment . 
it is clear that the patriot act 's provisions on the search of library and bookstore records are overly broad and undermine our basic constitutional rights . 
for the sake of civil liberties and the privacy rights of our fellow citizens , this house needs to debate the sanders amendment . 
mr. speaker , i ask unanimous consent to print the text of the amendment immediately prior to the vote on the previous question . 
mr. speaker , i yield back the balance of my time . 
mr. speaker , i object to the vote on the ground that a quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not present . 
mr. chairman , i strongly support the usa patriot act of 2005 . 
the continued threat of a terrorist attack in the united states and this month 's terrorist attacks in london remind us of the need to prevent , investigate , and prosecute all terrorist acts . 
it passed by a margin of 98-1 in the senate and by a margin of 357-66 in the house . 
even the american civil liberties union last april said , `` most of the voluminous patriot act is actually unobjectionable from a civil liberties point of view . 
the law makes important changes that give law enforcement agents the tools they need to protect against terrorist attacks. '' many of the tools of the act provided to law enforcement officials have been used for decades to fight organized crime and drug dealers . 
america is a safer country today than before september 11 because of the patriot act . 
giving the department of justice , the central intelligence agency , and the fbi information-sharing powers enabled law enforcement officials to disrupt terrorist cells in new york , oregon , florida , and virginia . 
first , we are revisiting an issue that we just covered in the flake/delahunt/otter/nadler amendment -- protections for recipients of a national security letter , which is an administrative subpoena used in terrorism investigations or in covert intelligence activities . 
current laws prohibit the recipient of a national security letter from disclosing the fact that they received it . 
while i understand the motive behind not punishing mentally incompetent individuals or those under duress , the law already allows for that through the use of an affirmative defense . 
mr. chairman , i yield back the balance of my time . 
this conference report helps law enforcement officials prevent , investigate , and prosecute acts of terror . 
it passed by a margin of 98-1 in the senate and 357-66 in the house . 
but certain provisions of the patriot act expire at the end of this year . 
this conference report renews many of those provisions and improves on the original legislation . 
it makes permanent the ability of law enforcement officials and intelligence officials to communicate about on-going investigations . 
america is a safer country today than before september 11 , 2001 , because of the patriot act . 
over 200 people in the united states have been charged with crimes tied to international terrorist investigations and have been convicted or have pled guilty because of the patriot act . 
patriot act -- the most important domestic security legislation since september 11 , 2001 -- will be re-enacted in slightly weakened form or allowed to lapse in a number of its key provisions . 
since the consequences of the latter would be manifestly detrimental to the war for the free world , legislators opposed to the act have offered to extend it for a short period -- a gambit they hope will allow them to dumb it down still further . 
they tend to characterize the act as an assault on the basic freedoms enshrined in the bill of rights and have sought far-reaching changes in the tools it provides law enforcement to detect and prevent terrorist plots inside the united states . 
in reality , the patriot act is an eminently sensible overhaul of the government 's antiquated counterterror arsenal , an overhaul that reflects the realization we can not hope to fight a 21st-century war using 20th-century legal instruments . 
consider two elements critics have most insistently demanded be repealed : ( 1 ) the socalled `` library records '' provision ( section 215 ) and ( 2 ) the authorization of what have been derided as `` sneak-and-peek '' search warrants ( sec . 
the patriot act only made business records ( including those of libraries ) available on roughly the same terms in national security cases as they have long been in criminal cases . 
in fact , as we now know , many of the september 11 hijackers used american and european libraries to prepare the run-up to the attacks . 
relevant literature , including bomb manuals and jihadist materials , have been staples of terrorism prosecutions for more than a decade . 
privacy extremists of organizations like the american civil liberties union ( aclu ) nevertheless have reacted to the patriot act 's much-needed business records law as if the gestapo had seized office in the united states . 
it does , however , allow agents to search premises but delay notification of the search to subjects of a terrorism investigation . 
in such situations , notification of the target has routinely been delayed for weeks or months after the eavesdropping ends . 
doing so can be absolutely critical to the arrest and prosecution of suspected perpetrators : delayed notification allows the government to complete its investigation without giving the subjects a heads-up that would certainly cause them to flee or destroy evidence . 
previously , a hodgepodge of different rules were applied in various jurisdictions . 
this is precisely the sort of fairness and equal protection congress should provide -- yet , it has been criticized sharply for doing so in the patriot act . 
on both the business records and delayed notification sections of the patriot act ( among others ) , the stance of the american civil liberties union and like-minded critics seems to have an ulterior motive . 
they appear intent on reopening settled case law on use of these authorities on crimes unrelated to terror . 
the original patriot act as a whole infringed only modestly on our civil liberties and did not meaningfully intrude on the privacy rights of law-abiding americans . 
we need to keep in mind , moreover , that if its precautions fail to prevent some future terrorist attack , we are likely to see impassioned demands for greater security measures at the expense of our freedoms . 
since few , if any of us relish that prospect , we need to ensure the patriot act retains its core provisions and authorities -- and remains an effective tool for securing the home front in the war for the free world . 
mr. chairman , i thank the distinguished chairman of the committee on international relations for yielding me this time and for his continued leadership on narcotics issues as we tackle these questions at the international level . 
the preceding speaker said that some of these amounts might be fairly small . 
it probably was not a truckload of hashish . 
it may not have been a big thing , but there are a lot of people dead . 
the link between narcotics and terrorism is growing , as the distinguish chairman pointed out ; and we have heard the same thing in the drug policy subcommittee , and that is anywhere from slightly below half to slightly over half of the major terrorist organizations in the world are funded by drugs , most likely heroin and hashish , but also cocaine . 
we have had multiple efforts around the world where we see some of these terrorist organizations starting to interact with each other . 
as they start to interconnect , we need laws that can address this , and i commend the chairman from the committee on international relations with trying to address this rapidly growing threat in all regions of the world . 
i urge this congress to send a strong message that this needs to be part of the patriot act as we look at the international efforts and the international connection in the funding of terrorism . 
mr. speaker , i rise in support of the patriot act and , in particular , title vii of that report , the combat methamphetamine epidemic act of 2005 . 
this is certainly the biggest , and last night we passed chairman boehlert and congressman gordon 's environmental meth bill , but this is the biggest comprehensive bill on meth that we have ever had in front of the united states congress , and it is important that we pass this . 
i want to thank a number of people . 
it is impossible to thank everybody who has been involved in this , but i would like to thank chairman sensenbrenner of the judiciary committee for his co-sponsorship and his willingness to put this in a conference report . 
if we did not have this in a conference report , it would not see the light of day . 
i thank chairman sensenbrenner ; also majority leader roy blunt , who has been an early leader in this charge ; chairman barton of the energy and commerce committee for his willingness to have this i would also thank the several members who have worked so hard to make this comprehensive anti-meth legislation happen . 
in particular , i would like to thank representatives mark kennedy , darlene hooley of oregon , dave reichert and john peterson , because they provided much of the content of this comprehensive bill and their consistently strong leadership on the house floor . 
i would also like to thank the four co-chairmen of the congressional meth caucus , congressmen larsen , calvert , boswell and cannon , for their staffs ' assistance in putting this together so we could have a bipartisan effort . 
congressman tom osborne has crusaded on this house floor and across the country on behalf of anti-meth legislation , as has congressmen baird , wamp , boozman , king , gordon and so many others . 
mr. speaker , i rise in support of the conference report to h.r. 3199 , the usa patriot and terrorism prevention reauthorization act of 2005 , and in particular of title vii of that report , the combat methamphetamine epidemic act of 2005 . 
i believe this bipartisan legislation is a vital first step in our renewed fight against the scourge of methamphetamine trafficking and abuse , and i hope the house will support its passage . 
i would probably take an hour if i tried to thank each of the members and staff who helped with this legislation , so i will have to mention only a few . 
first , i 'd very much like to thank chairman sensenbrenner of the judiciary committee for his cosponsorship of the methamphetamine epidemic elimination act , h.r. 3889 , one of the two bills that was incorporated into today 's legislation , and for his leadership in ensuring that anti-meth legislation would be added to the conference report . 
i would also like to thank majority leader roy blunt , chairman barton of the energy and commerce committee , chairman hyde of the international relations committee , chairman young of the transportation and infrastructure committee , chairman i would also like to thank several members who worked so hard to make comprehensive anti-meth legislation happen . 
in particular , i 'd like to thank representative mark kennedy , representative darlene hooley , representative dave reichert , and representative john peterson for providing much of the content of this bill , and for their consistently strong leadership on the house floor on meth issues . 
i would also like to thank the four co-chairmen of the congressional meth caucus , representative rick larsen , representative ken calvert , representative leonard boswell , and representative chris cannon , for their and their staffs ' assistance and support . 
and to every other member who has cosponsored either h.r. 3889 , or the other major bill incorporated in this conference report , the combat meth act of 2005 , h.r. 314 , i express my deep appreciation . 
i do n't have to tell any of you how serious a threat meth is for our communities ; pick up almost any newspaper or magazine these days and you can read about it firsthand . 
as chairman of the government reform committee 's subcommittee on criminal justice , drug policy and human resources , i have held 11 hearings on the meth epidemic since 2001 , not only in washington , dc , but in places as diverse as rural arkansas , ohio , oregon , and indiana , suburban minnesota , island of hawaii , and urban detroit . 
there are regional and local variations on the problem , of course , but one thing remains constant everywhere : this is a drug almost unique in its combination of cheapness , ease of manufacture , and devastating impact on the user and his or her community . 
there are three aspects of the meth epidemic that i believe need to be emphasized as congress prepares to enact this legislation . 
the small , clandestine meth labs that have spread like wildfire across our nation produce toxic chemical byproducts that endanger officers ' lives , tie up law enforcement resources for hours or even days , and cost tremendous amounts of money to clean up . 
that , combined with the rise in criminal behavior , child and citizen endangerment , and other effects , have made meth the number one drug problem for the nation 's local law enforcement agencies , according to a study released over the summer by the national association of counties . 
another survey by the national association of counties found that 40 percent of child welfare agencies reported an increase in `` out of home placements because of meth in the past year. '' this abuse unfortunately includes physical and mental trauma , and even sexual abuse . 
sixty-nine percent of county social service agencies have indicated that they have had to provide additional , specialized training for their welfare system workers and have had to develop new and special protocols for workers to address the special needs of the children affected by methamphetamine . 
community health and human services , as well as child welfare services such as foster-care , are being overwhelmed as a result of meth . 
three-quarters or more of our nation 's meth supply is controlled by those large organizations , and over half of our meth comes directly from mexico . 
the combat methamphetamine epidemic act will be the first legislation enacted by congress that addresses all three of these critical aspects . 
previous acts of congress have addressed meth production and precursor chemical diversion , while others have provided assistance to state and local agencies ; for the first time , however , we are tackling domestic and international chemical diversion , assistance to state and local agencies , child and family welfare issues , and the criminal production of meth . 
the conference committee has filed a detailed section-by-section analysis of the legislation , so i will only briefly mention the highlights of this bill . 
and sign a logbook ; and require training of all employees handling the products ; close a number of loopholes in existing import , export , and wholesale regulations of meth precursor chemicals , including import and manufacturing quotas to ensure no oversupply leads to diversion ; and regulation of the wholesale `` spot market '' ; require reporting of major meth precursor exporters and importers , and would hold them accountable for their efforts to prevent diversion to meth production ; toughen federal penalties against meth traffickers and smugglers ; authorize the `` meth hot spots '' program , as well as increase funding for drug courts , drug endangered children programs , and programs to assist pregnant women addicted to meth . 
each of these steps is vital to our success in the fight against meth , and i hope that the house will support them . 
of all the many members of congress who worked on this legislation , no one got everything he or she wanted . 
every one of us , republican or democrat , urban or rural , has a stake in the outcome of that fight . 
madam speaker , i thank the chairman for his cosponsorship and his leadership in making sure that this meth bill can pass this bill in the form of passing a conference report , which is the only real way to get this done . 
eighteen of the 40 major organizations that are involved in terrorism also deal in narcotics . 
it will require all pseudoephedrine and ephedrine products to be stored behind the counter or in a locked cabinet ; impose a daily and monthly purchase limit ; require purchasers to show id and sign a logbook ; and require training of all employees handling the product . 
it closes a number of loopholes in existing import , export , and wholesale regulations of meth precursor chemicals , including import and manufacturing quotas to ensure no oversupply leads to diversion ; and regulation of the wholesale `` spot market. '' it requires reporting of major meth precursor exporters and importers . 
this is our best chance to really get ahead of this epidemic that swept from asia to hawaii to california , the northwest to the plains , to the great lake states , is headed into the east and is into north carolina , south carolina , pennsylvania , and new york and headed to the atlantic ocean . 
this is our attempt , a massive coordinated multicommittee that took many chairmen to do this , senators talent and feinstein of the senate to do this . 
i thank chairman sensenbrenner , i thank the leadership , because this is a big day for those of us who have been fighting the anti-meth cause . 
using the patriot act over the last four years , the bush administration has monitored meetings of citizens who dare to criticize their government . 
if this is the price of security , now is a fair time to ask : what security have we gained ? 
the terrorist who mailed anthrax to the u.s. capitol and shut down a senate office building for two weeks is still at large , but a university of connecticut graduate student who studies anthrax in petri dishes was charged with bioterrorism . 
i am proud to represent one of the most diverse congressional districts in the country . 
the people of the 13th district know that your ethnicity , religion or country of origin is not indicative of your commitment to community -- or anything else , for that matter . 
i stand with them in support of those actions . 
mr. chairman , searching my constituents ' homes and not telling them , collecting information about what they read , and tracking their e-mail and web usage is a war on liberty to create a false sense of security . 
to paraphrase one of our founding fathers , ben franklin , the nation that sacrifices liberty for security deserves neither . 
for example , the formerly bedrock principle that government can not spy on you unless it provides strong evidence of wrongdoing to a judge no longer exists in america . 
madam speaker , there is no room for compromise in the bill of rights . 
with 30 , 000 of these national security letters going out every year , up from 300 before the patriot act was enacted , this is much more than just an academic argument . 
while no amount of success in the war on terror could justify the patriot act , it is especially tragic that we have little to show for 5 years of police-state tactics . 
in other words , the war on terrorism is just an irrelevant excuse for the expanded power of government to find out what books you buy , send undercover agents to your community group meetings , or search your home without a warrant . 
the patriot act is a war on liberty to create a false sense of security . 
mr. chairman , i thank the distinguished chairman of the full committee for yielding me this time , and i thank the gentleman from north carolina ( mr. coble ) xz4000760 for his help here . 
i rise , obviously , in support of the coble-schiff-forbes amendment and in favor of the underlying bill . 
it also includes three provisions from my bill , h.r. 785 , the cargo theft bill ; and it is an issue that i have been concerned about for over 2 years , so i am very pleased that it is part of the bill . 
so the authors of this amendment are to be commended . 
last , this amendment includes a provision requiring the attorney general to mandate the reporting of cargo thefts and to create a database containing this information , which will provide a valuable source of information and will allow states and local law enforcement officials to coordinate reports of cargo theft . 
i rise today in support of the coble/schiff/forbes amendment , and in favor of the underlying bill . 
it is a problem that affects our entire country , costs tens of billions of dollars each year , and demands a federal response . 
we know that terrorists can make a lot of money stealing and selling cargo , not to mention the fact that terrorists have a proven record of using trucks to either smuggle weapons of mass destruction or as an instrument of delivery . 
many of the industries involved in delivering cargo : trucking , shipping , and businesses -- are genuinely concerned about how security gaps expose cargo to terrorism . 
and last , this amendment includes a provision requiring the attorney general to mandate the reporting of cargo thefts , and to create a database containing this information . 
this database will provide a valuable source of information that would allow state and local law enforcement officials to coordinate reports of cargo theft . 
mr. chairman , i rise in strong support of this amendment and want to thank my good friend and colleague , the gentlewoman from new york ( mrs. lowey ) xz4002460 . 
we have worked on a number of things , including this , for quite some time . 
that legislation , i am happy to say , has since been supported overwhelmingly by the 9/11 commission , the president , and the secretary of the department of homeland security . 
we passed an amendment by house vote of 409 to 10 as part of the authorizing language for department of homeland security . 
simply , what this is , and this is not a geographic vote , this is not a political-philosophical vote , it simply says the department of homeland secretary and the secretary of that department ought to have the resources and ought to have the flexibility to direct federal resources where they belong , to direct federal resources where the threats exist . 
so if it is in the subway systems or the rail systems or the aviation system or some other system that the threat actually exists , the secretary will have the capacity and the tools to indeed take all of the resources that we have as a nation to protect ourselves . 
it is the highest order of duty here in this body . 
the gentlewoman from new york ( mrs. lowey ) xz4002460 and i have worked on this now for a number of years , and i am thrilled we are offering it here . 
my suspicion is it is going to be accepted here and made part of the patriot act . 
the reason it is part of the patriot act is the original formula , the current formula that we operate under , was part of the original patriot act bill that was passed . 
at that time , we could not have anticipated all of the things we now know to be true as a body . 
mr. chairman , i yield back the balance of my time . 
frederick douglass once said , `` the life of a nation is secure only while the nation is honest , truthful and virtuous. '' i have heard a lot of comments the last few weeks from folks saying this bill is needed for the war on terrorism . 
the bill today is about eliminating the sunsets of a handful of provisions in the patriot act and the 9/11 bill . 
some of these provisions are untested and we do not know how helpful they are because the president has not provided information . 
how good of a terrorism fighting tool is it if it has not been part of our war on terror yet ? 
i am disappointed that our colleagues on the other side of the aisle refused to allow an amendment offered to extend the sunsets for a few years . 
madam speaker , i am opposed to the reauthorization of the patriot act . 
first , i do not believe many of the so-called law enforcement tools will make us any safer . 
i am probably one of a few members of congress who has been spied on by his own government . 
i might add that none of us did anything illegal other than just convene and talk about how we would change our state . 
nothing good will come from many of the tools in the patriot act , and i fear that it will lead to more misuse of power . 
the ?9/11 commission members recently said that if the house funding measures were passed , congress would have received an a grade instead of an f on fulfilling its recommendation . 
we must focus our scarce homeland security resources on areas that are most at risk of terrorist attack . 
mr. chairman , i think we can meet some of the concerns expressed so far without adopting this amendment . 
there is a lot of individual information somewhere in the country in little pieces . 
it is looking at various databases and coming up with the relevant pieces of information and helping us to form a picture about what really happens . 
there has been some misunderstanding and i think some undue controversy about that for we will never get all those pieces of information together without these tools that help us do so . 
maybe there are some protections that we can come up with that help address the concerns of the chairman of the committee on the judiciary , but i think to simply add more reporting requirements and have these people filling out more paperwork when they really ought to be figuring out who the terrorists are and what they are up to is a misuse of their time . 
it will sunset so we can see if there were any violations of civil liberties during the time it was in effect , which will be approximately 4 years by the end of this year . 
however , we have no violations of civil liberties under the patriot act . 
of those 7 , 000 allegations , some were under other parts of the law , but none under the patriot act . 
so what we are talking about in this bill is sort of splitting hairs . 
there is judicial oversight for almost everything involved in the patriot act with few exceptions , like national security letters , which does require a certification of relevance before they move forward . 
we use these tools in the patriot act so we can catch terrorists and prevent acts of violence against american citizens . 
we use these same tools in other parts of the law , like when we are trying to find patent infringement , when we are trying to catch organized criminals , when we are trying to stop drug trafficking . 
as a former state attorney general , i fully understand the need to balance the security of our nation and the liberties of our citizens . 
the gravity of the situation is not lost on me , or any of my colleagues in this chamber . 
on october 24 , 2001 , a justified sense of urgency resulted in an unjustifiably rushed vote on the patriot act . 
many members had outstanding questions about the bill , which the rules committee put in place of another bill that had been passed by the judiciary committee . 
in the years since that bill passed , over 374 cities , towns , and counties in 43 states have passed resolutions expressing concern about the patriot act or an extension of it . 
i have received over 3 , 000 letters and emails from constituents on this issue , and i have met with hundreds of constituents in my district to discuss the patriot act in town hall meetings . 
i have found that americans of all stripes share my concerns about the act . 
the long awaited house floor debate of this bill has arrived . 
many of my colleagues and i are eager to make some commonsense changes to this law , and to bring to light our concerns . 
unfortunately , the bill before us today is just more of the same . 
all but two of the expiring provisions are made permanent , and 10-year sunsets are applied to sections 206 and 215 , the roving wiretaps provision and the `` library provision , '' respectively . 
all amendments brought to the rules committee that would have shortened the sunset period , so that congress could continue to conduct important oversight and review of this legislation , were not allowed a vote on the floor . 
i brought two amendments to the rules committee , both of which were rejected . 
this section grants law enforcement authorities unprecedented powers to search , or order the search of , library and bookstore records without probable cause or the need for search warrants . 
i must also express my grave concern about a section of the bill that was not given a sunset , and thus has not been given the debate that i believe it deserves . 
mr. chairman , i will vote against this bill today not because i oppose the patriot act in its entirety , but because i do not believe this bill represents the will of the people or their representatives . 
i think that if we were allowed a vote on an amendment to section 215 , for example , a majority of members would probably support it . 
as a former federal prosecutor and new mexico 's attorney general , i am familiar with both the needs of law enforcement to pursue suspects and a strong supporter of law enforcement . 
i am also a strong supporter of civil liberties and believe that our constitution must be guarded against encroachment even in the name of security . 
on october 24 , 2001 , a justified sense of urgency resulted in an unjustifiably rushed vote on the patriot act . 
many of us had little time to study the bill which became law . 
a bipartisan bill was junked by the majority 's rules committee in the middle of the night . 
i have received thousands of letters from americans worried about excessive government power without judicial oversight . 
however , the conference report is more of the same . 
it extends for 4 years two of the most controversial provisions of the bill , including the section granting law enforcement authorities unprecedented powers to search library and bookstore records without probable cause or the need for search warrants . 
this bill also makes permanent 14 provisions of the patriot act that were set to expire this year . 
national security letters are out of control , with no meaningful oversight . 
i will vote against this bill today , not because i oppose the patriot act in its entirety but because i believe that the needs of law enforcement can be met without eroding our liberties . 
mr. chairman , i rise to explain my decision to vote against this version of the patriot act . 
some of the provisions that are being reauthorized in this bill provide law enforcement officials with important tools that may be helpful in detecting and disrupting terrorist activities . 
other provisions , however , fail to provide adequate safeguards to ensure that the privacy rights of innocent citizens are protected . 
we can ensure that the government has the necessary surveillance powers without sacrificing the privacy rights in the aftermath of september 11 , 2001 , it is essential that we strengthen our ability to detect , deter , and disrupt terrorist activities . 
other provisions , however , leave citizens vulnerable to unchecked , unwarranted , and potentially abusive invasions of privacy . 
i am hopeful that the senate will address these shortcomings in the house bill so that , at the end of the day , we can enact a balanced bill that protects both our security and the rights and liberties we seek to secure . 
i look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues -- both democrats and republicans -- to develop a bill of which we can all be proud and which can be a true testament to american patriots and to the constitution we all seek to uphold and defend . 
some of the provisions that are being authorized in this bill provide law enforcement officials with important tools that may be helpful in detecting and disrupting terrorist activities . 
other provisions , however , fail to provide adequate safeguards to ensure that the privacy rights of innocent citizens are protected . 
we can ensure that the government has the necessary surveillance powers without sacrificing the privacy rights of americans . 
in the aftermath of september 11 , 2001 , it is essential that we stregthen our ability to detect , deter , and disrupt terrorist activities . 
other provisions , however , leave citizens vulnerable to unchecked , unwarranted , and potentially abusive invasions of privacy . 
many of these concerns were addressed in the senate bill that passed by bipartisan , unanimous support . 
unfortunately , the conference abandoned many of the safeguards in the final conference agreement . 
the conference report falls short in a number of areas . 
let me focus on 2 of these issues -- the inadequate checks on the national security letters and the foreign intelligence surveillance act court orders . 
the `` national security letters '' provision : ( 1. ) this authorization has no sunset ; ( 2. ) it provides no judicial review of a national security letter gag order . 
this is a departure from current law which allows the recipient of such a letter to challenge it in court . 
`` foreign intelligence surveillance act '' ( fisa ) court orders for tangible things ( section 215 ) : ( 1 ) unlike the senate bill , the conference report allows the government to obtain personal information on a mere showing of `` relevance '' , thereby striking the safeguard contained in the senate passed bill that required a 3-part test . 
( 2 ) the conference report does not permit the recipient of a section 215 order to challenge its automatic , permanent gag order . 
courts have held that similar restrictions violate the first amendment of the constitution . 
the senate version included many of the necessary safeguards . 
unfortunately , many of those provisions were abandoned by the conference committee . 
as a result i voted in favor of mr. conyers ' motion to recommit the conference report to the conference committee so that the conferees could return to the consideration of the senate passed bill . 
therefore , i must vote against the passage of the conference report that is before us today . 
in rural east tennessee , over 10 years ago meth production showed up in a real ugly way and spread like moonshine of 50 years ago , but 100 times more lethal , through the mountains and the hills . 
one of the innocent results here , though , of fighting meth and the production of meth are the children that are left in these homes . 
my colleague from tennessee , a democrat from nashville , jim cooper , wrote legislation , and i was the original republican cosponsor , that creates a provision funded at $ 20 million a year for the next 2 years to deal with the children that come out of these meth homes . 
over 10 , 000 children nationally between 2000 and 2003 came out of these meth homes and became wards of the state . 
in my state , 750 alone so far are wards of the state . 
so we are not just attacking the problem , but we are dealing with the aftermath of this deadly plague on america called methamphetamine production . 
if you listen to the testimony of the attorneys general and the prosecutors and you hear the cases , you know the patriot act has definitely kept our country safer , safer , since september 11 . 
today , we need to reauthorize it and keep the teeth in federal law enforcement and keep the terrorists out of our country . 
the patriot act is misleading american citizens and causing them to forfeit their civil liberties in the interest of what has become a political war on terrorism . 
at the same time , the president 's war on terrorism fails to fund protection for our transportation systems , our ports and , still today , uninspected cargo is being placed in the belly of the airplanes of all of our airlines . 
yet we continue in this act to violate the privacy of our citizens with section 505 , the national security letters section of the patriot act , which allows law enforcement to demand detailed information about an individual 's private records without judicial review , without the individual ever being suspected of a crime , without a requirement that law enforcement notify the individual that they are the subject of an investigation . 
furthermore , this section contains an automatic permanent gag order on the recipient of a national security letter , not even allowing the recipient to consult with an attorney . 
in one section of the law , 215 , they can get an attorney . 
mr. chairman , this power represents a clear violation of the fourth amendment against unreasonable search and seizure , as well as threatening speech protected under the first amendment . 
in fact , a u.s. district judge struck down section 505 in a case involving the government 's collection of sensitive customer records from internet service providers without judicial oversight . 
the judge found that the government seizure of these records constituted an unreasonable search and seizure under the fourth amendment , and found the broad gag provision to be an unconstitutional prior restraint on free speech . 
to address this , i proposed an amendment that would have provided the recipients of national security letters that would allow them to consult with their attorneys and any person that was necessary to produce the required records . 
this amendment would not have greatly changed the real meaning of section 505 . 
it was simply a common sense amendment that would have provided some legal recourse and balance for the recipients of national security letters . 
mr. chairman , what makes this country so great is our respect and protection of individual rights and civil liberties , and we must continue to provide adequate safeguards and protection to these rights . 
it talks about a provision of law both in sections 215 and 550 that does not allow one who is the target of an investigation or one who has assisted the fbi in gaining records , access to records , to talk about the investigation , to let people know they have been contacted , or that they in some way have been involved in assisting the authorities in seeking information . 
this amendment of mine is a very , very simple amendment that talks about what happens to someone who is under a gag order who may , through no fault of their own , place themselves in danger of being harmed or being killed because someone finds out that they have been involved , they are involved in the investigation in some way , and they are threatened by the person who discovers that they have been involved in the investigation ; or what happens to someone who is employed at a particular business where they give the fbi access to information . 
so i have raised the question about this gag order of what happens when someone is placed in a position through no fault of their own that they have to give up information . 
and someone may argue that in one section of the law , 215 , they have the right to get a lawyer and this could be included in the information that they share with the lawyer that would attempt to get them out from under the gag order . 
mr. chairman , what i am attempting to do , and in the scheme of things perhaps it is not that important because we have a patriot act , patriot act ii , that will basically extend two sections of the patriot act for 10 years , sections 206 and 215 , access to businesses and other records and roving wiretaps ; and we have these 14 other sections of the patriot act that are made permanent . 
i suppose my colleagues and the people of america should be worried about all of this , all of what is being done in this patriot act in the name of fighting terrorism . 
we want you to understand that there are enough people in power who believe that in order to exercise the power as they see it , they have a right to undermine the constitution of the united states of america . 
so my amendment in the scheme of things is not that important to try and protect a person or some persons . 
this patriot act is not in the best interest of americans . 
there are those on the other side of the aisle who have gotten up today and said i talked to a constituent who complained about the patriot act and i said to that constituent how have you been harmed , and the constituent could not explain it . 
it is about whether or not the children of this nation , the children of the future , it is about whether all americans are being denied their civil liberties because they have been led into the support of a patriot act that really just flies in the face of the constitution of the united states of america . 
i stand here in the congress of the united states questioning the wisdom of my colleagues on the patriot act , and i dare anyone to say i am unpatriotic because i do it . 
i have been elected by the people , and i could be a part of this charade of the government doing whatever we want to do in the name of so-called terrorism , but i do not see myself as an elected official nor do i see myself simply as a citizen that believes that the government is right in everything that it does . 
because i do not believe that , i dare to question those on the other side of the aisle and those on this side of the aisle . 
patriotism is about a constitution and a democracy that says america is different from everybody else and that we have come through a time and a history that has taught us that if you are to have a democracy , you must have certain guarantees , and those guarantees are embodied in the constitution that guarantees us freedom of speech , freedom of movement , freedom of religion , and freedom of privacy . 
those are the things that we should hold dear and we should fight to protect and we should hold onto with everything that we have , with every ounce of energy that we have . 
i hope that these are the teachers who are teaching the constitution of the united states and the history of this constitution , about how it evolved and how it developed ; and i hope they will teach them about the amendments to the constitution that strengthen it to make sure that we embody in this constitution all that may not have been thought about in the original framing of it by way of amendment . 
i hope that the teachers are able to say watch the debate on the floor of the congress of the united states so that you can understand that there are some intrusions that are taking place today with the patriot act that fly in the face of the constitution . 
i want you to be aware of it because when you leave this class , when you grow up to be whatever it is you are going to be , i expect that no matter where you are , whether you are in the united states , abroad , no matter where you are , you know how to stand up and fight for the constitution of the united states that guarantees certain rights and privacies that are now being intruded upon with this kind of act . 
mr. chairman , i yield back the balance of my time . 
mr. chairman , i suspect that the american people do not realize just how much the process of legislating is about reacting to events that take place around us . 
when the events of 9/11 occurred , we obviously reacted to those events . 
and so when we passed the patriot act originally , our effort was to try to find a new security balance for people here in our country , and we thought we had done a tremendous job of doing that in the judiciary committee , only to find that the rules committee , which did not even have any jurisdiction over the matter or had any hearings about the matter , took the bill , rewrote it , brought it to the floor and struck a completely different balance between the rights of government on one hand and law enforcement and the rights of individuals on the other hand . 
and a number of my colleagues have said that , well , there have not been any abuses by law enforcement of the powers that we gave them . 
but the truth of the matter is that depends on how you define an abuse . 
if we wait on something outrageous to happen , then we will react back in the opposite direction of against government and law enforcement in unreasonable ways , just as we are reacting in favor of law enforcement now . 
so here are a couple of statistics that you need to know about : the american library association found that libraries have received over 200 formal and informal requests for materials including 49 requests from federal officers . 
in a letter to the gentleman from virginia ( mr. scott ) xz4003641 , the department of justice said on july 5 , 2005 that that section had been used 153 times as of january 2005 . 
only 18 of those times were the uses for terrorism investigations . 
well , what is happening with the other 80 percent is in my estimation an abuse of this provision because we passed the law so that we could make it easier for law enforcement to get to terrorists . 
the law is being used in ways that , but for the events of 9/11 and the terrorism that occurred , we would not have accepted as residents of this country . 
we need to sunset this bill again for a shorter period of time , and i hope my colleagues will take that into account and vote against it . 
there are plenty of myths about the patriot act , and i think we need to put a few of them to rest . 
one of them is the myth that the local sheriff can go into your library and find out what you have been reading . 
under the patriot act , they need a court order in order to get any business records or library records or anything else , under the supervision of a federal judge . 
and it has to be as part of a foreign terrorist investigation or counterintelligence investigation against foreign spies . 
the intention of the patriot act is to prevent the next terrorist attack , instead of just letting the fbi gather the criminal evidence to convict somebody after thousands more have died . 
we need to reauthorize this act , and we also collectively as americans need to dispel the myths about the act and make some important strengthening of the act so that in the future it can continue to protect us . 
the bill expands police powers , it continues to authorize invasive violations of our medical records , our library borrowing habits and other private affairs . 
patriot ii restricts freedom , instead of expanding it . 
in defense of freedom , we are undermining freedom . 
i believe many of my colleagues voted for the original patriot act because of the sunset provisions , because they were assured this was a temporary measure for extraordinary times . 
now , all but two of the sunsets have been stripped from the bill , and those two come only after 10 years . 
so now we know the truth : the patriot act was never intended as an emergency , post-9/11 action ; as a matter of fact , it is not limited to terrorism . 
mr. speaker , the president and his administration continue its rhetoric that anyone calling for a withdrawal of troops or questioning the intelligence that led us into the iraq war is unpatriotic , while , on the other hand , using this war as an excuse , a patriot act was passed that recklessly violates our civil liberties and attacks the very freedoms our troops in iraq are told that they are fighting to protect . 
if you want to talk about dishonesty , look at this administration 's policies that have led us to ignore facts in order to manipulate the very policies that fly in the face of our own honesty , and this is an administration that also pays for `` canned '' news overseas . 
the real patriots have been those who stand up and question the misleading intelligence and dishonest tactics that got us into this war , those who have challenged the patriot act and its impact on the civil rights and civil liberties of every american . 
actually , it is patriotic to question how the patriot act affects the very rights that we live under in this country of ours . 
mr. chairman , i rise today in support of the usa patriot act . 
nearly four years ago and shortly after terrorists maliciously killed thousands of americans on september 11 , 2001 , congress passed the patriot act . 
today , we are at a critical point as congress considers extending 16 important provisions of the law . 
by providing these necessary tools , the patriot act builds a culture of prevention and makes certain that our government 's resources are dedicated to defending the safety and security of the american people . 
as president bush has said , `` free people will set the course of history . '' 
mr. speaker , if this rule is adopted , the house of representatives will consider the extension of the usa patriot act . 
the ultimate fate of this legislation will determine how effective we will be in investigating the clandestine activities of terrorist organizations and in preventing catastrophic events in the future . 
there is , mr. speaker , no greater or more solemn responsibility that we have as representatives of the american people . 
and , frankly , i have been astonished at the characterization of the bill and the record of the justice department . 
as a member of the committee and the subcommittee of jurisdiction , the subcommittee on crime of the committee on the judiciary , i have spent countless hours going over the records , including looking at top secret reports that are lodged with this congress , and i will state for the record i can find no evidence of a violation of civil liberties . 
that is a criticism of our department of justice , that is a criticism of our investigative agencies and our intelligence agencies that is not borne out by the record . 
i think we should make that very clear , particularly today when we have another instance , presumably , in london , of what we are facing . 
i authored the amendment in the committee on the judiciary to require two sunsets of the two most controversial provisions in this bill , but i did not do that based on any suggestion there is any record of a violation of civil liberties . 
i can recall being a member of that committee when i was in the minority when we received the bill on the midnight before we were supposed to consider things . 
it was the minority who made the motion to call the previous question and withdrew consideration of more amendments on their side . 
this is a structured bill that has something on the order of 20 amendments available , covering many of the issues that people are concerned about . 
this is an important day for us today , not just because of the explosions that have taken place in london today or those that took place several weeks ago , but rather because of 9/11 and our response to that wake-up call of the war on terrorism . 
the preamble to the united states constitution posits that both the provision for the common defense and the need to secure the blessings of liberty are central to the constitutional order . 
in the delicate balance of these important interests . 
our concern for liberty must not discount the consequences of a failure to keep americans secure from another terrorist attack . 
while it is important to avoid hyperbole on such a serious matter , the very nature of american life and the traditional regard for liberty could itself be threatened . 
the 12 oversight hearings conducted by the committee on the judiciary produced no evidence of abuse relating to the act itself . 
i hope other members have taken the time to go to the permanent select committee on intelligence , as i have , to review the documents that are filed pursuant to the patriot act by the justice department , to see for themselves whether or not they have found any evidence of abuse . 
it reminds me of those people who used to find communists under every bed : we know they are out there , we know they are there somewhere . 
the sunset of section 206 dealing with roving wiretaps and section 215 , which has been referred to , was adopted by the full committee . 
the bill specifically requires that the government meet a relevant standard when applying for a court order for records of u.s. citizens under 215 . 
the chairman 's bill , coupled with an amendment adopted by the full committee , explicitly provides that the subject of a court order under section 215 would have the right to consult with an attorney with respect to the order . 
the amendment at committee clarified that a recipient of such an order could disclose this information not only to comply with the order but to challenge it . 
on these and other parts of this bill , we have done the work in the committee to deal with the problems that have been suggested . 
mr. chairman , i thank the gentleman for yielding me this time , and i rise in support of the flake-schiff amendment . 
this is another effort in our continuation to support section 215 in all of its aspects , with the protections that i think are reasonable that allow us to take into consideration some of the concerns that people have expressed , even though there have been no examples , i repeat , no examples of abuses under this act . 
the justice department has told us they have not used this section in the area of libraries . 
mr. chairman , i thank the gentleman for yielding me this time , and i rise in support of this amendment . 
mr. chairman , national security letters are sort of a strange beast . 
it is kind of difficult to figure out what they are . 
they are sort of like administrative subpoenas , but they are not actually administrative subpoenas . 
nsls do not allow the fbi to read the contents of communications but rather the records of communication . 
the supreme court has recognized those kinds of differences . 
nonetheless , the recipients of these , while the justice department has told us that they allow them to talk to their lawyers , if you look at the statute as it exists now there seems to be a question about that . 
so in a very real sense this amendment both protects those who would receive one of these letters , and if they object to it they can go to an attorney , they can fight it , and it also gives the government a means of attempting to try and secure compliance with it . 
accordingly , the committee rose ; and the speaker pro tempore ( mr. putnam ) xz4003280 having assumed the chair , mr. hastings xz4001702 of washington , acting chairman of the committee of the whole house on the state of the union , reported that that committee , having had under consideration the bill ( h.r. 3199 ) to extend and modify authorities needed to combat terrorism , and for other purposes , had come to no resolution thereon . 
mr. chairman , i reserve the balance of my time . 
mr. chairman , i ask for an aye vote , and i yield back the balance of my time . 
mr. chairman , the hyde amendment recognizes a new reality in a very real danger that is growing : the deadly mix of drug trafficking and terrorism . 
it has now been estimated that nearly half of the designated foreign terrorist organizations are involved in the trafficking of illegal drugs . 
that is illegal drugs that end up on the streets of our cities , the cities of our allies , poisoning the fabric of their society and our society . 
terrorists , like old organized crime syndicates from the past , have recognized that illegally drug trafficking is a valuable source of financing and just another way to threaten our country . 
terrorists in afghanistan are now infiltrating and controlling the cultivation of poppy and ultimately heroin . 
hezbollah has been linked to drug trafficking from south america to the middle east ; and of course the revolutionary armed forces of colombia has long-standing drug trafficking operations which fund their deadly activities . 
the hyde amendment simply creates a new federal crime for the trafficking of controlled substances which are intended to benefit a foreign terrorist organization or any other terrorist organization and imposes a stiff mandatory minimum penalty of 20 years . 
this is really seriously two crimes : the one of drug trafficking connected with terrorism . 
let us remember that since most of the afghan heroin goes to europe and not here to the united states , our justice department and hard-pressed dea are very limited in going after the drug dealers and drug lords who facilitate terrorism directed at our troops . 
the compelling reason for me to return was the events of 9/11 . 
and one of the things that i thought i would never see in the house of representatives is an alice in wonderland type atmosphere where just because you say something , you think it is true . 
the fact of the matter is , many of the complaints registered by my friends on the other side of the aisle are taken care of in this conference report . 
if you vote down the conference report , those sections that are not subject to sunset will continue on without any of the changes that the chairman has articulated . 
madam speaker , it is the primary responsibility of government to protect the safety of its citizens . 
we have , as a result of oversight , and i have attended every single hearing in the subcommittee and full committee , done unbelievable oversight , reviewing every bit of evidence that has been out there . 
there has not been one single example of abuse proven , not one . 
but because we are concerned about the possibility of abuse , we have put at least 30 additional limitations into this conference report . 
and so really the question is , do you believe in the essential foundation of the patriot act which makes it is the primary responsibility of government to protect the safety of its citizens . 
the 9/11 commission report observed that `` the choice between security and liberty is a false choice , as nothing is more likely to endanger america 's liberties than the success of a terrorist attack at home. '' freedom presumes security . 
in the delicate balance of these important interests . 
our concern for liberty must not discount the consequences of a failure to keep americans secure from a cataclysmic event . 
while it is important to avoid hyperbole on such a serious matter , the very nature of american life -- and the traditional regard for liberty -- could itself be threatened . 
at the same time , it is the solemn responsibility of committees with oversight responsibilitites to be ever diligent to assure that government does not overstep the proper limits of its authority in implementing the patriot act . 
in this regard , in our oversight of the patriot act , the judiciary committee conducted 13 hearings and there was no finding of abuse . 
this was evidenced by the fact that opponents of the act resorted to attacks on the circumstances at guantanamo , and the creppy memo -- issues related to the wider war on terrorism but unrelated to the patriot act itself . 
the conference report contains a number of provisions which maintain the integrity of those key provisions necessary to combat terrorism , while at the same time strengthening the protection of civil liberties : as the author of the 10-year sunset provisions in the house bill relating to section 206 , roving wiretaps , and section 215 , access to business records the final language in the conference report responds to the critics of the legislation . 
the conference report contains the senate language of 4-year sunsets of these same provisions and extends the sunset language to the `` lone wolf ' provisions of the bill as well . 
the conference report explicitly provides for judicial review of any section 215 order . 
if the documents sought pertain to sensitive categories of records -- such as library , bookstore , tax returns , firearms sales , educational and medical records -- the fbi director , deputy director , or the official in charge of intelligence must personally sign off on the application before it can be submitted to the court . 
the conference report requires that the application to the fisa court must include `` a clear statement of the facts '' that demonstrate reasonable grounds to believe the tangible things sought are relevant to the investigation . 
the conference report requires the use of so-called minimization procedures to regulate the retention and dissemination of information concerning united states persons and the protection of privileged documents . 
the conference report makes it explicit that a recipient of an order has the right to disclose receipt to an attorney or other parties necessary to comply with the order . 
section 108 of the conference report imposes several additional safeguards on the use of roving surveillance : the conference report requires that the order describe the specific target in detail when authorizing a roving wiretap for a target whose identity is not known . 
the conference report specifies that the fisa court must find that the possibility of the target thwarting surveillance is based on specific facts in the application . 
as the former chief law enforcement officer of my state of california , i want to first of all emphasize that delayed notice search warrants are not an invention of the patriot act . 
the conference report adds new safeguards relating to the use of delayed notice search warrants . 
the conference report places a limit of 30 days on an initial request or on a later date certain if the facts justify such a delay . 
extensions of up to 90 days are possible unless the facts of a particular case justify a longer period . 
the language in the conference report provides for explicit judicial review of an nsl . 
the conference report provides that a recipient of an nsl may challenge any non-disclosure requirement in court . 
the report clarifies that a recipient may disclose receipt of an nsl to an attorney or other necessary party . 
there is a total absence of any evidence of abuse of the patrlot act . 
furthermore , the conference report adds further protections against any potential abuse of the law . 
the conference report represents a careful balance between our responsibility to protect americans from terrorist violence , and our responsibility to avoid any potential violations of their civil liberties . 
the enactment of this legislation is critical to this endeavor . 
there are those who will attempt to come here for the sole purpose of murdering innocent americans . 
madam speaker , first of all i want to associate myself with the comments made by my colleague from california and also to state for the record that i support the motion to instruct . 
i ran on a platform of freedom like most people did in this congress . 
i believe that we ought to look for other or additional sections of this bill to sunset , but i am happy to see that this congress is taking a hard look at the provisions and the sections that have already been mentioned to ensure that the freedoms that our families enjoy and the people in this country enjoy so much will be protected . 
i also understand the arguments that have been made about the oversight of the committee ; and , mr. chairman , i know that as the chair of that committee that will be done . 
my concern is for future generations and to make sure that none of the freedoms that americans enjoy today will ever be taken away from them in the future . 
i rise in support of the paul amendment and , in addition , in reluctant opposition to h.r. 3199 for several reasons . 
following the terrorist attacks of september 11 , i watched as members of congress came together in a bipartisan effort to craft legislation which would , it was argued , strengthen law enforcement 's hand in fighting terrorists . 
americans from across the political spectrum were willing to sacrifice some of the freedoms we cherish to immediately address security concerns , with the understanding that many provisions would be revisited and the civil liberty protections that we all hold so dear would be addressed . 
in these contemporary times , it may be difficult for us to conceive of the barbarous proceedings of the salem witch trials . 
indeed , they continue to perplex and horrify those of us who came later . 
but imagine if those perceptions and resulting actions were somehow a permanent part of our society today without an opportunity for review as to their validity ? 
if they were , under the patriot act 's intrusive infringement on america 's book purchases and library records , when the most recent episode in the harry potter book series was released last friday , we would have had hundreds of thousands of children `` burned at the stake. '' and i know this analogy might seem a bit extreme , but that is just how extreme things can become without proper checks and balances when restricting our civil liberties and freedoms , which is why we should support the paul amendment , because true freedom of expression is an important thing to preserve . 
i will support the paul amendment and i will vote against final passage of this version of the bill . 
i am very cognizant of the concerns brought to me by many of my constituents in michigan regarding the patriot act . 
i appreciate the gentleman letting me inquire about these provisions in the bill that you have reported out of committee . 
mr. chairman , section 215 of the patriot act pertains to the government 's abilities to gain access to what we commonly refer to as business records , records compiled by a business or an institution pertaining to a customer or visitor to that entity . 
this provision has come to be known as the `` library provision '' because many librarians and civil libertarians are concerned that this provision of the patriot act could authorize the government to pour through the library records of everyday private citizens . 
now , it is my understanding that your version of the bill has added protections to ensure that law-abiding citizens and residents of the united states do not see their cherished civil liberties violated . 
is it also the case that the recipient of such an order , such as a business or video store , is allowed to consult a lawyer and to contest these orders , and that judges are authorized to review such challenge ? 
in other words , we are not devolving to the executive branch powers of the judicial branch ? 
i have , and i hope the american people have , an accurate understanding of the safeguards put in place by the usa patriot act . 
mr. speaker , in the entire realm of human history there exists periods of time when evil people bent on destroying good , wholesome , wonderful ways of life get enough power to try to do that and to create chaos and to literally try to send us into a dark age . 
now , as a former judge and appellate judge , chief justice , i am very sensitive to the issues of due process , but we are in a war . 
going back to the civil war when lincoln suspended the writ of habeas corpus , it is in the constitution , `` the privilege of writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspended unless when in cases of rebellion or invasion the public safety may require it. '' he felt it did . 
we have not suspended writs of habeas corpus , even though we are in a war for our very existence . 
there will be oversight , because many of us are deeply concerned about our safety and about our liberties . 
so when the minority whip says , and he says he chooses his words carefully , and he says that this represents a craven , and i know i may look stupid , but i know what `` craven '' means , he says this represents a craven failure of our oversight responsibilities , then it tells me there might be a craven failure of his recognizing the oversight that we have conducted . 
anyway , the gentleman across the aisle says if this is approved , part of our tree of liberty will die . 
mr. chairman , i too rise in support of this bill . 
the thing is so far that provision of 215 has not been used with regard to libraries . 
but we can not lose sight of the fact either , we have not had one yet here , not since 9/11 . 
we do have some sunsets to provide some protection , and i am proud that this administration has not abused any of these until we can get these holes filled . 
mr. chairman , i want to thank the gentleman from wisconsin ( mr. sensenbrenner ) xz4003650 for his leadership on this important legislation , and i rise today in support of this bill . 
i led the department 's counterterrorism efforts in the united states attorney 's office in the state of texas . 
significantly , the patriot act tore down the wall between the criminal division and the intelligence side of the house . 
an fbi agent testified that efforts to conduct a criminal investigation into two of the hijackers were blocked due to concerns over the wall . 
it updates the law to the technology of today . 
the u.s. patriot act does not abrogate the role played by the judiciary in the oversight of the activities of federal law enforcement . 
we owe it to the citizens of this country to reauthorize the patriot act , for if we do not and another terrorist attack occurs on our shores we will surely all be held accountable . 
its aim was to give the women and men of our law enforcement community the authority and tools needed to prevent future attacks and save and secure the lives of american citizens . 
there is no question , mr. speaker , that many of the provisions of the patriot act have been useful to law enforcement and have helped to prevent terrorist attacks and secure our nation . 
but we must also be vigilantly aware that some of the provisions of the patriot act have the potential to be abused and violate the civil liberties of innocent american citizens , the same citizens it is meant to protect . 
congress understood this when it passed the patriot act and required that 16 provisions of the act be made to sunset , forcing us to revisit them . 
the acts of september 11 were not the only events in our history where our nation 's leaders were asked to strike this balance . 
during world war ii , under the banner of security , the civil liberties of 120 , 000 japanese americans vanished . 
mr. speaker , once again we are in a time of crisis . 
i implore all of us to proceed with caution . 
it is this type of bill , one that affects the most cherished rights we have as americans , that requires constant and vigilant oversight by congress . 
the surest way to ensure this oversight is to place sunsets on those provisions of the legislation that can be abused . 
unfortunately , this bill places sunsets on only two of the original 16 provisions , making the rest permanent . 
mr. speaker , the civil liberties of the american people are too important and the potential for abuse too great for us not to place sunsets on all of the 16 provisions . 
like our constitution , our liberties are a symbol of america . 
we are certainly responsible for the safety of this nation , but we are also certainly responsible for shaping the laws that determine what it means to be an american . 
mr. speaker , all of us agree that we must do all we can to secure and protect the united states , but we must also be mindful of those rights and privileges upon which this great nation was founded . 
mr. speaker , i rise today in support of the creation of a select bipartisan committee to investigate the preparation for and response to hurricane katrina . 
as representatives , we are elected by the american people , and it is our duty to ensure that the numerous federal agencies of which we have oversight and that we fund on an annual basis serve the taxpayers efficiently and effectively , and i think from the images that we have seen and from the reports from that area of the country , we have had serious problems . 
this is a job best performed by the elected leaders of the united states . 
we are charged with the responsibility of oversight . 
to those who are critical of the makeup of this committee , i say to them , the united states congress has responded in similar fashion 41 times , most recently with the formation of the select committee on homeland security in 2002 and 2003 . 
mr. speaker , we must form this bipartisan committee quickly so that the members from both sides of the aisle can begin the vital task of finding the problems that plagued the response to hurricane katrina on the local , state and federal levels . 
if we fail to act expeditiously and devolve into finger pointing and bickering , we are putting other areas of our nation at greater risk . 
mr. speaker , i rise in support of house resolution 439 and in support of the underlying resolution . 
one suspects they believe it will be unfair largely because while they will have full rights of representation on the committee in question , they will inevitably be the minority on any panel that fairly represents the composition of both the house of representatives and the other body . 
it would be easy and entertaining to lampoon the consistency of the so- called party of the people rejecting a committee composed of the elected representatives of the american people in favor of one made up of individuals who are both unelected and unaccountable to the voters of this country , but i will avoid that temptation . 
the first is our faith as individuals in the efficacy of democracy itself . 
as the minority in this house for 11 years , i fear my friends on the other side of the aisle have lost their faith in the american people , because of the choices they have made at the ballot box in recent years . 
having served as a member of a seemingly permanent minority in the oklahoma state senate earlier in my career , i understand the frustration on which that sentiment is based . 
however , as adherents to the ideals of democracy , we should trust that over time the people will get it right and that if our views are sound , they will prevail . 
in the meantime , our job is to argue our point of view in the court of public opinion and accept the outcome at the polls when the verdict is rendered . 
the second issue at stake here is the wisdom of empowering people who are neither elected nor accountable to perform the task our constitution assigns to the elected representatives of the american people . 
frankly , i share the sentiments winston churchill famously voiced when he said `` democracy is the worst form of government , except for all those others that have been tried. '' mr. speaker , it is fundamentally unsound and undemocratic to turn over the function of congressional oversight to a group of individuals who have neither been elected by the people nor accountable to the people for their actions or recommendations . 
it is a way for us , the representatives of the people , to avoid our responsibilities . 
those duties belong to the elected representatives of the american people . 
my colleagues on the other side of the aisle often complain there is insufficient congressional oversight . 
this is our chance to exercise that oversight , and the voters will surely hold all of us accountable for how well we do the job . 
i urge support of house resolution 439 and the underlying house resolution 437 . 
mr. speaker , i ask unanimous consent to temporarily control the time of the gentleman from california ( mr. dreier ) xz4001150 . 
mr. speaker , i just want to make a couple of quick points , and then i will reserve the balance of my time . 
reclaiming my time , mr. speaker , and i respect the opinion of my good friend from florida , but i think there was oversight . 
but i would actually agree with his fundamental point in the sense that i think oversight is more effectively done by the elected representatives of the people , by the appropriate people who are responsible for implementing the solution . 
mr. speaker , i reserve the balance of my time . 
mr. speaker , time and time again here on the floor of the house i hear speeches : `` we will never forget 9/11 ; we will better prepare and defend america. '' but the most basic lesson of september 11 , where we tragically lost so many first responders in the collapse of the towers , was that they lacked secure interoperable communications . 
we have not learned that most basic of lessons . 
today , it is subsumed into this gigantic morass of the homeland security bureaucracy , downgraded to subagency level with a political hack as its director , and most of the professional staff has resigned and gone on to run state management agencies around the country . 
there are still some good professionals there , but the leadership , appointed by the white house , and the fact it was subsumed in the bureaucracy at the insistence of the republican majority and the white house , they took away its independent agency status . 
will the other side of the aisle fess up , like the white house never does , that they were wrong to follow the lead of the white house to downgrade this agency , to politicize it , subsume it in a huge bureaucracy , and that we are less capable than we were on 9/11 to respond to these types of disasters ? 
mr. speaker , we need an independent agency outside of this highly partisan body . 
but all mistakes should come out , the failings of the federal government , the state government , and the local governments , with an independent , nonpartisan commission . 
mr. speaker , by direction of the committee on rules , i call up house resolution 439 and ask for its immediate consideration . 
mr. speaker , for the purpose of debate only , i yield the customary 30 minutes to the gentlewoman from rochester , new york ( ms. slaughter ) xz4003780 , pending which i yield myself such time as i may consume . 
during consideration of this resolution , all time yielded is for the purpose of debate only . 
mr. speaker , house resolution 439 is a closed rule providing for 1 hour of debate for consideration of h. res. 437 , a resolution establishing a select bipartisan committee to investigate the preparation for and response to hurricane katrina . 
the rule waives all points of order against consideration of the bill and provides one motion to recommit which may not contain instructions . 
also critical has been the outpouring of support and generosity from fellow americans and very importantly from 94 countries around the world . 
that said , as president bush has stated , there were aspects of the immediate response to hurricane katrina that were not acceptable . 
already we have seen the head of the federal emergency management agency resign . 
as debris is removed , water recedes and homes are rebuilt , we in congress must now assume our very serious and consequential constitutional oversight role of the executive branch and federal agencies so that we can find out exactly what went wrong and what went right in the early response to hurricane katrina . 
we need to get to the bottom of what happened , when it happened and why it happened . 
mr. speaker , to fulfill our oversight responsibility , we are following precedent and honoring tradition by creating a bipartisan select committee to look at the response of the government to hurricane katrina . 
this select committee will allow us to take a sober , serious , nonpartisan look at the development , coordination and execution of relief by state , local and federal authorities . 
mr. speaker , i reserve the balance of my time . 
article 1 , section 8 of the constitution states it , that we have to do our job . 
there are very important questions that have been raised by democrats and republicans and people from the outside community ; and we , as the representatives of the people , have the responsibility to get to the bottom of this . 
that is what the establishment of this bipartisan committee is , in fact , going to do . 
mr. speaker , i am happy to yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from charleston , west virginia ( mrs. capito ) xz4000610 , my very good friend and hardworking member of the committee on rules . 
mr. speaker , i yield myself such time as i may consume , and as i prepare to yield to my friend from moore , oklahoma ( mr. cole ) xz4000770 , i want to say to my good friend from massachusetts that it is very clear that members of the united states house of representatives do have the ability to deal with a disaster and at the same time engage in a very , very important investigatory process . 
it is also very important to note that this is not going to simply be republicans asking questions of other republicans . 
as i said earlier , and i know my friend from rochester raised this when she said it was nice of me to say that democrats would have the opportunity to ask questions , but we know that democrats , by virtue of this being a bipartisan committee , will be able to be deeply involved and engaged in this process as well . 
once again , i think it is important to note , as my colleague and friend from west virginia said , that we are the elected representatives of the american people and this is our constitutionally mandated responsibility which we should not pass on to someone else . 
mr. speaker , i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from oklahoma ( mr. cole ) xz4000770 , a hard-working member of the committee on rules . 
mr. speaker , i reserve the balance of my time . 
mr. speaker , i reserve the balance of my time . 
mr. speaker , i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from marietta , georgia ( mr. gingrey ) xz4001510 , a hard-working member of the committee on rules . 
mr. speaker , i reserve the balance of my time . 
mr. speaker , as we deal with this great challenge , one can not help but think back to the days following one of the most tragic events in our nation 's history , that being , of course , the attacks on the world trade center , flight 93 going down in pennsylvania and , of course , the plane hitting the pentagon . 
they came together committed to ensuring that we would never see the kind of terrorist threat that happened on september 11 hit the united states or our allies or anyone in the world again . 
and that really embarked us upon this massive global war on terror , and that has been the focus of the federal government . 
we know that the top priority on september 11 , 2001 , became this bipartisan goal of trying to deal with the global war on terror . 
mr. speaker , i am very proud of the democrats in this house who have come together in a bipartisan way to work with republicans in our shared goal of winning the global war on terror . 
we know that 2 1/2 weeks ago we faced another kind of disaster . 
and i will tell the members , as i stand here at this moment , mr. speaker , i live constantly with the prospect of a massive earthquake hitting the largest , most important state in the union , which i am proud to represent here . 
we in california deal with the threat of fires on a regular basis . 
and in the wake of those fires following that , we , of course , have terrible mudslides which impact tremendous numbers of people . 
in california , one of the most prominent was the northridge earthquake on january 16 of 1994 . 
and i will say that , having gone through all of this , mr. speaker , it is absolutely absurd , it is absurd , to believe that any member of this house , that any member of this house would not want to get to the truth of exactly what happened in the case of hurricane katrina . 
just yesterday , governor blanco , the democratic governor of louisiana , said that she takes responsibility for what took place in her state . 
speaker hastert has just called for members of the committee on appropriations to go to the gulf coast to look at this situation and to report back to us , because the very important responsibility of oversight right now that the committee on appropriations has over the $ 60 billion-plus that we , in a bipartisan way , have appropriated to deal with this , needs to be addressed . 
so this notion that there is not a bipartisan commitment to get to the bottom of this is absolutely ludicrous . 
i will tell my colleagues that this bipartisan committee is something that i think can play a very important role in ensuring that for all of us who face the prospect of a disaster in our states that we will be able to address it in a better way . 
i know that is not a popular thing to say ; but i serve on the committee on rules , and by virtue of that , i think it makes me an institutionalist . 
this is my 25th year serving here , and i am proud of the role that i have been able to play in trying to address very important institutional concerns , and we have been able to address many issues in a bipartisan way . 
we just reported out a rule that enjoyed strong bipartisan support dealing with coast guard reauthorization , and passage of rules like that are noncontroversial , they do not get attention , and those are things that we have worked on . 
in fact , i would argue that we do more things coming out of even the committee on rules in a bipartisan way than we do the things that we do that are very , very strident and partisan . 
because article i , section 8 of the u.s. constitution makes it very clear that we have the responsibility for congressional oversight , oversight of the executive branch ; and this bipartisan select committee , mr. speaker , will focus not just on the federal government . 
we are accountable as the elected representatives of the american people to the american people . 
the speaker , again , has reached out to the democratic leader and very much wants to have appointments made , and democrats will be able to ask any question that they want ; they will be able to participate in the process of bringing witnesses before the committee . 
slaughter ( ny ) amendment in nature of substitute : strike all after the resolved clause and insert : `` resolved , that immediately upon the adoption of this resolution it shall be in order without intervention of any point of order to consider in the house the bill ( h.r. 3764 ) to establish a congressional commission to examine the federal , state , and local response to the devastation wrought by hurricane katrina in the gulf region of the united states especially in the states of louisiana , mississippi , alabama , and other areas impacted in the aftermath and make immediate corrective measures to improve such responses in the future . 
the previous question shall be considered as ordered on the bill to final passage without intervening motion except : ( 1 ) one hour equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the committee on rules ; and ( 2 ) one motion to recommit. '' mr. speaker , i yield back the balance of my time , and i move the previous question on the resolution . 
mr. speaker , i rise in strong support of house resolution 437 . 
i have heard the other side of the aisle argue that what is the hurry , you are rushing to create an oversight committee and let us wait a couple of months . 
i want to point out to my friends on the other side of the aisle that we are still in the hurricane season . 
the other side of the aisle also is suggesting that this is a republican majority investigating a republican administration . 
i point out we were not focusing just on the federal aspects of this , as they would like us to do , but we are also focusing on the local and state aspects of this . 
i could name any number of instances . 
my colleagues on the other side of the aisle know that is true . 
the creation of an outside independent commission , as they call it , they are calling for doing that and spending an additional $ 5 million to $ 10 million . 
we have the staff within this congress on both sides of the aisle , both in the majority and on the minority , and hopefully we would not spend more than $ 500 , 000 to get this work done and get it done in a bipartisan fashion . 
i am fully in support of that . 
i note peripherally that the distinguished chairman of the committee on rules has other business and has left the floor ; but i was prepared to ask him , and perhaps his replacement in the chair for the majority can answer for me , what did the house of representatives do in the last 3 years with reference to the tragedy of 9/11 ? 
every one of us is mindful of our constitutional duty . 
last year , as we all know , four hurricanes ravaged my home state of florida and some of the gulf coast . 
three of them literally destroyed parts of the district that i am privileged to represent . 
we saw that a once-reliable agency had been placed on the back burner as an afterthought in the department of homeland security . 
our delegation literally begged the committees of jurisdiction to hold hearings on what we saw in florida . 
despite a whole lot of lip service , nothing has changed . 
the 9/11 commission was created to provide a full and complete accounting of the 2001 terrorist attacks . 
that is why i and the gentleman from new jersey ( mr. menendez ) xz4002720 and 156 of our colleagues yesterday introduced h.r. 3764 , legislation establishing a real independent commission , immune from political influence and absolute partisanship . 
and while they can not officially cosponsor our bill , a significant part , 76 percent , of the american people agree with us . 
supporting the american people 's concerns , you , mr. speaker , said at one point , and i quote , `` our party controls the levers of government . 
we 're not about to go and look beneath a bunch of rocks to try to cause heartburn. '' put another way , mr. speaker : we helped create this mess , and we are not going to be able to investigate it ourselves . 
so forgive me , mr. speaker , if i question the majority 's ability to conduct effective oversight with this type of political candor . 
what about the committees of jurisdiction already in existence in congress ? 
for my constituents , it is about the failures of this congress , and for others it is about the failures in new orleans and in the states and at the federal government . 
instead , congress has turned a blind eye , and the bill we have before us represents more of the same . 
because what the american people deserve at the end of this process is a document that does not necessarily agree with everything i say or does not cover the president 's back , which is what the republicans are trying to do today , but that actually helps fix the problems that hurricane katrina exposed . 
the purpose of the commission established by the gentleman from florida 's ( mr. hastings ) xz4001701 bill is not simply to assign blame . 
pre-identifying vulnerable areas , strategically deploying resources , anticipating potential stumbling blocks as we prepare for disasters , these need to be the guiding principles of our national response plan . 
furthermore , this commission will show whether or not , as i believe , fema lacked appropriate leadership , leadership with experience in disaster management , and then recommend ways in which the agency can be better prepared , both in terms of personnel and resources . 
unlike the president , i do not think brownie did a heck of a job . 
instead , it would be made up of members of congress , and there are three problems with that approach : first , there are some members whose time would be better spent dealing with the immediate recovery and reconstruction needs created by the hurricane . 
and , third , some of the problems we saw in the gulf coast include bad funding choices made by congress itself . 
the job of this congress is not to run interference for the bush administration ; it is to do what is best for the american people . 
seventy-six percent of the public want an independent commission because , quite frankly , they do not trust the republican majority to do it right . 
they have a pattern of sweeping problems under the rug , of turning everything into a political fight . 
mr. speaker , for so many reasons my colleagues on this side of the aisle have articulated , this resolution should be rejected . 
because it is neither bipartisan in terms of its authority , nor bipartisan in terms of its power , nor bipartisan in terms of its subpoena power . 
this president and this administration made some horrible decisions about putting political hacks and their cronies in charge of the agency that is in charge of the safety of the people of the united states , whether it is western fires , earthquakes , floods , tornadoes or hurricanes . 
this congress , powerful members of the senate and the house , made decisions about using fema as a honey pot to take resources out of and divert them elsewhere . 
the committee on appropriations chairmen of both houses , the leadership , the republican leadership of both houses , are they going to investigate that themselves ? 
that is why , when they are asked on this question , 75 percent of the american people want a 9/11 commission . 
they want a 9/11 commission because they saw that the 9/11 commission was the only way that the citizens of this country were going to get the answers , not the answers the politicians wanted them to get , and that is what this bipartisan , phony committee is about . 
they want a citizens ' committee to answer these questions because the questions are going to have to be asked of a republican president , a republican congress , a democratic mayor , a democratic governor , a republican governor and that simply will not be able to be done . 
the question that must be asked is : did he act responsibly as the president of the united states to protect the people of this country ? 
mr. speaker , i thank the ranking member , the gentlewoman from new york ( ms. slaughter ) xz4003780 , for yielding me this time and commend the members of the committee on rules for their important work on this subject , particularly the gentleman from florida ( mr. hastings ) xz4001701 who is the author of the legislation , along with the gentleman from new jersey ( mr. menendez ) xz4002720 , the chairman of our caucus , on legislation which will bring truth to this situation , an independent commission , modeled after 9/11 , respected by the american people . 
following the tragedy of 9/11 , the american people expected and deserved the truth . 
people of new york and new jersey were strong advocates for such a commission . 
but our country is grateful to the 9/11 families because they not only gave us that commission to review that terrible tragedy that befell our country , they gave us a tradition of transparency and finding the truth and holding people accountable and hoping to do so in a way that prevents future loss of life . 
so on behalf of the people in the region , i plead with my colleagues in this body to reject any sham committee . 
it was compounded by a manmade disaster because the federal response of fema fell so very , very short . 
that does not mean that many , many people who work for fema and many people , our first responders , police and fire , health care providers in the area and volunteers from every walk of life did not rise to the occasion . 
they certainly did , and we commend them for the sacrifice they were willing to make to rescue others in the time of the immediate recovery . 
but there are so many unanswered questions ; and instead of having a sham , why can we not have a real commission to look into this ? 
so the choice on the floor today , we have heard all of this discussion over and over . 
the fact is that we should be spending our time figuring out how we are going to help the people of the region rebuild their communities , to create jobs , to educate their children , to rid themselves of the toxic , literally toxic , environment , and that is the situation that they are in there . 
instead , we are wasting the public 's time on a subject that is unworthy of this tragedy , and it did not have to be . 
i certainly respect the congressional role of oversight . 
we have called for it over and over again , whether it was the war in iraq or the price gouging at the pump of gasoline for america 's consumers , whether it is abu ghraib or guantanamo . 
so i fully support congressional oversight by the committees of jurisdiction . 
so the idea of this congress having a role in terms of oversight in a bipartisan special committee is one that i supported . 
why is this congress afraid of the truth ? 
over and over again , iraq , name it , price at the pump , why is this congress afraid of the truth ? 
sometimes it is really important , as we try to find our common ground , we stand our ground where we can not find that common ground , but we always have to come down in favor of the people , to yield on points . 
but , first and foremost , we must have a truly independent commission , again , in the manner of the 9/11 commission that took testimony , that issued a report , that gave transparency and openness to the process and gave some level of truth to the american people . 
because the people in the gulf states , many of them affected are poor and economically disadvantaged and not as sophisticated , perhaps , as some of the people stricken with grief in the new york/new jersey area at the time of 9/11 , and in pennsylvania and in the pentagon . 
because these people are of a different economic status and because they are living in shelters and the rest and not really able to speak for themselves to the congress of the united states , we , the house democrats , will speak for them in asking for the truth and appealing to our republican colleagues for us to work together in a completely nonpartisan way to help meet their needs . 
senator landrieu , in the senate last week , brought the nation to tears with her presentation on what she saw in her beloved state of louisiana . 
and the gentleman from louisiana ( mr. jefferson ) xz4002010 has told us firsthand of what he has seen there . 
i could only see secondhand , joining the gentlewoman from texas ( ms. jackson-lee ) xz4001990 , the gentleman from texas ( mr. al green ) xz4006530 , the gentleman from texas ( mr. gene green ) , going to houston to meet with the victims of katrina in the astrodome and also in the george r. brown convention center . 
we saw children , little children , adorable little babies that we could hold in our arms , and 90-year-old great grannies , all of them , not the little babies , they did not speak for themselves , but their older siblings said , `` we want to go home. '' they praised the hospitality , the warmth , the generosity of the people of houston . 
as i said when i was in houston , i do not know of any city in america that could have risen to the occasion so quickly and so compassionately as houston . 
mayor white , judge eckels , the commissioner of harris county ; representative noriega , so many people in the community came together to help the victims of katrina . 
but still , with all of the respect that they extended to their guests , with all the health care , with all the care and feeding , still , of course , there is no place like home . 
with that , i just close again to say that our hopes and prayers are always with the people of the region . 
mr. speaker , on tuesday , president bush said that he took responsibility for the recent failure of the federal government to fulfill its ultimate duty of saving the lives of its own people within its own borders . 
today , this congress has to offer the american people its own definition of responsibility . 
the appalling aftermath of hurricane katrina , which swept over citizens from louisiana to alabama to mississippi , was the product of a combination of failures : failures of planning , failures of execution , failures of accountability . 
it is the responsibility of this body to examine why our federal government was behind so many of those failures . 
the 9/11 commission was our government 's response to the tragedy of september 11 , 2001 ; and after an exhaustive study , it produced a report that was trusted by the american people and by the members of our government . 
the 9/11 commission was not beholden to any interests besides those of its own integrity and the good of the country . 
this honorable response to the tragedy of september 11 puts to shame what has been proposed today in the wake of hurricane katrina . 
what was perhaps our federal government 's greatest failure to date to defend life at home is being met with a failure of leadership and openness and honesty in this chamber today . 
the republican leadership of the house and senate has called for the creation of an overtly partisan congressional committee to investigate the government 's pre- and post-katrina actions . 
they would give republicans control of every aspect of the proceedings , and they alone would control who would be subpoenaed . 
they alone would control which documents could be examined , and they alone would control the scope of the investigation . 
i object to it because it is the republican party which controls the levers of government and , as such , manages fema and the department of homeland security and every other federal institution which must be examined . 
the conflicts of interest that are present are so obvious that it is incredible anyone would deny them , but the members of the majority do not only do this , but they put forth one justification after another for their plan , each one less convincing than the one before it . 
they tell us that the structure of the committee is based on precedent and cite the bipartisan commission which investigated the iran-contra affair as evidence of this . 
after all , accountability has not exactly been the hallmark of this republican leadership . 
this majority did not investigate those who concealed the department of health and human services ' real estimate of how much the 2003 medicare legislation that we passed would cost . 
it did not investigate the role of top bush campaign contributors in writing vice president cheney 's energy plan . 
it did not investigate what led to our dehumanizing and shameful treatment of detainees at guantanamo bay in cuba and abu ghraib in iraq . 
only allowing a hand-picked group of witnesses to be questioned prejudices the investigation before it has even begun . 
why will you not support the creation of an independent commission ? 
what are you afraid of ? 
a commission controlled by the politicians of one party charged with investigating itself will face tremendous internal political pressure to eliminate embarrassing truths from the public eye , to defer blame and to hide facts . 
is the creation of an independent commission an abdication of our responsibility ? 
if we intentionally create a partisan , political investigation , that , mr. speaker , would be an abdication of our responsibilities . 
the public already overwhelmingly supports the creation of such an independent commission by 76 percent , and over 160 members of this body , representing more than 100 million of our nation 's people , have already supported the creation of such a commission through a substitute resolution by the gentleman from florida ( mr. hastings ) xz4001701 , my colleague . 
its findings would not just help us to prevent another terrible disaster from taking place , they would also help our government to regain its credibility in the eyes of the public . 
a newsweek poll from earlier this week found that fully 57 percent of the general population has doubts that government officials will respond well the next time a disaster strikes . 
those doubts would not be reduced until people believe that a real , independent investigation of katrina has taken place . 
but the findings of the congressional commission being proposed by the republican leadership will be forever tainted by the pervasive public belief that details were overlooked or truths hidden for political reasons . 
we have plenty of evidence to believe that . 
mr. speaker , i reserve the balance of my time . 
mr. speaker , i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from massachusetts ( mr. mcgovern ) xz4002630 , a member of the committee on rules . 
mr. speaker , if an independent commission is an abdication of our authority , why did we all vote unanimously to establish the 9/11 commission ? 
mr. speaker , i am pleased to yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from california ( ms. matsui ) xz4006631 , a member of the committee on rules . 
mr. speaker , i yield myself the balance of my time . 
i ask for a `` no '' vote on the previous question so i can amend the rule and allow the house , instead of h. res. 437 , to consider h.r. 3764 , which creates an independent 9/11-like commission to investigate the events involving hurricane katrina . 
i want to reiterate that 76 percent of americans in a recent abc/washington post poll preferred that a commission of outside experts , similar in nature to the 9/11 commission , and , in fact , i wish for the same people , to investigate the devastating events surrounding hurricane katrina , and that is not just democrats that were asked . 
sixty-four percent of republicans in that same poll said they , too , supported an independent commission to investigate the government 's preparedness and response effort . 
please vote `` no '' on the previous question so we can authorize an independent commission that will not be influenced by partisan politics instead of a republican-controlled committee investigating the failings of a republican-controlled administration . 
too many people 's lives were turned upside down because of the failure of governmental officials to adequately prepare for and respond to the impact of hurricane katrina . 
mr. speaker , i ask unanimous consent that the text of the amendment be printed in the record immediately prior to the vote on the previous question . 
mr. speaker , i yield back the balance of my time . 
mr. speaker , i object to the vote on the ground that a quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not present . 
this resolution puts a partisan congressional committee in charge of the investigation . 
i am also an original cosponsor of that amendment . 
letting congress investigate the government failures of hurricane katrina is like letting the fox guard the hen house . 
more than ever , the last 2 weeks have shown that we need an independent assessment of what happened . 
in my role as ranking member of the committee on homeland security , i have looked for answers and have tried to put together a timeline of events . 
i am submitting with my statement today for the record a timeline that the staff of the committee has put together for me showing what happened compiled from public sources . 
this document shows the complexity of the issues and the need for an independent assessment of what happened . 
i do not understand the opposition from the other side of the aisle against creating an independent commission that the american people have asked for . 
indeed , the type of commission proposed by the gentleman from florida ( mr. hastings ) xz4001701 and others has historically been used after large events that affect the country . 
on september 20 , they sent the largest contingent ever to travel to new york city to view the devastation of the world trade center and console the families of the victims . 
yet we went to new york , but now we can not go to my area of the country . 
now we want congress to take charge of this investigation . 
for the good of the nation , let us put aside partisan politics and not create a strawman committee . 
the result of the vote was announced as above recorded . 
mr. speaker , when hurricane katrina came ashore and ravaged the gulf states and the levees in new orleans , americans united in their support of those in need and the communities devastated by this terrible disaster . 
we were also eyewitnesses to the tragedy of hundreds of thousands of people who had escaped the wrath of the terrible storm only to then be stranded in the superdome , the convention center , or trapped on the roofs , surrounded by rising flood waters with little in the way of food , water , or medical care . 
with the passage of time , our outrage and frustration set in . 
reporters and the media managed to get to the heart of the disaster ; yet there was little sign of our federal relief efforts . 
just as the american people united to aid the victims of katrina , so too must congress . 
it is time for congress , as part of the federal government , and therefore an element of the relief response , to shoot straight with the american people . 
we saw the successful implementation following the tragedy of september 11 , and following this model congress will reassure the american people the answers that the independent commission finds and the recommendations they make are ones in which the nation can trust . 
my hometown of sacramento lies in a floodplain at the confluence of two great rivers and faces the constant threat of floods . 
they are more interested in identifying areas of weakness and making the necessary improvements . 
we must ensure that the federal government does its job of protecting the american people , and with an independent commission we will do so . 
as it has been pointed out , less than 1 percent of species listed have recovered in the entire history of the act . 
many species that were listed in error , yet because of flaws in the act , they are still listed . 
mr. chairman , one of those species is the alabama sturgeon . 
the economic cost of its listing has been estimated at $ 1.5 billion . 
mr. chairman , i and the rest of the alabama delegation worked directly with the gentleman from california to ensure that the bill is helpful to landowners in alabama and southeast . 
i encourage all of my colleagues to support this bill . 
mr. chairman , i rise to deal with the section of the manager 's amendment that covers the manatees . 
this is an unprecedented move to exempt a single type of activity , dock-building , from a key provision of the marine mammal protection act . 
it is not only bad policy , but it also undermines recovery efforts by the state of florida and the fish and wildlife service . 
by way of background , this section would allow those applying for dock permits to simply prove that their activities would not , quote-unquote , jeopardize , would not jeopardize the continued existence of endangered and threatened marine mammal species as mandated by the endangered species act , section 7. today , under existing law they must prove that their activities would have only a negligible impact on these species as mandated by the marine mammal protection act , section 101 . 
this simple change in wording lowers our national standard for protection of this well-loved species . 
because no single dock is likely to jeopardize manatees , but a whole succession of docks is likely to do exactly that . 
this amendment clearly targets manatees in florida , but we really have no idea what kind of precedent or implications this would have for other critically endangered marine mammals . 
they lost a lawsuit on july 13 , 2005 , against the fish and wildlife service in which the court found that the marine mammal protection act does in fact apply to dock-building activities that would lead to incidental take of marine mammals , and specifically manatees in florida 's inland waters . 
this amendment , therefore , is rushed into this particular bill , just part of the manager 's amendment ; it would undermine the process that has gone on for several years that the state of florida and the fish and wildlife service have engaged in to recover manatees in florida . 
finally , the minority and majority have already reached agreements and passed a version of the marine mammal protection act out of the committee on resources , and this amendment flies directly in the face of that process . 
mr. chairman , i rise in support of h.r. 3824 , the threatened and endangered species recovery act . 
less than 1 percent of endangered species have recovered , less than 1 percent . 
the esa has only helped 10 of 1 , 300 species listed under the law . 
thirty-nine percent of the species are unknown . 
we need to update and modernize the esa to strengthen the species recovery by turning conflict into cooperation and allowing the use of sound science . 
there are certain areas that are blighted in portions of our communities . 
i want to point to one , the delhi sand flower-loving fly , and of course , the other one is the kangaroo rat . 
can my colleagues imagine the traffic congestion in the area , the impact it would have in that area , on the flow of goods and others that would not be able to be moved ? 
for example , in the cities of colton and fontana , california , a handful of flies , yes , flies are responsible . 
the city of fontana alone has spent $ 10 million in legal fees associated with the esa and has been forced to put aside $ 50 million worth of land that has been intended for development . 
yet we have not been able to generate the kind of revenue that we need . 
think of the farmers not able to harvest their crops because an endangered species is found in the field . 
i ask my colleagues also to support the passage of this . 
mr. speaker , i am pleased that both sides of the aisle have recognized the need of some modifications in the endangered species act . 
i would like to , mr. speaker , introduce you to a man by the name of john gochnauer . 
nonetheless , he came back the next year to play for them in 1903 , where he once again , full-time player , hit .185 , and this time set a major league record , which has yet to be broken , of committing 98 errors as shortstop , which means out of every five times , he touched the ball , he booted or threw it away once . 
the endangered species act has established 1 , 300 species for preservation and has been able to preserve 12 of them , giving that act a batting average of .010 , if you round up . 
the endangered species act is the john gochnauer of federal programs . 
because if you are a good steward of the land , your practices which create and preserve habitat make you then open to government control and government regulations and produce an attitude of distrust and hatred . 
it actually penalizes the practices that help in the process , which is one of the reasons why this bill before us recognizes that , and especially in 13 ( d ) , a section that is in the bill but not in the substitute . 
it is there to provide grants to encourage cooperation to solve the problem , not to encourage people running away from the fear of the federal government 's control . 
i think that is probably one of the reasons why this bill is one of those unique bills to come before this body in which a majority of both parties in committee voted to support this particular bill . 
this bill is indeed one of modifications . 
but in 1995 , in california , there was a levee that was in need of repair . 
the bushes were not part of the endangered species act , but a beetle who could potentially live in those bushes was , even though no beetle was found in those 43 bushes that grew up on that levee after it was built . 
nonetheless , a mitigation plan was mandated , even though the directors of the levee said that it would weaken the levee . 
mr. speaker , the record of the endangered species act over the decades here has been one of jobs lost , of property restricted , of homes destroyed and , sadly , of human lives lost . 
the bill before us does that type of modification . 
i have one of my good constituents , mr. child , who bought 500 acres of land and found an endangered species on it . 
the problem is he also had 11 geese , and the federal government threatened to sue him at the rate of $ 50 , 000 for every snail the geese happened to consume . 
this gives us some idea why a small private property owner , as soon as he finds an endangered species , the goal is to get rid of the endangered species . 
the problem is that 90 percent of the habitat for endangered species is on private property . 
our goal , if we are really serious about trying to preserve endangered species of all kinds , is to get control and cooperation with small private property owners . 
it puts us backwards to the same old process of trying to threaten and intimidate , which does not work . 
this means they have little money and little funds left for actual recovery of species . 
mr. chairman , i rise in support of this bipartisan substitute and in unwavering opposition to the underlying threatened and endangered species act of 2005 , which does not defend endangered species as it purports , but rather protects the special interests of private industry and landowners . 
i am concerned about the environmental and fiscal health of our great nation and the path chosen by many of america 's leaders whose policies are painfully lacking in promoting conservation . 
although americans may debate the need to update the endangered species act of 1973 , tesra is absolutely not the answer . 
in fact , tesra is a step back , furthering the degradation of species and compounding man 's conflict with the environment . 
america is still in mourning as we enter the early stages of rebuilding the gulf coast and fighting a war in iraq and afghanistan costing our nation hundreds upon hundreds of billions of taxpayer dollars . 
particularly egregious is that tesra will cost nearly $ 3 billion in new spending in just the next 4 years , which will be used not to protect threatened and endangered species , but rather the interests of private landowners . 
taxpayers should be outraged by the fiscal irresponsibility of this congress . 
in my district , hardworking families are struggling to absorb the high costs of fuel into their budget while putting food on their tables and sending their children to college . 
the american public deserves a future that includes true protection of our endangered species and the development of fuel sources that are clean , renewable and promote conservation and energy independence . 
no matter how the proponents of the bill classify putting soft words and talking about it being reasonable or a compromise , it does not make it so . 
this is less about reform of the esa and protecting species , and more about making it easier for the exploitation of the environment . 
we have been in a state of stalemate for a number of years because the goal has not been reasonable refinement . 
the batting average analogy of my friend from utah simply misses the point . 
i have an urban creek that flows 26 miles through the heart of my congressional district . 
there are many troubling aspects of this legislation . 
putting in the hands , we have seen in this administration , of political appointees really perverting the decisionmaking in the name of science , these are not people that i think we ought to turn this over to willy-nilly . 
but the most troubling part of the legislation is found in the new entitlement program contained in section 14 . 
it goes far beyond paying people to obey the law , far beyond compensating for loss of customary use . 
it is providing a form of environmental blackmail and promotes endless legal battles . 
i urge my colleagues to reject the rule and this radical rollback of the endangered species act . 
mr. chairman , i will support the bipartisan substitute amendment by my colleagues , the gentleman from california ( mr. george miller ) xz4002780 and the gentleman from new york ( mr. boehlert ) xz4000350 because it is an honest effort to make it a better alternative that does not include the most egregious parts of the underlying bill . 
i take modest exception to the implication that was made from the other side of the aisle that somehow the endangered species act and environmental legislation had something to do with the tragedy we witnessed unfurl in the katrina-affected region . 
the gao presented a report yesterday saying that the delays in the project , that none of the changes are believed to have had any role in the levee breaches . 
lake pontchartrain and vicinity hurricane protection project congress first authorized the lake pontchartrain and vicinity , louisiana hurricane protection project in the flood control act of 1965 . 
the project was to construct a series of control structures , concrete floodwalls , and levees to provide hurricane protection to areas around lake pontchartrain . 
the original project designs were developed based on the equivalent of what is now called a fast-moving category 3 hurricane that might strike the coastal louisiana region once in 200-300 years . 
as gao reported in 1976 and 1982 , since the beginning of the project , the corps has encountered project delays and cost increases due to design changes caused by technical issues , environmental concerns , legal challenges , and local opposition to portions of the project . 
none of the changes made to the project , however , are believed to have had any role in the levee breaches recently experienced as the alternative design selected was expected to provide the same level of protection . 
in fact , corps officials believe that flooding would have been worse if the original the current estimated cost of construction for the completed project is $ 738 million with the federal share being $ 528 million and the local share $ 210 million . 
federal allocations for the project were $ 458 million as of the enactment of the fiscal year 2005 federal appropriation . 
this represents 87 percent of the federal government 's responsibility of $ 528 million with about $ 70 million remaining to complete the project . 
while this may not be unusual given the state of completion of the project , the corps ' project fact sheet from may 2005 noted 
mr. chairman , i rise in reluctant support of this amendment . 
i am especially frustrated that both bills repeal the critical habitat provisions of the esa , which are crucial to the recovery of species . 
i plan to vote against final passage of any legislation that repeals this important provision . 
it does not include the most egregious parts of h.r. 3824 which make a mockery of science and conservation . 
in fact , at shortstop they have a very able player , and they are hot in the middle of a pennant race . 
having said that , i rise in strong support of the rule and in strong opposition to the base bill which we hope with a substitute , the bipartisan substitute , to improve substantially and make it a product worthy of the support of the entire house . 
the current version of the bill was not available until monday afternoon . 
everyone concerned with endangered species both inside and outside of government has been scrambling to understand what is h.r. 3824 . 
the congressional research service , a bunch of outside groups that we look to for some advice and counseling , they are scrambling . 
we should not be dealing with the most fundamental rewrite of an environmental statute in 15 years in this manner . 
there are so many areas of agreement that we have , let us find common ground . 
mr. chairman , i would just like to correct a couple of things . 
first of all , this is mandatory spending we are talking about . 
the list of areas of disagreement are very strong , but i would also point out that we in the substitute bill embrace many of the provisions in the base bill because they need to be addressed in a responsible way and , in many cases , we take the exact language . 
i have no quarrel with the stated purpose of the bill -- to reform the endangered species act . 
i urge my colleagues to look beyond the descriptions of the bill and to examine the bill itself . 
the most advertised feature of the bill is that it gets rid of the current `` critical habitat '' provisions of the law and replaces the habitat requirements with flexible , comprehensive , science-based `` recovery plans. '' sounds pretty good . 
and it would be pretty good if that were a full description of what the bill did . 
so is there a way to get rid of the current `` critical habitat '' burdens and to use recovery plans without weakening the law ? 
of course there is . 
we eliminate all the provisions of current law that require critical habitat designations just as in h.r. 3824 , but we make recovery plans enforceable and we ensure that they have strong scientific basis . 
the bill weakens just about every feature of law designed to protect species -- for example , the review of federal actions to make sure they do not unduly harm species . 
in fact , many of its provisions -- the incentives for landowners to protect species , the public information requirements , the requirements to better involve the states -- are largely improvements to the law . 
so we commend the resources committee for so many of the bill 's provisions and we embrace them . 
but there is one provision of h.r. 3824 that our substitute does not include at all . 
i urge my colleagues of defeat h.r. 3824 , which just waves the banner of reform to distract attention from its actual content . 
mr. chairman , i rise in strong support of the substitute . 
i want to thank all of our co-sponsors for their support , the gentleman from michigan ( mr. dingell ) xz4001100 , the gentleman from washington ( mr. dicks ) xz4001090 , the gentleman from new jersey ( mr. saxton ) xz4003590 , the gentlewoman from california ( mrs. tauscher ) xz4003960 , the gentleman from illinois ( mr. kirk ) xz4002220 , the gentlewoman from california ( ms. matsui ) xz4002562 , the gentleman from illinois ( mr. johnson ) xz4002041 , and the gentleman from new hampshire ( mr. bass ) xz4000190 . 
that is a pretty good sampling of congressional centrists because there is a moderate , targeted solution . 
both the bill and the substitute require greater involvement of states in decisionmaking involving species . 
in fact , while it is hard to quantify , i would guess about 80 to 90 percent of the language in the substitute is identical to the base bill . 
that is because we developed the substitute by reading through the base bill , once we could seize a copy , and by incorporating into our substitute every word of h.r. 3824 that we possibly could . 
and most of all what we could not accept was the new mandatory spending required by this bill which would open the federal purse to developers while eliminating basic taxpayer protections . 
mr. chairman , i reserve the balance of my time . 
mr. chairman , i yield 3 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from new jersey ( mr. saxton ) xz4003590 , an informed and valued member of the committee on resources . 
mr. chairman , i reserve the balance of my time . 
there are a number of differences , but a principal difference . 
a developer could buy a parcel of land knowing that part of it could not be used because of the presence of endangered species . 
the developer then could request permission to build , say , a hotel on the property without doing much more than outlining the proposal on the back of an envelope . 
in the meantime , the developer could proceed with the same project on other portions of the property , make substantial profits on his property , and never have that affect the steady stream of payments coming from the government from what was always known to be a problematic site . 
that is why the same concerns that we have expressed to our colleagues on the floor today have been expressed by the administration in the statement of administration policy , which is otherwise supportive of the bill , in part because of the provisions that we also have in our substitute . 
the statement of administration policy warns : `` the new conservation aid program for private property owners provides little discretion to federal agencies and could result in a significant budgetary impact ... .. 
the committee on resources has put a lot of hard work into and has come up with a product that , in many respects , is just wonderful , necessary . 
but section 13 is absolutely , totally unacceptable for a whole lot of very good reasons , and it is unacceptable to the taxpayers of america because , boy , does this impose a burden on them . 
it emphasizes the need of small property owners , and we want to help them . 
mr. chairman , i yield back the balance of my time . 
mr. chairman , in washington everything looks perfect on paper and people hate to admit they made a mistake ; but the truth of the matter is how it works in real life is completely different , and we have a responsibility to make those changes . 
but for decades , responsible landowners have been afraid that the federal government would swoop in and take their livelihood away for the sake of this bird due simply to the outdated and unsubstantiated burdens of the endangered species act . 
unfortunately , current law has created incentives for landowners to destroy species habitat to rid their properties of liability . 
mr. chairman , in the 32 years that the endangered species act has been in effect , we have learned a lot of lessons over time and seen the areas where it needs some improvement . 
i believe that the gentleman from california ( chairman pombo ) and other members of the house committee on resources have worked very hard to come up with a piece of legislation that protects property owners ' rights and improves the way that we protect and rehabilitate endangered species , and i am proud to be an original cosponsor of this legislation . 
mr. chairman , one of the most important aspects of h.r. 3824 deals with private property owners ' participation in species recovery . 
specifically , h.r. 3824 will provide certainty for private property owners by allowing landowners to request a written determination as to whether their land use activities will violate the take prohibitions of section 9. it will also compensate private property owners for the fair market value for foregone use of their property where the secretary has determined that the use of that property would constitute a take under section 9. i believe we should protect our endangered species but not at the expense of our private landowners . 
mr. chairman , there is a better way to protect endangered species ; and i believe it is h.r. 3824 , the threatened and endangered species recovery act of 2005 . 
i encourage my colleagues to vote `` no '' on the miller substitute amendment and `` yes '' on the final passage of h.r. 3824 . 
one of the most effective ways to protect species habitat is through development of habitat conservation plans . 
these important provisions will free up limited government and landowner resources and ultimately improve conservation of species habitat by encouraging more habitat conservation plans . 
in fact , the west riverside county multi-species conservation plan is the largest in the nation covering over 1 million acres of land . 
the plan cost tens of millions of dollars to develop , years to put into effect , and will cost upward of $ 1 billion to implement . 
it is our responsibility to ensure when landowners and local authorities undertake an extensive planning like that back in my district , the federal government lives up to its part of the agreement . 
i just discovered in the miller-boehlert substitute that the habitat conservation plans that we put a lot of time in to work out in southern california may be put at risk . 
that would be very , very difficult for areas that spent large amounts of money to put this into effect , not to mention time . 
mr. chairman , i would like to thank the chairman of the full committee , the gentleman from california ( mr. pombo ) xz4003220 . 
i rise in opposition to the substitute amendment and in support of the underlying bill . 
i would like to congratulate the gentleman from california ( mr. pombo ) xz4003220 on many , many years of hard work on this issue . 
by my count , the number of democrats who voted for the underlying bill in committee was greater than the number of democrats who voted against it . 
we need to have some kind of a compensatory process , and we do not have that in the substitute bill . 
what that is , i do not know that we can figure that out until we have done a lot of litigation and have been through a great deal of pain in america . 
and a landowner , after he volunteers , could get 70 percent of his costs back for participating in the program . 
i urge support of the underlying bill and opposition to the substitute amendment . 
as i have sat here and listened to the debate on the rule , i simply do not feel that some of the statements by my colleagues are accurately reflecting what is in the bill as it currently is written . 
we are not going to be using taxpayer dollars to promote strip clubs or casinos , as one of my colleagues said . 
the reality is that under the endangered species act , most of the provisions of the act , as it currently stands , will be in place . 
that is a longstanding right of this country , to be compensated when government takes one 's property . 
we had a vote recently on this floor of over 400 members who said exactly that in one of the eminent domain cases that was recently challenged , when the supreme court took someone 's property . 
we have a longstanding tradition here of protecting personal property rights but not when it comes to the endangered species act . 
in my state , the fish and wildlife service said that 4.7 million acres of california had to be set-aside for the red-legged frog , 1.7 million acres for vernal pools and fairy shrimp . 
those in support of the substitute have been distributing a handout , and in the substitute it says virtually everything that the gentleman from california ( mr. pombo ) xz4003220 and i and others have written and coordinated on . 
in fact , about 90 percent of this bill was written by democratic staff . 
there is 10 percent disagreement on this bill , and virtually what that 10 percent disagreement is , is whether or not people are going to be compensated when their land is taken and the fact that there has been a new focus , according to some of my colleagues , of putting the onus of this bill mainly on to public lands . 
well , the reality is most of the endangered species , in fact , 90 percent of the endangered species , are on private lands . 
mr. chairman , when the endangered species act was adopted by congress in 1973 , it was heralded as landmark use of environmental legislation for the protection and conservation of threatened and endangered species . 
at that time , it was clearly understood that the ultimate goal of the act was to focus federal resources on listed species so that , in time , they could be returned to a healthy state and be removed from the list . 
i fully support the goal of species protection and conservation and believe that recovery and ultimately delisting of species should be the u.s. fish and wildlife service 's top priority under esa . 
i am in full support of the threatened and endangered species recovery act that we are hearing today because i think it is an innovative and creative approach to ending the long-running conflict between protecting species and enforcing conservation actions on private land . 
there seems to be no question that esa is due for an update since the substitute offered by many of my colleagues eliminates critical habitat in much the same manner as h.r. 3824 . 
currently , the system of critical habitat designations is so dysfunctional that it seems to defy logic . 
almost one-third of the entire acreage of merced county , where i live , would have been designated as critical habitat . 
coming up with a thoughtful way to enable recovery of endangered species without costly litigation has been a top priority for me since being elected to the congress , and i am pleased that this bill does just that . 
my original bill , h.r. 2933 , from the 108th congress , tied the development of a recovery plan to the designation of critical habitat . 
that has been reported by a number of my colleagues , and it is simply not true . 
in fact , i think many of my colleagues would be interested to know that my office has been inundated by representatives from so-called industry lobbyists requesting that certain provisions that were once included in this bill be put back in . 
i think it is unfortunate that the media and some members of the environmental community have chosen to vilify this bipartisan legislation over the past few weeks and provide nothing but a knee-jerk negative analysis because they have already prejudged chairman pombo 's bill as being the enemy . 
i am proud of this bill , and i am proud of the work that chairman pombo and his staff have done to create a document that is truly a compromise , and it is a real shame we could not agree on these last few things . 
whether some people want to admit it or not , the esa is not working to the best of its ability to protect the species , and it is our job as members of congress to do something about it . 
we can do better , and better is voting in favor of this bill . 
mr. chairman , i reserve the balance of my time . 
mr. chairman , i yield 1 1/2 minutes to the gentleman from the great state of oklahoma ( mr. boren ) xz4006450 . 
mr. chairman , i reserve the balance of my time . 
we should not require those same landowners to renegotiate what they have already agreed to under the new rules of this bill after it is enacted . 
based on that premise , i believe the threatened and endangered species recovery act should include a grandfather clause to cover any esa permits or approvals issued prior to the date of enactment of this bill , not just habitat conservation plans . 
i would inquire , is that the intent of the gentleman from california ( mr. pombo ) xz4003220 ? 
mr. chairman , i yield myself the balance of my time . 
i want to conclude by saying i thank the gentleman from west virginia ( mr. rahall ) xz4003310 for his offering of working on this piece of legislation , and we do so in the spirit of cooperation . 
i also have to say , though , that in this chamber where we have seen lofty rhetoric for a number of years , i personally having witnessed it for 26 since i was first an intern here , i have frankly never seen the rhetoric not coincide with the reality more than in this case oftentimes . 
mr. chairman , i rise today in opposition to the substitute being offered for a number of reasons . 
the substitute basically takes the pombo bill and cuts out everything that is important to my constituents , the small farmers and ranchers of the central valley who are being driven out of our valley through arbitrary and capricious regulatory burdens . 
what i can not support is the removal of 2 provisions that i find absolutely critical to any reforms to the esa : mandatory landowner notification , and the conservation compensation plans for effective landowners . 
many of the opponents of this provision claim that landowners can simply go to court and get a decision but in reality , they can not because the court has ruled in previous cases that unless the service tells them no directly they have no standing in court . 
this provision is crucial , especially to the little guy who does not have millions and millions of dollars to higher lawyers , biologists and surveyors needed to take on the service . 
the service is under a number of other time lines under esa such as a time line for completing political opinions which they also choose to ignore . 
i do have to say that i am pleased that my colleagues chose to include a number of provisions from the underlying bill in the substitute . 
the fact that the substitute includes the same repeal of critical habit speaks volumes for the overall consensus that this act needs to be changed and updated to reflect the evolving circumstances on the ground that have impeded the accurate critical habit designations . 
but the deleted provisions from h.r. 3824 and the new definition of jeopardy , under which , frankly , i am not sure if i could mow my own lawn , will do nothing to relieve the conflict that currently exists under that esa . 
so a farmer who is plowing his field and trying to grow a crop every day , if he is denied the use of that property , he can only be compensated for the loss of his farming income and he can not claim that it could be a high rise hotel in its place . 
i applaud my colleagues here today for offering this amendment in the nature of a substitute . 
it goes a long way in making meaningful reforms to the endangered species act without hollowing the fundamental goals of america 's flagship wildlife conservation efforts . 
while there have been successes in species recovery since enactment of the 32-year-old endangered species act , most would agree that it is in need of real reform to make it more effective in species recovery , less demanding on some landowners , and less prone to lawsuits and bureaucracy . 
however , pushing the problematic and prohibitively expensive h.r. 3824 , the threatened and endangered species recovery act through the legislative process has left a sour taste in many of our mouths because it removes the enforceable protections for species recovery and creates the entitlement program for private landowners . 
at a time when our country is still coping with the cost of the wars in iraq and afghanistan , and most recently with hurricanes katrina and rita , one has to wonder why a rewrite of the endangered species act that includes an entitlement program is even a consideration . 
this substitute will improve the recovery of more species , put back into place needed enforcement of species recovery plans , and it will do all of this and much more without creating an entitlement program . 
this bipartisan substitute is a more pragmatic solution , and i urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support it . 
mr. chairman , would the chairman of the committee on resources agree to enter into a colloquy ? 
mr. chairman , it has come to my attention that certain federal agencies with permitting , licensing , and leasing authority are requiring some of my constituents to agree to stipulations in their coal leases that go beyond protecting threatened or endangered species . 
for example , before the bureau of land management will issue a lease , they require the lessee to agree to potential modifications in the lease . 
section 10 of the bill authorizes cooperative agreements between federal agencies and states that cover candidate species and any other species that the state and the secretary agree is at risk of being listed as an endangered or threatened species . 
is the intent of the legislation to broaden the scope of the esa by allowing the government to regulate species that are not yet threatened or endangered by imposing new potential regulatory requirements , withholding of permits and licenses , or requiring special stipulations on federal leases ? 
i wore my eagle tie today in the hope that we will continue to protect the bald eagle , the symbol of our country . 
among them , and one that has to give pause to this body as we wrestle with how we are going to pay for hurricane katrina and other essential things here , and how much money is being borrowed in the name of future generations , is a section regarding compensation . 
if you ranch and you can not graze the cattle , you get paid the value of the area on which you can not graze your cattle . 
if you grew a crop and there is some sort of restriction and you can not grow that crop , then you would be compensated . 
and my destination resort would have provided me with a profit of $ 1 million a year for the next 30 years . 
this is going to be hundreds of millions , if not billions a year of a new entitlement . 
so taxpayers are going to be obligated to borrow money for speculative , possible potential future profits , and maybe even a little on top of that because the secretary can not compensate less than the fair market value . 
we will compensate you for the loss of harvest of the trees , but we are not going to pay for that speculative value . 
i can not believe that any member of this house is going to open the doors to the treasury so wide for potential speculation . 
if that amendment had been allowed , i think many more members could support this bill ; but that amendment was not allowed here in the house of representatives today . 
it is a perfect bill , and no amendment should be allowed here on the floor , but we are going to put the taxpayers on the hook for billions of dollars . 
take a piece of remote farm land , propose a huge development on it ; it does not have to be proven to be economically viable . 
the legislation before us today turns back the clock on 35 years of progress in responsible environmental stewardship by gutting the current endangered species act and replacing it with little to preserve endangered wildlife for future generations . 
over 99 percent of the species that have been listed as threatened or endangered under current law have been saved from extinction . 
but had this bill been the law of the land over the last 30 years , the fish and wildlife service points out that the bald eagle -- an icon of american freedom -- would exist only in our memones . 
any law that is 35 years old should be looked at with a fresh eye , and so i am supportive of attempts to update and improve the endangered species act . 
indeed , in my home state of connecticut , we are concerned that oysters , a key aquaculture product , may be unnecessarily characterized as an endangered species . 
but that is not the intent of the underlying bill . 
rather , the purpose of this legislation is to remove obstacles inconvenient to special interests with whom the republican leadership is in partnership . 
as such , this legislation would eliminate conservation measures on tens of millions of acres of land around the country , the `` critical habitat '' of endangered species , and prevent such conservation activities in the future . 
current law requires a review of all scientific and commercial data by a panel of outside scientists . 
this , mr. chairman , ensures that the peer-review process -- a central tenet of sound scientific research -- guides the process , not ideology and politics . 
instead , this bill would allow the secretary of the interior to make a determination about whether a species is endangered based on `` all available information '' -- that is to say , information that opens the door for phony science supporting special interests . 
this bill is nothing more than yet another entitlement program for special interests -- as always , with this majority , at the expense of the taxpayer . 
mr. chairman , the endangered species act is a statement of our priorities as americans . 
it is an affirmation of our belief that , just as we desire better economic opportunity for our children and future generations , so too do we hope to leave them a healthier environment . 
this is simply the continuation of a decade-long assault by the majority on our clean air , our clean water and our environment . 
according to the national research council , the endangered species act has saved hundreds of species from extinction . 
a study published in the `` annual review of ecological semantics '' calculated that 172 species would potentially have gone extinct during the period from 1973 to 1998 if endangered species act protection had not been implemented . 
according to the fish and wildlife service , 99 percent of the species ever listed under the endangered species act remain on the planet today . 
according to the u.s. fish and wildlife service , of the listed species whose condition is known , 68 percent are stable or improving , and 32 percent are declining . 
everybody has been saying that h.r. 3824 has been this great effort in terms of collaboration , and i respect that . 
i come from the state of washington . 
no part of the country has been more affected by the endangered species act than the state of washington with the spotted owl listings and the marbled murrelet listings ; but i believe that this legislation , h.r. 3824 , is a step backwards . 
in fact , the substitute amendment that i have cosponsored with the gentleman from california ( mr. george miller ) xz4002780 , the gentleman from new york ( mr. boehlert ) xz4000350 , and others that will be debated later today embodies those kinds of practical reforms which still provide us the kind of potent tools necessary to prevent extinction of species and to work towards their recovery . 
there are some aspects of this bill that i agree with to a point . 
over time , many supporters of the esa have come to question the way in which habitat is designated as critical in order to help species recovery . 
the substitute amendment also eliminates the critical habitat designation , but replaces it with the requirement that the interior secretary identify specific areas that are necessary for the conservation of species and then enforce these designations . 
another provision of this bill is one offered by my friend from oregon , but the idea that we are not any longer going to have epa consult on pesticides is a tragic mistake . 
sixty-seven million birds each year die because of pesticides ; and if we let this pesticide provision be enacted , it will be the most damaging thing i can think of for birds and other wildlife . 
you just said , take it out of the interior appropriations bill . 
well , i want to tell you , we have not funded the endangered species act properly under this administration , and if there is not any money , it is going to have to come out of somebody else 's hide . 
mr. chairman , i want to thank my dear friend , the gentleman from west virginia ( mr. rahall ) xz4003310 , not only for his friendship , but for all the good things he has done on the matter of endangered species and other matters on nature and conservation of natural resources . 
i want to pay tribute to my friend , the chairman of the committee . 
but he has made an honest effort and i want him to know of my appreciation and respect . 
having said that , endangered species is a very important piece of legislation that has worked well . 
large numbers of species which would have been extinct are saved by the fact that this has been in place . 
i would note that the success of the act i do not believe would be furthered by the adoption of the manager 's amendment , but it would be by the substitute to be offered . 
i would note that there is reason to constantly review the legislative pronouncements of the congress and to see how it is working and what needs to be changed to make it work better and more fairly . 
56 percent of the top prescription drugs in the world contain natural compounds from plants found in the wild , many of which come from endangered plants . 
we have saved large numbers of animals who might otherwise have been extinct . 
science is the core of esa and should remain so . 
h.r. 3824 regrettably changes it so that scientific data do not work in the same fashion they do and it creates new layers of bureaucracy . 
it also creates impacts which are supposedly related to national security , which may be important in terms of the recovery plan but not in terms of whether the animal should be listed or the species should be listed . 
they become a part of the decisionmaking rather than in the creation of the recovery plan . 
it is unfortunate that the legislation allows threatened species to dwindle until they become endangered , making the problem of recovery still more difficult . 
we can and we should address the real needs of small farmers , landowners , ranchers and others ; and we can do this , i believe , without allowing unlimited claims upon the treasury . 
this would , i think , entail an intelligent review of this matter , something which the gentleman from california ( mr. pombo ) xz4003220 and i tried to do . 
i would note that the president has expressed concerns in his statement of the administrative policy on september 29 and he says , `` requirements related to species recovery agreements , new statutory deadlines , new conservation and programs for private property owners provide little discretion to federal agencies and could result in a significant budgetary impact. '' so if you want fiscally and financially responsible legislation , legislation which , in fact , protects the species , which is fair to all , which makes progress and which is close to the area of the legislation but which has broad citizen support , conservation support , and does move the process forward , i would urge my colleagues to support the substitute which will be offered by my colleagues , the gentleman from california ( mr. george miller ) xz4002780 , and the gentleman from new york ( mr. boehlert ) xz4000350 . 
we can continue our efforts to try in good faith as has been done by both the distinguished gentleman from west virginia ( mr. rahall ) xz4003310 and the distinguished gentleman from california ( mr. pombo ) xz4003220 to achieve good legislation which will again address the concerns of all while at the same time protecting and conserving species which we have no right to remove from this world . 
mr. chairman , i rise in strong support of the substitute . 
it is supported by members of congress from every part of the country . 
it is not only a unique and valuable bipartisan piece of legislation , but it is one that will work . 
in order , however , to maintain a strong esa , the substitute gives a strong definition of what is meant to jeopardize continued existence of the species . 
science is the core principle of esa and we direct the secretary to issue , and regularly revise , guidance on the acceptable scientific measures . 
mr. chairman , this amendment represents a broad bipartisan and fiscally responsible effort to move this process forward in a manner that can not only get an overwhelming vote of support in the house , but which can move on to the president 's desk for signature in the same manner as the original act . 
i urge my colleagues to support the substitute , and i say that it will be not only a successful undertaking , but one which will be much more in the interests of the landowners and of the species that we are trying to protect and preserve . 
mr. chairman , it has been represented that this legislation is going to cost billions of dollars potentially , and for that reason we should reject it in the fiscal crisis in which we currently live . 
fiscal conservatives like myself and grover norquist of americans for tax reform support this important legislation . 
i might also note , as a representative of one of the districts that has vast amounts of property in the mountains and so forth , that a lot of small property owners , people who want to use their property , have that ability compromised by the cloud that is placed over their property once they get word of a threatened or endangered species . 
the bill of the gentleman from california ( mr. pombo ) xz4003220 makes it certain and provides a process for compensation . 
it can cost you many , many thousands of dollars and a great deal of worry . 
mr. speaker , i thank my friend for yielding me this time , and i thank him for his very important work on this vital piece of legislation . 
i rise to support the rule and the underlying legislation and to begin by praising the gentleman from california ( mr. pombo ) xz4003220 , the very distinguished chairman , for all of the effort that he has put in to assembling a bipartisan compromise on this . 
i will say i am somewhat disturbed with what i just heard from the gentleman from california ( mr. cardoza ) xz4000650 that 90 percent of this legislation was , in fact , crafted by democratic staff . 
but i will say that if it embraces the core republican goals that the gentleman from california ( mr. pombo ) xz4003220 is pursuing , i still will be supportive of it . 
but i think that that is demonstration of the fact that we are working in a bipartisan way and the gentleman from california ( mr. pombo ) xz4003220 has demonstrated his willingness to do just that . 
when i think about the long struggle which the gentleman from california ( mr. pombo ) xz4003220 has been involved in for a decade to try to bring about reform of the endangered species act , i think back to one of the challenges that we have in southern california , and the gentleman from california ( mr. calvert ) xz4000570 , who has worked long and hard on this , represents part of riverside county , and i recounted up in the committee on rules yesterday the fact that dealing with the stephens ' kangaroo rat , an endangered species , we had conflicting directives that came from government . 
the fire department in riverside county said you should clear the brush away from your homes to ensure that you do not face the threat of fire . 
the county of riverside said to comply with the endangered species act we would be jeopardizing the stephens ' kangaroo rat 's life . 
to their benefit , many people who followed the directive of the fire department , their homes were saved ; and , of course , those who did not tragically lost their homes because of fire . 
we right now in southern california are dealing with tremendous fire problems in that area ; and , frankly , i do believe that the kind of reform that is going to be assembled in a bipartisan way on the endangered species act will go a long way toward preserving property and to make sure that we diminish the kind of threat that does exist out there . 
recovery efforts , coupled with compensation for private property , that is a big part of what this effort is about . 
i congratulate , again , the gentleman from california ( mr. pombo ) xz4003220 ; and i know the gentleman from california ( mr. cardoza ) xz4000650 has been working very hard on this , obviously , because he has had a lot of impact , as he just outlined . 
mr. chairman , i rise in strong support of the threatened and endangered species recovery act , h.r. 3824 . 
i want to first of all commend the gentleman from california ( chairman pombo ) and the gentleman from california ( mr. cardoza ) xz4000650 for what is very commonsense , bipartisan legislation ; and i want to thank the chairman and his staff for all the long hours and the hard work they have put into this bill . 
the latest figures i have show that my home state of tennessee has one of the highest numbers of listings on the endangered species list . 
the burden of compliance under present law is , by far , the hardest for the smallest of our landowners . 
they have enough money , and compliance with the law is either a simple nuisance or just a small cost of doing business . 
i think , and the fact is , that the way the present law is , it drives out a lot of the competition for the big guys by getting rid of some of the little guys . 
`` well , the bill before us today is proof the `` era of big government has come again ! 
i oppose this sham overhaul of the endangered species act . 
of the more than 1 , 800 plants and animals protected by the act , only 9 percent have been declared extinct . 
the endangered species act has been a model for the protection and preservation of endangered species since 1973 . 
when this legislation was first passed , many species in this country were on the brink of extinction , and many more were in severe decline . 
esa is a great american success story that should only be altered with the greatest of care . 
in the thirty years since the passage of the endangered species act , we have seen an amazing turnaround in both the population numbers of species that were in decline , as well as in the significant environmental improvements that have fostered their recovery . 
i acknowledge the concerns of landowners and farmers about the current law , and i agree that the current law needs to be reformed . 
finally , it provides assurances that private citizens will get timely answers from the fish & amp ; wildlife service regarding the status of endangered species requirements on their land . 
h.r. 3824 was introduced just last week and was marked up without any public hearings , yet this legislation would most certainly rank as the most sweeping and significant change of environmental law in the past three decades . 
habitat degradation is the leading cause of species decline , and this bill proposes to eliminate critical habitat designations . 
i do not understand how eliminating protected areas can result in greater protection of endangered species . 
we have a solemn obligation to maintain responsible stewardship of america 's bounty , and this legislation would abandon that responsibility . 
i urge my colleagues to vote against h.r. 3824 , and to vote in favor of the balanced , bipartisan substitute legislation for esa reform . 
mr. chairman , i rise today as a cosponsor of h.r. 3824 , the threatened and endangered species recovery act . 
alabama ranks in the top five states in the number of listed species , and passage of this legislation will move us closer to achieving the goal of protecting and recovering the nation 's threatened and endangered species by adding a layer of common sense . 
the endangered species act , esa , although enacted with honorable intentions , has strayed from its original purpose of conserving plants and wildlife . 
since the enactment of the esa , only 10 species , less than 1 percent of those listed as endangered , have been recovered . 
this is just one of the numerous reasons why this legislation needs updating . 
most importantly , the manager 's amendment includes a significant provision that requires the fish and wildlife service to consider the economic and national security impact of listing a species . 
this impact analysis is an important tool that provides vital information to congress , federal agencies , states , and landowners about the potential effects of the esa within those geographic areas deemed to be essential for the species ' survival and recovery . 
i would like to thank chairman pombo for all his hard work on crafting this important piece of legislation , and i am very appreciative of his efforts to include this provision in his manager 's amendment . 
by enhancing the rights of private property owners and improving the impact analysis of the listing process , the esa will actually work to protect endangered species . 
i urge all of my colleagues to support this measure . 
i probably represent more critical habitat in the coastal counties of monterey bay than anybody . 
that critical habitat has made us a lot of money on what is watchable wildlife . 
of all the sports in this country , watchable wildlife exceeds them all . 
well , it is not the bill that is at fault ; it is the united states congress and the president of the united states that are at fault . 
i am on the committee on appropriations , and in 2003 the fish and wildlife service said it needed approximately $ 153 million to address the critical backlog of listings of critical habitat ; yet the president only asked for $ 18 million . 
pebble beach , cut all of your cypress trees and pine trees , which are the monterey cypress and the monterey pines , because now instead of beautiful scenery , you can build hotels all over that land . 
and if they do not allow you to do that because of the trees , the government will pay you . 
mr. chairman , i rise in support of the underlying amendment , because in the middle of the night , the manager 's amendment removed the noaa fisheries provision in the interior . 
mr. chairman , once again california leads the nation : this time it is for the number of listings for threatened and endangered species . 
another example is the big sur area of california where you can find redwoods from northern california growing next to the yucca of southern california . 
the endangered species act is one of america 's most important and successful environmental laws . 
as one of the pillars of environmental law , it has brought public attention to the impact of human activities on our nation 's wildlife that contributes so much beauty and delight to life as well as growing economic development in environmental tourism . 
but it also goes beyond that to declare the preservation of such species as the american bald eagle and the california condor , that glide on the thermals along the big sur coastline , a national priority . 
while opponents of the law complain that it has restored healthy populations of only 16 of the more than 1 , 800 species on its endangered list , dozens of other species have dramatically increased their populations because of the law 's protection . 
without the esa these species could easily have succumbed to extinction as corporations and developers decided the fate of their habitats . 
ninety-eight percent of the species protected under the endangered species act are still alive today , and many are stable or improving . 
without the endangered species act , wildlife such as the bald eagle , american alligator , california condor , florida panther and many other animals that are part of america 's natural heritage could have disappeared from the planet years ago . 
with the recent discovery of the once thought to be extinct ivory-billed woodpecker in arkansas and the mount diablo buckwheat in california , i think this is an opportune moment to highlight the success of many of our conservation efforts . 
for example , in my home state of california , i am especially proud of the conservation and management efforts that have helped significantly restore populations of california condor , the southern sea otter , the winter run chinook salmon , the least bell 's vireo songbird , the california brown pelican , and the california gray whale . 
while the southern sea otter still has a long way to go before being delisted , the increased numbers of sea otters along my district shoreline have greatly contributed to our tourism economy . 
the dramatic turnaround realized by the once thought extinct southern sea otter is a result of two critical protection laws -- the esa and the marine mammal protection act , the southern sea otter population grew from less than 100 otters in the 1930 's to the present total of 2 , 800 . 
as reauthorization of the esa moves forward this week in the house , i will fight to keep it strong enough to successfully overcome these threats to the southern sea otter . 
one small step is to increase awareness about the seriousness of the circumstances facing many of these endangered species and educating the public about these species . 
i know the esa has it 's problems and the proponents of this legislation have brought many of those cases to light today . 
any law that has been on the books for as long as the endangered species act will have issues -- some of these issues deal with inadequate funding , and some with the law itself . 
mr. chairman , i want to use the rest of my time to discuss a specific provision to move the national oceanic and atmospheric administration 's esa responsibilities to the department of interior . 
as you know , many of our constituents across the country care deeply about , whales , salmon , and sea turtles . 
giving jurisdiction of the ocean animals , whose survival is most at risk , to an agency without ocean expertise is ludicrous . 
fish in one river that arrive in spring will be managed by the department of commerce , while fish that arrive in that same river during fall will be managed by the department of interior . 
will the fishermen have to choose from two sets of fishing regulations , one from the department of commerce and the other from the department of interior ? 
as the pew and us commissions on ocean policy recommended , we need to consolidate our ocean management under one roof , specifically the national oceanic and atmospheric administration in the department of commerce , to be effective . 
mr. chairman , let 's not send the message that this congress is more interested in private property development than in the common good of america the beautiful , from sea to shining sea . 
if any of my colleagues have served on the committee on resources , as i have , you know that this is a truly bipartisan bill . 
the gentleman from west virginia mentioned that everybody can find an example of how the current esa is out of whack , and he uses that as an excuse not to move forward with a bill that reforms it . 
i would say that that is precisely the reason we need to reform it , because everybody can find not just one but two or three or a dozen examples in their own state of how the current law is not leading to recovery , but it is , rather , tying people up and making individuals and organizations simply pay for a regulation rather than recovery . 
the purpose of this bill is to lead to the recovery of species , and that is what this is all about . 
my own state of arizona has had its own issues with the endangered species act . 
many times , those who manage water resources have been tied up with regulation that has required them to spend money on that rather than the recovery of species . 
mr. chairman , i appreciate the opportunity to stand in strong opposition to the substitute and in strong support of the underlying bill . 
mr. speaker , i am in strong support of this rule . 
i also want to compliment the chairman of the committee on resources . 
he has been relentlessly patient to deal with a number of issues that have affected his district and those in the western areas of the united states , and he has presented to us today a bill that will reform , refine , and reauthorize the endangered species act . 
or if you are downstream and you want more coho salmon and you believe the dam is degrading the habitat for coho salmon or other species of salmon , you are less likely to appreciate the dam ; but both sides look at the endangered species act as either reducing their economic viability or reducing species viability . 
i think we need to do a number of things that we have done in the substitute . 
we have taken the words out of the base bill . 
we create a scientifically acceptable procedure , look on page 2 of the substitute , methods , practices and procedures that are acceptable science . 
look at page 4 of the substitute , five specific criteria before you can list that species . 
we are reviewing all species every 5 years to see if the change of status is there , page 5. we repeal the critical habitat requirement in the base bill and replace it with a slightly different recovery plan . 
the recovery plan has a number of significant and important elements : a time frame for that recovery plan ; objective measurable criteria ; a description of where the site should be , and the emphasis is on federal land and not private land ; and an estimate of the cost and time it will take to recover that species . 
there are a number of changes that we have made here to the gentleman from california ( mr. pombo ) xz4003220 which i think improves on the bill . 
what species should be determined endangered , there are five criteria laid out on page 4 of the substitute . 
we have repealed the critical habitat designations , but we have replaced it with recovery plans found on page 20 of the substitute . 
it has a very specific description of where that species should be recovered , and the emphasis of where that species should be recovered is not private land ; it is public land . 
the emphasis is on public land ; but whenever you go on private land , there should be some restitution , some sharing of federal dollars with those private landowners ; and 10 percent of the appropriated amount on an annual basis of this substitute will go for that very specific purpose . 
that is taken care of . 
page 43 of the substitute , there is a national security exemption . 
mr. chairman , i think we are here in some sense , past all the clutter of people articulating their most emotional feelings , is a bill set aside some 30 years ago to have an understanding about how we as members of congress , the government , can restore the prodigious bounty of god 's creation . 
well , in the real world , well , actually , in the real world which is nature , but in the reality of the human condition , we have a lot of other little things that we have to take into consideration . 
we are part of nature 's design . 
we are part of this bounty of god 's creation . 
mr. chairman , i rise in support of h.r. 3824 , the threatened and endangered species recovery act . 
this legislation will reform the 1973 endangered species act so that real species recovery can be achieved while minimizing conflict with landowners , businesses , public land managers , and communities , and particularly the farmers and ranchers of america that my committee represents . 
since the gentleman from california ( mr. pombo ) xz4003220 introduced this bill , we have heard groups on both sides of the issue recite statistics with the intent of proving or disproving the effectiveness of the law . 
well , i do not believe i can change many minds simply by pointing out that over 99 percent of the species placed on the list are still on it . 
if i , for instance , ran a hospital where only one half of 1 percent of the critical patients who checked in recovered , i could hardly claim to be doing a good job . 
what we need is an endangered species law that not only protects the species , but allows them to recover , to expand and to get off of the endangered species list as a thriving species . 
this is , however , the record the endangered species act has today compiled , one where only one half of 1 percent of the species have recovered . 
the landowner and his right to use his land are then simply left to the mercy of the courts . 
in my own committee , the committee on agriculture , we have recently examined another example of the infringement of property rights through the use of eminent domain . 
through these provisions , this legislation will fairly compensate landowners when they must forego use of their property and provide varied and unique ways to work with landowners . 
i believe the protection of endangered species is exceedingly important , however , a law that forces federal wildlife officials to simply catalog declining species while alienating landowners and discouraging good management practices is a bad thing . 
failing to improve the lot of species in more than 99 cases out of 100 is n't working . 
the endangered species act plays a prominent role in my state of missouri with over 25 endangered and threatened species located within the borders and nine in my district . 
over the last 30 years , less than 1 percent of all listed species have been removed , and most of them have been removed because of poor data . 
i thought the intent of the esa was to recover species and not leave them on the list indefinitely . 
the language in section 10 of the bill creates `` species recovery agreements. '' basically , it is an all-inclusive incentive program that will compensate landowners for their conservation efforts . 
it is my hope that this provision will foster a better working relationship with landowners and the federal government resulting in recovery of more species . 
my underlying goal is to protect landowners while keeping intact the spirit of the esa . 
as part of the farming community , i have heard stories of farmers afraid to report an endangered species on their land because of the implication it would have on their property and their farming operation . 
my point is that the esa was more of a burden on landowners , and without the cooperation of landowners , species recovery , i do not think , will ever be successful . 
another reason why i chose to get involved in this debate is because of the implication this act has on the management of the missouri river . 
the flood control act of 1944 authorized the army corps of engineers to maintain flood control and navigation along the river . 
in the 1960s , rachel carson 's book `` silent spring '' documented the harmful effects of ddt and other pesticides on songbirds . 
this prompted a ban on ddt and the passage of the original endangered species act . 
today we are considering a bill that would usher in another silent spring by eliminating the oversight for the registration of pesticides which harm wildlife and people . 
h.r. 3824 contains a provision allowing epa to consult with itself in determining the potential impacts of pesticide registration on endangered wildlife and fish , instead of consulting with the fish and wildlife service or the national marine fisheries service , which are the expert agencies whose mission is either in whole or in part to conserve species . 
but the epa currently only requires balancing the profits from using a pesticide against the dollar value of harm caused by that pesticide . 
the endangered species act , on the other hand , recognizes what almost all americans believe , that no dollar amount can be placed on the extension of our nation 's treasured wildlife or on the human health of people who work in those fields . 
it would leave in place current safeguards by requiring an analysis based on the health of wildlife , not the company 's bottom line . 
mr. speaker , by direction of the committee on rules , i call up house resolution 470 and ask for its immediate consideration . 
mr. speaker , for the purpose of debate only , i yield the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from massachusetts ( mr. mcgovern ) xz4002630 , pending which i yield myself such time as i may consume . 
during consideration of this resolution , all time yielded is for the purpose of debate only . 
mr. speaker , house resolution 470 is a rule providing for consideration of h.r. 3824 , the threatened and endangered species recovery act of 2005 . 
the rule provides for 90 minutes of debate equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the committee on resources and waives all points of order against consideration of the bill . 
house resolution 470 provides that , in lieu of the amendment recommended by the committee on resources now printed in the bill , the amendment in the nature of a substitute consisting of the text of the committee on resources print dated september 26 shall be considered as an original bill for the purpose of amendment and shall be considered as read . 
the rule waives all points of order against the committee amendment in the nature of a substitute . 
the rule provides that amendments printed in the report may be offered only in the order printed in the report , may be offered only by a member designated in the report , shall be considered as read , shall be debatable for the time specified in the report equally divided and controlled by the proponent and opponent , shall not be subject to amendment , and shall not be subject to a demand for a division of the question in the house or in the committee of the whole . 
lastly , the resolution waives all points of order against amendments printed in the report and provides one motion to recommit , with or without instruction . 
mr. speaker , the threatened and endangered species recovery act is one of the most important bills we will consider on species recovery and property rights this year . 
i commend the gentleman from california ( chairman pombo ) and other members of the committee on resources and their staffs who have worked hard to bring this legislation to this point . 
the result of their efforts is a solid bipartisan bill that updates key parts of the endangered species act and provides enhanced protection for property owners . 
for people of the rural west where i live , there are few more important matters than modernization of the esa . 
unfortunately , some of the most well-known examples of the esa problems have occurred in my region of the country , the pacific northwest . 
for example , mr. speaker , the northwest timber industry was decimated by the listing of the spotted owl 15 years ago , only to discover that today , the spotted owls have actually been endangered and displaced by other owls . 
four years ago , water to family farms in the klamath basin in oregon was cut off in the name of the sucker fish , when everyone knew there were other measures that would truly help species recover without bankrupting businesses and families . 
every summer , in excess of $ 3 million is being spent per listed salmon . 
every summer in excess of $ 3 million per salmon is spent to spill water over dams , even though science and common sense tells us that there are better ways of species recovery . 
this is all the result of the endangered species act becoming too driven by litigation and conflict . 
simply put , this act is broken , and it is in need of updating . 
if we put off modernizing the esa , it is not just the people of my region that will suffer . 
esa 's record of recovery of listed species is abysmal . 
less than 1 percent of the species listed under the act have actually been recovered . 
according to the fish and wildlife service , only 6 percent of the species are categorized as recovering . 
this bill will require agencies to complete recovery plans within 2 years of listing . 
these plans will require the identification of lands important for species recovery , in lieu of the cumbersome and litigation-driven critical habitat process . 
in addition , the bill authorizes collaborative recovery teams made up of a diverse group of stakeholders , including people with conservation expertise as well as those whose livelihoods are affected by environmental policies . 
after all , species recovery is a national goal that benefits all americans , and the cost of that effort should not fall solely on the shoulders of land holders . 
stronger science and esa information will result in our limited federal resources going to where they will do the most good , while reducing instances of drastic federal actions being taken on poor or limited data . 
mr. speaker , i reserve the balance of my time . 
mr. speaker , i yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from utah ( mr. bishop ) xz4000291 , a valued member of the committee on rules . 
mr. speaker , i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from new york ( mr. boehlert ) xz4000350 , chairman of the committee on science . 
my point was during the markup of the rule , there was no attempt on the other side to amend the rule to make his amendment in order . 
mr. speaker , i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from maryland ( mr. gilchrest ) xz4001490 , a member of the committee on resources . 
mr. speaker , i yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from california ( mr. dreier ) xz4001150 , distinguished chairman of the committee on rules . 
mr. speaker , i am pleased to yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from california ( mr. pombo ) xz4003220 , the chairman of the committee on resources , the author of this bill , and somebody who has worked extremely hard on this for at least 12 years . 
mr. speaker , i yield myself the balance of my time . 
mr. speaker , there has been a lot of rhetoric thus far on the rule , and i suspect there will be a lot of rhetoric when we debate the bill ; but there is one underlying thread here that needs to be mentioned . 
i came here 10 years ago , and this is one of the big issues that was very important to my constituency when i first ran . 
we did get a bill out of committee . 
i do not know what the reasons are , but i expect the reasons are the inflammation of the existing act . 
so with that , mr. speaker , i urge support of the rule . 
mr. speaker , i yield back the balance of my time , and i move the previous question on the resolution . 
mr. chairman , i rise in support of the legislation offered by the gentleman from california ( mr. pombo ) and would like to give you an example of why this bill is needed . 
and , at first , it did n't even seem like it would be that much of a problem . 
the mouse was a nocturnal animal that dwelt within a hundred feet of either side of streambeds . 
the front range of the rockies could also claim at least three government reservations -- the u.s. air force academy , rocky flats and warren afb in wyoming -- which offered the mouse almost untrammeled range in which to roam . 
but over the course of the next seven years , the lines moved . 
over the past seven years , the state of colorado spent approximately $ 8 million to preserve the mouse . 
counties up and down the front range spent even more money to acquire open space and to develop habitat conservation plans , few of which , to my knowledge , were ever completed or even begun . 
a scientist at the denver museum of nature and science stated this and the scientist whose 1954 work led to the original listing , agreed with the new data . 
but meanwhile , the states of wyoming and colorado and its front range counties and cities and residents are out at least $ 8 million and probably more for no good reason . 
if we are going to undertake these massive land-planning schemes , then the feds ought to be sure of their facts . 
i urge your support of h.r. 3824 . 
mr. speaker , i rise today in support of the rule and in strong support of the underlying bill . 
the endangered species act is a law with good intentions , but it has spun wildly out of control with tragic consequences for average americans . 
the northern california district i represent has been ground zero for some of the worst examples of the human impacts of this law gone awry . 
in 2001 , a community of family farmers in the klamath basin of northern california and southern oregon had their entire water supply shut off to prevent a perceived threat to two species of listed fish . 
several years ago a levee protecting one of the communities i represent had deteriorated , and the army corps of engineers predicted that in the event of high water , there would be a significant threat to human life . 
for nearly 7 years , local officials tried to repair that levee , mr. speaker , but those repairs were stymied because of the endangered species act . 
mr. speaker , the impact of this inflexible law have been real and devastating . 
mr. chairman , would the chairman of the committee on resources agree to enter into a colloquy ? 
first let me say to the gentleman that i am very appreciative of his efforts here to make the esa a better law . 
mr. chairman , it is my understanding that the legislation would provide the president the authority to waive or expedite any provision of the act in the event of a major national disaster . 
i also understand that the legislation would require the secretary to develop regulations establishing procedures for an expedited application or waiver of the act for agency actions that would be undertaken to address threats to human health or safety . 
as you know , mr. chairman , a terrible situation occurred in my district in northern california several years ago where a levee that protects one of the communities i represent had deteriorated to such a point that the corps of engineers predicted that this degraded levee , without repair , presented a threat to human life . 
i am sure the chairman has heard of other similar examples where the application of the endangered species act has complicated or delayed urgent and targeted levee repairs from occurring when they are needed to protect people from flooding . 
mr. chairman , it is my understanding that the secretary currently has in place emergency regulations that allow for expedited consultation in the event of an immediate threat to public safety , as , for example , when the floodwaters are rising and are feet or perhaps even inches away from breaking or breaching a levee . 
is the chairman 's understanding that the intent of the legislation is to require the development of additional regulations that would allow the secretary to expedite the application of the act for agency actions necessary to address threats to human health or safety ? 
again , mr. chairman , i want to commend the gentleman for his leadership and years of work he has invested in making the endangered species act a more responsive and effective law . 
i just want to focus on one aspect of this legislation which i think would be amusing in some sense if it were not for the fact that it is an example of a kind of cynical hypocrisy in those people who call themselves fiscally conservative . 
the bill guts the endangered species act , there is no question about that , and all the protections that are involved there ; but then it creates a whole new government giveaway program for some of the nation 's richest landowners and property owners . 
you might want to even cast aside the environmental aspects of it , because if you look at the monetary implications of this and the budgetary implications of this bill , it is going to create an even bigger budget deficit in the context of this huge giveaway program . 
people are using here more and more frequently the devastating impact of the two hurricanes . 
they want to sell off the national parks , they want to remove the safety net for millions of americans who rely upon government services , and now they are going to make it even more difficult for this congress to provide the kind of programs and assistance that are needed in terms of health care , education , a variety of things by passing a piece of legislation that builds an even bigger budget deficit by creating a whole new giveaway program , a new entitlement program for some of the wealthiest people in the country , some of the biggest landowners in the country . 
if you really want to conserve the fiscal integrity of this process , please vote against this bill . 
mr. chairman , i rise today to express my strong opposition to the threatened and endangered species recovery act of 2005 . 
despite the deceptive title of this bill , it is a measure designed to weaken the protections secured under the landmark endangered species act ( esa ) . 
while scientists are uncertain about the exact rate of extinction , they estimate that it is probably thousands of times greater than the rate prior to human civilization . 
in 1973 congress enacted the esa to address this problem of species extinction . 
under this law , once a species is designated as either `` endangered '' or `` threatened , '' powerful legal tools are available to aid in the recovery of the species and to protect its habitat . 
without these strong federal protections hundreds of species including the bald eagle , grizzly bear , florida panther , and the manatee would all be extinct . 
the bill we are debating today is flawed in many ways , but i am particularly concerned with its removal of habitat protection from the endangered species act . 
habitat destruction , degradation , and fragmentation is the most significant cause of species extinction . 
this legislation blatantly ignores the integral role habitat plays in the survival of a species by eliminating the designation of `` critical habitat. '' without this special designation , our government 's ability to recover species will be severely undermined . 
it is disconcerting that some of my colleagues do not value saving our unique natural treasures , but it is appalling that they refuse to acknowledge that the endangered species act is about much more than saving a unique species . 
the loss of a species interrupts the life cycle of the ecosystem it was part of and alters our environment in ways far beyond this isolated event . 
i understand the concerns of my colleagues that this law has been abused at the detriment of their constituents ' rights . 
however , i believe there are ways to balance the needs of development and property rights with the need to protect the health of the environment which we all share . 
instead of working towards a true compromise , we are considering legislation that is based on the fallacious premise that environmental protection requires a trade-off with private interests . 
it takes a very short-sighted , short term view of our world and our economy . 
the threatened and endangered species recovery act of 2005 severely hampers the effectiveness of the endangered species act . 
mr. speaker , the endangered species act is a safety net for wildlife , plants and fish that are on the brink of extinction . 
over its 32-year history , the endangered species act has been 99 percent successful in saving species from extinction , with only 7 out of over 1 , 200 species having gone extinct after being listed under the act . 
the number of species that have fully recovered is not as high , however , and at this point there is a recognition that the current critical habitat arrangement does n't work , for a whole host of reasons . 
i believe that any legislation amending the endangered species act should include a number of critical principles . 
it should not weaken existing law , nor should changes be adopted that would alter the original intent of the endangered species act . 
the loss of habitat is widely considered by scientists to be the primary cause of species extinction and endangerment . 
preservation of habitat is an essential element to any and all efforts to protect and recover endangered species . 
merely maintaining the survival of a species contradicts the spirit and letter of the law , which is why we need to hold federal actions to the standard of recovering species . 
the scientific review of matters relating to the endangered species act is already sufficiently rigorous . 
adding another layer of bureaucracy would serve only to slow the process , to the detriment of both the species in question and affected citizens . 
finally , i believe that while vigilant congressional oversight is critical to the success of any law , putting an arbitrary expiration date on the endangered species act would place the protection of species at the mercy of the legislative calendar . 
mr. chairman , white i realize that the endangered species act is not perfect , i believe that the version of the bill that is before us today will eliminate critical habitat without including other mechanisms to protect species ' homes . 
i applaud the efforts of a bipartisan group of my colleagues , including mr. miller , mr. boehlert , and the original author of esa , representative dingell , who have worked hard to develop an alternative bill that i am happy to support . 
the time is insufficient , not only to explain my position , but also the time for consideration of this bill has been insufficient . 
thirty-two years ago , we passed a bill that a republican president , richard nixon , signed to protect and conserve species in danger of extinction . 
for example , this bill would undermine the ability of the responsible federal agencies to ably perform their oversight roles , and it fails to recognize the importance of sound science to species recovery and restoration . 
it strengthens the definition of what constitutes jeopardy and requires the secretary to ensure that proposed recovery plans identify and include areas necessary for species survival . 
i urge support of the substitute and opposition to the underlying bill . 
thirty-two years ago , congress passed and a republican president -- richard nixon -- signed the endangered species act to protect and conserve species in danger of extinction . 
today , there are 1 , 268 species listed as endangered or threatened in the united states , including 26 in the state of maryland . 
roughly 40 percent of listed species have witnessed the stabilization or growth of their populations . 
the fact is , this law has enabled the very survival of some of our most vulnerable species -- including the bald eagle , the gray wolf , the california condor , and the whooping crane . 
for example , this bill would undermine the ability of the responsible federal agencies -- the departments of commerce and interior -- to ably perform their oversight roles , and it fails to recognize the importance of sound science to species recovery and restoration . 
it strengthens the definition of what constitutes jeopardy and requires the secretary to ensure that proposed recovery plans identify and include areas necessary for species survival . 
mr. chairman , we have a responsibility to protect our environment -- as well as the diverse forms of life that share it . 
reason number one , the substitute bill will make a significant change to reduce the amount of frustration that landowners feel by moving the listing process of habitat from the time of listing to a time of the development of the recovery plan . 
and the reason this will alleviate much frustration by landowners is it will allow these services to make a more acute and scientifically sound judgment where this land needs to be listed for habitat and will relieve significant frustration of landowners . 
second , the substitute will make sure that we try to use public land first when we try to protect habitat to take care of these species . 
third , and importantly , it will have a conservation grant program to allow the use of federal funds to help private landowners who will agree to use their lands to help in the preservation of these species . 
these are three very significant changes to the environmental protection act which will help property owners avoid some of the frustration that now exist while still moving forward with the purposes of this act . 
but we then need to vote `` no '' on the underlying bill for these two reasons : first , the underlying bill is a massive entitlement program that could be subject to massive fraud because the language is so loose and so speculative , we would be expecting the american taxpayers to shell out literally millions of dollars on highly speculative developments . 
why should the taxpayers have to pay for this flim-flam type of speculation ? 
this is a radical change which exposes the taxpayers to millions of dollars of loss that is not required by the u.s. constitution and makes no common sense . 
and second and lastly , very importantly , the underlying bill provides no enforceable protection for the habitat of these species . 
`` bring out every kind of living creature that is with you , the birds , the animals , and all the creatures that move along the ground , so that they can multiply on the earth and be fruitful and increase in number upon it. '' are we acting in the spirit of noah when we purport to vote , some may vote , for a bill that would prevent protecting the bald eagle from pesticides , when ddt almost removed it from the treasure-trove of american icons ? 
are we acting in the spirit of genesis ? 
when we act to remove any meaningful enforcement provisions to protect the habitat , are we acting in the spirit of genesis ? 
this is not a modernization of the act , this is a euthanization of the act , and i will tell you why . 
the underlying bill says that we are going to have these maps of habitat that will be developed , and that is a wonderful thing . 
and under the bill , as written , the maps will hang on the walls of these agencies in beautiful pink and blue , and the cub scouts and the girl scout troops can come through and look at the beautiful maps . 
the bipartisan amendment will say that those maps have some degree of teeth . 
i want to tell my colleagues of a woman who was in my office the other day . 
she told me about the thrill of seeing the salmon going up the stream on miller bay , and they do that because we have an enforceable mechanism to protect habitat . 
mr. chairman , that is why we need to do this substitute , which has a better way of identifying habitat in the recovery process so we do not have this frustration with the landowners , so we do not waste 3 years just bothering landowners and not recovering species , but we have a mechanism to get this job done . 
to suggest that an act that saves 99 percent of the species from extinction is a failure is not a way to keep score . 
mr. chairman , what possible reason is there for taxpayers to have to pay three , four times for the same protection of endangered species ? 
under the bill as written , the taxpayer would have to pay a landowner once for the privileges of not building the casino . 
while it is important to protect and save the many precious animals of this earth , it is also important not to take the property of the many americans who have worked hard to obtain their homes and land . 
this issue needs to be looked at from a bipartisan perspective and because of this i am in support of the substitute amendment offered by mr. miller of california . 
among other things , the substitute protects habitat for species recovery by maintaining habitat protections and puts the primary obligation for recovery on federal agencies by clearly defining `` jeopardy. '' it also makes clear that any federal agency action that impairs species recovery will jeopardize the continued existence of the species and , therefore , is prohibited . 
recovery plans will identify all areas necessary for the conservation of listed species . 
prior to the development of recovery plans , the miller substitute encourages the development of guidance that identifies particular types of activities that could negatively impact recovery . 
one of the most important aspects of the miller substitute is that it provides real landowner incentives for conservation through cost 
mr. chairman , i rise today to request that my name be removed as a cosponsor of h.r. 3824 , the threatened and endangered species recovery act of 2005 ( tesra ) . 
as a senior member of the house science committee , i also have serious reservations that in its current form , h.r. 3824 attempts to substitute politics for sound science in decisions involving endangered species , letting expediency and profit motives influence what should be scientific decisions . 
and while there is wide agreement here on the house floor that it should be amended and tweaked and improved on in light of past experience and modern times , we need to do it responsibly ; and i believe that responsible approach is better reflected in the substitute that is being offered here today . 
in my home state of wisconsin , an example of how well it has worked , working with local officials and the stakeholders involved , the higgins eye mussel has come back in the mississippi river , which acts as a great filtration system in the river basin . 
the karner blue butterfly , on the verge of extinction in wisconsin , due to the endangered species act and the recovery plan that was in place , is making a healthy comeback . 
the whooping crane is making a strong comeback in the necedah wildlife refuge , as has the granddaddy of them all , which has been referenced here today , the american bald eagle . 
if members would like to see some bald eagles , come to western wisconsin along the mississippi during the spring and fall ice flows , and you will see literally thousands of them . 
they are on the verge of being delisted because of their success story . 
epa identified the adverse effects of ddt , congress took action , and the bald eagle is resurging today . 
and the grizzly bear that is about to be delisted in yellowstone and portions of montana from the threatened species list , i can personally attest to the strength of their comeback , having just been in glacier park in august and coming within 20 yards of a big grizzly bear and her two cubs . 
that sentiment was reflected in president richard nixon 's words during his signing of the act on december 28 , 1973 when he said , `` nothing is more priceless and more worthy of preservation than the rich array of animal life with which our country has been blessed . 
it is a many-faceted treasure , of value to scholars , scientists , and nature lovers alike , and it forms a vital part of the heritage we all share as americans. '' i am also reminded of the wisdom of my recently passed friend and hero , senator gaylord nelson , who said , `` we must recognize that we 're all part of a web of life around the world . 
anytime you extinguish a species , the consequences are serious. '' thankfully today , citizens can see firsthand in every state the progress being made in bringing wildlife back from the brink of extinction . 
for example , in wisconsin , for the first time since its 1991 listing as an endangered species , the winged mapleleaf mussel , a species found only in a small area of the st . 
another success of the esa is the karner blue butterfly . 
although 99 percent or more of the karner blue butterfly 's range has been destroyed , wisconsin helped bring the species back using a conservation plan that takes into account the butterfly 's entire life cycle . 
i mention these successes because many of the comments made on the floor today cast esa as an unmitigated failure . 
i do n't believe that is the case at all ; and the scientific journal , ecology letters , recently published a study of the status of threatened and endangered species that showed more than half on the list for 5 years or more have either stabilized or are improving . 
that said , i agree with my friend and colleague , congressman john dingell , author of the original esa in 1973 , that this landmark bill could use an update -- that it could be and should be strengthened in ways that cuts bureaucratic red tape , broadens stakeholder participation , and most importantly better facilitates the revival of more threatened and endangered species . 
for instance , it is widely agreed the esa has done a good job in preventing the extinction of many species but it has been less successful in bringing about `` the recovery of listed species to levels where protection under the act is no longer necessary. '' i believe it is crucial the legislation provides for the development of strong , comprehensive recovery plans within a short period of time after a species is listed as threatened or endangered . 
but it adds crucial language requiring the secretary to identify -- during a 3-year recovery planning process -- lands that are necessary for the conservation of the species -- first on public lands and then , if necessary , on private lands . 
i also agree that private landowners have been required by esa to individually shoulder too much of the burden . 
more than two-thirds of threatened and endangered species reside on private lands where the endangered species act is least effective . 
it is imperative landowners be regarded as part of the solution and given the tools and incentives necessary to engender their help and support . 
i believe we should have at least considered expanding the habitat conservation plan land acquisition program in h.r. 3824 which has proven itself effective in reducing conflicts between the conservation of threatened and endangered species and land development and use . 
for example , under h.r. 3824 the government can be forced to pay out repeated claims for different proposals to use the exact same piece of property . 
these claims do n't even need to be backed up by proof of compliance with state or local land use laws . 
and instead of lessening the number of esa related lawsuits , even cbo has stated this provision is likely to increase the amount of litigation . 
mr. chairman , i urge my colleagues to support the responsible , bipartisan boehlert substitute that answers the concerns of landowners , states , and sportsmen , while improving the ability to achieve timely recovery of endangered and threatened fish , wildlife , and plants . 
let 's mend it in light of past experience and the demands of modern times , but let 's do it responsibly -- support the substitute . 
for me , i would quote from the house republican majority committee on the budget that warned that the underlying legislation `` creates a new entitlement program. '' this spring , moderates of the republican tuesday group and conservatives of the republican study committee worked together to put forward budget reforms to end deficit spending . 
the heart of our reform was a prohibition against new entitlement spending . 
entitlement spending already makes up two-thirds of all federal spending . 
our deficit , because of hurricane katrina and related costs , will top over $ 500 billion this year ; and i do not believe that we can afford a new entitlement program . 
the grant portion of this bill that compensates landowners is responsible . 
the mandated spending portion of the bill is not responsible . 
cbo warns that in their score of this bill both costs and litigation will go up under the bill . 
following cbo 's fiscal advice , i would urge adoption of the more fiscally responsible substitute . 
this legislation , as many of us know , will do nothing to improve our ability to help species recover . 
as a matter of fact , this legislation will repeal all endangered species act provisions that protect threatened and endangered plants and wildlife from the harmful impact of pesticides . 
our own national symbol , the bald eagle , is threatened with the provisions of this bill that would repeal the pesticides provisions that currently exist and which help protect endangered species . 
pesticides have played a large part in the decline of many species , including the bald eagle . 
the bald eagle is the symbol of our national unity . 
there is a recognition that plants and wildlife and human beings are all part of the same interconnected process ; that we are interdependent ; that we are all one . 
i could talk for a while about how this bill is going to provide giveaways to developers at the expense of wildlife and endangered species . 
i could talk about all that , but i want to stress that what we are really doing here in voting for this bill is rejecting the whole idea of interdependence and interconnection ; rejecting the idea of a bald eagle which stands for national unity and that we are all together . 
mr. chairman , i rise today in opposition to the threatened endangered species act , the so-called `` reform '' that will dismantle our nation 's most fundamental wildlife protection law and in support of the bipartisan miller , boehlert , dingell , gilchrest , dicks , saxton , tauscher , kirk substitute . 
i am disappointed at the missed opportunity for the house to strike a real balance in the protection of rare species facing extinction and landowners from future government constraints . 
among other things , the threatened and endangered species act would remove the federal protection of critical habitats that are necessary for the recovery of a species . 
i believe there is more we can do to support the goals of the esa . 
it took decades for many of our nation 's species to reach the point of extinction . 
it is unrealistic to propose that there will be a quick fix to the recovery of animals and plants facing decline . 
as members of congress , as responsible citizens , i urge my colleagues to join me in supporting real reforms to the esa by supporting the bipartisan substitute amendment and rejecting the underlying bill . 
mr. chairman , i rise in support of the boehlert-miller substitute and against the underlying bill . 
a major factor forcing threatened and endangered species towards extinction is the loss and deterioration of habitat necessary for survival . 
the majority has just presented us with this manager 's amendment to the underlying bill that would delete not only the protections and enforceability afforded under the designation of critical habitat but also the broader habitat protection provided by the jeopardy definition . 
we have arrived at a situation where the underlying bill will offer no enforceable protection for the habitat that endangered species need to survive , but will only create a blizzard of unenforceable bureaucratic paperwork which , in the words of shakespeare , would be `` full of sound and fury but signifying nothing. '' the boehlert-miller substitute would retain the enforceable protections for habitat provided under a strong jeopardy definition and i urge its adoption . 
there are dozens of news stories describing rallies and press conferences held by opponents of the endangered species act . 
ten years after the republicans took control of the house , they may be one step closer to repealing one of the most successful environmental laws in the history of the country . 
dismantling the endangered species act has also been a top priority of the bush administration . 
one of the sad realities of the republican control of our government is their absolute contempt for the environment . 
since they have taken control of the congress , they have been rolling back environmental protections nonstop . 
in fact , just months ago , legislation was drafted and subsequently circulated by the chair of the committee on resources that would have completely eliminated endangered species protections over the next 10 years . 
the bill before us is a major first step toward complete elimination of the endangered species act . 
over 30 years ago , the endangered species act was signed into law by president richard nixon , and in the years that followed , it became renowned as one of our nation 's most successful , effective , and vital conservation laws . 
the endangered species act alone has been credited with saving hundreds of species from extinction , most notably the florida manatee , the california condor , and the bald eagle . 
according to the u.s. fish and wildlife service , 99 percent of the species ever listed under the endangered species act remain on the planet today . 
but the benefits of the endangered species act extend far beyond protections for any one or group of endangered plants or animals . 
for example , the reintroduction of the gray wolf into yellowstone national park 10 years ago increased revenues in adjacent local communities by $ 10 million annually . 
h.r. 3824 takes us back to the bad old days and completely repeals protections against the use of hazardous pesticides , and removes one of the most important parts of the endangered species act , the protection of critical habitat . 
this is one of the most shocking proposals i think i have seen . 
what is the cost of this sweetheart deal ? 
according to the congressional budget office , the full price tag of this deal could reach $ 2.7 billion over the next 5 years . 
so contrary to what the proponents of h.r. 3824 will say today , this is really a new entitlement for developers and other business interests . 
with the largest deficit in american history , with mounting costs from the recent hurricanes , and with the war still raging in iraq and afghanistan , is this the right time to open a slush fund that will funnel millions of dollars to developers and businesses , while undoubtedly resulting in the extinction of unique animals and habitats across this country ? 
i hope that my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will take a close look at this legislation and recognize it is not our only option . 
on a smaller scale , a similar approach has been overwhelmingly successful in my home state of massachusetts . 
but in just 14 years , they have made a dramatic comeback , and this was largely the result of coordinated efforts between conservationists and private land managers . 
environmental and animal rights groups strongly oppose this bill , and so do many of the nation 's leading editorial pages : the new york times , the boston globe , the los angeles times , the seattle post intelligencer , the idaho falls post register , to name a few , all oppose scrapping the endangered species act . 
but i want to read from the hometown newspaper of the first president bush and the gentleman from texas ( mr. delay ) xz4001040 , the houston chronicle : `` after 32 years of success , the endangered species act may need streamlining and adjustment to the realities of the continued development of rural areas of the country . 
it should not be destroyed and replaced with a law that would give all the advantages to business interests and allow the secretary of the interior to play god with the nation 's biodiversity. '' the miller-boehlert amendment is proposed to modernize responsibly the endangered species act . 
mr. speaker , i submit herewith for the record the editorial i quoted from earlier : an endangered act since president richard nixon signed it in 1973 , the endangered species act has prevented the extinction of hundreds of species of american plants and animals , restoring many to sizable populations . 
in the process of designating 1 , 370 species eligible for protection , the act also has generated court battles by opponents who chafed at restrictions on commercial development of essential habitat . 
backed by land development and agricultural interests , as well as the bush administration , several members of congress are pushing legislation that would gut what some consider the most important environmental law in u.s. history . 
environmentalists charge that pombo 's bill eliminates any provision to help species recover from near extinction and effectively forbids the designation of critical habitats on virtually all federal land . 
the existing law requires that species be protected if they are endangered in a significant portion of their range . 
this month the u.s. fish and wildlife service adopted similar reasoning when it proposed the removal of the pygmy owl in arizona from the list of threatened species because healthy populations exist in mexico . 
under president clinton the agency had proposed designation of 1.2 million acres in the state as critical habitat . 
under the pombo standard , animals such as the grizzly bear , bald eagle and timber wolf , with large populations in alaska , would not have qualified for protection in other parts of the united states . 
the supreme court recently refused to hear a challenge to enforcement of the act brought by developers in a dispute involving the endangered kretschmarr cave mold beetle in texas . 
pombo 's bill would allow the secretary of the interior to determine what scientific evidence is relevant in deciding if a species is endangered and give the secretary the power to overturn decisions by federal biologists and wildlife managers . 
after 32 years of success , the endangered species act may need streamlining and adjustment to the realities of the continued development of rural areas of the country . 
it should not be destroyed and replaced with a law that would give all the advantages to business interests and allow the secretary of the interior to play god with the nation 's biodiversity . 
texans are justly proud of the vast array of wildlife that thrives in protected forests , mountains and marshes across the state . 
let 's make sure that natural treasure is preserved for the benefit of future generations . 
mr. speaker , i reserve the balance of my time . 
mr. speaker , i appreciate the comments of my colleague on the committee on rules , the gentleman from utah , but he uses statistics very selectively . 
that is an astonishing success rate of more than 99 percent . 
i will also provide for the record an article that appeared in the salt lake tribune by ben long , who is a contributor to the writers on the range , a service of high country news , who has written a great article about how the endangered species act succeeds with flying colors . 
hundreds of them live in my home state of montana . 
across the united states , the bald eagle is a living , flying example of what works about the endangered species act . 
`` at the same time it has caused a lot of conflicts. '' pombo evidently spends too much time inside his stuffy washington office . 
if he got out in the forests and rivers more , he might know the story of the bald eagle . 
that year , surveys turned up only 12 bald eagle nests in all of montana . 
they protected the birds from chemical poisoning , destruction of habitat and needless , wasteful killing . 
by 2005 , the number of bald eagle nests in montana multiplied to 300 nests -- 25 times the number before the bird was included on the endangered species list . 
today , montana is one of the top 10 eagle-producing states in the united states . 
now , there are hundreds of wolves in western montana , and more in neighboring idaho and wyoming . 
because montana stepped up to the plate and agreed to manage these animals for the future , the federal u.s. fish and wildlife service recently handed wolf management over to the montana department of fish , wildlife and parks . 
this is evidence of the flexibility built into the law . 
the endangered species act has allowed wildlife managers to kill problem wolves -- even wipe out entire packs that made a habit of killing livestock . 
when i was a kid , the only eagle i ever saw was on the back of a quarter . 
mr. speaker , i yield myself the balance of my time . 
mr. speaker , i would again urge my colleagues to , first of all , vote `` no '' on the rule , and i would also urge them to vote `` no '' on the underlying bill . 
i appreciate the work that the gentleman from california ( chairman pombo ) and others have put into this bill , but the bottom line is that the underlying bill eliminates habitat protections ; it abandons the commitment to recovery of endangered species ; it repeals protection against hazardous pesticides ; it politicizes scientific decision-making ; it eliminates the vital check-and-balance of consultation ; it requires the fish and wildlife service to allow unfettered habitat destruction ; it would require taxpayers to pay developers , oil and gas companies and other industries , for complying with the law ; and it is an entitlement . 
i know the chairman has kind of objected to that characterization , but that is not my characterization . 
it is what our colleague from illinois ( mr. kirk ) xz4002220 who testified yesterday on behalf of the republican study committee and the republican tuesday group said last night in the committee on rules , that this bill creates an expensive new federal entitlement program . 
mr. speaker , i yield back the balance of my time . 
only nine species listed under the act have gone extinct , and five of them were later determined to be extinct by the time they were listed . 
meanwhile , thanks largely to the act 's protections , we have fully recovered such species as the american alligator , grey whale , and peregrine falcon , and stabilized the populations of bald eagles , sea turtles , manatees , and hundreds more . 
and some species , such as the california condor and red wolf , would probably be extinct without the protections of the act . 
from looking at the record of the endangered species act , i would say that it has been a success . 
a study by the congressional research service has shown that 41 percent of listed species have improved their status after being listed . 
the act certainly has not brought every endangered or threatened species to full recovery , but many of these have only been listed a few years . 
the u.s. fish and wildlife service reported that only 4 percent of species listed for less than 5 years have recovered by any appreciable amount . 
it eliminates the designation of critical habitat , which is one of the most important provisions in the endangered species act . 
the bill includes a number of other unfortunate provisions , but perhaps none are more unfortunate , or more mind-boggling , than the proposal to pay off developers for what they should be doing anyway -- obeying the law . 
this bill says that if a developer wants to build something but ca n't do it because of the endangered species act , the government must pay them for the loss of the income they would have received from the development , even when the development is economically unfeasible . 
first of all , we are saying that the government will pay you for obeying the law . 
there are a number of reasons why we need to focus our resources on protecting endangered species . 
wildlife means millions of dollars to local economies , both through tourism and outdoor recreation . 
but preserving species is about more than just economic value and being good stewards of the earth . 
a recent study by the national cancer institute showed that in the past 20 years , 78 percent of new antibiotics and 74 percent of new anticancer drugs were linked to natural products . 
every species that goes extinct decreases our chances of finding the next miracle drug to fight infection , alzheimer 's , cancer , or aids . 
the endangered species act is something we should be proud of , and something we should look to tweak to improve species recovery , not gut to give egregious and unwarranted payouts to developers . 
the landowner does not show that they could do that , that they could go through the city zoning , they could go through the county zoning , that they would get those permits to build those houses or whatever else he wants to do , or he could build that commercial establishment , no showing of that . 
mr. chairman , i yield for the purpose of a unanimous consent request to the gentleman from california ( mr. farr ) xz4001290 . 
mr. chairman , i yield to the gentleman from massachusetts ( mr. markey ) xz4002530 for the purpose of a unanimous consent request . 
`` shortsighted men , in their greed and selfishness will , if permitted , rob our country of half its charm by the reckless extermination of all useful and beautiful wild things. '' so said republican president theodore roosevelt almost 100 years ago , and how relevant his remarks are today . 
only 7 out of 1 , 200 species , according to fish and wildlife service , have become extinct , and they became extinct because of their status before they were listed . 
there are problems with the act that need to be addressed , but many of the changes embodied in this bill are not designed to fix the problems . 
we are a nation of laws and constitutional rights , but where in the constitution does it say property rights are an immutable and an open-ended entitlement ? 
where would we be as a nation if the law did not allow reasonable government regulations of private property without payment of compensation if undertaken for the public good ? 
that kind of regulation occurs every day in every state in every locality throughout the country . 
it occurs as a result of practically every regulatory statute we pass . 
it is a long-standing principle of the jurisprudence of our courts . 
section 13 of the bill establishes a new program of conservation aid ; and under this program the government must provide compensation to landowners whenever an esa restriction prevents a particular use of property , regardless of the fact that other uses of the property remain and those uses are very valuable . 
this new aid program , therefore , requires the payment of compensation to landowners even though no governmental taking of their property has occurred . 
and rather than compensation being required where a restriction essentially strips property of all of its valuable uses , the standard under the takings clause , which exists today , this bill requires compensation whenever a restriction prevents a single use of property . 
if enacted , this bill will set a very dangerous precedent that could lead to the insertion of similar provisions in other environmental and regulatory statutes . 
mr. chairman , as a member of the interior , environment , and related agencies subcommittee of the committee on appropriations , i know that there are some problems with the implementation of this act . 
the current `` critical habitat '' designation needs to be revised and should be established later in the process during the development of species recovery plans . 
mr. chairman , federal land belongs to all of us . 
the endangered species act is a vehicle through which we can conserve our land and balance the needs of all against the short-term and destructive interests of the few . 
mr. chairman , i serve a very rural district , a lot of landowners . 
in 1978 , 50 miles of the central platte river in nebraska was designated as critical habitat for whooping cranes . 
only 3 to 4 percent of the whooping cranes visit the platte river annually . 
the great majority of whooping cranes never see the platte river , never visit it at all ; and so many have questioned this designation because this designation has led to a cooperative agreement between nebraska , colorado , and wyoming involving thousands of acres of lands , hundreds of thousands of feet of water to support critical habitat ; and it is still not complete after 8 years of spending millions of dollars . 
this is a very controversial issue , and he and the committee should be commended for working to address some of the real problems in the current law . 
there are a couple of provisions for which i have been a strong proponent , and i am pleased that the chairman has agreed to include them in the manager 's amendment . 
specifically , the provision requires that each of the power marketing administrations , the bonneville power administration , western area power administration , southwestern power administration , and the southeastern power administration , to include costs related to the endangered species act in their customers ' monthly electricity billings . 
in the pacific northwest alone , the bonneville power administration accounts for 45 percent of the region 's electricity sales and 75 percent of the transmission lines . 
the agency spends an average of $ 500 million per year on esa compliance . 
of course , the electricity ratepayers . 
the point of all this , mr. speaker , is that few pacific northwest consumers have a notion of the amount of money of their monthly bills that goes directly towards the endangered species act compliance , nor do they or other end-user consumers of the other power marketing administrations . 
it is estimated that as much as one third of the power bill from the bpa is devoted to salmon recovery , but no one knows for sure . 
i get a bill once a month from the power company that includes all sorts of information about tips on conserving energy and warnings on how to keep me from electrocuting myself , but nowhere does it detail what i am paying for . 
i would like to thank the chairman for including language in the bill that consolidates jurisdiction of the endangered species act management of species under one agency . 
noaa fisheries originally was part of the department of interior until 1970 , when noaa was created under the department of commerce to address federal management of commercial and tribal fisheries . 
this was prior to the enactment of the endangered species act of 1973 . 
now the agency 's mission of managing commercial and tribal harvests of salmon and recovering endangered species are in conflict . 
noaa fisheries and the fish and wildlife service have differing processes for handling and permitting thousands of activities that must undergo federal conciliation under the esa and competing science on how best to manage the species . 
consolidation of agencies managing the esa will eliminate duplication and allow scarce federal resources to be focused on achieving the true objective of the endangered species act , the recovery of species through science-based management . 
i thank the chairman for his leadership on this issue , and i look forward to the passage of this bill . 
those are not my words , those are the words of a city counselor from santa barbara , california . 
in a hearing we had on endangered species last year , she described california as being the greenest state , santa barbara as being the greenest of the cities in california , and she as being the greenest of the green . 
she said that the endangered species act is blocking people from making additions onto their homes , it is keeping the beach closed , it is stopping development in their town , and they are tired of it . 
elimination of the act is too extreme . 
in order to keep the flow in the rio grand river at the level that the biologists said we had to have , we had to release storage of water that had been building up for 50 years in four different reservoirs . 
so one of the most important provisions in this bill is that sound science must be used for any decision . 
mr. chairman , i thank the gentleman for yielding me this time , and i thank him for his extraordinary leadership on behalf of the american people in terms of the air they breathe , the water they drink , in protecting god 's beautiful gift to us , this beautiful legacy that we have in our environment , and i commend the ranking member , the gentleman from west virginia ( mr. rahall ) xz4003310 , for his leadership as well . 
i rise as house democratic leader , of course , in support of the substitute , but i also rise as a mother and as a grandmother ; mother of five and grandmother of five . 
but we teach our grandchildren , and i did teach my children when they were little , that everything in nature is connected and that there is a reason , a balance to it all , this beautiful web of life that is nature . 
today 's bill of course in this debate points out what value we place on that . 
with the passage of the first endangered species law in 1966 and the modern endangered species act in 1973 , congress made a commitment to future generations of americans , at that time that would be our children , my grandchildren . 
we made a commitment to maintain the web of life and preserve the myriad species that form an essential part of our natural heritage . 
we must keep that commitment for the sake of our children and our grandchildren . 
the endangered species act is a safety net for wildlife , fish and plants that are on the brink of extinction . 
of the 1 , 800 species protected by the law , only nine species have been declared extinct . 
earlier in the debate , i heard the gentleman from washington ( mr. dicks ) xz4001090 speaking , and i see he is still in the chamber , and i thank him for his very enlightening presentation about how many species have been saved during the life of this law . 
it saved the florida manatee , the grizzly bear , the southern sea otter , sea turtles , and many other animals and plants , all important in the balance of nature . 
on the floor of the house , week after week , month after month , the republican leadership pushes through legislation shredding the safety net for children , for veterans , for the elderly , for the poor , for the sick and the disabled , so it comes as no surprise today that they bring a bill that will shred the safety net for the endangered plants and animals . 
this is really unfortunate , because , again , it all relates to the balance of nature . 
in wisdom you made them all ; the earth is full of your creatures . 
we have yet to learn the roles that many creatures play in the web of life , and we are yet to discover the practical effects many species may bring to humankind . 
many of us have dear friends or family members whose chances of survival have been increased by the use of taxol . 
it undermines sound science by directing the secretary of the interior , a political appointee , to issue regulations locking in a static definition of specific acceptable scientific data . 
it establishes an extraordinarily new entitlement program for developers and speculators that requires taxpayers to pay them unlimited amounts of money , and the list goes on and on . 
many people who care very , very much about the environment , about the balance of nature , about the web of life have concerns about the enforcement . 
i think that is why it is important for congress to be very clear what our intent is , so that intention of congress and that clarity of our voices here will give guidance to those who enforce the law so that is the implementation and the execution of it is not in a way that is so risk averse as to be counterproductive . 
that is why my colleague , the gentleman from california ( mr. george miller ) xz4002780 , joined by a group of members and also the gentleman from new york ( mr. boehlert ) xz4000350 , taking the lead on the republican side , have developed a substitute to this bill that gives landowners assistance and incentives to protect endangered species , strengthens the science behind the endangered species act , and requires improved coordination with the states . 
i urge my colleagues to strengthen the endangered species act by voting for a bipartisan substitute and opposing the underlying bill , and in doing so , to truly , as members of congress , show our children that we mean it when we say that we all know that everything in nature is connected and it is important to maintain the balance , the web of life . 
in isaiah in the old testament , we are told that to minister to the needs of god 's creation , and that includes our beautiful environment , is an act of worship . 
let us minister to the needs of god 's creation . 
first of all , i want to thank the major coauthor of the bill , the gentleman from california ( mr. cardoza ) xz4000650 , for working with me in a bipartisan way over the last several months to craft a bipartisan solution to the problems that we have got with the endangered species act . 
i also would like to thank the gentleman from west virginia ( mr. rahall ) xz4003310 , the ranking member on the committee , for all of the work that he put in , and that his staff put in , particularly jim zoia , who did yeoman 's work in putting this bill together . 
lori sonken , tod willens , and rob gordon worked tirelessly to try to compromise and work out a bill that we could all be proud of , along with hank savage from the office of legislative counsel . 
this debate over endangered species has been raging across this country for years , and our effort was to throw away everything that we had tried to do in the past and put it aside and try to start again and say how do we sit down as members of the committee on resources and come to a solution that we can all agree with . 
it is kind of ironic this morning to hear people come to the floor and talk about how radical the bill is and how quickly we moved on it . 
we traveled around the country , going to places where people actually have to live with the implementation of the law and listened to them and what they told us . 
it is amazing to hear all of this stuff that is supposedly in the bill . 
from what i see , all of these folks are going to vote `` no '' on the bill and they are going to vote `` no '' on the substitute , because the substitute claims to be the same thing . 
but when we get to endangered species , we tell a farmer , you can not farm part of your land , 10 percent , 20 percent , 50 percent , whatever it is , you can not farm that part of your land , now , all of a sudden , oh , we can not do that . 
if you take away somebody 's private property , if you take away the use of their private property , you have to pay them for it . 
we bring up today the endangered species reform act with the purpose of trying to deal with what some of the real issues are , what some of the real problems are that we have had and have developed over the last 30 years . 
if one goes back and reads the original endangered species act , it becomes difficult to be critical of specific language that is it in because the purpose of the endangered species act was to , first of all , prevent species from becoming extinct but , more importantly , to recover those species . 
i came into this debate originally because i did not like the way that private property owners were treated under the implementation of the law . 
that became a big issue in my district and throughout much of the west . 
private property owners felt threatened that they would lose their private property and that they could lose control and the ability to use their private property under the implementation of the law . 
that became a big problem , and it is something that we began to work on , to try to have some kind of property rights protections in the law . 
but the more i got into the endangered species act , the more i realized the law was just not working in terms of recovering species . 
of those 1 , 300 , 10 have been removed because they were recovered . 
about three-quarters of the species are either declining in population or the fish and wildlife service has no idea . 
it is something we all share in terms of preserving wildlife and preserving species . 
as we have gone through this last several months , i have had the opportunity to work with the ranking member , the gentleman from west virginia ( mr. rahall ) xz4003310 , and his staff ; and i thank them for all of the work that they put into this bill to get us to this point . 
in the end , there were a few issues that we just disagreed on , there were issues we could not come to a conclusion on , but the vast majority of what is in the underlying bill was an agreement that we were able to work out and that i stand by . 
but i will say that , in the end , private property rights , the protection of those property owners , has to be in the final bill , because the only way this is going to work is if we bring in property owners to be part of the solution and be part of recovering those species . 
mr. chairman , i reserve the balance of my time . 
mr. chairman , i am certainly well aware of the situation that the gentleman is speaking to . 
i was a member of congress at the time that that levee broke and tried at that point to help the gentleman to take care of that problem before it broke . 
accordingly , the committee rose ; and the speaker pro tempore ( mr. goodlatte ) xz4001540 having assumed the chair , mr. sweeney , chairman of the committee of the whole house on the state of the union , reported that that committee , having had under consideration the bill ( h.r. 3824 ) to amend and reauthorize the endangered species act of 1973 to provide greater results conserving and recovering listed species , and for other purposes , had come to no resolution thereon . 
mr. chairman , i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from virginia ( mr. goodlatte ) xz4001540 , the chairman of the committee on agriculture . 
mr. chairman , i reserve the balance of my time . 
mr. chairman , i yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from oregon ( mr. walden ) xz4004190 . 
mr. chairman , the manager 's amendment makes a number of technical changes to clarify certain provisions and address issues concerning science , the definition of `` jeopardy , '' consolidation of esa-related programs , and review of protective regulations . 
it directs the secretary of the interior to survey certain federal lands to assess their value for a report back to congress . 
that is the short version of what is included in the manager 's amendment . 
mr. chairman , i reserve the balance of my time . 
i look forward to the gentleman 's opposition to the highway bill and any new purchases of land , to the wildlife refuge system , to the park system , or any other thing that we spend money on , because he sees it as a big giveaway , a big government giveaway system . 
again , what the underlying bill does is if you step in and take habitat from a private property owner and you tell them that you restrict them and you tell them they can not use part of their property , then we set up a system of incentives and grants . 
but , if in the end , the secretary says your property is necessary for the recovery of an endangered species , therefore you can not use it , we compensate them for that and we pay them for it . 
if we build a highway across somebody 's property , even though that may increase the value of the rest of the property , we pay them for it . 
if we take part of their property for a wildlife refuge , even though that may increase the value of the rest of their property , we pay them for it . 
but , if we take their property for endangered species habitat , we tell them , you are out of luck . 
this is a brand-new way of dealing with compensating property owners whose land is taken . 
this is a brand-new way of dealing with a very real problem and assuring some kind of protection to my property owners and your property owners . 
mr. chairman , it was just a couple of weeks ago that the supreme court came out with a decision where this congress stood up and said , you can not use eminent domain to take away private property , to take someone 's house away from them and give it to another individual . 
and all of you ran down on the floor and said you were all in support of that . 
but when we are talking about somebody 's house , all of a sudden you want to pay them ? 
i know that some of my colleagues are just philosophically opposed to that , and god love you . 
but the fact of the matter is , if you take away somebody 's private property , you ought to have to pay for it . 
it does not say the government can step in and take 90 percent of your value and then it is okay ; it does not say they can take away 30 percent of your value and that is okay . 
is the gentleman going to oppose the highway bill because we compensate people when we take their land away for a highway , even though we do not take 100 percent of the use ? 
you guys talk big about wanting to protect habitat and protect species , but 90 percent of the habitat for endangered species is on private property . 
the only way you are going to recover species is if you bring in the property owners and have them be part of the solution . 
mr. chairman , i reserve the balance of my time . 
one of you comes down and beats us up because we are spending too much money about this massive increase in spending under this bill . 
mr. chairman , i yield myself the balance of the time . 
this was an important thing for us to go through , and i think that we produced a good bill at the end of that . 
mr. chairman , i yield back the balance of my time . 
mr. chairman , i reserve the balance of my time . 
mr. chairman , i yield for the purpose of a unanimous consent request to the gentleman from california ( mr. gallegly ) xz4001440 , a member of the committee on resources . 
mr. chairman , i yield 1 minute to the gentleman from california ( mr. cardoza ) xz4000650 , co-author of the underlying bill . 
mr. chairman , i yield myself the balance of my time . 
first of all , i wanted to respond to your comments on jeopardy . 
the gentleman from west virginia ( mr. rahall ) xz4003310 and i spent months debating the meaning of a word , and we finally came pretty close to getting a bill put together . 
i remember 10 years ago , i introduced a bill on endangered species , and one of the major provisions in that bill was to utilize public lands , and i got ripped over it because 90 percent of the species have their habitat on private land . 
but if it is going to work , if we are truly going to put the focus on recovery , if we are truly going to try to bring these species back from the brink and do the responsible thing , private property owners have to be part of the solution . 
we hear a lot of horror stories about things that have happened in my district and mr. cardoza 's district and mr. costa 's district and mr. baca 's district , in your district , mr. miller . 
when it comes to protecting private property owners , regardless of what all the hot rhetoric is , what the underlying law says is that if you meet state and local zoning laws , if you go through the process of getting that approval , then you have something . 
so this argument is totally out of line and off base . 
as the chairman knows and many of my colleagues , i came to our discussions with the view that the esa does not need amendment , that most of its problems could be fixed by additional appropriations or administrative changes that this administration is not willing to make . 
it was a fair process ; and , indeed , when we had problems , we found open communication was received from the other side of the aisle , and i appreciate that . 
i wish the bill , because of these latest changes in the manager 's amendment , were not being rushed to the house floor . 
in the last several hours , the bill passed out of the committee has completely blown apart . 
for example , the manager 's amendment abandons the definition of jeopardizing a species we agreed upon in committee . 
instead , the secretary of the interior will use existing regulations which allow federal actions to proceed , even if they will reduce the likelihood of a species ' survival and recovery . 
the survival standard is akin to keeping a patient on life support without any chance of recovery . 
not only was fiscal responsibility thrown to the wind in this process , but we have turned back the clock to an era in which ddt was commonly known as `` drop dead twice. '' h.r. 3824 includes a provision adopted in the committee on resources that would repeal the endangered species act provisions that protect threatened and endangered species from the harmful impact of pesticides . 
the economic and environmental implications of this provision are staggering . 
this bill also contains provisions that would severely weaken the consultation process , the very heart of the esa . 
under current law , the fish and wildlife service analyzes a proposed action to gauge if it is likely to place the continued existence of a species in jeopardy . 
this bill , quite to the contrary of current practice , wipes away any standards for that process . 
proponents claim this change is justified because of the service 's heavy workload . 
instead of fixing the problem by giving fish and wildlife more resources , the bill simply changes the rules and undermines species recovery . 
under section 10 of h.r. 3824 , no additional consultations will be required once the secretary enters into a cooperative agreement with a state . 
these provisions , taken together , raise a whole host of questions and concerns . 
quite likely it will result in more extinctions , the loss of more of the creatures god has placed in our care . 
frankly , we can not be good stewards of his creation and pass this bill . 
mr. chairman , i reserve the balance of my time . 
mr. chairman i reserve the balance of my time . 
mr. chairman , in response to the last colloquy that just took place between the two gentlemen from california in regard to emergency powers that would be granted the president to waive provisions of the endangered species act , i just wanted to respond that the endangered species act did not get in the way in any manner whatsoever of recovery efforts in response to hurricanes katrina and rita . 
so i just wanted to make that clear for the record that esa did not hamper any recovery efforts for any of the most recent hurricanes . 
mr. chairman , i yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from arizona ( mr. grijalva ) xz4001620 , a distinguished member of our committee . 
mr. chairman , i yield for the purpose of making a unanimous consent request to the gentleman from new mexico ( mr. udall ) xz4004131 . 
mr. chairman , i yield 5 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from michigan ( mr. dingell ) xz4001100 , the dean of the house as well as the father of the endangered species act , the ranking member on the house committee on energy and commerce . 
mr. chairman , there is probably not a member of this body that can not get up and tell some horror story with the current administration of the endangered species act . 
nowhere is that more evident than in the world of medicine . 
i have my chief of staff who has returned from the hospital , thank the lord to many medicines that have been produced from nearly extinct species . 
there are a number of important medicines , including possibly the next effective treatment of cancer , aids , or heart disease that can come from species that we are trying to protect and save on this world . 
mr. chairman , i yield 3 1/2 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from washington ( mr. dicks ) xz4001090 , ranking member on the subcommittee on interior , environment , and related agencies of the committee on appropriations and a member of my class . 
mr. chairman , i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from washington ( mr. inslee ) xz4001930 , a very valued member of our committee on resources . 
mr. chairman , i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from wisconsin ( mr. kind ) xz4002180 , a valued member of the committee on resources . 
mr. chairman , i yield myself the balance of my time . 
mr. chairman , psalms 104 , verses 25 , 30 : `` in wisdom you made them all , the earth is full of your creatures . 
in the earlier comment , i stated that there are numerous members of this body , perhaps to the person , who could tell of horror stories involved with the administration of the current endangered species act . 
and while some of those stories are probably valid and have their good points , the current regime , as i also previously stated , has not been working . 
funding perhaps would have solved many of these horror stories to which members of this body refer . 
the legislation would increase direct spending by requiring the secretary of the interior to pay aid to private landowners who are prohibited from using their property under certain circumstances . 
at a time when we are already cutting bureau of reclamation projects , western water projects , indian programs , our national parks . 
those who criticize this act refer to the supporters of the act as being more concerned about critters than human beings . 
nowhere should that care be more evident than in the world of medicine . 
nearly 50 percent of all our medical prescriptions , for example , dispensed annually in our country , are derived from nature or modified to mimic natural substances . 
yet we have only investigated about 2 percent of the more than 250 , 000 known plant species for their possible medical breakthroughs . 
the extinction of a single species may mean the loss of the next effective treatment for cancer , for aids , or for heart disease . 
mold fungus led to the development of penicillin over 50 years ago . 
again , quoting from the bible , from ecclesiastes : `` man 's fate is like that of the animals ; the same fate awaits them both : as one dies , so dies the other . 
all have the same breath. '' mr. chairman , at the appropriate time , i will be speaking on the manager 's amendment and i will also be speaking in support of the substitute amendment that will be offered . 
as i said in my opening comments , i introduced these negotiations in good faith with the gentleman from california ( mr. pombo ) xz4003220 , my chairman , because i thought there was not adequate funding to enforce the current endangered species law , and those negotiations were conducted in good faith , and we came quite close , and he will say probably that 90 percent of the current bill is a bill upon which i agree . 
but i will say at this point that this legislation needs to be defeated , the substitute that will be offered needs to be supported , and we need to look very seriously at how we can enforce better the endangered species laws on the books today rather than the overhaul that exists in the pending legislation , and i urge defeat of the legislation . 
mr. chairman , i yield back the balance of my time . 
these changes are likely to result in more species extinctions at greater loss of taxpayer dollars . 
to say that i agree with 90 percent of this bill is not an accurate description , or is an unfair way to paint the matter . 
one of the points that we had reached agreement on was that there was to be a recovery-based standard of determining when federal agency actions jeopardize the continued existence of a species . 
it eliminates the bill 's requirement that appraisals determining the market value of foregone use of property are binding on both the secretary and the property owner . 
that makes the current pending legislation worse , and it will increase the cost of this entitlement program to property owners and it will increase that cost to the american taxpayer . 
mr. chairman , i reserve the balance of my time . 
mr. chairman , i yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from california ( mr. george miller ) xz4002780 . 
mr. chairman , i rise in support of the substitute amendment . 
it will significantly improve the species recovery which is an important part of our negotiating process that led us up to this bill on the floor today . 
the substitute will also include a statutory definition of jeopardy that will ensure that federal agency actions do not diminish recovery . 
that is a very important part of giving up the critical habitat designation , that we have an improved consultation process and an improved definition of what constitutes jeopardy . 
mr. chairman , i urge strong support of this bipartisan substitute and , again , opposition to the underlying bill . 
the gentleman from alaska ( mr. young ) xz4004392 of the committee on resources put me on the study group to talk about the endangered species act , to try and finally get it off the dime . 
it is time to end the joke of shoot , shovel , and shut up . 
i want to thank the gentleman from california for bringing this issue forward and finally getting off the dime and giving us an opportunity to vote for a reform package that truly does what we need to do , and that is save the species of this country . 
mr. chairman , i rise in strong support of the bipartisan substitute . 
mr. chairman , the endangered species act is one of our most farsighted and important conservation laws . 
today , we have wolves in yellowstone , manatees in florida , and sea otters in california , largely because of the act . 
in the southern part of new jersey , we have bald eagles , timber rattlesnakes , and barred owls because of the protections provided by the endangered species act ; and by protecting their habitat , we have protected our own habitat . 
consequently , i join with my colleagues to offer the responsible , bipartisan miller-boehlert substitute that reforms the law , answers the concerns of landowners , states , and sportsmen while improving the ability to achieve timely recovery of threatened and endangered fish , wildlife , and plants . 
by contrast , our substitute provides a better way of protecting habitat necessary for recovery , with a true focus on recovering species . 
there is broad consensus in congress to reform the endangered species act , mr. chairman ; but it is vital that in doing so we maintain the integrity of the act and our ability to conserve these species for future generations . 
mr. chairman , i rise in support of the miller-boehlert substitute amendment because i believe we will not have a world to live in if we continue our neglectful ways . 
the endangered species act has been a guiding force for the preservation of species threatened with extinction for over 30 years . 
according to the u.s. fish and wildlife service , 99 percent of the species ever listed under the esa have been prevented from going extinct , and 68 percent are stable or improving ; but the recovery plans in place may need 50 years to restore these to relative abundance . 
the amendment would prevent the creation of a mandatory entitlement program for private property owners which is likely to be hugely expensive . 
the substitute also restores the role of science in the endangered species act . 
the underlying bill appears to give the opinions of individuals without any scientific expertise equal standing with those of scientists and repeals protections against hazardous pesticides . 
mr. chairman , i rise in support of h.r. 3824 . 
reform of the endangered species act is much needed . 
the law has adversely affected thousands of farmers , ranchers and homeowners whose private property has been taken without compensation . 
over 90 percent of endangered plant and animal species are found on private property . 
there should be a balance between the rights of property owners and conservation . 
h.r. 3824 will allow the secretary of interior to compensate private property owners for the fair market value of the loss of use of their property when the secretary concludes that the use of the property would be a taking . 
this is a fair and long-overdue process that will actually promote preservation and conservation of endangered species and at the same time protect private property rights . 
they constantly preach that god 's creations are precious , yet once again they are showing their hypocrisy that they would be so careless with the lives of god 's creatures . 
perhaps if some of these endangered species were in a persistent vegetative state , republicans would come rushing to their aid . 
perhaps if scientists would concede these same plants and animals were fashioned during the week of god 's creating the world , the right wing would be willing to help . 
importantly , this substitute actually discourages the use of private land for public purposes . 
in some cases , private property owners will be asked to mitigate for the effects of preserving threatened and endangered species . 
the substitute strikes a careful balance between the rights of private property owners and the preservation of our natural resources . 
i encourage my colleagues to join me and a bipartisan group of members in supporting this reasonable , better substitute and opposing h.r. 3824 . 
i support much of the thrust of the original bill . 
had it been adopted , we would have kept the best parts of the bill as reported -- including the authorization for reimbursement for livestock losses that i supported in the resources committee -- and made the further improvements that were needed for it to deserve approval by the full house of representatives . 
proponents of the reported bill say the endangered species act has led to too many lawsuits . 
but according to the bush administration 's analysis of the bill as reported , `` the new definition of jeopardy in the bill , as well as various statutory deadlines , may generate new litigation and further divert agency resources from conservation purposes. '' the substitute did not have the same problems . 
those provisions worry the bush administration , which has told us that they `` provide little discretion to federal agencies and could result in a significant budgetary impact. '' and after reviewing the bill as reported , the nonpartisan budget watchdog group , taxpayers for common sense , concluded that `` this legislation is rife with loopholes and vague wording that have the potential to cost taxpayers billions of dollars , and must be revised. '' i supported the bipartisan substitute because it would have made the revisions necessary to close those loopholes . 
nonetheless , while i can not support the bill today , i am hopeful that it will be further improved as the legislative process continues and that the result will be legislation to revise the endangered species act that i can support and that will deserve the support of every member of congress . 
once again the folks running this place have made a mockery of the legislative process . 
first of all , last week , just a short 10 days ago , we first saw the bill . 
some of the members of the committee did not even see it until tuesday . 
we only had four witnesses and several hours of hearings ; and the crucial witness in this case , the administration witness , would not even take a position on the bill . 
after we had that hearing with four witnesses , the very next day , rather than waiting a day or two and seeing how the hearing went and what the reaction was , we marked up the bill and reported it out of committee . 
so at the end of the week we thought we had one bill . 
so what the gentleman from california just said about the democrats writing the bill , sure , we contributed some of the language , but the manager 's amendment makes significant changes in this bill ; and the things that we are really fighting over , we may have contributed 90 percent , but the things we are fighting over in the 10 percent are huge things at stake : this huge giveaway to big developers , major changes in the environmental laws . 
it has made mockery of the legislative process . 
first of all , let us talk about some of those differences . 
it basically does not put a dollar amount in the bill , because they are afraid of the dollar amount because it is an entitlement program for landowners that want to gut the endangered species act . 
it sets up a program so that the government goes out and works with those landowners to accomplish the goals of the endangered species act . 
the majority bill , and this is another major difference , changes the endangered species act in a radical , radical way , especially with the adoption of the manager 's amendment . 
the substitute reforms the endangered species act , while protecting the core provisions of that magnificent environmental law that has been on the books for 30 years . 
at the end of this , we have not respected this institution by the way we brought the bill before the floor , the way we have worked in committee to put it on a rocket docket and speed it through , speed it through this process . 
mr. chairman , i rise today in support of the substitute amendment in opposition to h.r. 3824 . 
h.r. 3824 is being promoted as a piece of legislation that is good for business . 
as a senior member of both the small business committee and the resources committee , i think i have an important perspective on this issue . 
i would like to draw a parallel between the endangered species act and landmark legislation that has been passed by congress to protect the health and safety of workers . 
but we do n't because we intuitively understand that supporting the very foundation of business , the people who do the work , is a long-term economic benefit for society , even though it may cost a few dollars up front . 
all of us can easily relate to the problems caused by unfair labor practices and unsafe working conditions . 
however , very few of us are scientists . 
i am not here to say whether that is good or bad but just to offer one explanation why we find it so difficult to grasp that the health of our environment and the continuity of all the pieces in our environment is as important to the health of our society and the strength of our economy as sound labor practices . 
legislation that hurts the health of the worker is not good for business . 
laws , like the one being proposed today , that undermine the very foundation of our society 's well-being and economic infrastructure , are not good for business . 
when we undermine the basic tenets and goals of the endangered species act , we do so at our own peril . 
most of us in the house were alive in the early 1960s when rachel carson published her book , silent spring . 
the silence of which she spoke caused by the extermination of songbirds , dying because the shells that protected their offspring shattered long before the young were ready to hatch . 
the eggs shattered and the next generation died because ddt weakened the structure of the eggs . 
the spring , once filled with the sound of songbirds , was growing ever more silent as ddt began to pervade every corner of our environment . 
ddt nearly exterminated our nation 's symbol of freedom , the bald eagle , because it shattered their shells . 
ddt nearly exterminated the endless flocks of brown pelicans flying low over the ocean 's horizon , because it shattered the shells of their young . 
in my lifetime , i have witnessed the near extinction of these birds . 
even though the birds have returned , did we ban ddt too late , because we all know that every one of us harbors residues of ddt in our bodies , that ddt is found in our mother 's milk ? 
but the existence of today 's young people is not the existence i remember from my youth . 
bottled water , mercury poisoning the womb , rates of asthma attacks skyrocketing , beaches closed because e.coli pollutes the water and sickens our children . 
let me close where i began -- whether or not a drastic weakening of the endangered species act is good for business . 
this highly selective economic analysis only counts what can be most easily quantified -- the cost of timber not cut , the cost of water not sold , the cost of crops not sprayed with pesticide . 
it is easy to hold up the first balance sheet and say , `` business will suffer '' in the same way one could say that by prohibiting the labor of children , `` business will suffer '' . 
but the cumulative costs of a thousand cuts into the environment that sustains us as humans will be borne by everyone in society , consumers and businesses alike . 
the endangered species act does not take property from private entities ; it protects the property , the health and the wealth of all americans . 
he created the forest reserves for both the future home building needs of the country and for water , if we read his statements , and , of course , for nature as well . 
he created the wildlife refuge in the klamath basin to ensure that we would have healthy wildlife populations for generations to come ; and , indeed , the wildlife refuge is home to the greatest concentration of bald eagles in the united states , in the lower 48 . 
when the national academy of sciences reviewed the decisions , they said the agency made mistakes in the outcome under the endangered species act ; and further they went on to say that those decisions put in jeopardy potentially those very species , the sucker fish in the upper klamath lake and the coho salmon in the klamath river . 
it potentially could have damaged both of those . 
and unlike the substitute that will be offered soon , we allow a full public process , a 1-year timeline for the secretary to further define the criteria of the science . 
this section says you can not come back and get a second bite at the same apple , so you have to follow state and local zoning ordinances and laws , you have to prove you are financially capable of undertaking the activity , and the government has to give you an answer when you propose to do something on your private , private , property here . 
that is one of the great things about this country . 
we can talk about the bald eagle , and i am a big fan of them , but one of the underpinnings of our great democracy is our private property rights . 
in the case of the klamath basin , in many respects they were taken away when their water was cut off and 1 , 200 farm families were left destitute . 
i believe in recovery , i believe in species , and i think what we are changing in this bill will build new partnerships that will bring landowners and the government together like never before , that respects the rights of private owners of property , and will actually result in increased recovery of species and habitat . 
mr. chairman , i urge approval of the underlying bill . 
mr. chairman , first of all , to respond to my colleague from washington , a simple deed restriction takes care of that . 
let me talk about a couple of the differences between these two plans and why i support the underlying pombo bill . 
cbo says we will compensate private property owners to the tune of maybe $ 6 million in the first 5 years . 
so if the members want bigger bureaucracy , pay gs15s here in washington , a total of $ 1 million combined over the year , and they get just as much as we are talking about trying to help out the private property owners . 
and if they ask the government for some sort of safe harbor for entering into a habitat conservation program , basically they get back a written determination under our provision that prevents them from being prosecuted , from the government 's coming back and double-timing them , saying , yes , go ahead and we will not prosecute if you do everything you said you were going to do . 
under the alternative , as i read it , whatever they do , they would have to get an incidental take permit and then they still do not have any kind of protection from the government 's coming back again after them . 
our national symbol , the bald eagle , is one of the most profound stories of recovery in progress . 
the american alligator , the peregrine falcon , and the california condor are but a few examples of species that have benefited by the provisions in the bill . 
according to the united states fish and wildlife service , nearly half of the species that had been on the list more than 7 years were stable or improving , and those are the facts . 
mr. chairman , h.r. 3824 is full of giveaways to large development companies and other special interests . 
the pombo legislation includes provisions that require the government to use taxpayer dollars to pay developers and other special interests not to violate the endangered species act , instead of creating commonsense incentive programs that would foster greater involvement in conservation efforts . 
congress should choose to send a national message regarding the mindful stewardship of our country . 
if not , further abuses will occur as evidenced by governor schwarzenegger in my own home state of california . 
tuesday , the governor fired all six members of the state reclamation board , an agency that oversees flood control . 
is the governor 's protection of developers and big landowners worth the devastation that oversight can avoid ? 
congress would be wise to take notice , in light of the no-bid contracts , pleas to exempt all environmental regulations in the gulf states after katrina , and the same old companies slurping up federal funds in egregious excess . 
it would also allow the unlimited use of dangerous pesticides at the expense of the people , plants , and wildlife . 
this bill would repeal all endangered species act provisions that regulate the use of pesticides like ddt , which nearly resulted in the extinction of the american bald eagle in the mid-20th century and decimated the california brown pelican population in my own state . 
will taxpayers be asked to foot the bill to pay companies to follow other laws of the land ? 
mr. chairman , i thank the gentleman from california for yielding me this time , and i wish to engage the chairman of the committee on resources in a colloquy . 
for many years , mr. chairman , the u.s. army corps of engineers has engaged in river management practices that have harmed several species of native wildlife that live in and near the missouri river and undermine the economic livelihood of many communities along the upper missouri river basin . 
my state , and others in the upper reaches of the basin , have repeatedly endeavored to influence the decisions of the corps as it makes critical river management decisions . 
the interagency consultation provisions found in the current law are one of the few tools at our disposal . 
so i am concerned that the alternative procedures defined but not specified in section 12 of the threatened and endangered species act would create a way for the corps to disregard the consultation requirement , and i want to make sure the alternative procedures provision is not designed as a way to eliminate consultation between federal agencies . 
mr. chairman , i thank the gentleman for recognizing my concern and clarifying the intent of the bill . 
mr. chairman , i rise in support of h.r. 3824 . 
this legislation is a reasonable , balanced response that i think will address many of the unintended difficulties and consequences that have arisen since the passage of the original act . 
that has given us an awful good opportunity to see what sort of insight and experience in terms of what has worked in preserving and protecting endangered species and habitat and what just as importantly has not worked . 
california faces numerous challenges in complying with the endangered species act , like many parts of our country . 
we also have 11 million acres of designated critical habitat of which 30 percent of it is privately owned . 
in kern county , part of which lies in my district , we have more listed species than any other county in the state of california . 
to relay an anecdotal story of which there have been many here today , in 1995 , we had a chinese immigrant farmer who , believe it or not , was jailed and prosecuted due to an accidental taking of a species on his land that he had farmed for years . 
as a matter of fact , his tractor had been confiscated as corroborating evidence . 
as a result of that , i and others in the california legislature led a successful effort to change the law to ensure that that would not happen again . 
during the committee markup last week , i successfully passed two amendments that clarify local governments ' role in participating in the development of habitat conservation planning . 
as we know , many of the habitat conservation plans have had difficulty in their adoption . 
it obviously is a work in progress , but we should understand that the dilemma that we face in america today is that while we all want to protect native plants and species , the dilemma is that our population growth has threatened the habitats for many of those plants and animals , and therein lies the dilemma . 
i applaud the bipartisan efforts of the gentleman from california ( mr. pombo ) xz4003220 and the ranking member , the gentleman from west virginia ( mr. rahall ) xz4003310 and their staff for working with all the members of the committee , and the gentleman from california ( mr. cardoza ) xz4000650 for addressing the problems of the original bill . 
mr. chairman , i would like to enter into a colloquy with the chairman of the committee on resources . 
my amendment that i referenced a moment ago that was accepted by the committee is meant to assure that states and units of local government have fair input in the listing process for threatened and endangered species . 
local governments , we know , often have the best on-the-ground information on the status of communities of plants and animals that are in the area . 
this bill would formally recognize the local governments ' rights to comment on the listing process and the acquisition of the best available scientific data . 
in many areas of california , we have water districts that are an extremely active part of the local governmental units that are involved in the species recovery process . 
in order to understand the status and the challenges of the various species that are listed , is it the chairman 's understanding that the reference to units of local government in section 8 of the bill would include water districts ? 
first of all , the definition as it relates to property rights i think is lacking and needs to be worked on in an important way . 
second , as it relates to the discussion of jeopardy to species , it is so vague . 
how it would be applied to section 7 and other aspects of the measure , i do not believe it is clear and could indicate further need for litigation , which is the current problem and part that we are trying to solve . 
farmers and ranchers , i would maintain , are , in many cases , one of the last bastions of protection for habitat . 
when we have growth areas throughout the country , like in california , those farms and those ranches are one of the last hedges to urban sprawl and uncontrolled growth . 
mr. chairman , i rise in opposition to the substitute and in favor of the underlying bill . 
an amendment offered by the gentleman from california ( mr. radanovich ) xz4003300 in committee , which was accepted without objection , will allow local officials to perform vital work needed to prevent the potential threat of catastrophic flooding . 
i rise in opposition because this needed amendment is stripped out of the substitute . 
we know how complex federal bureaucracy can be , but in times of emergency nothing is more important than human health and safety . 
when critical levee repairs are needed to protect human life , time is of the essence . 
the esa must be made flexible enough to allow timely repair and maintenance of levees before disaster strikes . 
the amendment that we offered frees local agencies from lengthy processes only for those projects where critical repairs are needed to avoid the loss of human life due to natural disaster . 
the amendment that we offered in committee is narrowly tailored to give local flood protection officials the same flexibility to make needed repairs ; but importantly , it does so before the onset of deadly flooding . 
it is ironic that the fish and wildlife service and noaa fisheries have recently implemented emergency procedures enabling them to expedite the otherwise lengthy consultation process that has to occur before the reconstruction of levees and other flood protection infrastructure ravaged by hurricane katrina . 
thank god they did implement these procedures , because time is of the essence . 
there is no provision under existing law that allows for emergency measures to be taken prior to the onset of danger . 
my colleague advised in california back in 1990 and 1991 , the corps of engineers warned the community that their levees needed repair work . 
we must not allow this kind of avoidable tragedy to happen again . 
mr. chairman , i rise today in support of this important very important reform legislation because it is an issue that is very important to me and many of my constituents in my district . 
as we all know , the challenge we face in reforming the esa is to create a balance between the important goal of conservation and preservation of our nation 's species and making sure property owners , businesses , workers and communities do not suffer unnecessarily for these efforts . 
under the current structure of the endangered species act , these two goals have unfortunately been at odds and have been a barrier to important economic development . 
a community in my district seeking this balance is durant , oklahoma , which is in part of the `` historic range '' of the american burying beetle . 
the leaders of durant have worked hard and have had success in bringing business to their area of far southeastern oklahoma , but each year , the construction of new sites for these businesses is brought to a screeching halt , always looking for the burying beetle , but no presence of the beetle has been found for a number over years . 
there must be a better way to balance the needs of the species and the needs of the communities . 
i commend the hard work of those who have brought us here today . 
of course , we get to the floor and i am hearing some different things now . 
now , it seems to me what this comes down to is a couple of differing philosophies here . 
if you were a suck-up to the king , if you paid homage , kind of like the kelo decision , you were the better friend of the government , then the government was going to treat you good . 
and if you do not get it within 180 days , then you have got your answer as a matter of law . 
by golly , under our system of law , the way our constitution is written , you ought to be compensated for it . 
the congress assembled on behalf of the american people , and this administration will borrow $ 1.3 billion a day every day for those 30 days . 
well , perhaps we could make some real cuts in wasteful programs in the budget , instead of attacking the vulnerable , the students , kids getting lunches at school . 
the president has this bizarre idea that we should borrow a trillion dollars , one thousand billion dollars to go to mars while we can not meet the needs of people here on earth , here in the united states of america . 
the general in charge of star wars gave us some very , very encouraging news . 
but he said it has a better than zero chance of working , better than zero after $ 100 billion and abrogating the anti-missile treaty . 
there is a lot of money coming in there . 
of course , those same oil company execs , of course they were not under oath , i have got to admit that , said that that money , the head of exxon said it is nothing , it is chump change , and it has no effect on our operations . 
then we have a few tax giveaways out there , offshore companies like accenture , largest homeland security contractor in the history of the united states , $ 10 billion , who has moved their headquarters to the bahamas so they will not pay any taxes in the united states of america , but they are going to defend us against foreign enemies , but they just do not want to pay any taxes here . 
mr. speaker , reclaiming my time , i would schedule some up-or-down votes on these sorts of major cuts in a much expanded reconciliation under an open rule . 
mr. speaker , that was the ploy of your party . 
what we are talking about is congress going on vacation , congress going away for 2 weeks , have thanksgiving at home , while we are taking food out of the mouths of kids and depriving students of loans through the reconciliation bill , borrowing $ 1.3 billion a day on behalf of the american taxpayers and getting them by another $ 39 billion . 
you are negotiating cuts only with your side of the aisle . 
you do not intend to get a single democratic vote ; and the biggest cut in the bill is student loans , the party of opportunity . 
the second biggest cut in the bill is medicaid ; dump those problems on the states and deprive people of needed health care . 
then , of course , we have the cuts in food security and other things in that bill . 
we will not be allowed to offer any amendments during the consideration of that bill . 
i would stay here through next week and have debate day after day and go through a series of amendments up or down on bringing some fiscal responsibility to this congress . 
mr. speaker , i wondered to myself earlier this morning as the rules committee majority members passed yet another closed rule which stifles debate and shuts off meaningful contributions from members of this chamber . 
congress has only had since january 3 of this year to complete work on the 12 annual appropriations bills , the so-called `` must pass bills '' that congress works on every year . 
in case anyone is unclear , so far the president has signed only five of the 12 appropriations bills that must pass and become law before september 30 . 
military quality of life and veterans affairs ? 
of course , the bill which funds this very institution , the legislative branch appropriations legislation , well , we did that to protect our branch . 
it is an irrefutable fact , the last time that there was sole democratic control of congress and the white house , all 13 appropriations bills were passed by september 30 . 
now we have debt as far as the eye can see and disdain from much of the rest of the world . 
the people here are the modern day incarnations of nero . 
more than 45 days have passed since congress passed its last continuing resolution , 48 to be exact ; and in that time , republicans have managed to pass a measly three of the ten outstanding appropriations bills at the time of the last continuing resolution . 
but in the real world where salaries and promotion are based on accomplishments and contributions , getting done 30 percent of what you are supposed to get done is absolutely abysmal . 
in fact , this morning the chairman of the rules committee said to us that we have `` full employment '' in this nation . 
so forgive me , mr. speaker , if i feel it unnecessary to grant republicans another 30 days to fix a problem that they , one , created on their own , and two , have shown zero ability that they are capable of leading our country in a responsibly fiscal manner . 
the problem republicans have is their beloved tax cuts that 95 percent of the people in this country barely benefit from . 
mr. speaker , i reserve the balance of my time . 
the suggestion that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle should have completed their work by september 30 is mandated by our responsibilities here in the house of representatives . 
and i find it disingenuous to speak of the other body , which i heartily endorse what my colleague said with reference to the gentleman from california ( mr. lewis ) xz4002392 in this house of representatives but the other body is controlled by the majority . 
the gentleman asks for another date or debate about this continuing resolution , doubtless what we would have been able to do is stay here and that may have lit a fire under some of the people in the other body who need to get their work done . 
we have all sorts of problems in this nation and there is no reason for us not to complete our work . 
i say to my very good friend from florida that your and my chairman of the rules committee speaking about closed rules in another time made the following statement , that closed rules are anathema to democracy . 
when you argue that we are going to have time to do this , when we take the budget deficit matter up , what you are talking about is 1 hour on the rule , 1 hour on general debate , you say 2 hours , i will accept that , on general debate , 10 minutes in the motion to recommit , and that then is what 435 members and five delegates have that they can deal with in terms of time . 
what part of national sacrifice do we not understand ? 
what part of closed rule that i heard so often in 1992 does the majority not understand that that does not give the members of this body the opportunity to come forward with amendments that might make sense with reference to fiscal responsibility here in the house of representatives ? 
those are some of the issues . 
mr. speaker , i have no additional speakers and i yield back the balance of my time . 
this is a continuing resolution that simply includes a change of date extending our work through december 17 in order to give the president and others enough time to review these conference reports and other pieces of legislation being sent to the administration in rapid fire . 
mr. speaker , i reserve the balance of my time . 
mr. speaker , i yield back the balance of my time . 
mr. speaker , i will not take very long on this bill either , but i do think it is important to take note of a few facts . 
at the beginning of this year , it was made quite clear by the majority that they desired to finish all appropriations bills on time and that there be no omnibus appropriations bill lumping all kinds of disassociated items into the same package . 
we on the minority side of the aisle have provided procedural cooperation at virtually every step of the way . 
those time limits were sometimes stringent and they met with objection from a number of members . 
we provided unanimous consent so that the scheduling of legislation could be accelerated on numerous occasions . 
those bills are the treasury , transportation , hud bill , the military quality of life bill , the labor , health , education and social services bill , and the defense appropriations bill . 
together , those four bills , which we have yet to complete , represent 78 percent of appropriated financing for the coming year . 
it is certainly not because of any failure on the part of the appropriations committee . 
and yet we are here with so much unfinished business on the appropriations side of the ledger . 
despite the fact that the white house , the senate and the house are all under control of the majority party , despite that fact we have reached this delay and are forced once again to seek another continuing resolution . 
the reason that has occurred , in my view , is because the budget resolution was so skewed in favor of the ideological right within the majority party caucus that in the end , even a number of republican moderates have not wanted to vote for some of these bills , most especially in the senate . 
and we find that even republican committee chairmen , like senator specter , have described one of the bills as being totally inadequate to its responsibilities . 
this country is in the middle of fighting a war . 
that war has a huge cost , and yet the republican majority is in pursuit of its goal of providing huge tax cuts , a huge percentage of which will be put into the pockets of the most wealthy people in this country . 
their desire to do that has led them to a willingness to borrow whatever it takes in order to put the money in those pockets and then use the resulting deficit as a reason to cut back on a number of other bills . 
they use it as a reason to make significant cuts in education , in health , in science , environmental protection and the rest , and then pretend that the cost of katrina is what made them do it , when , in fact , the cost of tax cuts for persons in the top 1 percent of income in this country over the next decade will cost about 10 times as much as the cost of katrina . 
so then we are forced because of the squeeze , we are forced to endure delays , and we have to bring forward a continuing resolution such as we are doing today . 
and i would point out that after we have gone through all of this effort , we , in the end , are probably still going to be stuck with an omnibus appropriations bill at the end , despite the fact that the majority party indicated they were going to move heaven and earth in order to avoid such an eventuality . 
it is my understanding that the people expect to attach the bird flu appropriations , the appropriations for katrina supplemental , and every other special deal that somebody can conjure up and attach it to the defense bill , and then hide it behind the skirts of military spending . 
the betting is that members will want to support funding for the troops and so they will vote for whatever other garbage is attached to that bill by way of nongermane items . 
it could be avoided if the majority had chosen to be a little less ideological , if they had chosen to pull the rubber band just a little less tightly , and if they had chosen to cross the aisle and work in a bipartisan fashion on taxes , on spending , and on other items that affect the shape and nature of the budget . 
mr. speaker , i yield back the balance of my time . 
mr. speaker , by direction of the committee on rules , i call up house resolution 558 and ask for its immediate consideration . 
mr. speaker , for the purpose of debate only , i yield the customary 30 minutes to my neighbor and friend , the gentleman from florida ( mr. hastings ) xz4001701 , pending which i yield myself such time as i may consume . 
during consideration of this resolution , all time yielded is for the purpose of debate only . 
mr. speaker , house resolution 558 is a rule that provides for consideration of house joint resolution 72 , making further continuing appropriations for fiscal year 2006 . 
as we approach the end of the week and the time that we will be taking in our districts to celebrate the thanksgiving holiday , this particular rule and the cr probably are among the least controversial things that the gentleman from florida and i will discuss today . 
the rule provides for 1 hour of debate in the house equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the committee on appropriations . 
the rule waives all points of order against consideration of the joint resolution and provides one motion to recommit . 
this is something that unfortunately has become a routine part of our end-of-the-year appropriations process and chairman lewis under tremendous leadership with a great committee behind him has managed to avoid that this year , in fact , setting almost a record by completing all of the house 's work on the appropriations process before july 4. the committee has practiced due diligence and is working to pass each of these bills individually rather than having them attached as a train at the end of the year . 
this continuing resolution is necessary because our friends on the other side of the rotunda are a little bit further behind in their appropriations process and we are working through the conference report stage . 
the cr is a clean continuation of h. j. res. 68 , which passed the house in september by a vote of 348-65 , and which funded programs and activities at the lowest of the house-passed level , the senate-passed level or the fiscal year 2005 current rate and included language prohibiting agencies from resuming or initiating programs for procurement not funded in fy 2005 and prohibited agencies from awarding new grants and other forms of assistance during the period of continuing resolution . 
again , i want to express my gratitude to the gentleman from california ( chairman lewis ) , the ranking member , the gentleman from wisconsin ( mr. obey ) xz4003000 and the entire committee and staff of the appropriations committee for their hard work this year . 
i urge members to support the rules and the underlying continuing resolution so we can finish the appropriations process in regular order and continue on our way toward responsibly funding the needs of america . 
mr. speaker , i reserve the balance of my time . 
i recognize that we all had to get up early to be at rules this morning , and apparently it is affecting some of our temperaments . 
i would just point out that we finished all of the house 's work , and i gave equal credit to both our chairman , the gentleman from california ( mr. lewis ) xz4002392 and the rest of his committee and the ranking member , the gentleman from wisconsin ( mr. obey ) xz4003000 , who finished all of our work by july 4 , all of our appropriations processes in regular order , in an individual manner instead of having to bundle them up into a train at the end of the legislative season . 
to date , we have finished seven of those 11 appropriations bills . 
we will do the eighth in a couple of hours here on this floor today , which leaves three remaining waiting to be returned from their conference work with the senate . 
and when it comes to the enemy of time and being at the end of the legislative calendar , that , unfortunately , is the case with the appropriations process that we are waiting on regular order , the conference committees with the house and the senate to finish their work on those three remaining bills . 
it funds the operations of government from now until december 17 . 
the stifling of debate is nonexistent . 
the fact that it is a closed rule indicates that there is really no other option about how to approach a continuing resolution other than should it be december 16 instead of december 17 ? 
would the gentleman have the cr expire on thanksgiving day when no one will be in this chamber to act to fund the operations of the government so that national parks remain open and social security checks continue to go out ? 
what would the amendments be that the gentleman would offer if december 17 is an inadequate solution to funding the operations of government until we finish the three remaining conference reports on appropriations ? 
mr. speaker , i reserve the balance of my time . 
mr. speaker , the gentleman clearly has come to the floor a little bit early , because all of these things are going to be eligible for debate here in another several hours when we move forward on our deficit reduction package , and the gentleman will have an opportunity to exercise through his vote that savings process , that deficit reduction process . 
the gentleman is passionate about his concern for the fiscal well-being , but he is clearly misdirected in the sense that he will have an opportunity to vote on a number of these deficit reduction measures , a number of these savings , a number of these government reform mechanisms ; and he will have the opportunity to present all of the things that he talked about in his own recommittal motion , which is a right that has been granted to the minority party . 
so all of the things that he talked about , all of the things that he objects to , the sound agricultural policy that guarantees that we continue to have the safest , cheapest food supply in the world , if you want to cut those things , you can put it in your program . 
the point is that we are here today debating the rule on the continuing resolution of the government because we have three regular order appropriations bills yet to move , because i believe , to our credit and to this chamber 's credit , to the credit of the entire house , we are not moving a last minute omnibus choo-choo train that all of us have to go home and then discover something in that that we are not real terribly proud of . 
i think it is a credit to the appropriators on both sides of the aisle and a credit , frankly , to both chambers , and as the gentleman from florida has pointed out , under republican leadership , that are bringing us 11 individual appropriations bills that can be voted on up or down . 
you have an opportunity to make your position publicly known on each of those bills , rather than having things stuffed into a last-minute train , which all of us object to and which diminishes the status of the house . 
mr. speaker , i reserve the balance of my time . 
we know that it is going to be a long day as we approach the debate over the labor , health and human services appropriations bill , the ongoing debate over the continuing resolution to fund our government , and later today the deficit reduction package , which i dare say will not take food from any child in america 's mouth , despite the overheated rhetoric of the gentleman from oregon , respectfully the gentleman from florida and a number of others on that side of the aisle who it would appear from their media statements discuss in the salons and parlors of the beltway whether republicans hate children or old people more . 
i dare say that as we bring up this deficit reduction act , which finally for the first time since 1997 puts us back on a serious track to finding savings not just in the discretionary side of our spending but in the mandatory side which makes up over half of federal spending today and which slows the rate of growth in government , again , one of those washington , d.c.-style cuts , where budgets grow 7 percent instead of 7.3 percent or they grow 6 percent instead of 6.3 percent , and we find $ 50 billion worth of savings in a $ 2.5 trillion per year budget . 
i think that almost any american would say i think that my budget growing 7 percent instead of 7.3 percent is acceptable , and i dare say to my friend from florida , who represents , among other counties , palm beach county , florida , the home of lake worth avenue among other places . 
i think there are a number of counties that would gladly trade their tax base for his , and i would also say that i believe that somewhere in palm beach county there is an afterschool program of some shape or form . 
there must be an afterschool program somewhere in all of palm beach county , florida . 
i believe that as we move through this debate it is important for us to be responsible in our rhetoric and keep our eyes on the ball , which is the looming fiscal crisis that is out there if congress does not have the courage to get its arms around mandatory spending , which is consuming federal spending , making up over 50 percent of it today and two-thirds of federal spending . 
mr. speaker , reclaiming my time , the gentleman referred to the entire county , not his piece of the county , and i certainly am well aware of pahokee and belle glade and the challenges that they have gone through . 
mr. speaker , i yield back the balance of my time , and i move the previous question on the resolution .
