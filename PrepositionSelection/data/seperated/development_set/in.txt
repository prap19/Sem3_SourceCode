the gentleman from wisconsin refused earlier to yield time but i was going to ask him if virginia has those elections in a shorter time period they should be commended for that
so now we have a situation in the congress where the virginia delegation has sent their members here but many other states do not have members here
do they at that point elect a speaker of the house in the absence of other members
they come in
i have been in very traumatic situations with people in severe car wrecks and mountain climbing accidents
people respond in extraordinary ways and we must preserve an institution that has the deliberative body and the checks and balances to meet those challenges
we in this body were effectively disabled by an anthrax attack not long after september 11
i would ask my dear friends will you conduct this election in 45 days if there is anthrax in the mail and still preserve the franchise of the american people
you had a mock debate in the committee on the judiciary in which the distinguished chairman presented my bill without allowing me the courtesy or dignity to defend it myself
sir i think you dissemble in that regard
here is the fundamental question for us my friends and it is this the american people are watching television and an announcement comes on and says the congress has been destroyed in a nuclear attack the president and vice president are killed and the supreme court is dead and thousands of our citizens in this town are
the american people in one scenario are told we do not know who is going to run the country we have no representatives where in another you will have temporary representatives carrying your interests to this great body while we deliberate and have real elections
in fact what our bill would do is tell the terrorists you could come on a single day and set off a nuclear weapon in this town and kill every single member of us and though we would be missed the very next day the congress would be up and functioning with every single state every single district having full representation by statesmen and stateswomen at a time of national crisis
you are leaving this country vulnerable to change in power
if we have temporary replacements you immediately reconstitute the house you immediately ensure representation you assure that you maintain the balance of political power and you do it in an orderly structured way with no chaos in a way that is constitutionally valid by definition
it does not allow really qualified people necessarily to get here and act in time
it does not solve the problem for this reason by leaving us without a congress for 45 days we essentially impose the opportunity for the executive branch to exert marshal law and that is not what the framers of this country had in mind
then another delegation comes in et cetera
you are essentially leaving this country without a house of representatives without checks and balances without separation of powers for at least 45 days assuming an election can be held in 45 days and assuming that the terrorists through an anthrax attack like they subjected this very capitol to will not somehow undermine that ability
if we do not and we are not fortunate history will not look kindly upon the jeopardy in which we have left this great nation
vote no on this bill and insist on true debate on true continuity of congress in a responsible way that protects the balance of power assures real succession to the presidency and most importantly assures that your constituents will have representation at a time when our nation may well go to nuclear war institute a draft appropriate trillions of dollars suspend habeas corpus and impose marshal law
mr chairman if there is no one to speak in opposition i ask unanimous consent to withdraw my preferential motion
he said the accumulation of all powers legislative executive and judiciary in the same hands whether of one a few or many and whether hereditary selfappointed or elected may justly be pronounced the very definition of tyranny now i would like if i may to ask my colleagues before we pass this appropriations bill with legislative language in it alleging to maintain continuity to maybe address a couple of questions before my colleagues vote on this and i will yield time
and if that is the case are we not with this bill promoting tyranny in this country
mr chairman i would suggest that with these questions remaining we should not be passing this legislation in the manner in which we are
we believe we need real elections not hasty elections not elections in which the candidates are chosen by the party but elections in which there is time for deliberation elections in which there is time for overseas people to vote elections in which we can have real candidates real debate real primaries et cetera
but the question is should we have a congress in the interim
i have heard the chairman of the committee on the judiciary point out that in the days post911 it was an elected congress not an appointed congress that made decisions
my colleague from illinois will recall that in fact the patriot act was passed during that 7week interregnum and interregnum may be the proper word because if we do not have a congress we would have effectively a monarchy or an appointed administration
far preferable would be some mechanism in which the terrorists and the rest of the world could see the congress of the united states reconvening with legitimacy and with distinguished statesmen from both sides of the aisle to conduct the people s business until such time as we had really elections
so do i madison was present in that first congress
in this congress we have spent so much time debating so many things of much less importance and it is fair enough to say that my amendment did not pass
major votes in the us house of representatives september 11october 26 2001 september 13 2001
the bill exempted individuals killed in the 911 terrorist attacks or who die as a result of injuries suffered in those attacks from paying federal income tax in the year of their death
this bill directed the justice department to expedite the benefit payment process for the public safety officers and their families that were killed or suffered catastrophic injuries sustained in the line of duty in connection with the terrorist attacks of sept
the bill appropriated 40 billion in emergency funds to pay for the costs of recovery from the 911 terrorist attacks and to counter investigate and prosecute terrorist activities
the bill appropriates 105 billion for military construction programs in fy 2002
this bill provided 15 billion in assistance to the us airline industry to help stabilize the financial condition of the industry in the wake of the terrorist attacks on sept
11 5 billion in immediate cash assistance and 10 billion in loan guarantees
the measure provided business and individual tax cuts totaling 995 billion in 2002 and 1594 billion over 10 years
and we were able to work with the gentleman from new york mr walsh xz4004200 the gentleman from virginia mr kingston xz4002210 the gentleman from virginia mr moran xz4002831 the former subcommittee chairs and ranking members in slowly moving some things forward
i must confess i have some concerns in looking at this budget
the library of congress is the largest repository of information in the world
we have an obligation in congress to support their efforts and it is time sensitive
and i am afraid that if we slip a year then we slip another year we end up putting a burden on the people who run the library of congress and we put part of that collection in jeopardy
look at what happened to the library of congress jefferson building being neglected for decades and it took a major renovation for the library that gem that we are all so proud of to be fit for use in time for its centennial
this is an important little detail that is going to make their job harder and i am afraid in the long run if we are not careful it is going to be the abrogation of our responsibility to maintain this largest collection of information in the history of the world
mr chairman i am pleased to join the gentleman in coauthoring this amendment
and i hope that our distinguished chair and ranking member of the committee on appropriations will be able to in fact deal with this in conference in a serious manner because it is not just a matter here of saving over 5 million a year just in printing costs and it is not a matter of saving some 57 tons of paper
there are 521 subscribers in america to the printed version of the lt em gt lt em gt congressional record
this is symbolic of what we can do in the vast federal bureaucracy to break the stranglehold of past action and move to take advantage of this technology that we have invested not hundreds of millions but billions of dollars every year
this is a small important step to move us in the right direction
i rise in support of the millendermcdonald amendment and to express concern for the underlying bill
i am glad we are considering legislation that would address what should be done in the event of a largescale incapacitation of congress
it is more essential than ever in a time of national emergency that democracy be preserved
our constitution established the house of representatives to provide directly elected representation in the event of a catastrophe that must be restored as quickly as possible
we have heard sort of grand philosophical statements of our allegiance to democracy on the floor of this house but at the same time we need to be practical about what actually can work in a time of national crisis
i was secretary of state in the 1980s for 8 years in the state of ohio a large state with several million registered voters a state that has always had a tradition of bipartisan elections conducted fairly
the year of 2004 may have been different where the election machinery frankly was not so well administered as it had been in the past by secretaries of state of both parties
in a national emergency congress must be able to provide immediate relief and this legislation would allow the country to elect representation for those 6 or 7 weeks
you can not i believe hold fair elections accessible elections in 49 days
again military voters people far away outside the country in uniform serving our country elderly voters who do not have access to the polls the most vulnerable among us in many ways that can not simply do that
i supported legislation last year that as the gentleman from wisconsin chairman sensenbrenner said was defeated but could be considered in the light of understanding how elections actually work in that there needs to be a time line to get candidates on the ballots to get the ballots printed to get them sent to the armed forces around the world and get those ballots back in time for an election
i support the millendermcdonald amendment because appointing the process if we could do that down the line and i understand that is not on the table today but to do them in 45 or 49 days simply is not practical and too many people will be denied the right to vote
we want to refill if you will the house of representatives as quickly as possible but we want to do it in the most democratic way possible and ultimately that means giving the election machinery time so that everyone especially our servicemen and women overseas so that everyone has access to the ballots
mr speaker on march 1 the committee on rules met and granted a structured rule for hr 841 the continuity in representation act of 2005
mr speaker hr 841 is an important step forward in addressing what are critical shortcomings in america s plan for the continuity of this house in the event of an unexpected disaster or attack
while i was not a member of congress on september 11 2001 i was in an office directly across lafayette park from the white house
like all americans i remember that day in detail
in the event that more than 100 members of congress are killed the speaker may announce that exceptional circumstances exist and thereby trigger expedited special elections that must occur within 7 full weeks thus ensuring the continuity of the house of representatives
mr speaker this legislation should not be very divisive based on the fact that a similar measure passed the house by a substantial bipartisan margin of 365 to 97 in the last session of congress
mr speaker you may well hear many members describe various provisions today in the context of federal election law
we can either be responsible in preparing for what we all hope never occurs or we can engage in pointless bickering over election laws that are historically controlled by the localities
what we do know however is that we are engaged in a real genuine and taxing global war on terror
it is an issue of critical importance in establishing an orderly response should the unthinkable occur again
this bill originated in direct response to the events of september 11
during my time as secretary of state in oklahoma the bombing of the alfred p murrah federal building occurred
at that time such an event was considered unthinkable in the united states
hr 841 is an important part of that preparation and it also is a tangible sign to terrorists that they will never intimidate this country change the nature of this house as the elected representatives of the american people or keep our government from facing any challenges it may face in the future
mr speaker i want to thank the gentleman for his kind words and i look forward to working with him as we move ahead and i learn from him as i already have in the context of the deliberations of the committee on rules
in closing i would like to say i believe the debate has been an excellent discussion underlining many of the substantive concerns of both sides of a complex issue
mr speaker today others have placed this debate in the context of election laws and constitutional issues
it is about establishing an orderly procedure to ensure the continuity of the house in the aftermath of a catastrophic event
this amendment makes in order another amendment to take one more step toward satisfying the concerns of the minority and the senate by extending the time limits by which states can hold elections
it is a short extension but useful in that it allows states to phase their election plans over 7 even weeks
i am mr speaker in its present form
i do this and offer the amendment so that we can avoid the misallocation of voting machines and poll workers that occurred last year in the ohio presidential election that led to lines of sometimes 10 hours and disenfranchisement of tens of thousands of voters
consider the following in franklin county in that state 27 of the 30 wards with the most machines per registered voter showed majorities for bush while six of the seven wards with the fewest machines delivered the large margins for kerry
they also found that election officials in franklin county decided to make due with 2 868 machines even though their analysis showed that 5 000 machines were needed
in columbus alone it is estimated that the misallocation of machines reduced the number of votes by up to 15 000 votes
in the columbus area the result was that suburban precincts that supported mr bush tended to have more machines per registered voter than those in the innercity precincts that supported mr kerry
this should never happen again in an election in our nation
it is unconscionable to stack the deck so that americans are forced to wait in the rain in line while others are given the red carpet treatment
this small yet valuable unit is irreplaceable in protecting the capitol grounds against potential threats
in the past the park police s horse mounted unit has been unavailable when requested by the capitol police
additionally with the capitol police s mounted unit dismantled in the event the park police were able to respond all of that manure that they were talking about there would be no one to clean it no mechanism in place
i and chief gainer believe that the mounted unit is an inexpensive and effective resource in guarding the capitol against potential threats as well as an important part of improving community relations
in these dangerous times with constant and changing threats against the united states capitol complex the capitol police deserve all of the tools that they deem necessary at their disposal
it has assisted with three arrests worked 33 demonstrations issued more than 200 notices of infraction responded to assists in 9 reports of suspicious packages responded to 16 calls for crowd control assistance and responded to 28 calls for assistance in traffic accident incidents
this program has only been in existence and operational since may of 2004
and he says that they have to be under stress whenever they are in traffic
i will remind members in the gao study they do not recommend eliminating the mounted horse patrol
he joined the gentleman from wisconsin mr sensenbrenner xz4003650 and me along with former secretary of state candice miller and our distinguished colleagues the gentleman from ohio mr chabot xz4000710 the gentleman from texas mr paul xz4003110 and the gentleman from maryland mr bartlett xz4000170 in cosponsoring this legislation
in the last congress while it has not happened in this congress i was very pleased that the distinguished ranking minority member of the committee on the judiciary the gentleman from michigan mr conyers xz4000800 joined as a cosponsor of this legislation as well as my good friend and colleague the gentleman from california mr berman xz4000250
and it is my hope that we will be able to move ahead in a bipartisan way dealing with this very very important institutional issue
and i will say that when i left the building on september 11 2001 i did so when one of the great capitol hill policemen said to me that there was a plane headed towards this building and we all know now that that is the plane that went down with those very courageous passengers in pennsylvania
when we think back on september 11th obviously it was one of the darkest days in the history of our republic and it has led us to spend a great deal of time thinking about the unthinkable
but since that time the speaker of the house has really stepped up to the plate and done a wide range of things that are designed to ensure that the people s house and in fact we hope both houses of congress are able to continue to function
the reason that members stood on the east front of the capitol was to let the american people and to let anyone know who would want to do us in that we as a nation are strong and this institution the greatest deliberative body known to man was continuing to function
he established the ability to effect a joint leadership recall from a period of adjournment through designees and the requirement that the speaker submit to the clerk of the house a list of designees to act in the case of a vacancy in the office of the speaker
and mr speaker we all know that at the beginning of this 109th congress we included in our opening day rules package the provisions that allow the house to establish a quorum which could be lowered if we go through a litany of roll call votes that would determine that many members had been incapacitated and could not actually show up to work here
i think it is important to note that we provided a number of protections in the use of that rule including several that have been suggested by the members of the other side of the aisle
some of those recommendations that came from members of the minority on this issue extended roll calls lasting days at a time and excluding any time in recess so that members can contact the house and let us know that they can come to vote
and mr speaker at the recommendation of the minority consultation with the minority leader in accordance with the traditional relationship between the speaker and the minority leader
now the continuity in representation act of 2005 which we are considering here today deals with how we will replenish the house if terrorists kill large numbers of our members
the gentleman from florida mr hastings xz4001701 has just alluded to something and while i know we do not enjoy the strong support of the minority on this we have made a step in that we are going to have a manager s amendment made in order that would allow us to move in the direction of what it is that the minority wants and that is allowing for 49 days which would be a full 7 weeks
protecting overseas military and absentee voters so that they receive additional time in which to return ballots
and i want to thank particularly the distinguished ranking minority member of the committee on armed services the gentleman from missouri mr skelton xz4003770 for his fine work in that area and his commitment to ensure that we address the issue of military and overseas voters
you will recall when we considered this legislation which at the end of the day drew large bipartisan support in the 108th congress we were able to address the concerns that were raised by the gentleman from north carolina mr watt xz4004240 at the end of the day when we were debating the legislation and that is included in this
i believe that we need to continue working in a strong bipartisan manner to move this bill through the house and get it to the other body just as expeditiously as possible
in that spirit i anticipate that we will amend the rule as i said to move under this manager s amendment from 45 to 49 days
i also have to say that on this rule itself we are very happy to have made in order the amendment of my colleague and neighbor the very distinguished gentlewoman from california ms millendermcdonald xz4002750 who has offered an amendment calling for 60 days
and i remember that date because we convened the congress in philadelphia to mark the bicentennial of the connecticut compromise back on july 16 of 1987
of course the federalists have been so important in explaining and justifying the actions of the framers as they put the constitution together
madison wrote extensively about this institution the house of representatives in federalists 52 through 57
in the other body the united states senate people are appointed by their governors if vacancies take place
but no one has ever served in the people s house this body without having first been elected
and i think it is important to note that madison made it clear when he was talking especially about this institution as he said in federalist no
in federalist 52 madison wrote it is essential to liberty that the government in general should have a common interest with the people so it is particularly essential that the branch of it under consideration should have an immediate dependence on and an intimate sympathy with the people
frequent elections are unquestionably the only policy by which this dependence and sympathy can be effectively secured he went on in federalist 57 and wrote who are to be the electors of the federal representatives
a gradual abridgement of this right has been the mode in which aristocracies have been built on the ruin of popular forms i think it is very important for us to understand that there have been times in our nation s history where we have faced greater difficulty than the difficulty that we face today or even greater difficulty than we faced following september 11 of 2001 and that was the civil war
and of course we have the newest example of selfdetermination in the world
we saw terrorist attacks and we continue to see that in iraq
mr speaker i am convinced that as we look at the struggles taking place in iraq today that building and reinforcing democratic institutions is crucial for the safety security and happiness of a nation s people whether it is the people of iraq or the people of the united states of america
we should not have standins or successors from a list in our back pockets passing laws declaring war or suspending habeas corpus
thus as we look at the very tough challenge of how to preserve our democracy in the face of catastrophe this legislation is the most responsible way to continue the legitimacy of our government
if we look at the tragic loss of more than 100 members the idea of having the states hold special elections in that period of time is something that is doable
people will unite and will remove all obstacles in conducting elections
in the time of a horrible tragedy feeding and clothing one s family making sure the roof is over their head and then playing a role in picking one s leaders that is all part of the process of rebuilding
and it can be done in a relatively short period of time
a year and a half ago in our home state we went through a special election recently going through an unprecedented situation
we had the recall of a governor and an election that took place in 55 days
we debated this issue in the 108th congress
we have had three markups on this issue two in the committee on house administration one in the committee on the judiciary and we had 122 democrats who joined with us in support of a responsible piece of legislation which in fact encourages the madisonian vision of an elected people s house
now i think that if we look at the debate that we have had if we look at the fact that we have continued since september 11 of 2001 to focus on a wide range of matters that impact this institution and the challenge that we never faced in our history i believe that having this very important legislation that was passed by a margin of 329 in this congress 329 to 68 that including it now in the legislative appropriations bill is the most appropriate way to deal with it
we chose in the committee on rules to allow the gentleman from washington mr baird xz4000110 to have an opportunity to strike this measure and in just a few minutes we are going to once again have a vote on whether or not we allow the process of elections to go ahead
now it is very true it is very true that it would be difficult it would be messy it would be ugly but walter dellinger the former solicitor general a great constitutional scholar from duke university made it very clear in his testimony before the committee on rules when we talked about this issue that he would prefer to see a house of representatives that is comprised of fewer members that are actually elected by the people than would be appointed
mr chairman i seek the time in opposition
and it is very true that that is the case for what has happened in modern times
in fact the battle of antietam saw southern troops get within miles of this capitol
now i do not believe that appointed members should be making the decision in the people s house
but in the people s house no one has ever served here in our more than 200year history without having first been elected
and this notion of creating a scenario whereby people could serve in the people s house without having first been elected is anathema to the entire basis on which the united states of america was founded
sixtythree members of 435 voted in favor of our proceeding with a constitutional amendment
mr chairman i support this amendment to strike legislation which has nothing to do with the appropriations process legislation which has been improperly placed in this bill the text of hr 841 the continuity in representation act of 2005 that bill has already passed the house twice in slightly different forms in the spring of 2004 and most recently on march 3 2005
the senate refused to consider it the first time and it is currently pending on the legislative calendar in the senate where it will remain unless objections by various senators are dealt with
instead the house appropriations committee has to its obvious discomfort effectively been hijacked by the house majority leadership to load the bill onto legislative branch appropriations in the belief that the senate will meekly submit to anything tucked into the house title
if the bill s supporters ever hope to get it passed in some form they need to make a serious effort to address the objections rather than to employ parliamentary games
i believe it is in fact counterproductive
attempting an end run around the regular order on what is despite their spin a very controversial bill does nothing to enhance credibility in potential negotiations with the senate
we did an informal survey in our office of the lt em gt lt em gt congressional record
but we have to seriously consider the issue of the continuity in congress
and yes even though we have provided for rules if members are incapacitated we have a constitutional responsibility to ensure the american people have full representation in this congress
and in keeping with the great traditions of our country we need to keep it that way
we heard a desire to make sure that this bill specifically allows for primaries that language is incorporated in this bill
in closing we face a significant threat
in the event of the unthinkable this bill strikes a blow to the heart of the terrorists and allows this body to reconstitute itself as quickly as possible therefore carrying on the spirit of mason and of this great nation
mr speaker i rise today in opposition to this closed rule which limits debate on how this body should operate if it experiences mass causality
this is an issue of grave importance to the american people and the integrity of that democracy in times of dire crisis
in turn congress has rightfully committed itself to creating policy that protects americans from future attacks though i question how successful we have been in our actions
september 11 also presented us with a challenge to consider continuity in the house during a worstcase scenario
in examining such a grim situation we must foresee what will be needed to regain stability and reassure the american people and the world that our government is going about business as usual
the underlying legislation requires the states to hold special elections within 45 days in the case of extraordinary circumstances
should this time period be adopted it would undoubtedly result in the disenfranchisement of millions including seniors who vote absentee our diplomatic corps and our men and women serving in our armed forces
what can you realistically do in 4 more days
all of this is happening at the same time my friends in the majority have blocked democratic members from offering three different amendments to the bill all of which were germane and all of which were turned in on time
it seems to me that we operate under two rules in the house of representatives one for them and one for us
these temporary appointments would serve until states are able to elect representatives in accordance to their own laws
yet when our colleague the gentleman from washington mr baird xz4000110 offered this proposal in the 108th congress as a footnote the gentleman from washington s mr baird xz4000110 wife is about to deliver their child and he might not get here
but he certainly has been a stalwart leader in the effort to do what is necessary to preserve the integrity of this body
they set up a vote in the way that it was impossible for the proposal to be given its due consideration
in my view it was cutthroat politics and we should not allow for those kind of actions
it does not address how the house quorum rules will work in the case of mass house vacancies
think about it this way in the first 6 weeks following september 11 the house this house authorized the president to use force against terrorists and appropriated 40 billion to address the emergencies in new york and at the pentagon
if the underlying legislation is dropped the legitimacy of actions taken by a shorthanded congress most likely during a time of war would always be in question
anyone who suggests that the constitutional amendment process takes years in my view is incorrect
i suspect that they will respond similarly in this case
all of these concerns underscore the need for this body to consider this legislation in an open and much larger discussion on the continuity of our government during times of mass causality
the effects of our hastiness today may not be felt while any of us are alive but at some point in the future our successors and our states will be trapped by poor decisions we might make today
what they said in the very preamble of their document is the following we held two public meetings where we heard testimony from experts and in the course of our investigation we explored a wide range of options short of a constitutional amendment to ameliorate or solve these problems
unfortunately because the constitution dictates the way that vacancies are to be filled in the house and senate there is no way to establish a procedure to quickly fill mass vacancies without a constitutional amendment
no greater or eminent scholar that laid the foundation perhaps other than jefferson dealt with all of the issues that they contemplated in their time
we had a vote on whether or not there should be an open rule in this important process for america and we had an amendment offered by a distinguished member of this body the gentleman from minnesota mr sabo xz4003540 requiring states to offer sameday voter registration for special elections held in accordance with this bill
seems reasonable that people would be scattered and other things on their minds in a crisis such as we had experienced on 911
my colleague from new york mr nadler xz4002890 who lost more people than all of us combined in the 911 tragedy offered a measure to prohibit deceiving any person as to the time place or eligibility requirements of special elections held in accordance with this bill
and the gentleman from michigan mr conyers xz4000800 the ranking member of the committee on the judiciary offered an amendment that would require states to equally and fairly distribute election personnel and equipment when it conducts the special elections contemplated in this bill
when we open up this institution we will be able to address matters in a more meaningful way so that the minority can have their amendments contemplated in good kind
i end by saying that thomas mann of the brookings institution who was one of the lead authors of the continuity commission s report stated in front of the committee on house administration the following the inability to swiftly constitute the house and senate would deprive the country of a fully functioning first branch of government at a time of grave national crisis
unable to achieve a quorum or relying on a questionable quorum interpretation allowing a small minority possibly a handful of surviving members to act for the full chamber congress would be unable to legitimately elect a new speaker or confirm a new vice president both critical links in presidential succession
mr madison offered the 17th amendment to the united states constitution that has held well through the years with reference to continuity and we owe no less responsibility to those founders to be mindful of our responsibilities in that regard by offering up to the american people an appropriate constitutional amendment to be debated and decided by the people of this great country
i rise today to offer an amendment to cut 1 percent of the level of funding in this appropriation bill
they have done some very good things in here particularly in that hole of waste we have in the east front of our capitol which goes on and on and on
they have done a great job in trying to rein that in
i simply think that with all of these appropriation bills with most of them we can find 1 percent to cut and that will move us in a tiny way towards a balanced budget
mr chairman i want to inquire of the distinguished gentleman from wisconsin chairman sensenbrenner i have an amendment in the nature of a substitute
in the spirit of collegiality i realize that we have a rule but i gained a sense that the committee on house administration would be supportive of this substitute which would only allow an added 5 days for an appeal from 2 days less than a week
i am disappointed we are not even in time of death and tragedy terrorism that we can not find in our hearts and in our intellectual minds the ability to be collegial and to work in an very informed and thoughtful way
this is a question to answer the needs of the secretaries of state and the states that when this crisis occurs that all of them have the procedures in place to be able to fulfill our democratic calling
in addition this provides for an expansion of the right to sue for declaratory judgment beyond the governor but to citizens and classes of citizens
mr chairman the gravity of the matter of reconstituting the house of representatives in the face of catastrophe requires the fullest debate possible
however due to the fact that a structured rule was reported out of committee this body is relegated to saving this severely flawed legislation by way of the only two amendments made in order last tuesday those of my colleague the distinguished ranking member of the house administration committee and the jacksonlee amendment
the jacksonlee amendment has three essential components which propose to preserve the rights of the states the voters and of the spirit of democracy the first portion of this amendment jacksonlee 1 reads as follows in section 26 b 4 b i of the revised statutes of the united states as proposed to be added by the bill strike 2 days and insert 5 days this change would amend the section of the bill that deals with the time in which a person s may file a lawsuit arising out of the speaker of the house s announcement of vacancies in the house of representatives in excess of 100
because not every state has a capital beltway or even a superhighway system and because information travels at a different rate in every location it is important that we establish a fair standard for a filing rule that affects every state in the country
its text reads as follows in section 26 b 4 b iii of the revised statues of the united states as proposed to be added by the bill insert after the action the following taking into account an opportunity for an expedited appeal of the initial decision
given that the time in which a federal judge has to compose an order disposing of these matters is provided in this bill an equally expeditious appeals process should be provided so as to maintain consistency with the us constitution and the commitment to both the 5th and 14th amendments
thirdly the amendment reads as follows in section 26 b 4 b iv of the revised statutes of the united states as proposed to be added by the bill insert after vacant the following any citizen of the district or any group of citizens of the state
this proposal is very important to protect the interests of all citizens in the various congressional districts in the midst of party politics as well as the certification of classes in legal actions
as the bill is drafted section 2 paragraph 4 subparagraph iv would confer the right to sue in the event of a vacancy announcement by the speaker of the house solely to the executive authority in the case of texas the governor
such overly restrictive language almost certainly threatens to deprive the citizens of a right that they should enjoy in the event that the governor chooses not to participate in a suit for declaratory or injunctive relief pursuant to a vacancy announcement made by the speaker of the house
in order to protect the rights of every person who truly has an interest in a call for a special election under this act this provision must be amended to allow citizens and classes of citizens to sue for relief
a mere extending from 2 days to 5 days to make sure that americans even in crisis have due process and democracy and justice is not too much to ask
i would indulge and beg my colleagues to realize all this does is simply allow for the people of america in crisis to be represented and to be responded to
mr chairman i rise in strong support of the jacksonlee amendment
again the idea of this amendment in the judicial review aspect one there is no definitive information about how the information will be disseminated to our states and to citizens in a 2day period if crisis is occurring if a terrorist act has occurred
in addition the other aspects of the legislation provides for an expedited time frame
it does not in any way cause a sufficient delay that would not allow us to restore this body to its ability to do business on behalf of the american people
mr chairman i rise today in support of hr 2985 the legislative branch appropriations for fiscal year 2006
these bush administration tax cuts have created gaps in so many programs and these legislative branch appropriations are no different
it is unfortunate that these appropriations are so tight when the cost of operating the house of representatives is in fact getting higher
with these unfortunate budget cuts in place it will be our constituents who suffer
regardless of these cuts congress will continue to function properly and we will serve our constituents proudly but these cuts in our funding undermine our efforts
in addition to insufficient funding to the house of representatives the greatest deficiencies can be found in the legislative branch agencies that directly or indirectly support congressional operations
funding for the capitol police who are entrusted with protecting the capitol complex and all those who work and visit here actually received 2 million 1 less than in fy 2005 and 504 million 17 less than requested in this appropriation
the architect of the capitol who have worked so hard in the last year to make the capitol complex more accessible to visitors received only 3173 million 167 million 6 more than current funding but a full 1236 million 28 less than requested
indeed even the library of congress the resource for members and staff to conduct research and the institution meant to be our nation s greatest repository of reading materials even their funding was cut in this appropriation
however the issue that has me most concerned about this appropriation is the language of hr 841 which would require states to hold special elections within 49 days of the speaker declaring that more than 100 vacancies exist in the house
first of all this language has no business being in this appropriations measure it clearly legislates on what is supposed to be a spending bill
truly the other side of the aisle is trying to sneak in a piece of legislation within this appropriation in order to force its passage upon the senate
the more expedited the process of replacing despite my objections with certain provisions of this legislation i will vote in favor of this appropriation because it serves the needs of our congress
however i hope that soon our economic and budgeting practices would change so that we are not forced to make so many cuts in vital areas
i also hope that in the future we do not use these appropriations bills as a way to further our legislative agendas
mr chairman i rise today in strong support of my colleague mr baird s amendment to hr 2985 the legislative branch appropriations for fiscal year 2006
the baird amendment would strike the language of hr 841 which would require states to hold special elections within 49 days of the speaker declaring that more than 100 vacancies exist in the house
first of all this language has no business being in this appropriations measure it clearly legislates on what is supposed to be a spending bill
truly the other side of the aisle is trying to sneak in a piece of legislation within this appropriation in order to force its passage upon the senate
in the event of a catastrophic disaster elections should be held on an expedited time schedule
the pillars of what makes american democracy unique however should not be toppled in the pursuit to do so
all debate of the candidates platforms or characters would be nearly muted and in effect americans would vote in the blind significant disenfranchisement will likely occur in the unrealistic time frame that the language of hr 841 offers in this appropriations measure
there would be no way to mail out and receive absentee ballots in time
overseas americans including those in the military would not have a realistic chance to vote
there is something unseemly about denying our men and women of the military the right to vote in the most consequential elections imaginable when we would be replacing perhaps the entire house
it would be difficult to even print the ballots in the time allotted under this act
there are the language of hr 841 in this bill proposes to make the issue of state elections a federal question however just because this issue would become federalized does not mean that we should frustrate the essential elements of democracythe processes of establishing the eligibility of state candidates voter registration voter freedom of choice and equal access to voting under the civil rights act must be preserved even in the face of a catastrophe
clearly this language does not belong in this appropriations bill nor does it serve the best interest of the american people
the hefley amendment is inappropriate at this time when funding needs have already been neglected in this appropriation
it is unfortunate that these appropriations are so tight when the cost of operating the house of representatives is in fact getting higher
regardless of any possible cuts congress will continue to function properly and we will serve our constituents proudly but these cuts in our funding undermine our efforts
in addition to insufficient funding to the house of representatives the greatest reason to reject the hefley amendment can be found in the legislative branch agencies that directly or indirectly support congressional operations
funding for the capitol police who are entrusted with protecting the capitol complex and all those who work and visit here actually received 2 million 1 percent less than in fy 2005 and 504 million 17 percent less than requested in this appropriation
the architect of the capitol who have worked so hard in the last year to make the capitol complex more accessible to visitors received only 3173 million 167 million 6 percent more than current funding but a full 1236 million 28 percent less than requested
this is a historymaking event in the house of representatives
that is in large part due to the cooperation that the chairman received from the ranking member the gentleman from wisconsin mr obey xz4003000 but in large part also from the leadership exhibited by the chairman of the full committee
the clerks the people taking down our words here the lt em gt lt em gt congressional record that will be printed overnight the parliamentarians who do such good work in directing the proceedings of the house all of the capitol hill police who stand guard 247 and protect the capitol the attending physician s office who keep us all healthy the people who work in the cloakrooms the people who help us write bills the people at crs who help us make sure that we get the words correct and get them done correctly in the bills that we prepare and take a lot of credit for
we could not do it without this bill without the funding in this bill and we could not do it without the people who provide all of the services and are very dedicated many of whom work late hours to keep this place going
and after 911 we do not want people standing outside we do not want people standing in inclement weather and there will be an opportunity for people to get a little bit of history before they enter the capitol
it is under way in the rayburn garage
with respect to the provision that was put in the bill having to do with respect to what do we do around here if another disaster happens if the members are injured or killed in some kind of an attack there has to be something that guides the direction of the house in the event that something happens
the speaker decided in order to get this moving and in order to get the senate to go along with something it had to be included in a bill and it was put in this bill
it was put in really to get something done to make something happen to have some provision in the event that something happens
that is the way we get members to congregate in this house
my point is the idea that this was included and is some sort of nonessential thing it is essential that we have a provision in the law that allows us to account for a situation in the event that members need to be replaced
that is really the reason it was put in
we have included other provisions in bills before to try and get some compromise with the senate
we need to have this provision in the law
mr chairman i will address it in this way i was here on 911 as the gentleman was
it reportedly came into existence as the brainchild of a senator from colorado now retired without any formal examination of the merits and demerits of using horses in the capitol police environment
unlike the us park police which must patrol thousands of acres of wooded parkland in northwest washington the capitol police patrols a confined area readily accessible to nonmounted officers and much of which is not even accessible to the public at all
some argue that the mounted unit is especially useful in crowd control and maybe that is so
however on those occasions where crowds needing control may develop on the capitol grounds and these occasions are usually well anticipated the capitol police can easily ask for assistance from their park police colleagues who are well trained in the use of horses and can also be trained about the capitol and working here
maybe there is value in that when elsewhere on and around the grounds other capitol police officers are routinely brandishing automatic weapons
i rise today in opposition to this legislation and am disappointed we are taking up this measure again when we should be debating this issue in a more thoughtful and comprehensive manner
well mr chairman i am sure that the authors of this legislation had all the good intentions in the world but unfortunately we find in the real world in practice it does not always work out as we had intended
the mail ballot process itself can be very cumbersome and i can guarantee you that very potentially the elderly people with disabilities and most especially our men and women in uniform who are overseas would potentially be disenfranchised by this shortened time frame
i want to remind everyone that in the 6 weeks after the attacks of september 11 congress passed legislation authorizing the use of military force an airline assistance measure an economic stimulus bill the defense authorization act numerous appropriation bills the farm bill legislation pertaining to bioterrorism victims assistance and terrorism financing
worse in the case of widespread incapacitation the house would be unable to achieve a quorum and become inoperative during a time of crisis
a recent change in house rules tried to circumvent this problem by creating a provisional quorum which would permit a smaller number of members to constitute a quorum in emergency circumstances
but i am disappointed that hr 841 does not take a comprehensive approach to continuity nor does it address a priority of mine deciding how congress could communicate and function if terrorist acts prevented it from meeting in one location
i want to thank all the committee members for their contributions in putting this bill together
while small in size this is the bill that funds the work of the congress and it is a bill that we all can be very proud of
there will be no reductions in the current workforce
as part of an amendment in the full committee i offered and the committee adopted the continuity in representation act at the speaker s request
this bill has passed the house twice and just recently the vote in march was 329 to 68
we are all in this together mr chairman and because of that i feel very strongly that this legislation should have the support of the entire house
as we have discussed the smoking policy in the house office buildings is under the jurisdiction of the house office building commission
i would be very happy to join with the gentleman in that discussion
i think i probably will discuss it with my wife as well but in the meantime you and i work together on the committee and i am happy to work with you on almost any issue you might raise
mr chairman let me tell the gentleman that i am very appreciative of his interest in the institution s history
included in the cvc is a 16 000 squarefoot exhibit hall
in this exhibit hall the architectural and legislative history of the institution are highlighted
as part of the currently proposed cvc exhibits are detailed sections on the history of the capitol and included in this is the fact that when the capitol was originally built it was used for more than legislative meetings
all these facts are included in the cvc exhibits and i would encourage that the education of citizens be pursued in this venue so that a more complete history beyond a plaque can be presented
there have been and i very much appreciate the gentleman s interest in this matter
he and i will be pursuing it as we go forward in the months and indeed the years ahead
i must say the speaker has been most concerned and he asked me to put this in this bill because a constitutional amendment takes so long to accomplish
in the meantime he has a proposal that will go forward and will be altered significantly as we go forward in order to expedite the process
mr chairman i rise to yield time to the gentleman from california mr dreier xz4001150 but before doing so i just want to mention that the previous speaker had a constitutional amendment regarding the issue of continuity in the last congress and on that constitutional amendment the vote was 63 yeas and 353 nays
mr chairman it was not my intention to speak in these closing moments
mr chairman reclaiming my time i think it is important for the public to know that all of us are concerned about continuity of government in the event of a tragedy
but indeed there are differences in the approach that one might take
we have had the debate and very few in this house have supported that proposition
my colleague the gentleman from wisconsin mr obey xz4003000 and i early on in this congress were not active supporters of a cvc
but indeed his leadership and my leadership at a higher pay grade made a different decision so we are carrying forward their work in this process
it is rather a fabulous addition to the capitol the greatest addition that has been made in this century i believe
i am critical of the architect but in the meantime i am not one
therefore we are going to add this major change whereby visitors can enter the capitol and it will have a very significant piece of our future history in the capitol complex
i am very happy to participate in this with my friend the gentleman from wisconsin mr obey xz4003000
mr chairman i rise to claim the time in opposition to the amendment and i ask unanimous consent that the gentleman from wisconsin mr obey xz4003000 control 2 12 minutes of that time
as a matter of fact at one time in my life i thought i might be a veterinarian because i loved horses and ducks so much
in the meantime i watch them parade around the capitol and i have wondered from time to time about their relative value
so frankly i think we ought to proceed with the language that is in the bill
mr chairman i rise to claim the time in opposition to the amendment
the record is distributed in accordance with title 44 chapter 9 of the us code and within that there are 3 000 copies that go to members of the house and senate 153 copies to the library of congress et cetera
i can provide the balance of this in the record
and if i am correct in that i would be inclined for us to stand back in this discussion if the gentleman agrees with me and perhaps discuss this further as we go to conference
mr chairman i rise to claim the time in opposition to the amendment and i ask unanimous consent that the gentleman from wisconsin mr obey xz4003000 control 2 12 minutes of that time
in addition we have provided 84 million for the architect for perimeter security
in addition to the 2 345 000 provided in this bill for general expenses the capitol police have 32 653 000 in unobligated balances for a total of almost 62 million
this 2 million amendment is interesting but the police in this instance do not need an additional 2 million and because of that i strongly oppose the amendment
it provides for costofliving increases some inflationary items and a minimal number of projects to keep our buildings and grounds in reasonably good order
mr speaker by way of suggesting that the leadership on both sides of the aisle made the decision about building our visitors center and that process has gone forward and many a fit and start but nonetheless it is going to be the largest expansion of the capitol in modern time
the gentleman from wisconsin mr obey xz4003000 and i have been on the other side of that issue in the past but nonetheless like the visitors center the speaker has suggested we include the continuity of government item in this package
that too is at a pay grade that is above mine and i feel very strongly we should have some mechanism to make certain that in times of a real tragedy the house can get its work done
but in the end we do need to have special elections in the case of a catastrophe
the problem is it misses the point of what happens in the 45 days or if the gentlewoman from california ms millendermcdonald xz4002750 passes in the 75 days
because that appears to be the case and absent a constitutional amendment to allow for a temporary appointment we will have martial law and the elimination of a republic in this country
mr chairman the legislation that we are going to be considering today deals with a very very serious issue the possibility actually of a tragic attack that would result in the death of a significant number of our colleagues in the house
in fact only the heroic actions the unbelievable bravery of those brave passengers on flight 93 prevented that particular plane that particular flight from reaching its intended target
hr 841 the continuity in representation act provides a very reasonable very well thoughtout mechanism for the reconstitution of the house of representatives in the event of such a tragedy
the sponsor of the bill the gentleman from wisconsin mr sensenbrenner xz4003650 as well as the gentleman from california mr dreier xz4001150 and the gentleman from ohio mr ney xz4002930 are to be commended for their great commitment and dedication in crafting this bill and bringing it to the floor today
mr chairman all the other branches of government already have contingency plans in place
in the case of a vacancy the president would be replaced quickly by the existing line of succession
the senate would be reconstituted very quickly through gubernatorial appointment as is outlined in the 17th amendment
only the house would be unable to function quickly in a time of national emergency
the continuity in representation act would correct this problem by requiring states to hold special elections to fill vacancies in the house of representatives not later than 49 days after the vacancy is announced by the speaker of this house in the extraordinary circumstances that vacancies in representation from the states exceed 100
article 1 section 2 of our constitution states when vacancies happen in the representation from any state the executive authority thereof shall issue writs of elections to fill such vacancies the key word here is elections no event should be reason enough to change this historic and constitutional constant
there have been a number of suggested alternatives to the proposal in this legislation
some have called for perhaps temporary appointment of the members of congress in such an emergency either through gubernatorial appointment like that in the senate or even by a sitting member naming a successor to take the seat in the event of that member s death
concerns have also been expressed regarding the requirement that special elections be completed within 49 days of the speaker s announcement of 100 existing vacancies in the house would be difficult
mr chairman before i came to congress actually i was honored to serve as michigan s secretary of state for 8 years with a principal responsibility of serving as that state s chief election official so this is an area that i do have some expertise in
in turn this would eliminate the petition requirements and the verification process that accompanies it
hava is granting federal dollars to the states in historic proportions quite frankly dollars that they are using to eliminate antiquated election equipment and purchasing new stateoftheart equipment
states have either constructed or are moving very quickly toward construction of statewide computerized voter registration files similar to the one that we built in michigan several years ago
also states are now moving toward uniformity of voting systems in their precincts
uniformity of election equipment in a state will enable vendors to always have a camera ready template of the ballot and then all they literally have to do is fill in the names of the nominees for us representative and go to print
hr 841 also protects the ability of military personnel and overseas citizens to participate in a special election by requiring that absentee ballots be transmitted to such voters within 15 days of the speaker s announcement and that such absentee ballots be counted if they are received not later than 45 days after the state transmits them
in fact even now the department of defense the dod is moving towards a program where service men and women stationed overseas can actually download their ballots via the internet
to that argument i would simply point out that some states today already have requirements that special elections be held in much less time than the 49day period
i have no doubts that they would do so in a time of national emergency
i believe passing hr 841 is a step in showing the enemies of freedom that america is remaining ever vigilant
similar legislation received over 300 votes in the last congress and i would again ask my colleagues for their strong bipartisan support of this legislation
first let me congratulate the gentlewoman from michigan in joining our committee the committee on house administration
mr chairman i rise in opposition to hr 841 in its current form
while the bill number has changed since last year the core problems in this legislation remain the same as in last year s bill hr 2844
it restricts the franchise and inhibits public participation in the expedited special elections it would create an especially unfortunate development following so closely after the serious problems revealed in the aftermath of the 2004 elections
this bill is part of a series of actions by the majority over the last 2 years as advertised in addressing problems of congressional continuity
the stated objective of the legislation is to override state laws in order to hold expedited special elections within 45 days of a catastrophe which may leave more than 100 vacancies in the chamber
it is simply inadequate to the task of reconstituting the house in a truly democratic fashion
members on our side of the aisle were split almost down the middle last april in the vote on this legislation because they felt pressured to do something
hr 841 contains a wish list of provisions which would set impractical deadlines ignore the rights of candidates to run and of voters to participate in elections and create confusion in the aftermath of a national catastrophe when the country needs the stability of established constitutional processes and the legitimacy of the rule of law
among the principal flaws of this legislation are the time frame is much too short for the conducting of special elections in many states
even states whose present laws contemplate 45 days may not cope in the aftermath of an unknown future crisis which could affect our infrastructure and communications systems nationwide
the house last year rejected a proposal for 75 days in which to conduct these elections
while states could conduct special elections to fill vacancies even without this bill it eliminates their flexibility in the scheduling of elections in the format of the elections and in the costs of elections
there is insufficient time for voter registration for those wishing to participate in an unscheduled sudden election for the house
the bill provides no mechanism for candidates to qualify for the ballot in states which require petition gathering or other potentially timeconsuming measures intended to assess the public support and credibility of potential candidates
this bill assumes that there are instant candidates out there who upon learning of a vacancy will decide to run without full consultation with family and friends or with their potential parties and relevant interest groups and who can instantly arrange financing and instantly have an infrastructure in place to negotiate the campaign finance laws
these steps are extraordinarily difficult even in normal circumstances
more importantly are they the people we want to give a head start in gaining seats in the house
this bill also allows insufficient time to conduct primary elections in the many states which allow them for special elections
nevertheless the 45day scheme would still effectively block them in many states
this bill still allows insufficient time to send receive and count absentee ballots even in those states which will not use primaries
mr chairman this bill contains no mechanism to activate its own provisions in the event the entire house membership is wiped out
hr 841 deals with a practical catastrophe and a partial one but becomes useless in the event of a total catastrophe
it was suggested on the house floor last year that in the circumstances that the entire house was wiped out it would be up to the people to come together and make the determination as to the rebuilding process and how it begins
should we not be settling this issue right now right here in the legislation before us
the 45day provision in the bill allows insufficient time to assemble the infrastructure of elections necessary to manage elections competently and fairly
even in elections under the best of circumstances there are inevitably problems with voter registration lists voting with provisional ballots transmitting receiving and counting absentee ballots reserving polling places and staffing the polls with voting machines and election workers
after a catastrophe we can add a potential breakdown in communication systems and other infrastructure including transportation along with the potential inability to order voting machines and ballots
fortyfive days is simply not enough time in many states to conduct special elections especially after a national catastrophe
mr chairman this bill represents the wrong choices of values in a democracy
mr chairman the continuity in representation act provides a process to ensure that our democratic government remains stable and orderly during a possible time of great instability
in addition it preserves the unique status of the house of representatives by continuing the tradition and the constitutional mandate that every member of this body must be elected by his or her constituents
in such a time of crisis the people of this nation must have a voice in the critical decisions that are being made
in fact a survey of election officials confirmed that this is a realistic time frame and i will tell you as a former elections official myself i concur with those findings
furthermore several states already have laws in place that require special elections to be conducted in a shorter period of time than the 49day limit that this legislation requires
when this issue was before the 108th congress mr chairman the house acted in an overwhelmingly bipartisan fashion and approved the continuity in representation act by a more than threetoone margin
in fact hr 841 that we consider today has improved on the previous bill by addressing the following reservations that some members of the house and some of the states had regarding that bill
certainly as an advocate of states rights this provision was extremely important to both myself and many of us here in this chamber
with these changes i am hopeful that the bipartisan support for this legislation will be even greater today than it has been in the past
it is about our ability to secure the homeland and it does that by ensuring that our democratically elected government is able to respond in the face of an urgent threat
this is an issue that affects every single american mr chairman and the congress should act in the interest of america and of democracy
i urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting hr 841 and i look forward very much to supporting and passing this important and historic legislation
mr chairman i rise in opposition to the amendment and i yield myself such time as i may consume
while this amendment would only increase the time limit in which to conduct the special election by 11 days more than the limit provided for in hr 841 it would weaken the power of congress in a significant way
following an attack in which over 100 members of congress have been killed it is quite likely that a military response would be required
the amendment by the gentlewoman would prevent congress from acting in this situation
a survey of election officials as i mentioned earlier shows that 49 days is a reasonable period of time in which to conduct a special election
in turn this would eliminate the petition requirements and the verification process that accompanies it
hava is granting federal dollars to the states in historic proportions dollars that are being used to eliminate antiquated election equipment and the states are purchasing new stateoftheart equipment
states have either constructed or are moving towards construction of statewide computerized voter registration files similar as i mentioned to the one we built in michigan several years ago
again a fantastic election tool for any election but particularly so in this case for an expedited election
uniformity of election equipment in a state will enable vendors to always have a cameraready template on the ballot and then all they have to do is just fill in the name of the nominees for us representative and go to print
finally mr chairman some states already prescribe that special elections be conducted in a period of time even shorter than this
the only thing that this amendment would effectively do is extend the time period for which some parts of the nation would not be represented in this body in the united states house of representatives
while it is true that state and local officials must have sufficient time to conduct elections it is imperative that they be completed as quickly as possible so that there is some semblance of continuity in representation
mr chairman i yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from wisconsin mr sensenbrenner xz4003650 the distinguished chairman of the committee on the judiciary who has been a driving force in bringing this legislation to the floor today
in this book we have the first report of the continuity of government commission in that it outlined an election in michigan michigan s third congressional district where the vacancy occurred in 1993 and the time that was allotted for that election was 178 days which brought us the distinguished gentleman from michigan mr ehlers xz4001190 who is part of our committee
mr chairman in returning to the testimony of mr doug lewis executive director of election center after polling election officials from around the country he summarized the results while the responses indicated a variety of dates ranging from the shortest time period of 35 days after determination of who the candidates will be to a period of 4 months it appears that election administrators feel that they can conduct an election with as few as 45 days
each additional day beyond the 45 day minimum time frame creates greater confidence in the process mr chairman i prefer to come down on the side of the interest of democracy and my instincts after campaigns for local state and federal office tell me 49 days is simply too short
mr speaker i rise in opposition to the motion to recommit
the language in the motion to recommit is very similar to the language in the help america vote act legislation hava as it is commonly called that legislation being hr 533
in fact the gentleman from michigan mr conyers xz4000800 is not the only member who has proposed comprehensive election reform
the committee on house administration has scheduled hearings on these issues including in the state of ohio i would say and we will be considering all of these bills in due course
let us leave these other issues for a later day when they can be debated in the proper context
i share those concerns as well having been the ranking member of the legislative branch subcommittee before it was incorporated in the full committee
we raised these the gentleman from georgia mr kingston xz4002210 and i it is not meant to be argumentative but we have created a situation where the capitol visitors center is going to create some substantial problems in the future
obviously we are way behind schedule but that happens in a lot of construction projects
now do you want to be the member who tells your constituents after traveling from any place in the united states and for many of them it takes a whole day to get here they stay here they are all excited and they get to the capitol visitors center and want to go to the capitol and you have to tell them well actually there is no room
half of the people coming into the capitol visitors center are probably going to have to be informed there is no room in the actual capitol for you to be able to make a visit today
one of them is in regard to smoking
we have a ban on smoking in all federal buildings but we exempt congressional office spaces
i do not want to change that necessarily i can understand why there is an exemption in place but we have a particular problem with the rayburn cafeteria
in the rayburn cafeteria the main dining room is overflowing with patrons generally every tuesday wednesday and thursday and so those patrons are forced to spill over into the designated smoking area
i think we need to address it because some of these people have real serious health problems in terms of their breathing capabilities some have asthma and other related problems
i yield to the chairman of the full committee to see if he has some suggestions in how we could alleviate this problem for the nonsmokers
would the chairman be willing to make sure that this gets raised to the appropriate people so we could address it in a constructive way
i think we will pursue it in that manner rather than trying to find some legislative solution
in may of 2004 we began with six horses
but the salaries and the benefits of the capitol police officers that are involved in this come to approximately 600 000
so in more than 10 years we have only had a 4 percent growth much less than inflation
if there are too many copies of the record being charged to the congress the problem lies in the other chamber
mr chairman congress has addressed this problem in recent years
mr chairman hr 841 the continuity in representation act of 2005 is an important piece of legislation that furthers the vital objective of ensuring that the people s house would continue to function effectively and with legitimacy in the event of a catastrophic terrorist attack in which a large number of house members would be killed
when operating under a tight time frame any additional time can make a difference in the quality of the process
thus i believe this amendment enables us to better strike the proper balance between the demand to fill house vacancies through special elections in as short a time frame as possible and the need for election officials and the voting public to have the necessary time to get ready for elections and to examine the candidates and the issues
i rise in support of this bill which complies with the budget resolution for fiscal year 2006
most of the funding in this bill goes to nonpolitical agencies and nonelected people who make it possible to do our work the people who provide vital data and analysis to inform our policy decisions who keep our buildings and grounds functioning and of special importance providing security for all of the legislative branch
hr 2985 provides 287 billion in new budget authority and 25 billion in new outlays for programs within the legislative branch
the funding level represents an increase of 42 million in ba and 241 million in outlays over last year a 17 percent increase from fy 2005 levels
consistent with a longstanding practice under which each chamber of congress determines its own housekeeping requirements and the other concurs without change appropriations for the senate are not included in the bill reported to the house
this measure in providing 2865 billion in budget authority for the operations of the legislative branch excluding senate functions is well below the overall suballocation of 3719 billion
the bill contains a small recession in ba for the library of congress for the copyright reengineering project and no advance appropriations or emergencydesignated spending
mr chairman i am pleased to support hr 841 the continuity in representation act introduced by my distinguished colleague house judiciary committee chairman james sensenbrenner
hr 841 provides a practical and constitutional way to ensure that the house of representatives can continue to operate in the event that more than 100 members are killed hr 841 thus protects the people s right to choose their representatives at the time when such a right may be most important while ensuring continuity of the legislative branch
article i section 2 of the united states constitution grants state governors the authority to hold special elections to fill vacancies in the house of representatives
alexander hamilton who played a major role in the drafting and ratification of the united states constitution characterized authority over federal elections as shared between the states and congress with neither being able to control the process entirety
i have no doubt that the people of the states are quite competent to hold elections in a timely fashion
after all it is in each state s interest to ensure it has adequate elected representation in washington
i am disappointed that some of my colleagues reject the sensible approach of hr 841 and instead support amending the constitution to allow appointed members to serve in this body
allowing appointed members to serve in the people s house will fundamentally alter the nature of this institution and sever the people s most direct connection with their government
james madison and alexander hamilton eloquently made this point in federalist 52 as it is essential to liberty that the government in general should have a common interest with the people so it is particularly essential that the branch of it under consideration should have an immediate dependence on and an intimate sympathy with the people
mr chairman there are those who say that the power of appointment is necessary in order to preserve checks and balances and thus prevent an abuse of executive power during a time of crisis
of course i agree that it is very important to carefully guard our constitutional liberties in times of crisis and that an overcentralization of power in the executive branch is one of the most serious dangers to that liberty
supporters of amending the constitution claim that the appointment power will be necessary in the event of an emergency and that the appointed representatives will only be temporary
mr chairman this country has faced the possibility of threats to the continuity of this body several times in our history
for example the british in the war of 1812 attacked the city of washington yet nobody suggested the states could not address the lack of a quorum in the house of representatives through elections
during the civil war the neighboring state of virginia where today many capitol hill staffers reside and many members stay while congress is in session was actively involved in hostilities against the united states government
yet abraham lincoln never suggested that nonelected persons serve in the house
adopting any of the proposals to deny the people the ability to choose their own representatives as noted above the framers gave congress all the tools it needs to address problems of mass vacancies in the house without compromising this institution s primary function as a representative body
in fact as hamilton explains in federalist 59 the time place and manner clause was specifically designed to address the kind of extraordinary circumstances imagined by those who support amending the constitution
in conclusion i urge my colleagues to support hr 841 the continuity in representation act which ensures an elected congress can continue to operate in the event of an emergency
natural gas prices in this country are an island to themselves
mr chairman i rise in opposition to hr 841 and i regret the partisan flavor that seems to have become part of this debate
i looked at it with an open heart and an open mind and find that i agree with the gentleman from washington mr baird xz4000110 that at a time when we need it the most this bill will leave us in limbo without leadership and it will make america vulnerable at a time when we need leadership the most
mr chairman the time frame in this bill of 45 days is both too long and too short
fortyfive days is too long to reconstruct the house of representatives in a time of crisis when decisions need to be made immediately so in that 45 days when we are the most vulnerable this legislation would leave america the most vulnerable
this is hollow a very hollow approach to democracy suggesting that this would permit people to be elected when in fact it will be the party bosses that will be deciding who the voters will have a chance to vote on
just as the vice president of the united states is elected as part of a ticket with the president alternate representatives would go on the ballot and be elected as a ticket with their representative so that in times of crisis there would be immediate representation for the united states congress and for the people throughout our country
it provides for both the continuity of congress and for the continuity of representation for every district in the country even if only one representative dies or is in incapacitated
hr 841 on the other hand does nothing to address incapacity and in the case of death allows as many as 99 districts at a time to go without representation for months
thus the rohrabacherbaird amendment not only solves all the continuity problems but also preserves the principle that only elected officials may cast a vote in the house of representatives
many otherwise competent leaders were in a state of shock and at one moment when we gathered on the capitol steps to send a message to the american people representative baird and i realized more was needed and began singing god bless america
all our colleagues joined in
this is too important an issue to think about in terms of party politics
this is a time of crisis when american people will be counting on us to do our best and to set up something that will work in a time of crisis
i oppose this amendment because it does not correct the fundamental flaw of hr 841 which is leaving the united states of america at a time of its worst crisis its worst potential crisis that you can imagine it leaves the american people in the lurch leaves them without representative government and without representation in the congress for 7 weeks
many otherwise competent leaders were in a state of shock and at that moment on 911 did not necessarily know or were incapable of doing exactly what the right thing was
and let me note that on that day that time of crisis when we were all in confusion standing on the capitol about ready to break up representative barrett and i looked at each other in our eyes and said this is not enough
and it was representative barrett and myself that started leading that singing and were joined in by our colleagues
what is happening is we are being offered an alternative that will leave them in the lurch leave them wanting at the time of maximum crisis
if we do believe in god bless america let us join in now with the partisan flavor of this debate and do what is right to make sure our people are prepared if our country is ever attacked like this again
what is going to happen in the future if we put this solution in place and there is a crisis
so again let us not leave a void which this bill does for the future americans who will face the crisis of a generation and leave them in the lurch
mr chairman i rise in support of this legislation and commend my chairman for the good job that he has done but i am opposed to one portion of the bill
the bairdrohrabacher amendment which we will debate in a few moments will remove title iii from this appropriations bill
title iii not only should not be in this appropriations bill it should not become law no matter how it is brought up
the task force that got together to try to come up with a solution to this challenge of what we are going to do in case of a catastrophe where many of our people are killed or incapacitated became confused about what they were supposed to be doing
the idea is not to ensure the election process but to ensure that this congress can act in a time of emergency
instead what we have gotten as our alternative which is in title iii of this bill will put us in grave jeopardy for 7 weeks after a national catastrophe
i am pleading with my republican friends to please open their eyes and not let the ego of the people on this task force who put together this and now will not look at any other alternative get in the way of watching out for the people of the united states
if al qaeda or any other enemy of our country manages to create a situation or explode a bomb or murder or incapacitate large numbers of our people we can not wait for 7 weeks of a special election in order to deal with that
please think about what will happen if we have another major bombing in this country and it happens in this city
put ourselves in a position of what will happen in a catastrophe
waiting 7 weeks for special elections as presented in this bill would be a disaster
mr chairman i rise in support of hr 841 the continuity of representation act of 2005
during the last congress the house acted in an overwhelmingly bipartisan fashion to address this deficiency by passing the predecessor of this year s bill by a larger than three to one margin
unfortunately the bill was never brought up in the other body because of the objections of one or more anonymous members of that chamber
the house unique among all branches and bodies of the entire federal government is rooted in the principle of direct elections and that principle must be preserved
current federal law allows the presidency and the senate to consist of entirely the unelected in certain circumstances
congress has the clear authority to enact the continuity in representation act under article i section 4 of the constitution which allows congress at any time by law to make or alter state election laws
consistent with the right to chosen representation the founders explicitly considered congress s power to require expedited special elections as the solution to potential discontinuity in government in extraordinary situations
as alexander hamilton wrote the constitution gives the congress members from both parties have a significant stake in the operation of the house following a terrorist incident and i am pleased that the legislation before us today is appropriately a product of bipartisan cooperation and input
i have no doubt that the boundless spirit of the american people will ensure that democracy prevails even in the most pressing conditions
and i point out that what this bill does is to ensure the prompt filling of vacant seats in states that have long special election processes
virginia is able to fill vacancies in its general assembly by special election within 12 days after the vacancy occurs provided the governor calls a special election
if virginia makes that apply to vacancies in the house of representatives we are going to have a full virginia delegation sitting in this chamber or elsewhere legislating while the states that decide that they want to have more debates and keep the seats vacant will end up sitting unrepresented here
what this bill does is that it speeds up the process in the slow states the ones that have lengthy special election processes including the gentlewoman from california s own state
the one seat in the house of representatives that is vacant today is that occupied by our beloved colleague the late bob matsui
but if no candidate in that election gets more than 50 percent of the vote then we will wait until may 3 to find out who the new representative from sacramento california is
to respond to the gentleman s comments about california it does show that we do need beyond 45 days to hold a special election such as in the case of our late friend representative bob matsui
twenty votes are necessary for the twothirds majority necessary to propose amendments to the constitution on any subject and i believe that the house of representatives at that time clearly and emphatically spoke in favor of maintaining elections as the only way one could enter the house of representatives the people s house
so now we hear that the 49 days that are proposed in this bill are too short to be able to organize a proper election in a time of crisis
during the second world war great britain was under attack constantly by the german air force and even during the war they were able to hold special elections to fill vacancies in the house of commons within 42 days
this bill will work just as well in a time of crisis as a way of repopulating the house
so the responsible thing to do is to speed up the special election process particularly in those states like california where it takes forever to fill a vacancy so that the states can have full representation as quickly as possible
it has also been shown it is too short a time to conduct special elections in many states
it is insufficient time for voter registration and for those who want to participate in this unscheduled election
this bill simply represents the wrong choices of values in a democracy
secondly the purpose of this bill is to require special elections to be held in those states with slower special election processes to be held as quickly as possible within the 49day period
i would respond to that simply by saying if virginia repopulates the house or its delegation to the house within 12 days and it takes at least 62 days for wisconsin to do so 50 days will elapse or almost 2 months will elapse while wisconsin has either a reduced or no delegation in the house but the house keeps on legislating
the membership has been preparing for the debate on this bill with the amendment made in order under the rule
and also there is an appeals process in the gentlewoman s amendment that would allow the appeals to be dragged out indefinitely
when there is a catastrophe that wipes out a significant number of members of the house it is in the interest of the public to fill those vacancies as quickly as possible through a fair election
we should not allow anybody to tie up an election call in the courts forever and ever and ever simply because their candidate might not be in a proper position to win the election
they will result in new representatives coming with mandates rather than having the frustration of lawsuits that go on interminably
mr chairman the fatal flaw in this amendment is it does not extend the 49 days under which the election is required to be held under the provisions of this bill
so the more time we spend in court the less time the election officials have to be able to organize the election print the ballots mail the ballots to absentee voters at home and overseas and get them back in time to be counted
we have heard an awful lot saying well the time frame is just too compact in order to run a fair election
what the gentlewoman s amendment does is that it makes it more compact because every day and every week that is spent tied up in the courts is going to be that much less time for the election machinery to operate
mr chairman i rise in opposition to the baird amendment
the gentleman from washington has been very sincere in stating that there ought to be a constitution amendment to provide for temporary appointments to the house of representatives in case of a tragedy
the house debated that amendment in the last congress and it was rejected by the resounding margin of 63 ayes to 353 noes
and those who voted for that bill in february ought to vote against the baird amendment today
in this 49day time frame the election center has shown that there can be special elections that will have the vigorous debate that the gentleman from washington mr baird xz4000110 wants to have in terms of selecting replacement representatives for those of us who are wiped out
mr chairman i thank the gentleman from california for allowing me to participate in this discussion
would the chairman enter into a colloquy with me regarding an amendment i had wished to offer relative to placing a plaque in statuary hall
as the gentleman knows i was interested in offering an amendment today that would require a plaque to be placed in statuary hall which would recognize that church services were held in the house chamber from 1800 to 1868
throughout the 1800s the speaker s podium in the old house chamber was converted into a preacher s pulpit on sundays for church services
as the gentleman knows i withdrew my proposal in light of ongoing activities relative to the exhibitry in the capitol visitors center
i wonder if the gentleman would not mind please explaining his understanding relative to statuary hall and the exhibit hall in the soontobeopened capitol visitors center
mr chairman i thank the gentleman and i appreciate so much his working with me on this and look forward to appropriately recognizing the fact that there have been religious activities in this capitol from the beginning of our nation through the first 70 or 80 years
one of his predecessors in the 10th district of texas died tragically just a few days ago congressman pickle and the gentleman from texas mr mccaul xz4006540 did attend his funeral and could not be here today to vote nor could he be here today to offer this amendment
so i offer it in his stead
as a good conservative and someone who minds the fiscal house of the united states government the gentleman from texas mr mccaul xz4006540 offered this amendment that would simply rein in the cost of printing just much like the gentleman from arizona mr flake xz4001340 offered a few moments ago
so at this time i would simply like to recommend the house do accept this amendment that would rein in excessive spending
i think we and each individual congressman s office can actually rein in that spending ourselves and actually print out the bills that we need
with that i would certainly appreciate the kindness of the house in voting for this amendment that would somewhat restrain our spending in the matter of printing here in congress
and we are not going to eliminate jobs in this instance
as the ranking member of the joint committee on printing i can appreciate the gentleman s interest in reducing excessive printing and diverting the funds to more useful purposes
the gpo will perform whatever work congress orders and congress will pay for it in a subsequent appropriation if necessary
this is a limitation amendment and the language in the amendment simply establishes the scope of the limitation
for the purpose of amendments this rule provides for priority recognition to members who preprinted their amendments in the lt em gt lt em gt congressional record and the rule also allows for certain points of order to be raised in the course of consideration of this bill
mr speaker this bill deals with filibusters in the us senate
actually mr speaker it does not but until you say that magic word the media does not send its attention to the fact that the house is actually continuing on with the input of good government in our processes so this bill actually for which i am pleased to stand before the house and support the rule on the underlying legislation is the interior appropriations act
i appreciate the hard work and the hard choices that the subcommittee chairman the gentleman from north carolina mr taylor xz4003992 the gentleman from california chairman lewis the gentleman from washington mr dicks xz4001090 and many others have put into making and putting this essential funding bill together which does live within the budget discipline and in fact reflects the priorities of this congress
by prioritizing the needs this provides for example an increase in six of the eight epa programs for the environment
it also provides for a record amount of funding to the national fire plan and gives the department flexibility in these accounts to help prevent and fight the annual onslaught of raging fires on public lands in the west which have plagued many areas especially california in recent years
i am also pleased in particular that the gentleman from north carolina chairman taylor has been diligent in funding the vital payment in lieu of tax program or pilt which so many western and rural counties depend upon for these vital public services
it is also very nice to note that the committee on appropriations which is tasked with trying to prioritize needs and fund those that are truly significant in that prioritization and in this particular situation the gentleman from north carolina chairman taylor and the gentleman from washington mr speaker i reserve the balance of my time
i would like to do something unique so far in today s debate and talk about something that is actually in the bill and something about which we will be debating later and preface it with the comment of why when we try to prioritize should we spend new taxpayer money for new recreation areas and programs when some of the existing programs longtime recognized long time in the bill are not totally and fully funded
in fact 67 percent of my state is owned by the federal government
now i am an old teacher and as i look at the situation of education i find a unique phenomenon that the area of this country in which education funding is growing the slowest the area of this country where the classrooms are the largest the area of this country where the student population is increasing the fastest and the area of this country where state and local commitment in tax base is being paid by their citizens all happen to be found in the 13 states of the west
and the common denominator for all is the amount of public lands that happen to be in these particular states
those members east of the rocky mountains sometimes do not comprehend the concept because there is very little of your land owned by the federal government and you can maximize the amount of input but you can not do it in the west
one of my counties has an area known as the black box something that no one in utah would ever try to raft down
one of our good constituent friends from another state decided to come and raft in the area of the black box and unfortunately he lost his life doing it
there is a program that we have long had called payment in lieu of taxes which recognizes the burden placed upon the west and the burden that should be funded
from the mid1970s until the early 1990s virtually no new money was placed in this program
this congress put 14 million of new money into the burgeoning problem of trying to pay for the federal lands in the west
instead of prioritizing this program they recommended a cut in this program and increased funding to the administrative overhead of the department of the interior
i commend the gentleman from north carolina chairman taylor for recognizing the unfairness of this and by increasing the payment in lieu of taxes to last year s level plus 3 million but it is still not close to full funding
we have an opportunity of expanding this in conference
this is one of the issues in this freeflowing open rule that we will be discussing later on
this is an issue where i commend the chairman for doing what he has done in this bill and urge him to continue on because the citizens of the west the kids in the west the education system of the west have been harmed too long by policies that all of us in congress for over 30 years have been implementing
i appreciate the opportunity coming here and discussing this particular open rule that allows for us to discuss the prioritization which is the key element of what we do in every appropriations issue
but the same discussion also takes place in another area and it takes place in the committee process before it ever comes to this bill
i am here to still contend that the committee both republican and democrat did a good job in coming up with a prioritization process
this committee put significant new money not just into national parks but to maintain the backlog that we have of maintenance in our national parks
i was saying with pilt and i will say it again that what we have to do is fully fund it because it has been looked at for too long especially when the minority party was in charge here and there were basically no increases in pilt funding it has been looked at for too long as welfare for the west
i think there are some areas in which i think they could go ahead and move forward in those particular areas but once again prioritizing those commitments we have already made and fully funding those first
in closing mr speaker i have to reiterate the fairness of this open rule and urge its adoption because of that along with the underlying appropriation legislation
i am sure we can all come up with issues here and there in the appropriations bill or for that matter in any other bill we have where we would like to have it come out differently had we had our way but in judging this bill as a whole and the process that has been through it to get to the point i believe it is worthy for members to support this particular piece of legislation
and then i do want to talk to my good friend from florida about what we really did with education in utah
2 notwithstanding any other provision of this resolution the amendment printed in section 3 shall be in order without intervention of any point of order and before any other amendment if ofered by representative obey of wisconsin or a designee
the amendment is not subject to amendment except for pro forma amendments or to a demand for a division of the question in the committee of the whole or in the house
3 the amendment referred to in section 2 is as follows amendment to hr 2361 as reported offered by mr obey xz4003000 of wisconsin at the end of the bill before the short title insert the following sec
a the amount otherwise provided in this act for environmental protection agency state and tribal assistance grants and the amount specified under such heading for making capitalization grants for the clean water state revolving funds under title vi of the federal water pollution control act is hereby increased by 500 000 000
b in the case of taxpayers with adjusted gross income in excess of 1 000 000 for calendar year 2006 the amount of tax reduction resulting from enactment of the economic growth and tax relief reconciliation act of 2001 pub
then invite the american chemistry council as a partner in this study knowing that in exchange for 2 million paid toward the study it wants looser regulations for the pesticide industry which in turn wants to use humans instead of animals so it can justify relaxed exposure limits
although we passed this amendment by unanimous consent two years ago epa resurrected the study when the fiscal year expired in october
our amendment is supported by a broad coalition of environmental advocates including the alliance for human research protection in my home state of new york
after the budget shortfall was announced both sides of the aisle in the senate came together to take immediate action to address the issue
while we were sitting on our hands the three surgical operating rooms at the white river junction in vamc was closed on june 27 because the heating and air conditioning system was broken
the communitybased outpatient clinics needed to meet veterans increased demand for care in the north florida and south georgia va health care system was delayed due to fiscal restraint
as of april in gainesville florida there were nearly 700 serviceconnected veterans waiting for more than 30 days for an appointment
certainly in a state like florida where we have more than our share of heavy rains during rainy season and you can be darn sure we are going to have a lot of hurricanes again it would be virtually playing russian roulette every time that citizens would be drinking tap water
i can not in good conscience allow the rule to go forward and have that communicated to the epa
but keeping it in the legislation is very wise policy
mr speaker i rise today in support of the motion to instruct conferees on hr 2361 department of interior environment and related agencies appropriations act for fiscal year 2006
several weeks ago the house of representatives unanimously passed hr 3130 which provided 975 million in health care funding for the fiscal year
we did that in response to revelations at the time to a line of questioning that i had with dr
this shifting was driven by underestimates of longterm care requirements and increased use of va facilities by returning operations enduring freedom and operation iraqi freedom veterans to also include a surge of veterans in categories 1 through 6 and category 7 for health care
this house acted the very same day in which the secretary made his request through the president of the united states approving to the penny the va s request
yet the number was not even dry on the paper when in fact days later we were then informed that number was really 1275 billion and they needed an additional 300 million
the 300 million is for a carryover account which we in congress permit the va to utilize
but when we look at vha s forecasting performance which has been the focus at some of our animated hearings in the house 3 over the last several weeks in april they provide notice to the committee on appropriations that they are going to reprogram 600 million
then in the latter part of june when we hold our hearing they testify they are short 975 million but they have workaround solutions then a few days later while we are on our july break we learn that the number was short 300 million
we either take care of that in 2005 or we have to include it in the 2006 budget amendment
what is it going to be in august
so that is why i am going to support the motion to instruct because there is a loss of confidence here in the house with regard to the number that has been given to us
in particular i am greatly disappointed and have lost confidence in the leadership and management of the deputy under secretary for health for operations and for management
in the meantime congress will ensure that veterans health care is funded
we will hold va accountable for its use of these dollars in the performance of its mission
i will specifically visit a polytrauma center in minneapolis
one of the harshest realities of combat in iraq and afghanistan is the number of servicemembers returning from iraq and afghanistan with loss of limbs and other severe and lasting injuries
one of them is in minneapolis one is in palo alto another one is in richmond and one is in tampa
vsos and others are saying that these individual veterans are not being seen because of cuts in the va
we can all see that only 2 months remain in the fiscal year
i also commend my colleagues in the senate for their willingness to act quickly to secretary nicholson s request and to resolve this matter
in the end those of us who exercise great care to raise and support the military know that our obligation does not end upon one s discharge
i urge my colleagues to support the motion to instruct conferees in order to ensure that the veterans funding can be done as quickly as possible
mr chairman established in 1907 by president theodore roosevelt the tongass is our nation s largest forest about the size of west virginia
mr chairman each year the timber industry is subsidized by millions of tax dollars taxpayer hard working funding tax dollars for logging in the tongass national forest approximately 850 million since 1982
there are already about 5 000 miles of roads in the tongass
let me repeat that at taxpayer expense in the tongass
this amendment is not an attempt to take away jobs in alaska
in fact between 1998 and 2004 tongassrelated jobs fell from over 1 500 to less than 300
in fact the forest service has a 10year supply of timber remaining off current roads
in fact the forest service is offering to let logging companies cancel contracts already sold because the companies do not want the timber
mr chairman i support logging in our national forests when it makes sense when it is economically viable
i also might bring to the attention the fact that this is essentially the same amendment that was offered and held in order in the last congress
with that said i believe the subcommittee has done an excellent job in crafting a bill that addresses those major problems
several years ago this committee provided funds for a new visitors center at chickasaw national recreation area in my district
the bids came in high due to the rising cost of materials
mr chairman i am asking that you consider restoring this project in conference should funds become available
mr chairman i rise in strong support for the stupakshaw antisewage dumping amendment
by allowing routine blending it will only increase the concentration of the contaminant in our environment
mr chairman i raise a point of order against section 413 of hr 2361 on the grounds that this provision changes existing law in violation of clause 2 b of house rule xxi and therefore is legislation included in a general appropriation bill
that is a very significant hit on these accounts in this important agency
therefore mr chairman i raise a point of order against the amendment because it proposes to change existing law and constitutes legislation in an appropriation bill and therefore violates clause 2 of rule xxi
the rule states in pertinent part an amendment to a general appropriation bill shall not be in order if changing existing law
mr speaker i thank the gentleman for yielding me this time and i want to compliment the gentleman from wisconsin mr obey xz4003000 the gentleman from texas mr edwards xz4001180 and all the members who deeply care about our veterans in this body
and with the war raging in iraq and with the seriousness of the injuries any of us who have been out to walter reed or to bethesda to see these heroic young men and women who have come back with these very severe wounds i think all of us want to see the best care given to our veterans
we have been reading about posttraumatic stress syndrome and the consequences and the effect on the lives of these soldiers and sailors and marines when they come home after having been involved in the kind of violent combat that is being seen in iraq
i had a chance to visit the va hospital in seattle recently and i was told by the people there that they still have a backlog a waiting list of 2 500 people waiting to get their appointments at the seattle va
mr speaker i want to say that i believe the other body was correct in adding this money but this is not something that normally would be part of the interior appropriations bill
this is just something that happened we were the first bill moving through and it became a convenient vehicle in the other body to put this 15 billion onto
i think mr nicholson has not been as forthright as he should have been in telling the various committees on the hill what was needed
but in my mind there is absolutely no excuse for not approving this 15 billion
mr speaker i appreciate the gentleman s efforts and he is sincere in everything he says
mr chairman the provision in the fiscal year 2006 appropriations bill that is the subject of this amendment would allow the fish and wildlife service to sell public lands in the lower klamath and tule lake wildlife refuges and use the profits from the land sales to buy water rights
as members of congress whose constituents would be affected by a provision such as this we feel it is necessary to have time to review the proposal in order to ensure that the proposed program best suits the needs of the local communities in our districts
these plant designs allow communities to prevent sewer overflows and meet all clean water act standards in a costeffective way
in those cases a plant then treats it twice
one person from the ohio river valley water sanitation commission said in the case of the ohio river without our blending policy more untreated overflows would occur and the water quality impacts of wet weather would be more damaging the head of an agency in california said with blending our member communities can provide the maximum clean water treatment possible to unpredictable exceptionally heavy rains and snowmelt while still meeting permit limits which are set to protect public health and the environment a water executive from little rock arkansas said blending protects public utility infrastructure by preventing washout of sensitive biological systems and protects public health and private property another official said a prohibition of blending will result in the need for extremely expensive facility upgrades that will not result in any meaningful improvement to water quality or protection of the public health if we prohibit blending it will cause worse environmental trouble than if we allow these experts and these utilities to proceed with it
mr speaker for 2 years our nation s respected veterans organizations along with democrats in congress have been predicting cuts in veterans health care services due to inadequate va health care budgets
in february in fact of 2004 nearly a year and a half ago republican chairman of the house committee on veterans affairs the gentleman from new jersey mr smith xz4003802 and his democratic ranking member the gentleman from illinois mr evans xz4001260 in a bipartisan letter predicted the administration request for va health care for this year would be 25 billion short
did they stand up for veterans health care needs in funding
to make matters worse the gentleman from new jersey mr smith xz4003802 house democrats and veterans organizations were right in saying veterans health care services were underfunded and the house leadership was wrong
at every step of the way over the past 2 years in the committee on the budget in amendments there in the committee on appropriations in amendments there in the 302 b allocation the amount of money for veterans care in the committee on appropriations in all of these places and on this house floor repeatedly the house leadership has fought against the money needed to adequately support our veterans health care needs during a time of our war on terrorism
they are still dragging their feet in trying to adequately fund veterans health care needs
it is time for republicans and democrats alike today to do the right thing and to instruct the conferees on the interior appropriations bill to support the same 15 billion emergency veterans health care funding that was approved by a bipartisan vote of 96 to 0 weeks ago in the senate
mr speaker i thank the gentleman from wisconsin for yielding me this time and for his leadership on behalf of our nation s veterans leadership which has sorely been lacking in this house
this administration and this congress has insulted our veterans community repeatedly in the last few months insults which i hope we will remedy with today s motion
this could have been signed by the president several weeks ago yet in my hometown of san diego we have 1 000 people on a waiting list just to have their first appointment
the democrats in this congress have tried at every level on the committee on the budget on the committee on appropriations in the senate in the house and we tried on the floor of this house to give the independent budget numbers the force of law but we were voted down on pure partyline votes
i come from the district that has by far and away more wild horses in it than any district in the united states bar none
of the 30 000 horses we are talking about 20 000 of them are in the second district of nevada
my colleagues in nevada horses do not always look beautiful like the horse that we see in black beauty
anyone falsifying or concealing information in that contract is subject to criminal penalties under us law
in sum the new blm rules will make it a crime to sell wild horses for slaughter yet will allow for the sale of these animals to buyers seeking to provide them good caring homes
i applaud the bush administration and the bureau of land management for taking responsible action to assure america s wild horses and burros are cared for and i would like to thank the ford motor company and the take pride in america program which this amendment will stop dead in its tracks for supporting blm in this effort and creating the save the mustangs fund
as is usually the case in such debates the results are exactly the opposite of what is being advocated
ironically rather than saving wild horses the amendment will have the perverse effect of ensuring their numbers will stay at unsustainable levels adoption efforts will be hampered and thousands of old unadoptable horses will stay stuck in limbo in longterm holding facilities or as the gentleman from kentucky suggested euthanized
the blm has conducted an analysis of their wild horse and burro program and determined that if they had not removed many of the wild horses from the range prolonged drought reduced forage production and poor health would have resulted in large losses during the winter of 2005
in cedar city utah for example over 100 horses had to be removed from the range to prevent their suffering and potential starvation
inadequacy of the adoption program has resulted in many of these horses being sentenced to spend the rest of their lives in longterm facilities unsuitable for wild horses
as is usually the case in such debates the results are exactly the opposite of what is being advocated

in cedar city utah for example over 100 horses had to be removed from the range to prevent their suffering and potential starvation
inadequacy of the adoption program has resulted in many of these horses being sentenced to spend the rest of their life in long term unsuitable for wild holding facilities
because of the overwhelming cost of these facilities at the expense of the federal government the number of horses on the range is still well above the appropriate management levels called for in law
furthermore onehalf of the entire wild horse and burro operating budget is used to take care of unadoptable horses held in these facilities
currently there are 8400 horses in these long term facilities that need to be moved on through the program in order to prevent malnutrition and starvation that is associated with the overpopulation of the range land herds
by denying the funds to implement the sale program for wild horses and burros this irresponsible amendment would eliminate a far more efficient tool in the management of the program
by not allowing blm to keep the herd in manageable numbers this amendment endangers the welfare of the wild horses by exacerbating the deplorable conditions these animals must try to survive in where their only escape is death by starvation
mr speaker i rise today in opposition to this rule not because of what it allows but rather because of what it does not allow
as someone who will be offering an amendment to that bill later today i appreciate that the majority structured the rule in such a manner
for the fiscally conservative in the house the amendment of the gentleman from wisconsin mr obey xz4003000 was revenue neutral paying for itself by capping the tax cut for millionaires at just over 138 000
mr speaker we live in trying times with enormous fiscal constraints many of which have been brought upon ourselves
the underlying legislation includes funding which is essential to everglades restoration in my district and throughout south florida
the bill also increases funding for operations at our national parks as well as a 67 million muchneeded increase in funding for the bureau of indian affairs
despite these increases the underlying legislation makes major cuts in funding to some of our most important environmental and health programs
conservation funding is about 750 million below or less than half of what was promised when congress passed the conservation and restoration act in 2000
it is also the second appropriations bill in which we can see the drastic and dramatic effects of the bush tax cuts
republicans are going to try and associate domestic funding cuts with the cost of the war in iraq
all communities currently do not share in the burden of health and environmental risks and my amendment expresses congress support for epa doing what is necessary to protect these communities
mr speaker individuals in our country on their own are not going to force power companies to reduce mercury emissions from smokestacks
with innovation that can only occur in a consortium of stakeholders the department of the interior can make major environmental restoration projects a reality
everyone in america shares in the responsibility of contributing his or her own fair share
is there any member in this body who is unwilling to pay just a little more to ensure that everyone in america has clean air to breathe
if given the chance who would not be willing to pool his or her resources with others in his or her neighborhood to collectively ensure that everyone everyone has safe drinking water or that no child will be forced to grow up playing in backyards polluted by dangerous levels of mercury and other toxins
i do not blame or fault the appropriators for the funding cuts in the underlying legislation but i do fault the majority in this body for creating a situation in which failure to adequately fund america s needs has become imminent
if the previous question is defeated i will amend the rule so we can consider the amendment of the gentleman from wisconsin mr obey xz4003000 that was rejected in the rules committee last night on a straight partyline vote
i find it incomprehensible that we do not understand the dynamics of that or that most if not all of us in this body do not have communities that would benefit from modernizing our water systems
the obey amendment pays for itself and adds nothing to the federal debt while maintaining funding levels in every other program in the bill
this amendment will correct one of the most serious shortfalls in this bill
i urge my colleagues in the house to vote no on the previous question
in an effort to cut down on the time constraints let me just briefly explain the amendment
it prohibits the epa from using funds in this bill to work in contravention of executive order 12898 and delay the implementation of that order
my amendment makes clear congress s support for the executive order and its original intention to achieve health and environmental equity in minority and lowincome communities
in adopting my amendment congress will call on epa to move forward with the identification of atrisk minority and lowincome communities so appropriate steps can be taken to improve their health and wellbeing
mr chairman i include for the record the findings of the epa inspector general report and those in support of the amendment
2004p00007 march 1 2004 purpose in 1994 president clinton issued executive order 12898 federal action to address environmental justice in minority populations and lowincome populations to ensure such populations are not subjected to a disproportionately high level of environmental risk
results in brief epa has not fully implemented executive order 12898 nor consistently integrated environmental justice into its daytoday operations
epa has not identified minority and lowincome nor identified populations addressed in the executive order and has neither defined nor developed criteria for determining disproportionately impacted
moreover in 2001 the agency restated its commitment to environmental justice in a manner that does not emphasize minority and lowincome populations the intent of the executive order
although the agency has been actively involved in implementing executive order 12898 for 10 years it has not developed a clear vision or a comprehensive strategic plan and has not established values goals expectations and performance measurements
in the absence of environmental justice definitions criteria or standards from the agency many regional and program offices have taken steps individually to implement environmental justice policies
this has resulted in inconsistent approaches by the regional offices
thus the implementation of environmental justice actions is dependent not only on minority and income status but on the epa region in which the person resides
our comparison of how environmental justice protocols used by three different regions would apply to the same city showed a wide disparity in protected populations
agency comments and oig evaluation in the response to our draft report the agency disagreed with the central premise that executive order 12898 requires the agency to identify and address the environmental effects of its programs on minority and lowincome populations
the agency s complete response and our evaluation of that response are included in appendices d and e respectively
the hastings amendment will ensure that funds spent at the us epa can not be spent in any way that conflicts with the 1994 executive order federal actions to address environmental justice in minority populations and lowincome populations eo 12898 directs each federal agency to develop an environmental justice strategy that identifies and addresses disproportionately high and adverse human health or environmental effects of its programs policies or activities on minority populations and lowincome populations with the goal of achieving equity in federallyfunded programs for those communities
the hastings amendment is needed to get epa to take the next steps that are needed to achieve the promise of fairness and equal treatment for minority and lowincome communities in federal environmental programs
this problem was first addressed at epa in 1992 when president george hw
bush created the office of environmental equity at epa now the office of environmental justice it was addressed a second time by president clinton when he issued the executive order in 1994
the agency s failure to move forward on the important issue of environmental justice has been the hastings amendment does not place new requirements on the epa but rather provides direction for the agency to fulfill its longstanding obligation to ensure that minority and lowincome populations are not exposed to dangerous and disproportionately high levels of air pollution water contamination toxic hazards or other environmental and health threats in their communities
we urge you to cast your vote in support of the hastings environmental justice amendment

in fact just the other day a democratic colleague mentioned this bill and said the gentleman from north carolina mr taylor xz4003981 is as tight as a snare drum and i take that as an extreme compliment
he said the center needed millions of dollars in structural repairs yet he could not move forward on them because of the park service contracting requirements and inflated costs
the only national park service cut loose in the past 20 years supposedly and yet in this bill it includes 178 million for operation and maintenance at the kennedy center and 10 million for construction
i question whether the various agencies really need all of the new vehicles authorized in this bill
the chairman has done a fine job in reining in costs particularly in the area of land acquisition but at a time of a 300plus million deficit we need to do more
even in a small way i encourage support of this amendment
mr chairman i rise in strong support of this amendment offered by my colleagues which will prevent the epa from finalizing a policy that may increase the risks of waterborne illness and harm our nation s waterways
such a policy could result in water systems with more pathogens viruses bacteria and parasites that make people sick contaminate our drinking water supplies harm fish and other aquatic life
the use of secondary biological treatment to remove bacteria and pathogens from sewage has been in place for decades in order to protect the public from waterborne illnesses and i believe we must preserve these longstanding standards
blending waste streams at times other than natural emergencies will result in an unnecessary discharge of harmful contaminants into our waters
i plan soon on reintroducing my bill the clean water infrastructure financing act which will authorize funding levels in the clean water state revolving fund which better reflect the considerable depth of our nation s wastewater infrastructure needs
i urge strong support for this amendment because we must invest in effective sewage treatment to help ensure that our constituents are protected from health hazards
i want to really applaud the gentleman from michigan for putting together a truly bipartisan amendment that not only put together a broad coalition of members in this house including the chairman of the subcommittee who has accepted the amendment to stop this blending regulation
we all saw when milwaukee dumped over 4 billion gallons of sewage into lake michigan just last year and an incredible rise in the number of beach closings along the illinois shoreline nine in glencoe 12 in wilmette 34 in winnetka a rising tide of dirty water that would have been increased with this
mr speaker i rise today in opposition to the rule and in strong opposition to what i consider a very bad bill
i am particularly outraged that the bill completely zeros out the stateside grant program of the land and water conservation fund a program that has been an enormous help to our local communities and the families who live in them
the land and water conservation fund lwcf is based upon a simple concept it takes revenues from offshore oil and gas drilling and invests them in our nation s public land letting states take the lead
now even though lwcf takes in 900 million annually from oil and gas receipts in recent years just a fraction of this funding has been used for its rightful purpose
in all the stateside program has helped communities by funding 40 000 projects nationally success stories that can be found in every state and in 98 percent of us counties
in fact in many lowincome urban communities the stateside grant program is responsible for virtually all parks
over the last century the nation s wastewater infrastructure has resulted in enormous strides in improving public health
the merrimack river was once among the most polluted waterways in the nation
during heavy weather these combined sewer systems steer raw untreated sewage into rivers like the merrimack and bays such as casco bay in maine
in economicallydistressed communities such as lawrence haverhill and lowell that have combined sewer systems it is not currently possible to provide full treatment for all sewage during wet weather
i seek assurance from the gentleman from michigan that his amendment would not prohibit cso communities from blending if it is authorized by their permits in accordance with the clean water act
mr chairman obviously we are here tonight to talk about just a commonsense issue in regards to this blending issue
i in fact have been involved in the construction of and the management of wastewater treatment plants
blending is used obviously in very high water times and i think that that is an issue that we have heard raised tonight
we are not in any way trying to stop the issue of blending during the storm season but the fact of the matter is in 2003 there were more than 18 000 closings or advisories around the united states and that was 5 000 more than ever at any time before
these closings were due to fecal coliform increases in bacterial levels outside of the norm
the fact of the matter is it does not take a medical degree to understand that this is a health issue for our families and our children that are out there that are actually swimming sometimes in this waste
in fact we are looking at the blending of untreated solid free waste with treated sewage
i was saddened to learn about the provision in last year s omnibus appropriations bill that would allow the sale of any wild horse that has been rounded up and is more than ten years old
there is simply no reason for these horses to be slaughtered for use as meat in other countries
it is a beloved literary figure a character in a movie or television show a symbol of adventure a friend of the cowboy and an important part of our history
william shakespeare once stated that horses were as full of spirit as the month of may and as gorgeous as the sun in midsummer i can say it no better and encourage all of my colleagues to join me and support the rahallwhitfield amendment and help save the wild horse
196 i was delayed in traffic
mr chairman i rise in support of the amendment
mr chairman when epa proposed to issue a new policy document on sewage blending i was concerned that it could cause an increase in the frequency of blending by those communities that current use the practice and an increase in the number of communities that use the practice
i do not believe that there currently is enough information available to epa and state permit writers to know that any increase in the use of blending is protective of human health and the environment
i do not believe that sewage blending is what was intended when the secondary treatment requirements for publicly owned treatment works were put in place by congress in 1972
even the proponents of blending acknowledge that blending is used only in limited high flow circumstances at all other times the sewage otherwise receives full secondary treatment the current acknowledged limitations on the use of blending lead to the question if blending constitutes secondary treatment then why is it not acceptable all the time or if it does not constitute secondary treatment why is it allowed at all
epa want s to make sure that it only occurs in the very limited narrow circumstances and that it meets all requirements in their clean water act permit and that water quality standards downstream are also maintained mr chairman increasing the use of blending is not an acceptable longterm solution to meeting secondary treatment requirements
this bill provides huge cuts 40 percent cuts over a 2year period in the clean water revolving fund
every time that those of us on this side of the aisle point to the shortcomings in the budget that the republican majority has just passed we hear well we ca nt do anything about these shortages in the appropriation bills because after all we have limited resources the gentleman who just spoke the gentleman from utah said the appropriations process quote should prioritize our needs i fully agree
i do not begrudge i do not denigrate in any way people who have managed to strike it rich and who are managing to make a million dollars a year
i hope everybody in this country at some point in their lives can do that
but i do believe that people who are the most blessed in our society ought to pay their fair share and the budget resolution which was imposed on this committee by this house does not allow us to reach that kind of fair distribution of tax burden
because the rules committee would not allow that amendment i am going to vote against the previous question and i am going to vote against the bill because the bill is grossly negligent in dealing with the air and water pollution problems facing this country
i am also not at all thrilled by the fact that for the first time in all the years i have been in congress there will not be a single dollar provided for land acquisition programs
the gentleman may not want it in his state but there are key tracts of land that we want the government to acquire in my state there are key tracts of land we want the government to acquire for instance at george washington s birthplace before real estate developers destroy that beauty for all time
i am an old real estate broker so i have nothing against real estate developers but i do not think they ought to be able to get their gloms on the most pristine land in this country and turn it into a shopping mall when we have our population increase by onethird since i came to this body and when we have an increased need for resources that the average family can enjoy
but most of all the biggest problem with this bill is that it walks away from our obligation to help state and local governments clean up some of the dirtiest rivers and dirtiest lakes in the country
i certainly am in support of the intention of the gentleman s request but it is my understanding that there may be a problem with one of the amendments
mr chairman at this point i had intended to offer an amendment to the stupak amendment because i am certainly in support of the content
it is very good that this amendment is being adopted but it again illustrates the need for in fact increasing rather than reducing the amount of money that we put into the clean water revolving fund and i would hope that we would remember this as the bill goes through the system because we can avoid controversies such as this
mr chairman my understanding is that there are no other amendments left to the bill and i simply want to say that i think the chairman of the subcommittee has been very fair and balanced in the way he has approached the bill
how any member votes on this bill is in my view up to that member
this bill does all of those things not because the gentleman from north carolina mr taylor xz4003981 wanted to but simply because of what the majority leader said 2 weeks ago when he said this is the budget the american people voted for when they voted for a republican house a republican senate and a republican white house i do not agree with mr delay xz4001040 on much but i agree with him in that assessment
the budget resolution passed earlier this year told the congress to find a way to meet the targets in that resolution even if we had to gut the clean water program and to cut the stag grants
mr speaker for the past 3 years a number of us on this side of the aisle including the gentleman from texas mr edwards xz4001180 myself and several others have tried to bring the administration to the realization that we needed many more dollars in the veterans health care funds than in fact they requested each year
we have heard that thousands of patients have had to wait more than 3 months for appointments in california
we have heard that in states like arkansas and oklahoma and mississippi and louisiana the va has stopped scheduling appointments for many veterans who are eligible for care
we have heard of 6month delays in emergency surgery in oregon
we have heard that facilities have had to erect scaffolding to protect patients and staff from falling bricks in maine
we have heard that a medical center in vermont has major shortfalls in their prosthetics budget
we have been told that doctors have had to pilfer supplies from neighboring hospitals to carry out routine procedures in illinois
and we have been told that life safety improvements like replacing fire alarm systems have been postponed as the funds are used to cover operating expenses in states like california
yet in the face of stories like that in april va secretary nicholson told the congress that no additional funds would be needed for fiscal year 2005
two weeks later the problem in their eyes got even bigger
the other body did the right thing in the interior bill
i would point out also that in my view some members of this house have paid a very high price for speaking out on behalf of our veterans
we saw earlier this year news stories which reported the fact that the majority caucus not only removed from his chairmanship but removed from the committee itself the member on the other side of the aisle who chaired the committee in charge of veterans funding because he had been too insistent in agreeing with those of us on this side of the aisle who kept insisting that we needed more funding for veterans health care
first of all one of the previous speakers tried to suggest that in fact the gentleman from new jersey mr smith xz4003802 had not been fired by the majority party caucus because he had been too willing to speak his own mind about the needs that he saw for veterans health care
the fact is that the democratic estimates that we offered were consistent and the bipartisan estimates that were offered by the gentleman from new jersey mr smith xz4003802 and the gentleman from illinois mr evans xz4001260 were consistently that we needed 25 billion in this account over the budget request
this 15 billion in this motion now brings us to the 25 billion that we have been saying all along was needed and that the gentleman from new jersey and the gentleman from illinois were saying all along was needed
in that sense it is very similar to the action of the administration in threatening to fire the government official who tried to tell congress what the true cost of the prescription drugs under medicare proposal was that the administration proposed last year
we have a narrow band of people those in the uniformed services of the united states who are being asked to sacrifice virtually everything while 90 percent of american society is making no sacrifice about the war
they are able to be comfortable in their homes
unfortunately we have not demonstrated that because of the shortfalls that we have seen in the veterans health care budget
balanced management must be restored in the public lands where wild horses roam
in an effort to achieve this balance congress gave the blm the authority to sell the excess
all this mr chairman has been said before and i am not going to go into it again except i will tell you that without this authority the only feasible option is leaving unadopted excess animals in contracted longterm holding facilities that we are now doing to the cost of at least 9 million a year
the loss of this new tool in selling would only mean that priority funding will keep going to care for and feed unadoptable animals instead of managing the number on the range and in balance with the demands of our other resources
i would hope mr chairman that my colleagues would see the wisdom in turning back this probably wellintended but misdirected amendment
in fact it would have no effect on any currently permitted uses of blending
it will affect our tourism our shellfish in coastal states around the country
mr chairman our communities are on the front lines in their attempts to meet the requirements of the clean water act
the funding levels in this bill reflect almost a half billion dollars in cuts to the clean water state revolving fund over the past two years
he is truly a champion in our quest for clean water and should be commended for his work protecting the great lakes
he is also a champion for clean water and a leader in our quest to provide assistance to local communities for their treatment systems
compliance with this provision would require forest service personnel field visits to numerous locations where road contracts are in effect to determine if or when road construction has begun
therefore determining the construction status of roads in the tongass would take considerable effort on the part of the forest service
this new substantial duty makes this amendment legislative in nature
appropriations without authorizations or that exceed authorized levels violate house rule xxi clause 2 this amendment enforces this rule by not allowing moneys to be spent for 10 specified programs within the committee on resources sole jurisdiction which are not authorized to be funded in fiscal year 2006 until the committee on resources authorizes them
the money remains in the bill but can not be obligated by the agencies until the authorizing committee authorizes them to do so
because the interior appropriations bill often combines both authorized and unauthorized programs in a single number such as funding for survey activities of the us geological survey the amendment assures that these programs which are authorized by fiscal year 2006 their funding can not continue
for those programs which are authorized but the amount appropriated exceeds the authorized level such as in the case for the council on environmental quality then the amendment restricts the funding to the authorized level
the purpose of this amendment is to give us the ability to go back and authorize a number of these programs that have not been authorized for years and in some cases in excess of a dozen years
one of the major problems that we have is the committee on appropriations gets in the position of having to continue to appropriate money on these unauthorized programs because they are important programs
but in this case what we are talking about is 53 billion that is being appropriated
i believe that the taxpayer demands that we do our job in authorizing these programs and make sure that the public is getting their money s worth out of these different programs
the gentleman from north carolina mr taylor xz4003981 and the gentleman from washington mr dicks xz4001090 have worked with us on a number of different things that are in this bill over the past year
but i would urge the chair to rule the amendment in order because what i am trying to do is strip out and put fencing around appropriations for unauthorized programs
i urge the chairman to rule the amendment in order
mr chairman i rise today in opposition to the rahall amendment
in restricting the ability of the bureau of land management blm to sell wild horses and burros under the wild horse and burro act of 1971 we are also restricting opportunities for responsible owners or groups to purchase horses that might have otherwise been sentenced to spend their lives in holding facilities or to starve on our rangelands
mr chairman i represent a district in nevada a state that is home to more wild horses than all other states combined
although i agree that wild horses are a symbol of the american west i also believe that it is the responsibility of congress to ensure that these animals are managed protected and controlled in an effective manner
it is a fact that the current number of wild horses in the nation greatly exceeds the ability of the blm or the land to handle these animals
we must work to maintain responsible and humane alternatives such as sale authority in order to ensure that these animals are properly cared for
our wild horses are already competing for scarce sources of food and water on rangelands in arid states like nevada causing many of them to waste into skin and bones
i believe that some of these horses should be allowed to be sold to good homes where they can receive proper nourishment and veterinary care as opposed to competing for little food and water in the wild or being held in longterm holding pens
part of that heritage are the herds of wild horses direct descendants of animals that came here with early explorers and missionaries which still roam the ranges in parts of the american west
in 1971 congress formally protected these wild horses and mandated that they could not be sold or processed into commercial products in effect slaughtered
all of that changed as a result of a rider tucked away in the dead of night in the massive omnibus appropriations bill enacted last december
so far this year 41 wild horses that we know of have been sent to one of the three foreignowned slaughterhouses in this country
moreover the blm has estimated that 8 400 horses need to be sold to comply with the recent change in the law
so their meat can end up on menus in france belgium and japan where it is considered a delicacy
we do not allow the commercial sale of horse flesh in this country for human consumption but we are exporting horse meat for that purpose abroad
they see in this issue the pioneering spirit and the ideals of freedom and the current policy has created disillusionment with many over how their government works and what their elected leaders stand for
from florida stacey wrote knowing that the horses wo nt be there for my kids has made me feel sad hurt and angry at our government a former west virginian named valerie who now resides in nevada wrote i and our friends have enjoyed going on to the desert to see wild horses roaming free jeremy from oregon wrote your support will help to restore the public s confidence by assuring us that congress operates under the principles of for the people and by the people we must restore the people s faith
yet his reward was to end his life in a japanese slaughterhouse
ferdinand was not a wild horse true from the american plain but the issue is one in the same
as children many of us recall reading the compelling story in the book misty of chincoteague what type of message would we be sending today s youth if misty was rounded up and sent to be slaughtered
in conclusion mr chairman the gentleman from kentucky has just touched upon a very important point and that is that there are alternatives available to the outright slaughter adoption and euthanization
in regard to what the gentleman from nevada said that blm has recently done what blm has proposed in the last day or two in an effort to head off the successful passage of this amendment is illegal under the change in law that was made by the omnibus appropriation bill last year
and i would say to the distinguished chairman of the subcommittee in defense of the gentleman from california mr pombo xz4003220 and myself on the authorizing committee this change was made in an appropriation bill not in an authorization bill
therefore it is incumbent the change or reversal be done in an appropriation measure
190 i was traveling with the president in wisconsin
mr chairman i am very pleased to offer this amendment along with my colleagues because the epa s proposed guidance would hurt water treatment practices already in place in my home state of florida
there is a rumor as has just been expressed by my friend from tennessee that our amendment would cost upwards of 200 billion in added costs to cities
over the years we in congress and those in state governments have created a variety of methods to help control animal populations whether it is placing a species under the protection of the endangered species act when the numbers are dwindling or allowing increasing hunting for various species when the numbers of the species are too great
in order to be good stewards of our public lands these animals must be managed and the only way to manage these herds is to take some of these animals off the range
this amendment would ensure that the environmental protection agency could not use funds in this legislation to accept consider or rely on studies from outside parties that intentionally expose human beings to pesticides
according to epa administrator stephen johnson back in 2001 epa believes that we have a more than sufficient database through use of animal studies to make licensing decisions that meet the standard to protect the health of the public without using human studies
right now the united states environmental protection agency the agency in charge of protecting public health from environmental toxins is encouraging industry to use human beings as guinea pigs
what may be the greatest offense yet is that the epa is conducting and engaging in these studies with no binding safeguards to make sure these tests protect public health
not only are there no binding safeguards for epa conducted studies but many of the outside studies which the epa accepts fail to meet minimum international standards established in the nuremberg code and in the helsinki declaration of the world medical association
our amendment is critical because in the absence of binding standards at epa the pesticides industry has increased its use of human testing studies and putting more humans at risk for what are frequently statistically invalid studies
the epa needs to have binding safeguards in place and we need to have information about how a better understanding of how dangerous and toxic these pesticides are for our children
currently clean water rules say during major wet weather events sewage treatment plants are allowed to combine the filtered but untreated human sewage with fully treated waste water before discharge in a process known as blending when no other feasible alternative exists
we do not want human waste in the water we drink and swim in
as a step in the right direction vote yes on the bipartisan stupakshawpallonemiller amendment
groups weighing in against epa s sewage proposal american littoral society american public health association american shore and beach preservation assoc american rivers children s environmental health network citizens campaign for the environment clean ocean action clean water action coast alliance east coast shellfish growers association earthjustice us conference of catholic bishops environmental integrity project and coalition on the environment and jewish life
the short answer is no my amendment would not change the existing requirements for cso communities which are outlined in the 1994 cso policy and were incorporated in the cwa in 2000
the proposed policy would undercut those communities investing in longterm solutions that are protective of public health the environment and downstream economies
given the heavy load of viruses parasites bacteria toxic chemicals and other contaminants in sewage it is critical that sewage treatment plants strive to achieve full treatment not just discharge poorly treated sewage because it is cheaper to do so
i want to thank the gentleman from tennessee mr duncan xz4001160 also for his work in this area along with the gentleman from washington mr dicks xz4001090 and the members on our side
we all agree in this appropriation process that that is not the way congress ought to go about doing its business and worse yet that legislation overturned decades indeed generations of congressional policy
now we can argue the substance and the differences as to whether this is economically feasible and right and whether this is humane or not but the fact of the matter is it was surreptitiously snuck in it ought not to have happened i believe it violates policy for more than a generation and 30 to 40 years of congressional intent
mr speaker i ask unanimous consent that during further consideration of hr 2361 in the committee of the whole pursuant to house resolution 287 no further amendment to the bill may be offered except pro forma amendments offered at any point in the reading by the chairman or ranking minority member on the committee on appropriations or their designees for the purpose of debate amendments printed in the record and numbered 3 6 8 11 13 and 17 amendments printed in the record and numbered 1 4 5 and 14 which shall be debatable for 20 minutes an amendment by the gentleman from florida mr hastings xz4001702 regarding environmental justice which shall be debatable for 20 minutes an amendment by the gentleman from wisconsin mr obey xz4003000 regarding a 500 million increase in clean water state revolving fund and tax matters an amendment by the gentleman from wisconsin mr obey xz4003000 regarding a 100 million increase in clean water state revolving fund which shall be debatable for 20 minutes an amendment by the gentleman from ohio mr gillmor xz4001500 regarding state and tribal assistance grants an amendment by the gentleman from ohio mr chabot xz4000710 or the gentleman from new jersey mr andrews xz4000080 regarding the tongass national forest which shall be debatable for 20 minutes an amendment by the gentleman from california mr pombo xz4003220 regarding making spending on certain accounts subject to authorization an amendment by the gentlewoman from california ms solis xz4003840 regarding intentional dosing an amendment by the gentleman from wisconsin mr obey xz4003000 to amendment no
each such amendment may be offered only by the member named in this request or a designee or the member who caused it to be printed in the record or a designee shall be considered as read shall not be subject to amendment except as specified and except that the chairman and ranking minority member of the committee on appropriations and the subcommittee on interior environment and related agencies each may offer one pro forma amendment for the purpose of debate and shall not be subject to a demand for division of the question in the house or in the committee of the whole
an amendment shall be considered to fit the description stated in this request if it addresses in whole or in part the object described
mr chairman i move to strike the last word for the purposes of engaging in a colloquy with the gentleman from oklahoma mr cole xz4000770
mr chairman i ask unanimous consent that the bill through page 128 line 12 be considered as read printed in the record and open to amendment at any point
mr chairman i rise to claim the time in opposition to the amendment and i yield myself such time as i may consume
mr chairman this issue is about the proper management of wildlife and public lands and the committee on appropriations is in charge of trying to adequately fund the united states agencies
we in the committee on appropriations have a situation where wild horses and burros cost the taxpayers 40 million annually
there are currently 24 000 wild horses and burros that are kept in shortterm or longterm either way holding facilities
they are being housed in these shortterm facilities and that is costing 20 million and they are living there until they die
mr chairman i rise in opposition to the gentleman s amendment
there are 435 members in the house and we have 100 over in the senate
because of that we have cut many things and had a very difficult time in doing it
based on our review of all of the information received we have no intention of finalizing the blending policy as proposed in november 2003
mr speaker i rise in opposition to the motion to recommit and i wish we did not have to have a rollcall vote
i know that the error that was made is being taken care of in this legislation in 2005 with 15 billion and in 2006 with another 15 billion to make the entire 3 billion
we all have relatives who served in world war ii and we know they saved this world with their dedication
we know also how much our other veterans give to this country those who fought in subsequent wars right up through the current time with our own children fighting in iraq
so all of us want to provide the materials and the health care benefits for our veterans and this amendment will be one of the steps in providing that
it has become more and more difficult to keep and create jobs and small businesses here in america
and when we look around at what the world is doing unless we change the environment here in america we are going to become a thirdrate economy
over the last generation starting in the 1960s congress has created barriers to keeping and creating jobs
in june 2002 a small business owner from baltimore maryland testified before the regulatory reform and oversight subcommittee of the committee on small business on how this particular epa reporting rule causes harm to her business
her small business specializes in printing small quantities of custom glass and ceramic ware for special occasions
some of nancy s work can even be found in the house gift shop and but because of the epa s toxics release inventory lead rule nancy s business is forced to compile daily records on how much color is used for the mugs because the color contains a very small amount of lead
i hope that we can work together with the gentleman from north carolina chairman taylor in the conference report to try to remove some of these unnecessary regulations
so in conclusion we must not move forward with our government to implement regulatory burdens like this on the american public because it drives jobs overseas it increases the trade deficit it reduces the federal revenue and it moves us toward a thirdrate economy
mr chairman i rise in opposition to this amendment and i certainly am one who is not in favor of the slaughtering of wild horses but i am also as a fiscal conservative who is concerned about what happens along the way because we are looking at a price of somewhere on the order of 20 million a year to take care of the horses that nobody wants to adopt right now
there are some 37 000 wild horses and burros roaming on blm managed lands in 10 western states
in the few seconds i have left i want to show my colleagues this photo
this cage was put over this grass and this is what the wild horses have done all around it in terms of what happens in a fairly wet area
what we need to do is if there is a problem with someone violating the law we need to put the criminal penalties back in so they can be prosecuted but the blm have said they will not issue any contracts that will allow for any slaughter
mr speaker i thank the chairman of the subcommittee on interior environment and related agencies of the committee on appropriations for calling for this motion to instruct conferees and i rise in support of that motion and i thank him for his hard work and support on this issue
it is our best determination that the 15 billion figure will provide us the funds that we need to complete this fiscal year the 2005 fiscal year and the funds that are not utilized in 2005 will be available in 2006
i might add we have had estimates from the veterans service organizations in each of the 6 years that i have been chairman responsible for the appropriations for veterans affairs
by the way we have increased this veterans administration budget each year in the neighborhood of double digits
mr speaker i just wanted to come to the floor and say the gentleman from washington is correct all members of this body that i know republicans and democrats totally stand behind our veterans in giving them resources and that is the spirit with which we should approach this debate
the va in my area is still not accountable enough but we need this money
to allege or assert in any way that the house republican leadership removed the gentleman from new jersey let me tell members i was there
while i am not going to say what was said in the meeting of the steering committee we hired the gentleman from indiana
for all of the right reasons we hired the gentleman from indiana as the chairman of the committee on veterans affairs because of what he is doing and we need to do in terms of reforms and accountability at the va
the va should have been moving money around 10 years ago to reform to close the facilities they do not need open new facilities even contract so people can go to the best health care provider in their community to receive health care
mr chairman i want to thank the gentleman for yielding me time very much and as he so aptly stated we would not be here today except for the action of senator conrad burns in the last omnibus bill
what this motion and amendment that we are proposing today is really about it is not so much about a few wild mustangs and burros only 31 000 remaining in the wild western grazing lands
but what this is really about it is about the fact that we have 18 000 permits issued by the bureau of land management to ranchers in the west on 214 million acres of land of which these ranchers are paying less than six cents per acre per year
the question becomes is it in the heritage of america to protect the few remaining wild mustangs and burros
i can tell my colleagues i have a lot of cattle ranchers in my district in kentucky and they are in tennessee and florida and texas and alabama and mississippi and louisiana and all around this country and all of them pay a lot more than six cents per acre per year for these permits and for land
i might also add that these 18 000 permits of ranchers on these grazing lands in the west provide only 2 percent of the cows slaughtered in america and we all like a good steak
we want to continue slaughtering cows for steaks because they are raised for that purpose but we also have a responsibility to protect wild mustangs and burros who are native to this country who have been protected in this country
they simply lost that protection because of a 4 000 page omnibus bill and none of us was aware that the burns amendment was in it
even though they may put in a contract that a horse can not be taken to slaughter they have no recourse if someone does it
we have companies like ford motor company taking in horses now and we have over 214 entities out in the country doing it
but this is a wellintended amendment and it would reintroduce the policy that has been the accepted policy in the us for 37 years
instead of turning back the clock and allowing sewage to flow freely in our rivers we must increase our investment in upgrading wastewater treatment plants
i urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting this important amendment
mr chairman today i will vote in support of the amendment to the fy06 interior appropriations bill offered by mr rahall that will prevent the secretary of the interior from expending funds to conduct sales of wild horses for the next fiscal year
initially let me indicate that i believe the process by which wild freeroaming horse and burro act was amended with language inserted in an omnibus appropriations act without any public hearings or comment was extremely inappropriate and that fact alone is grounds for congress to revisit this issue
i do not believe however that these wild horses should end up in slaughterhouses
the fact that fortyone wild horses were recently slaughtered at a foreignowned processing facility and an additional fiftytwo barely escaped the same fate clearly demonstrates that the current sale program is flawed despite blm efforts to implement safeguards and pursue a measured approach in administering the sale authority
in the meantime because i believe that a oneyear moratorium on blm s sale authority for wild horses is needed to allow this debate i offer my support to the rahall amendment
in 2004 approximately 263 million americans and people throughout the world visited our nation s 388 national parks memorials and national monuments
mr chairman i think that when american families and those from throughout the world visit our wonderful treasures across the united states that it would be nice if the souvenirs that they take home with them were actually made in our country
i believe that it is patriotic that our souvenirs that we bring home from our national treasures in fact be made by american workers
the amendment before us would require that all souvenir products sold in america s national park system prospectively be made in america
mr chairman i rise tonight in strong support of the stupak amendment to the interior appropriations bill
in fact just this morning as we have heard the epa recognized just how bad an idea it was and announced that it was reconsidering its proposal
i urge my colleagues to vote in favor of the amendment and ensure that the epa does not change its mind again and attempt to impose an imprudent sewage blending policy on america at some point in the future
madam speaker i rise in opposition to hr 3283 concerning trade with china
i join with millions of american workers in saying no to this illconceived republican gift to the chinese government
products made in china are cheap through the exploitation of the workforce
i support american workers in saying let s combat china s unfair trade practices by providing us with the tools to save american jobs
it is an insult to american workers that in the same week that congress is considering cafta it is bringing forth a weak china trade compromise bill
i rise in strong support of hr 3283 the united states trade rights enforcement act
madam speaker this bill goes to the heart of what we know is true in south carolina china cheats
i thank president bush and the administration for stepping up their trade enforcements this year and i especially commend them for expediting the implementation of the chinese textile safeguards to combat recent surges in exports to our market but when it comes to china more must be done
the united states trade rights enforcement act would provide the necessary tools to ensure china meets the trade obligations it has agreed to in order to become a member of the wto
in addition it holds in this legislation that china will be accountable
but what it is is just another cynical attempt to buy what is very well documented in this nation s profree trade procafta media very well documented in the media this is just another cynical attempt to buy votes on cafta among other cynical attempts to buy votes on cafta
this fails as the gentleman from maryland mr cardin xz4000640 said as the gentleman from new jersey members of congress should be troubled that this bill has been introduced only in order to push through another trade priority
we should not have to approve a jobkilling trade deal with central america in order to get the chance to vote on a toothless china bill
i will say that again we should not have to approve a jobkilling trade deal with central america in order to get a chance to vote on this toothless china bill
in the past 5 years our government has refused to enforce domestic trade laws with regard to china failed to take advantage of wto mechanisms to challenge china s violations of international trade rules balked at taking any concrete action on china s manipulation of its currency what i hear from my manufacturers in akron in lorain and in elyria almost every week
i would like to have a debate with the gentleman from pennsylvania mr english xz4001230 in regards to problems of double counting
in regard to currency manipulation by china an issue that many of us have talked about on this floor what does this bill do it sets up another study by the treasury department
in regard to the use of safeguards no action in this bill
international property violations no action in this bill
in regards to the loophole chinese exporters have to avoid paying duties it provides a temporary 3year provision rather than permanently fixing the action
despite what the gentleman from pennsylvania said there is no new money in this bill in order to enforce our laws
it would allow action to be taken in regards to the safeguards that we have negotiated with china on the wto accession agreement
it would provide permanent relief in regards to the loophole that chinese exporters are currently using to avoid duties
the bottom line is this legislation actually creates more problems in industry being able to bring antidumping or countervailing duty actions and we should not be making it more difficult
i listened to the gentleman from pennsylvania mr english xz4001230 talk about this being the key trade vote of the year and i think we should understand that the committee on rules is responsible to make sure that we have a fair and open debate by the manner in which they propose rules
there has never been an opportunity to offer a single amendment to this bill anywhere along the process whether in the subcommittee the full committee or here on the floor
no action is taken in this legislation in that regard
nothing is done in this bill to bring action against china for currency manipulation
no action is provided in this bill against china in regards to their infringement of intellectual property
nothing is done in this legislation for action against china in regards to the flooding of markets
there is nothing new in this bill
then my friends talked about other issues that are not in this bill
the provision that we have in our legislation on china currency is to direct that a claim be brought within the wto not inconsistent with the wto so that we would use the dispute settlement resolution process within the wto which is certainly within the rights that we have
we did business in over 100 countries including countries like china
but for china to successfully and fairly participate in the global marketplace they must live up to their trade obligations
this bill is a strong tool to make sure china abides by the rules of free trade and puts us businesses in a competitive position to take advantage of those opportunities
trade issues is an interest but i do not know the ins and outs but i want to speak as someone who is not on the committee that sees it in a little different way
mr speaker the vote that we are voting on today when we talk about amendments this is the same exact bill that we voted on yesterday in suspension
are there some jobs in some sectors that are lost
and that is where the administration and republicans and democrats need to come together to try and help those sectors that have lost jobs because in other sectors jobs have increased and those presidents like many members on the floor feel that the overall policy is good
if you look at northern ireland you look at the middle east look back when jimmy carter and president clinton started peace talks in the middle east
when i was in hanoi to the minister i said why will you not get involved with president clinton and trade in vietnam and he pointed at thousands of bicycles outside his window and he said congressman i am a communist
my colleagues who have legitimate concerns especially in their own districts and we need to work those things out but this is an important bill and i ask my colleagues to support the rule and the bill
mr speaker the argument from the other side of the aisle that this issue is somehow tied to cafta i think is particularly striking and particularly odd because the underlying bill that we are considering today should be on the consent calendar it should not be controversial with the bulk of people in this congress who care about the american economy
mr speaker today the house has the opportunity to vote on a bill that will take the largest step toward strengthening our trade remedy laws in over 15 years
this bill is a comprehensive approach towards eliminating many of the inequities that exist in our trading relationships particularly our bilateral uschina trade relationship
right now a major tool in our arsenal is unavailable in dealing with a nonmarket economy or communist countries
it is ridiculous that when we find subsidies in france japan brazil or taiwan we can use countervailing duties to strip the benefits of those subsidies but we can not do so if we find the same subsidies in china or vietnam
by replacing current bonds that are used by new shippers in antidumping cases with cash deposits we are dealing with one of the biggest loopholes
mr speaker passage of this legislation is essential for the economic future of the next generation for the future of goodpaying jobs in places like northwestern pennsylvania where we make things for a living
the democrats bill is actually weaker than our bill because it ignores a recommendation by the gao to authorize the commerce department to use thirdcountry information in countervailing duty cases against china consistent with china s wto accession commitment
they have simply misread this legislation and done it in an egregious way
madam speaker i yield 1 minute to the distinguished gentleman from michigan mr rogers xz4003421 one of the key players in developing this legislation
madam speaker i would like in this closing minute to cut through the fog of process arguments and weird alice in wonderland illusions to linkage to other trade agreements
this is important legislation and it is important in itself and it deals directly with key problems that we are having in our trade relations particularly with china
let me say i do not look particularly becoming in a fig leaf and the gentleman from new jersey who is hanging his hat on the fig leaf that has been introduced by the other side which is not taken seriously by anyone does not look particularly becoming hanging back behind that either
i would urge everyone who in this chamber is as concerned as i am about the problems of china trade to vote for this rule and to vote for this bill
they also voted against clarifying congress s opposition to efforts to water down our domestic trade law protections in the current wto rules negotiations
and finally they voted against requiring the treasury to clarify its definition of currency manipulation in the context of the very modest change that the chinese have now put forward
it is just that the minority in the committee on ways and means never had much interest in issues like cvd before
the rule underlying this debate is consistent with ways and means traditions sought and supported by both parties when they were in the majority
offering a fig leaf alternative a bill dropped in the same day that we announced the consensus we had worked forward is not enough
the truth was blurted out may i tell the members mr speaker today in the hill magazine in which it quoted a spokesman for the committee on ways and means democrats as saying the minority s near unified opposition to the bill stemmed as much from its role in the cafta battle as from the strength of its content this is all about cynicism
they would rather stop a significant first step in dealing with china if it inconveniences their strategy on cafta
in other words they are more worried about dealing with another trade agreement dealing with five countries whose combined economy is smaller than that of the czech republic than dealing with the real problem and the real threat in beijing
madam speaker i rise in opposition to hr 3283 on both process and policy grounds
first the bill limits our use of thirdparty data when investigating chinese subsidies in antidumping cases
the effect of this provision is to force us to use china s own data in these cases even though we ve learned time and again that china does not play fair in the global trade market
i rise in support of this bill and i am mystified by the opposition on the other side of the aisle
it appears that partisan politics trumps their interest in american manufacturers
under china s fixedexchange rate the us annual bilateral trade deficit accelerated since 2001 reaching 162 billion in 2004
meeting with businesses in my district the three main complaints i have heard from my district regarding china have been piracy of product the dumping of products on our market and the currency pegging issue
i say as one who opposed a trading agreement with china that this legislation brings the monitoring capacity necessary to understand what happens in international trade
simply stated madam speaker if you want to get in the game play by the rules
madam speaker i believe it is critical that we seek out abuses in existing agreements and reform such laws that are detrimental to us producers
in my northern california congressional district honey and honeybees play a critical role in pollinating many of our important export crops including almonds
because chinese new shippers are allowed to circumvent antidumping orders by posting bonds the honey industry in california and nationwide faces serious and continuing price declines making it difficult for honey producers to provide bees for pollination
madam speaker i rise today in opposition to hr 3283
the socalled united states trade rights enforcement act would provide little to no remedy for those in my district who are deeply concerned about the ever growing trade deficit with the peoples republic of china due to its longstanding illegal policy of currency manipulation
we should be debating this issue in great depth not the rather cursory discussion we are having today
we should be talking about why our trade deficit with china is now at 162 billion and continues to grow with no end in sight
and we should be talking about how jobs in our home states have been affected and what we can do to help american businesses who are struggling to export their goods to china
rather today the house is considering hr 3283 because of an agreement reached i presume to secure votes in favor of the seriously flawed dominican republiccentral american free trade agreement drcafta
i have heard from a number of constituents in my district who are deeply concerned about these issues
madam speaker today i stand with the people in my district who are affected by china s currency manipulation and our soaring trade deficit
however i will vote against hr 3283 and it is my hope that the congress will reevaluate this serious issue in a detailed fashion to actually address these important issues that have bipartisan support
madam speaker i rise in strong support of hr 3283
we can look at the history and the fact of the whole architecture of agreements that we have had with china memoranda of understanding concerns that members of congress from both sides of the aisle brought to this floor in order to try to manage united states trade with china
the us trade deficit with china keeps getting worse because labor costs in china are so much cheaper
we are giving away our jobs here and the central issue is the cheap labor in china
they are not going to amount to a hill of beans because the fact of the matter is that the us trade deficit in china will continue to grow it will approach 200 billion as long as the labor costs are cheaper
it has been refreshing in this sense that we have talked about the issues
in the last few days when it comes to cafta that is not what the administration or the republican majority have been doing
instead we have learned about a number of deals that have been cut one of them relating to dams and locks in return for a vote or if not in return that being taken into account if the vote was cast
and then there has been the same process regarding sugar in order to try to win some votes from people who object to the provisions on sugar
again they are not in the agreement
so while i very much disagree with the statements in almost every case made by the majority regarding cafta in a way they were talking about issues and they were not talking about bait being offered for people to cast their vote
i want to talk about what is really as i see it and my colleagues in so many cases see it as the overriding issue
i suggest that they be kept to the economic data in perspective
one estimate is that in terms of gdp the impact of cafta on the us would be less than onefifth of 1 percent
this is why central america dominican republic and cafta matter so much in terms of where trade is going
regarding the cafta countries we are now talking about countries in a region that has latin america the worst income distribution of any region in the world
there is a weak middle class in most of the countries
the headline was in latin america richpoor chasm stifles growth and i quote because of an abundance of natural resources and a large indigenous population latin american nations group up relying on raw materials cheap manual labor to exploit them and low government taxation
the system concentrated land ownership and wealth in a few hands deprived governments of money to spend on education and other incentives and essentially ordered the incentives for the elite to invest not in human capital or technology
and so in recent years we had agreements jordan cambodia which essentially said to countries look take steps to make sure that workers have their basic rights
we are not talking about the laws of the united states we are talking about the five core internationally recognized rights no child labor also no forced labor no discrimination in the workplace and also so importantly the rights of workers to associate and to organize
that standard is not used in any other part of the agreement whether it is intellectual properties or investments or tariffs or subsidies
there has been an effort to obscure what the reality is on the ground in central america but state department reports make it clear the ilo reports make it also very clear
in reality workers do not have the ability to exercise internationally recognized rights
in some cases all they have to do if they fire workers who want to form a union all they have to do is pay severance pay
in a special order that i took on some weeks ago i spelled out one example in el salvador
why is it important that workers in central america have their basic internationally recognized rights
in these countries with immense poverty in these countries with terrible maldistribution of income in these countries with weak middle classes if workers can not exercise their rights they are going to remain poor
and our companies and their workers are not going to have middles classes in central america that can buy their goods
this was also in the wall street journal i read a letter to the editor by rutilio martinez who is a professor in colorado and he was responding to an article about chavez in venezuela and he is very much opposed to the chavez regime
he concluded the rest of latin america from mexico to argentina should take notice what is happening in venezuela and do something to improve their horrible distribution of wealth otherwise soon there will be very many venezuelas in this povertyridden but resourcerich region a major threat to security in central american countries is terrible income distribution
there was talk about certain groups in central america opposing this agreement
i just urge everybody to listen also to bishops who are there with their flock in central america
in light of a recent visit to washington dc 2324 june 2004 by a delegation of six bishops representing the church in central america the bishops secretariat of central america and the chairman of domestic and international policy committees of the united states conference of bishops wish to express with one voice our observations and concerns about the uscentral american free trade agreement i quote from just one of their concerns
this is in subsection 3 many have claimed that cafta will lead to a significant increase in jobs
however these jobs could principally be in assembly plants maquilas which mainly employ women and which offer an unstable form of employment
without proper worker protections we know from our own experience that this type of employment will not foster authentic human development it is said by some defenders of this agreement that the problem is not in the laws it is enforcement
the record of this administration in terms of trying to bolster enforcement is abysmal
as i saw a few years ago in central america in the maquilas in three of the countries there are no rights of workers on the ground in reality
they are working for 75 cents an hour maybe a buck mostly young women in the maquilas many with children sole supporter of their children
as soon as they tried to have a voice in the workplace a voice at work that voice is kicked out is snuffed out by their discharge
let me just read quickly from an article that is going to be published in the sister city news dos pueblos the new yorktipitapa nicaragua sister city project dos pueblos is a nonprofit organization that began way back in 1987
while the minimum salary in 2003 covered 492 percent of the basic food basket 53 products identified as necessary to feed a family of four for a month the minimum pay in 2005 is only covering 26 percent of these costs so it is not a question of buying a cadillac it is a question of buying food
mr speaker it is tragic that this administration has handled trade and shattered the bipartisan foundation for trade that is so necessary that is so vital that a number of us have wanted to help reestablish in this country
now they are going to come here on this floor in just a few days and what they are apparently going to try to do once again instead of getting 250 to 300 votes on a truly bipartisan basis they are going to essentially headstrong i think headinthesand in terms of good trade policy see if they can squeeze out a victory by one or two votes
in closing the gentleman from ohio mr turner xz4004110 said at the very end that people supported morocco people supported jordan i did because in those countries the rights the internationally recognized rights of workers were in place so enforce your own laws there were laws to implement
that is not true in cafta
it is not true in central america
i am in favor of a cafta
if that continues to happen in latin america we are going to see more people voting with their feet or voting at the ballot box as they have been doing
they want a stake in globalization
in order to have that they have to have a voice in the workplace
i urge we defeat cafta as negotiated and return to the table which we can do and refinish this agreement in about a month
in that way we can proudly say we met the challenges of globalization in this case in the year 2005
mr speaker this bill before us in a word is a smoke screen and it has so little smoke let alone any fire that members can see straight through it
we should not be handling our relationships with china in that manipulative a way
number two as to the connection with cafta the gentleman from pennsylvania mr english xz4001230 was not in favor of cafta until there was an agreement to bring up his bill and then he said he was for cafta
for example there was discussion in the media about commitments that were made by this administration regarding pocketings and linings and that there had been an agreement reached with the cafta countries
i just saw an article from la nacion in costa rica about this alleged agreement on textiles and here is a quote from the minister the trade minister of costa rica
i am quoting it is not true that those consultations that negotiation has occurred and it is not at all true that we in costa rica and the rest of central america have sat down yet for that process of consultations so we need a full airing of cafta and of the china bill
we have in our substitute provisions that say let us have an avenue for action rather than simply more talk
it is an effort to say we are doing something when we are really not in order to give some people i guess an excuse to vote for another bill
last night the republican majority on the rules committee reported out a closed rule for hr 3283 a closed rule that only allows for 1 hour of debate and no amendments well except for the one amendment offered by the back room author of this bill in the first place the gentleman from california mr thomas xz4004010 the distinguished chairman of the committee on ways and means
then there was a amendment offered by the distinguished ranking member of the committee on ways and means the gentleman from new york mr rangel xz4003330 a comprehensive amendment that addresses the real problems facing america in its trade with china currency manipulation export surges barriers to us export of goods and services and the right of american private sector companies and workers to challenge china s agricultural and manufacturing subsidies
finally there was an amendment offered by the gentleman from maryland mr cardin xz4000640 which would have shut down the loopholes in the countervailing duties in the thomas bill
mr speaker i have sat in this chamber and heard over and over members on the other side of the aisle give 1minute speeches demanding that the senate have upordown votes on judicial nominations
the chinese government must be laughing with glee at the republican leadership s blatant abuse of power in their lockstep rejection of democratic debate
in fact when the thomas bill does take action it actually opens up more loopholes for china to exploit more ways for china to hide its subsidies and more opportunities for china to manipulate and falsify its trade and economic data
and china continues to engage in unfair trade practices with billions lost to chinese piracy of us intellectual property chinese subsidies for its manufacturers and chinese currency manipulation harming us exports
in fact if press reports are to be believed this bill is being brought to the floor today as ineffective as it is so members on the other side of the aisle can have some cover to vote for cafta later on today
i think one of the reasons why they are not being made in order is because the leadership on your side believes that in fact these amendments will actually carry the day
i would say to the gentleman from florida that just to make it clear that one of the reasons why so many of us voted against this bill yesterday one is because it does not have any teeth in it
we wanted something that had some teeth in it that was actually going to send china the message we want to be sending
at least we should be given the chance to let the majority in this house work its will
the substitute was offered in the committee on rules last night but was blocked on a straight partyline vote
mr speaker i rise tonight in strong opposition to cafta
for almost 30 years i worked at great northern paper company in east millinocket maine where my father worked for 43 years my grandfather before him for 40 years
and that is the way it is in a lot of mill towns in maine and all across the country
two days after i was sworn in as a member of congress in january of 2003 i learned that the mill where i worked filed bankruptcy and was shutting its doors
in maine alone since 1998 and to late 2004 the federal government had documented 11 724 workers who lost their job due to trade
the number serves to demonstrate yet again what people in maine already know through our own tough experience
well i can say my first year in congress we had labor market areas in maine whose unemployment rate was over 35 percent
in recent days the administration authorized house leadership to secure votes with whatever is at hand from extra funding as you heard earlier for individual members districts in the highway projects and energy bill to the still incomplete appropriations bills
in fact it makes it harder to stop unfair chinese trade practices
leadership held open a 15minute vote for 3 hours while they twisted arms in order to ensure passage
is this in the best interest of our nation
and why must these votes always happen in the dark of night
americans should wonder what kind of witchcraft is being passed on the house floor as we consider cafta in the dead of night
the administration may want this deal to pass as quickly as possible before more opposition mounts but the people who have suffered the most under our trade policies including many of my neighbors my coworkers and my family and many of the good people in maine have earned the right to ask a simple question about what a new trade deal will mean to their families and get some real answers before we move forward
the mill in millinocket the great northern paper company s other mill did the same thing
we heard earlier that in some of these cafta countries labor is less than 2 a day
the only way we are going to be a secure country the only way we are going to be able to be respected among other nations like we have in the past is to make sure that we have a strong economy
when we look at what happened during world war ii what made this country the greatest country in the world with our greatest generation was the ability for americans back home to work in our manufacturing industry to work hand in hand
we must vote this cafta deal down regardless of what time in the morning it comes up and regardless of how long the leadership holds the vote open
they have significantly lower wages sometimes slave wages in their plants
their steel enjoys millions of dollars in government subsidies
china limits foreign participation in the wireless market by imposing severe regulatory requirements on telecommunications imports
the lack of intellectual property rights enforcement has resulted in epidemic levels of counterfeiting and piracy causing serious harm to us businesses
consideration of this bill is an important part of what we need to be doing in an extensive selection of things to hit back on china
madam speaker this legislation in front of us today as it relates to china is about one thing and one thing only providing political cover for those who are reluctant to embrace cafta
the majority realizes if they simply put cafta on the floor they do not have even the muscle in this instance to put this legislation through
we are offering a veneer to the american people a ruse as it relates to the problems we are having with our trade practices in china
currency manipulation in this legislation no action
dealing with chinese trade barriers in this legislation no action
i think that if they put a study in front of this house we all ought to take a test on it in 2 years
imagine in a serious issue like this we are going to ask for studies
how much more emphasis can we put on that issue in this institution
we have a highly regarded regular order in this institution of the responsibilities of the committee on ways and means the committee that many members of this institution desire to be on
you have hearings with a respected tradition in this house of representatives for the committee on ways and means
they want to know in your district where they stand
the resulting imbalance is destroying family wage production jobs here in this united states
it was 16 billion in the month of may alone
human rights abuses continue to be a problem in china
many factories in china still utilize child and prison labor
we can not even get in to see what is going on in those factories
china has only made a minor change in disconnecting its currency from the dollar
just today 9 30 this morning i can report to the congress of the united states in new jersey where the us chamber of commerce has said we are going to gain all of these jobs from this trade we are going to gain all of these jobs from cafta
mr speaker i am very disturbed that the gentleman from pennsylvania the last speaker has introduced partisanship in this
we gave it away in the free china deal
we gave up article i section 8 of the constitution what we learn in the eighth grade commerce belongs in the house of representatives not on the president s desk
and second of all the jobs that we have gained and the jobs that we have lost in our dealings with china make very interesting reading because we have lost highwage jobs and we have gained those jobs that pay far less
madam speaker i rise in strong opposition to this legislation
in reality this bill which appeared out of the blue on the house floor as a suspension bill is part of a deal made with several members in return for a few votes on cafta
madam speaker in addition to the irony of the protectionist flavor of this bill let me say that we should be careful what we demand of the chinese government
as was pointed out in the wall street journal recently with the yuan tied to several foreign currencies and the value of the dollar dropping china could be less inclined to purchase dollars as a way of keeping the yuan down
fewer treasury bond purchases by china in turn would drive bond prices down and boost yields which subsequently would cause borrowing costs for residential and some corporate customers to increase
this is not an argument for the status quo however but rather an observation that there are often unforeseen consequences when we demand that foreign governments manipulate their currency to us advantage at the very least american consumers will feel the strengthening of the yuan in the form of higher us retail prices
in conclusion i strongly oppose this illconsidered and potentially destructive bill and i hope my colleagues will join me in rejecting it
i could spend my time tonight going into the whats and the whereases and the whatfors but i think it might be more fruitful to discuss this in the broader perspective perspective first of all involving the track we are on relative to our trade agreements and our nation s economy
then secondly a particular for instance in terms of where this is just more of the same in terms of our loss of jobs loss of economic opportunity here at home and then finally to discuss the process a process that i think raises serious questions about this trade agreement
we have been on a track of these trade deals part of our participation in the global economy for some years now
but this commentator contrasted the united states where it is not just local interests that are represented by the big multinational corporations based in this country it may be a us corporation but may be jobs all across the world
they tell us that our trade deficit the amount we buy more than we sell has never been greater in the history of our country
a friend of mine says there is not a trade deal ever negotiated that our silkshirted ivy leagueeducated negotiators could not lose in half an hour
you certainly seem to think there might be truth in that when you look at the job loss that has just wrecked the economies of important parts of our country and led us to a net position again where we are buying more than we are selling to a dimension never before seen in the history of the united states
we had growing up when i was a kid in school we thought of ourselves as north dakota bread basket to the world
we were very proud of the role we played in feeding the world
we have got about 94 percent of their wheat market just to reference a commodity important in north dakota
and i represent people third generation fourth generation on the land families that broke the prairie under the homestead act to begin their family s farming experience and now making a go of it because they raise sugar beets in the red river valley
this entire sugar industry from the red river valley sugar beet growers from the workers in the plants today to the sugar cane growers down in the south central and southeastern part of country to the sugar beet growers out in the northwestern united states significant areas of the country broadly affected by the threat to sugar
because what is at stake in cafta is opening up the border for yet an additional allotment for sugar to come pouring in from the cafta countries countries whose labor wages have no relation to ours whose environmental protections in their plants are no relation to ours whose costs are often subsidized to get them down to global dump price
and i have seen the context of the cafta debate argument that what the united states needs is to resort to the global dump price at the end of domestic production of sugar in this country
and when it comes to sugar believe you me just look right across the opinion of the united sugar industry in this country
they believe it is the beginning of an end to domestic production of sugar in this country
what that means in the red river valley we are talking fargo grand forks north dakota not large places is a direct and indirect economic impact of up to 2 to 3 billion direct jobs 2 500 indirect jobs maybe 30 000 in the area i represent
just another chapter in this global trade path we are on that has cost us so much and brought us the deepest deficit in the history of the country
it was negotiated in the spring of 2004 and concluded in late spring early summer
if this was such a point of pride for our trade negotiators who brought this agreement home why in the world did president bush not as an achievement of his administration put it front and center in the election campaign and run it up to congress for a vote
why did they keep cafta like a dark family secret in the back room out of the way out of public view after the election
because the american people understand that we have the deepest trade deficit in the history of the country
and that is why beginning this last week before the august recess the majority the majority who have dictated so much in terms of vote outcomes did not know whether they have the votes to pass cafta
and so what are we hearing in these final hours before the cafta vote
cafta gives us a deeper trade imbalance in my view with cafta countries
there is a highway bill in conference committee
one of the things each and every member represents is thousands and thousands of miles of roads back in their home districts
it is very important for each of us republican and democrat alike from every corner of the country that we get our local needs attended to in the highway bill
this trade deal so important for american jobs is being bartered for highway projects in farflung congressional districts
now we are hearing that it is going to be brought up for a vote late at night in the early morning hours of the last minutes before we break for august recess
i fully expect that you might see this up for a vote between 2 and 3 in the morning maybe or 4 and 5 in the morning if they have not corralled the votes before we leave town
i was as a freshman in a democrat majority
we have been in the minority for more than 10 years
and i believe we are in the minority in part because our leaders thought there were times when we had to vote for the majority instead of voting for those who sent us here
mr speaker house resolution 387 is a closed rule that provides 1 hour of debate in the house equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the committee on ways and means
the rule waives all points of order against consideration of the bill and provides that the amendment in the nature of a substitute printed in the committee on rules report accompanying the resolution shall be considered as adopted
mr speaker i rise today in support of this rule and the underlying bill hr 3283 the united states trade rights enforcement act
in 2001 china joined the world trade organization by notifying the wto they had formally ratified the wto agreements
however a report released in december of 2004 by the us trade representative stated that while china has worked hard to comply with its wto commitments they have not always been satisfactory
major areas of concern identified in the report included intellectual property rights agricultural services industrial policies trading rights and distribution and transparency of trade laws
the system would require that the president issue semiannual reports to congress on china s progress in meeting these commitments
hr 3283 would apply us countervailing duty law to exports from nonmarket economies such as china to give our manufacturers the tools they need here in america to compete with nonmarket economies in those countries
the bill also tightens the rules on antidumping duties by requiring cash deposits and suspending for 3 years the availability of bonds for new shippers in antidumping cases in order to prevent those shippers from defaulting on their obligations
mr speaker in today s global marketplace it is vital that trade obligations be enforced and that our manufacturers and producers be allowed to fairly compete in our markets here at home and those abroad
we have also managed to find time this week to pass the first comprehensive postal reform in years
so for the second day we will have an opportunity to devote the time and resources to debate the need for our country to enforce trade agreements with china to keep our commitments that have been negotiated and passed in the congress to make sure that the resources are in the department i am happy to yield mr speaker 5 minutes to the gentleman from indiana mr souder xz4003850 another leader on this issue
application of us countervailing duty law to exports from nonmarket economies is more than an empty gesture 6 million per year in additional money to ustr beyond the president s request up to 45 million and earmarked for the general counsel office of monitoring and compliance the suspension for 3 years of bonding authority increased teeth increased enforcement increased compliance to make the chinese follow the law and agreements that we have already signed and agreed to
we are passing out major postal reform for the first time in years a highway bill that has been in the making for over 2 congresses now an energy conference report that has also been in the making for over 2 congresses now the opportunity to have at least one and perhaps as many as three appropriations conference reports behind us as we enter the august district work period and a central american free trade agreement as well as a bill that gets tough with china that finally holds our administration s feet and the feet of either party s feet to the fire and requires that they monitor and enforce the existing trade agreements that have been enacted by this congress
the suspension for 3 years of the availability of bonds for new shippers in antidumping cases
that is a reflection of what is going on in the countryside that there are genuine fears out there about currency manipulation
we have debated it now this is the second day first on the suspension calendar admittedly with the belief that it would garner twothirds support from this chamber in the belief that everyone would share in the need to crack down on chinese abuse of trade agreements that everyone would agree that we need to put as many tools in the tool kit as possible to enforce and monitor their compliance to bring about that transparency so that the world community can see what is going on can see where there are distortions can see where there is manipulation and now it is back today for a straight upordown vote

i think it is bad policy and bad politics for our foreign policy and certainly our trade policy to be used in an effort to solicit votes or to be done in a partisan way to see who won and who lost
there is a substantial difference between the bills that the democrats put in which certainly deals with the provisions that are in the bill before us today but also it prevents the loopholes that are in that bill and provides for other considerations that would make this a better bill and improve our relationship with china
we hope that a vote against this bill will send a message to democrats and republicans not to use the procedures of the house for political purposes to not put controversial bills on the suspension calendar and to take them to the committee of jurisdiction where they belong so that they can be discussed debated and then brought to the floor in a bipartisan way so that we can look at it
the qualities that exist in the english bill we have been able to see some loopholes
what makes the other side believe that we democrats are not entitled to participate in the substantive nature of sensitive complex legislation
putting this on the suspension calendar in my opinion is an insult to members on both sides of the aisle and is an insult to those people who oversight what we do because the suspension calendar means that we never thought that they would ever have a problem with it and that is why we did not share what is in this bill
we have plenty of time to work in the committee on ways and means in dealing with this so that we can be proud that we do not have a rangel bill or an english bill or a republican bill or a democratic bill
but i do not know how many suspension bills they are going to bring in as an excuse to get members to say i got them to talk about china and therefore i am going to vote for cafta
what we should be doing is bringing these issues up in the committee that has jurisdiction and we are so proud of it and to make certain that the best we can is to have this as a bipartisan effort on both sides
so this is not the first time that the committees of jurisdiction have had to have members bypassed in terms of their input bypassed in terms of the ability to have amendments and bypassed in terms of saying that we have to find some way to find some bill that we can get bipartisanship on it
madam speaker i recently hosted roundtables with manufacturers in my district
as john hoskins of curtis screw in buffalo told me they have never been afraid to compete globally but this centuryold manufacturer can only compete globally if they can compete fairly and they note that some of their chinese competitors have much of the cost subsidized by the government
to put this in perspective he said the only way
as a longtime champion of fair trade and a lead cosponsor of this legislation i rise in strong support of the us trade rights enforcement act
when china was permitted to join the world trade organization in 2001 there was an implicit promise made to american businesses workers and consumers that we would get a fair deal in our trade relations with the chinese
yet in so many areas intellectual property rights currency valuation subsidies trade barriers you name it we see china failing to uphold its end of the bargain by ignoring international trade norms
i recently hosted roundtables with manufacturers in my district and whether it s currency manipulation or unfair subsidies it s clear that our local employers have long had enough of the way china cheats on trade
as john hoskins of curtis screw in buffalo told me they ve never been afraid to compete globally but this centuryold manufacturer can only compete globally if they can compete fairly and they note their chinese competitors have much of their costs subsidized by the government
i have always maintained that our products and our workers can compete anywhere with anyone in the world as long as that competition is fair
these are counterfeit parts made in china
we have the chance today for the first time to put a law enforcement trade officer in charge so that when they get up in the morning the first thing they do is work on how to stop china from doing exactly this and stealing jobs from our economy
there is a town in china 80 percent of the parts over 30 outlets were counterfeit
if we do not step up to the plate with this bill we are going to lose and continue to lose 12 billion a year just in automobile part counterfeiting
i plead with those on the other side if they truly care about labor if they care about the individual that gets up in the morning plays by the rules and is trying to compete in a world market they will vote for this bill
mr speaker george washington in his farewell address warned of some of the problems that would be created with two strong party systems and today i see it
we have the ability today to make a statement to stand up for every worker in america who gets up plays by the rules goes to work and tries to build the best products in the world and they do
you should have the faith and confidence in them to stand up today and say we are going to help you by leveling the playing field
it is amazing and i want to talk just a minute about counterfeit goods because in this bill for the first time we say you have to have a trade enforcement officer who gets up in the morning and her whole job for the whole day is going to make sure that countries like china are living up to their wto and the world trade arrangements and agreements and the rule of law the protection of intellectual property
this product right here you can not tell the difference in these two products except what is on the inside
windshields in china a group of auto companies went together and said you can not counterfeit these things it puts americans at risk
there are no safety factors in your glass
after three convictions in china that company is still producing automobile glass
brake pads there was a woman killed in saudi arabia because they put formed grass in brake pads and sold them as a counterfeit part and unfortunately took her life
as always the devil is in the details
last week in the education committee we cut 11 billion from pell grants
we have millions of kids living in poverty
i rise today in strong support of this legislation
i first want to recognize the gentleman from pennsylvania mr english xz4001230 a member of the committee on ways and means subcommittee on trade for his persistence in bringing this bill to the house floor
many in this chamber including myself feel that beijing can do a much better job in demonstrating to the world that its markets are transparent and fair both to consumers and exporters to china
at the same time we have to be focused and pragmatic in determining how we can be most effective in establishing checks
in this bill we create an extensive monitoring of the chinese market and its compliance on a range of issues such as intellectual property enforcement whether the currency mechanism is being implemented properly market access to the united states goods and its accountability of chinese subsidies
i might say it too that he is absolutely correct because there is a substantial provision in there that was written by the gentleman from new york mr rangel xz4003330 the ranking democrat on the committee on ways and means
i do not recall any trade bill of this sort that has been brought directly to the house with an open rule so that every member can throw in everything and every political speech as we are hearing today
and is it not strange that we would be asked to violate the world trade organization provisions by unilateral sanctions which are in violation of the world trade organization
but it does it in an orderly manner
it does it in accordance with law and it does stick to the principles of the world trade organization which is something that we subscribe to
mr speaker reclaiming my time i would say to the gentleman that we do not waive any of those rights in the bill that is before the house today
mr speaker i rise in strong opposition to the rule before us this morning because as was pointed out yesterday the republican leadership in a clear attempt to circumvent the democratic process tried to sneak the united states trade rights enforcement act through the house under suspension of the house rules
but this leadership wanted to force this bill through the house without a proper hearing in the committee without the appropriate debate and without any opportunity for amendment or improvement
this is like being given an opportunity to vote in an election with only one candidate on the ballot
but real american jobs are hanging in the balance and a perfect example of this can be found in buffalo new york
after 100 years of business the buffalo color company the last domestic producer of indigo dye used to make blue jeans is in the final throes to quote the vice president of bankruptcy
without the data if they do not let their currency float how in the world do we measure how much they are manipulating the currency
and those critics of those of us who have been putting pressure on china in the last few weeks said we could never get them to reevaluate their currency
i rise in support of hr 3283 the united states trade rights enforcement act
because of chinese government intervention in the economy chinese businesses are not subject to the same market forces as american businesses
american businesses have also been enticed to setup shop in china
in addition to cheaper labor costs businesses in china do not have to worry about clean air clean water osha or compliance with a crushing regulatory burden
despite huge growth in the chinese economy and explosive international trading the chinese gove rnment refused to revalue its currency
it will allow investigators to compare china with comparable market economies most likely india in order to see just how much the chinese government is unfairly aiding its businesses
this will not save american manufacturing overnight but it will help to level the playing field and allow fair competition in the global marketplace
i am one of many members that withheld support for cafta in exchange for concrete action on china
that may be but if manufacturers in my district are put out of business because of unfair competition from china whether or not they have access to markets in central america will be irrelevant because they will be out business
i urge all of my colleagues in the house and the senate to vote for this necessary tool against unfair trade practices
i would have liked to have had a lot more in this bill
i hope we can get some additional provisions in as it moves through the senate
but the fact is with all due respect the most powerful lobby or at least one of the most powerful lobbies in this congress is the china lobby with quotes around that those people who believe that trade with china and expanding trade with china is absolutely essential
if i can move into policy for a few minutes because it is very difficult to figure out how to deal with a country that is cheating in their currency manipulation
if you do not have any data like this bill is asking us to collect when i went in and worked with the gentleman from pennsylvania mr english xz4001230 and others to try to put this bill together in the beginning the main problem is that most of the proposals on the table are not workable
we know there is currency manipulation because they are propping it up but that is very difficult to prove in a world court
this bill incorporates the english bill that i was an original cosponsor of and helped in drafting with the modifications of the ways and means committee with the numbers collection so that we can have the first steps to be able to not just be a paper dragon
all the rhetoric of congress got nothing but when we leveraged on cafta which quite frankly is a little tiny peanut compared to a great big elephant when we are talking about china very important in central america very important to those democracies important to a few people in our country and certain trading agreements but just a little tiny trade thing and china is a huge trade thing but they will not talk to me or others about china either party unless you leverage your vote when it becomes a critical time
as arab countries back out of our currency and move to the euro because of our support for israel and other elements in the middle east china has helped prop it up
madam speaker when china joined the wto the us and china entered into an accession protocol among other things that protocol anticipates that the united states may find that china is subsidizing exports and in that case the united states may seek to impose countervailing duties to level the playing field
as originally drawn this bill dropped the key phrase where practicable it restricted the ability of the commerce department to measure subsidies in china and other nonmarket economies
madam speaker i rise today in opposition to hr 3283 the socalled united states trade rights enforcement act
in fact this bill does little to address serious trade issues with china and it is on the house floor for only one reason to garner votes for cafta later this week
there is no question that congress should do everything in its power to enforce trade rights worldwide
let s look at the facts in 2004 the us trade deficit with china grew to a record 162 billion
this despite the fact that china joined the world trade organization wto in 2001 and should be well on its way to reducing trade barriers and opening up their markets to us goods and services
madam speaker we have known about trade enforcement issues in china for years
but china legislation magically appears only now that cafta is in trouble
the united states trade rights enforcement act as amended is a compendium of a number of positions that have been expressed in a bipartisan way by members of this house in regard to some of our trading partners
the provisions to assist us in determining how you examine a nonmarket economy and determine whether or not it is carrying out practices that are in violation of the wto is applied to any country with a nonmarket economy
that also in this legislation would be monitored
yes it includes the office of china affairs but i do want members to know it also includes the office of japan korea and asian pacific affairs because there are several provisions in here monitoring frankly the government of japan based upon its unfair trade practices most focused on the use of socalled sanitary and phytosanitary measures as in fact nontariff trade barriers
so this is a compendium of concerns presented at a time that the trade issues will be in front of us this week and leadership felt and i agree as well that this measure allows us to focus beyond this hemisphere in fact at major trading partners and behavior that we have seen not just in terms of providing tools to enforce us trade rights but to monitor personal individual and voluntary commitments made by governments as well
some of the other measures and we saw that in the hearings that the committee on ways and means has had over china and other trade concerns this bill is backed by hearings notwithstanding what the gentleman from new york mr rangel xz4003330 said
but most of the other pieces of legislation in fact violate the very wto rules that we desire china and other nations to follow
it is a responsible bill responding in ways that are appropriate
inappropriate responses that actually violate the wto rules when trying to make the point that other nations should follow them is in fact irresponsible
mr speaker i ask unanimous consent to yield the remainder of my time to the gentleman from pennsylvania mr english xz4001230 who has been instrumental in producing this bill and that the gentleman from pennsylvania mr english xz4001230 may control the remainder of the time
madam speaker i rise in opposition to hr 3283 the united states trade rights enforcement act
in fact it could create additional problems for them
in particular i am concerned that the legislation could make it more difficult to apply countervailing duties to china and other nonmarket economies while making it easier for them to hide subsidies
mr chairman i rise today in support of hr 2123 the school readiness act of 2005
the goal of the head start program is to give atrisk children all across our nation a fair chance at succeeding in the educational system
in my home state of california 658 percent which is almost twothirds of those enrolled in the head start program are latino
head start has long lasting effects on those most in need
head start graduates are more likely to graduate from high school and less likely to need special education repeat a grade or commit crimes in adolescence
this bill improves the program in several key ways it increases funding for underserved children for the children of migrant and seasonal workers it will allow approximately 10 000 more children to leave the agricultural fields and enter the classroom it expands the native america head start programs and it also works towards ensuring that parents can get information in their native language when possible
this bill was passed unanimously out of the committee on education and the workforce in may
that kind of partisan politics has no place in a bill that is about increasing educational opportunities for our children
many of our latino parents and children already face a number of barriers in accessing the head start program
it would place tens of thousands of already atrisk children in danger of losing their head start teachers
and in doing so it would block countless lowincome and minority parents from climbing the ladder out of poverty
we should not make it more difficult to participate in a program that enables thousands of parents to make the lifechanging transition from being a parent volunteer to being a trained and paid head start teacher
i rise in strong support of hr 2123 the school readiness act of 2005
as a former head start volunteer i know firsthand the tremendous benefits this program has delivered for children but never did i think that summer the first year of head start s existence that i would one day be a part of the congress in reauthorizing head start
during the full committee markup for this legislation i was pleased to join with my colleagues the gentleman from pennsylvania mr platts xz4003210 and the gentleman from maryland mr van hollen xz4004150 in offering an amendment that will provide some commonsense flexibility for head start centers to use the open slots for the early head start program
mr chairman the committee on education and the workforce learned that more head starteligible children ages 3 to 5 are participating in state prekindergarten programs because there are more of them leaving some of the head start programs with unused slots
research has shown time and time again that infants who receive the highquality child care and early education programs do better in school have more developed social skills and display fewer behavior problems
i would like to thank the chairman of the committee the gentleman from ohio mr boehner xz4000360 the chairman of the subcommittee the gentleman from delaware mr castle xz4000700 and the members of the committee for supporting this amendment in the full committee markup
the resolution before us provides for a structured rule for the consideration of hr 2123 the school readiness act of 2005 and makes a good number of important amendments in order and will provide for a full and wideranging debate on all the aspects of the head start program
the underlying bill does not include provisions which were deemed by some controversial in the base text such as providing hiring protection for faithbased head start providers
today almost 1 million students are involved in head start
in some places the head start program is great
i do not want to be a little bit parochial here but being well acquainted with those involved in head start in my particular area they do a great job and i am very proud of my association with them
but in each of these situations the program still could be better
for that purpose this bill focuses or attempts to focus the academic program more clearly in particular areas
especially important is this particular thing that in the text of this particular bill it puts a greater emphasis on tying head start programs to a state s curricular standards
to be a priority grantee in the head start program they have to show a pure correlation to a state s curriculum standard
the head start programs have to demonstrate an active support in trying to tie their programs into local school districts
this is essential in the long run if you want to have a smooth transition between head start and the local schools
this bill recognizes that is a serious problem and a serious error and attempts to try to bridge that gap by insisting that head start programs work closely with their local school districts to provide a seamless entry for those kids going through head start into the regular school programs in the states where they are
the competition that will be new in this particular program will drive improvements in head start at the same time it will meet the needs of a recommended financial management that the gao suggested
by looking for and rewarding success in head start programs and also looking for and punishing deficiencies in any 5year cycle there is an element to try to improve this program taking a program that is good and great and in every situation making it indeed better
there are also within this guarantees that there is a guaranteed share of the money that will go to native american programs migrant and seasonal workers the most disadvantaged of the groups that head start is trying to help and assist who will never be placed at a disadvantage in the overall process
in addition to that this bill removes certain flawed techniques of evaluation that have been standardly used by the head start program and replaces them with something that is more scientifically based
in addition to a manager s amendment the chairman of the committee who recommended this bill recommended four amendments two by republicans and two by democrats
the committee on rules instead in addition to the manager s amendment recommended 11 additional amendments five by republicans six by democrats
i commend the gentleman from ohio mr boehner xz4000360 and the sponsor of this legislation the gentleman from delaware mr castle xz4000700 for their hard work in placing this bill before the house and i urge all of my colleagues to support this rule
if i could just make a note of the amendments that were not made in order of the 12 four were defeated in committee
so they did have a hearing in which they were discussed
one was withdrawn in the committee
two dealt with issues that can be dealt with in other bills and should be dealt with in other bills
one was combined and given preference to a similar bill and one was a policy issue that we simply said would not be there because it would take money away from the training of teachers in contradiction with what the bill was trying to do
i understand her feelings about not being allowed to have an amendment placed in order on the floor
i have been in that situation myself several times
i would simply point out that the particular amendment to which the gentlewoman refers was offered in the committee itself and was defeated on a bipartisan vote in that committee
it was one of the concepts that we thought was not necessary to replow all old ground over and over again and that is probably one of the reasons why this particular amendment was not placed in order by the committee on rules
mr speaker once again i share the frustration and understand the gentlewoman from california as to her amendment not being made in order here
but i once again would point out that the amendment was presented in the committee and was rejected by the committee
i also was a school teacher and i realize in the article the gentleman quoted from the constitution i was an officer of public office and trust
that is a concept which has been upheld in statute by this body
we should not put some kind of artificial barrier in front of groups that can help kids from actually doing that especially when they are functioning under the rules that we have established and have been upheld by the courts
i have always enjoyed his comments in the committee on rules and i have oftentimes agreed with his comments in the committee on rules
mr speaker as we conclude the debate on this rule i would remind people that the underlying bill provides for the head start program in many different areas
it is an investment in our future
i am happy to see some improvement offered in the school readiness act of 2005 such as abandoning blockgranting increasing accountability on academic performance and content and teacher quality
it does not go far enough in providing additional funding for teachers so they may acquire bachelor s degrees by 2011
in oregon only 58 percent of the eligible children are being served
instead of focusing on getting more eligible children into the program the republican leadership is once again attempting to repeal civil rights protections by introducing an amendment permitting religious organizations to use federal funds to discriminate in hiring and firing decisions
faithbased organizations have long participated in the head start program and have successfully received federal funding without discriminating
mr speaker i want to thank my colleague from utah for yielding time and mr speaker today we have an opportunity to act on behalf of the nearly 1 million disadvantaged children in the united states who participate in the head start early childhood education program every year
the bill before us the school readiness act was introduced by the gentleman from delaware mr castle xz4000700 my friend and colleague and approved unanimously by the committee on education and the workforce in may
for four decades head start has provided comprehensive services to help prepare lowincome preschool children for success in school and in life
another problem we have witnessed is an alarming number of financial abuses in various head start programs showing that taxpayer dollars are not always being used to serve disadvantaged children and their families
we must demand more in exchange for the money we are investing and that is why the bill before us reforms and strengthens the head start program
these protections are a direct response to the reports of chronic financial abuse that have surfaced in recent years
the bill requires head start grantees that fail to meet program requirements to compete in order to continue receiving funds
this commonsense reform will fundamentally shift expectations in the head start program by demanding nothing less than the highest quality programs and for the first time ever programs that fail to meet expectations will face the possibility of losing federal funding
the amendment would help implement a reform initiative at the department of health and human services designed to address the internal weaknesses in the head start management structure and improve its overall effectiveness and i would urge my colleagues to support it
lastly i would like to note another critical issue we will consider today in the aftermath of hurricane katrina
faithbased organizations were among the first to reach out and lend a hand in service to those impacted by this disaster
they focus on issues from job training to child care and everything in between
too often the federal government has ignored or impeded the efforts of faithbased organizations willing to lend a helping hand in providing critical services to the neediest in our communities
the boustany amendment will protect the rights of faithbased groups to fully participate in serving head start children without relinquishing their religious identities
i think the rule before us today is a fair rule that makes in order an array of democrat and republican amendments and i would urge my colleagues to support it
mr chairman i rise today in support of this bill to reform and reauthorize the head start early childhood program
the school readiness act will introduce greater competition into the head start program and use that competition to leverage reforms that will result in a better program for the children head start was created to serve
this bill will strengthen school readiness and increase the role of all 50 states and local communities in head start
there is no question that most head start children are better off in the program than they would have been without it
that is not in dispute here
but there is evidence that some head start centers could be doing an even better job of providing preschoolers with the academic foundation they need in order to succeed in school
it will also improve teacher quality by ensuring a greater number of head start teachers have degrees and are adequately trained in early childhood development particularly in teaching the fundamentals
we are going to improve program integration in all 50 states by encouraging cooperation and program coordination from the ground up
the bill also addresses weaknesses in the head start financial oversight structure that have allowed the mismanagement and outright abuse of federal funds meant for disadvantaged children
the federal government is investing nearly 7 billion per year in head start and every dime should be going to support disadvantaged children
the gao the government accountability office in a report that we requested found that the financial management weaknesses in head start are resulting in diminished services for children
unfortunately there is currently no system in place to assure parents and taxpayers that these types of abuses will be prevented
the vast majority of those in head start are honest individuals dedicated to making sure the poorest of our nation s children have a chance to succeed
in numerous federal programs across the country faithbased institutions that want to lend a helping hand and providing critical social services are allowed to do so without changing the fundamental character of their organization
former president bill clinton for example signed four bills into law that explicitly protected the hiring rights for faithbased organizations when participating in federal programs
to the contrary faithbased organizations are forced to relinquish their protected right to hire individuals who share their beliefs or they are not allowed to participate in the program at all
their efforts in response to hurricane katrina serve as just one more example
yet when they seek to participate in federally funded programs for this purpose they must forfeit the identity that drives them to serve
today i urge members to support an amendment that i will be offering on behalf of the gentleman from louisiana mr boustany xz4006360 to restore the hiring protections in the head start program so that faithbased institutions can participate fully without giving up their mission and character that make them such an effective partner for programs like head start that serve those in need
we have got a strong bill that will help give disadvantaged children the head start they need to succeed in school and in life
many of the accountability principles that were outlined in the gentleman s bill hr 778 have been included in the school readiness act and these reforms i think are critical if we are going to ensure grantees are effectively managing taxpayer dollars and also to ensure that funding is targeted most effectively for purposes that support the program s goal of preparing kids for school
one of the reasons that there is some concern is that members on both sides of a question over the role of faithbased organizations there are meaningful differences on both sides but we have nothing to fear in allowing the house to work its will
mr chairman when our forefathers in the 1960s wrote the 1964 civil rights act landmark legislation they provided a specific exemption in hiring for religious organizations understanding that religious organizations would probably want to hire someone of their own faith
nowhere in this exemption does it say that well you have the exemption if you use your own money but if you participate in federal programs you lose the exemption
it does not say that anywhere in the 1964 civil rights act
the fact is that i understand there are deeply held beliefs here but i do not think a religious organization should have to give up their rights under the 1964 civil rights act just to participate in providing services to poor children who desperately need them
if what is being proposed under the boustany amendment is so awful why would president bill clinton during his 8 years in office have signed the following bills into law the 1996 welfare reform law the 1998 community services block grant reauthorization the 2000 community renewal tax relief act the 2000 substance abuse and mental health services administration act
why would president bill clinton have signed all of these bills into law if in fact this was such a bad idea
unfortunately my colleagues know that we are likely to win because we have won on this case time and time again as this debate has occurred in this house
the underlying reauthorization bill here is a good one to help head start children to get the head start they need if they are going to have a chance to succeed in school
and we know from all of the studies for lowincome children to have a chance in school going through an early childhood development program like head start is absolutely essential and that those children that are involved in head start and other like programs have a much better opportunity and a much better chance to succeed while they are in school
now there is no one in this house who believes more in empowering parents to be active participants with their children active and empowered parents with head start programs
but we have seen a number of problems in head start programs from financial abuses to very poor results for children and the gentleman from california mr george miller xz4002780 and i have worked closely to develop this bill and to develop this proposal that continues to allow parents to be actively involved
it still requires the grantees to urge parents to be involved but we do it though in a strictly advisory capacity
the only difference here is the veto power whether in fact the parent councils can veto the decisions of the board or the management
mr chairman i do not oppose the amendment but i ask unanimous consent to claim the time in opposition
mr chairman i do not oppose the amendment but i ask unanimous consent to claim the time in opposition
mr chairman i do not oppose the amendment but i ask unanimous consent to claim the time in opposition
this has been in the law for some time
given what we are trying to accomplish in terms of helping children be ready for school we ought to have all of the providers possible
if there is an entity out there who thinks they can provide head start with a very highquality program and make a profit we ought to allow them the opportunity to apply and be in the program
i am a big believer in competition a big believer in the private sector and innovative solutions
given the challenge we have with lowincome children in very lowincome neighborhoods anything we can do to bring more highquality innovative services to those children we ought to take that chance and so i support the gentlewoman s amendment
mr chairman i think the point we are trying to make here is there is a lot of innovation that is underway in terms of bringing technology and other innovation to the whole idea of learning
nobody has asked me for it i am not suggesting there is going to be a rush to come in with innovation but without some opportunity at getting a return on your investment will the innovation ever come
that is where i am willing to take the chance that new ideas new innovations in terms of developing these children could be very beneficial to the program
mr chairman i ask unanimous consent to claim the time in opposition to the amendment although i do not oppose the amendment
unfortunately with the hurricane moving now somewhat east of where it was he decided to return to his district in central and southwestern louisiana
so he is not here today and i offer the amendment in his place
this amendment will correct a flaw in the federal head start law that has stripped these organizations of their hiring rights forcing them to relinquish their civil liberties if they choose to participate in federal early childhood programs that are poised to be reauthorized today
in fact earlier this year we rejected in a bipartisan fashion an amendment that would have barred faithbased organizations from providing job training services in their own communities
the united states supreme court in 1987 unanimously reaffirmed the hiring rights for faithbased organizations
the amendment we are considering today is offered in the same spirit as the 1964 civil rights act the 1987 supreme court decision and each of the four laws signed into law by president bill clinton
considering the proven track record of faithbased providers in meeting the needs of our nation efforts we are seeing in action right now in the gulf coast region why would we want to deny them the opportunity to make a difference in the lives of head start students
president bush has worked tirelessly to remove barriers that needlessly discourage faithbased groups from bringing their talents and compassion to federal initiatives that help americans in need
one of the reasons that this language was not included in the original bill was to try to create a spirit of bipartisanship in moving the process along
we have had this debate many times in this house
in the 1964 civil rights act and amendments to it in 1974 religious organizations were granted an exception in their hiring practices so they could hire people of their own faith
over the years religious organizations have been involved in doing all types of good works including providing programs in their communities
but for far too long these organizations have been denied the use of federal dollars in order to preserve their religious heritage
as a matter of fact bill clinton bill clinton during 8 years in office signed 4 laws into law that had the same identical language as being offered to this bill today
what we have been trying to do in the work force investment act the community services block grant act today in the head start act is bring some consistency to the federal rules and regulations in terms of allowing faithbased providers to offer services without having to give up their protections under the civil rights act
go have that debate in the judiciary committee bring it out here and we will vote on it
clearly we are not in real agreement
we may disagree and in fact i disagree with a couple of the amendments but i agree with most of them on both sides
in fact in some ways it was a poverty program when it began
i think we are all in that together
i think everybody in this building would agree that we need to do that
so i hope we keep that in mind as we look at our amendments and the legislation and hopefully when the day is over we can move forward in helping these young people
mr chairman i thank the chairman for yielding me time and i also thank him for his tremendous work in bringing this bill together
i like i think most of us if not all of us believe very strongly in the head start program and i believe that this act emphasizes every child regardless of his or her economic status should have the best chance possible to succeed
in 1965 head start was created to give economically disadvantaged children access to the same educational health nutritional social and other services that were enjoyed by their more affluent peers
the goal of the program was as it remains today to provide children a solid foundation that will prepare them for success in school and later in life
in my home state of delaware head start programs serve over 1 500 children with almost 500 additional 4yearolds receiving assistance through state government funding
however head start students continue to enter kindergarten well below national norms in school readiness
the bill improves the academic focus of the program by establishing new quality standards that ensure enrolled children develop and demonstrate language skills prereading knowledge including an interest in and appreciation of books reading and writing premath knowledge such as recognition of numbers and counting cognitive abilities related to academic achievement and social development important for environments constructive for child development early learning and school success
for that reason we improve the quality of teachers in head start classrooms by requiring that in time 50 percent of all head start teachers nationwide must have a baccalaureate degree
i believe strongly however in the policy goals of coordination and integration that were at the heart of the demonstration project incorporated in the legislation i introduced last congress
we continue to believe it is essential to remove barriers and prevent collaboration between head start and successful state and local early childhood initiatives and i believe the proposal we are offering will in fact go further to foster integration among quality early childhood programs
about 40 states including delaware have established some form of early childhood education because states recognize that these services can make a real difference in preparing children for a successful future
in this new era head start should be working towards integrating services with other school readiness programs not competing against them
where we previously would have allowed no more than eight states to improve head start coordination with state and local efforts this bill will ensure programs in all 50 states are able to increase collaboration
finally we are asking early childhood providers in a state including head start preschool and child care to come together to identify ways to integrate school readiness initiatives across the state
as i have said i believe in the program particularly because of how the program helps children later in their academic lives
despite these stories we have also heard many stories of programs in which funds were being diverted away from this purpose
the gao recently released a report that warned the financial control system in the federal head start early childhood program is flawed and failing to prevent multimilliondollar financial abuses that cheat poor children taxpayers and lawabiding head start operators
it recommended that increased competition in the program could help weed out poorly performing grantees and ensure highquality services are available to children and families
in response to the gao s recommendations we are increasing the competitive nature of current program
the competition requirements in the school readiness act will help to alleviate these programs but more importantly will drive program improvement across the board program improvements that will ultimately help thousands of children nationwide which should always be our goal
the importance of early childhood education services can not be overstated and i believe strongly in the reforms which are here
i would say finally although we may have some disagreement about some of the amendments on this legislation that ultimately getting all these children up to the starting line equal in school and particularly those who are at 100 percent of poverty or less is in the best interests of all of us in congress and all the kids out there in the united states of america
specifically the amendment would revise the financial audit language to ensure that financial audit requirements for head start programs are consistent with those required under the single audit act amendments of 1986 that it builds on parental consent requirements included in hr 2123 as reported to further clarify that any health service available to children in head start may not be performed without the prior written consent of the parent and included a number of technical and conforming amendments
edward zigler who is opposed by the way to some things that i was for in the past so i do not always quote him but he is widely credited as the father of head start and many people follow him here and he stated with respect to the policy council i created and implemented the policy councils in the early 1970s
in fact i very much like that the house bill keeps in place the policy council with the role i had in mind for it while putting above it a board of directors with what i see to be some good requirements for membership on this board
i think this is the right governance for our head start operations in the united states of america
mr chairman i do not oppose the amendment but i ask unanimous consent to claim the time in opposition
mr chairman i do not oppose the amendment but i ask unanimous consent to claim the time in opposition
mr chairman i do not oppose the amendment but i ask unanimous consent to claim the time in opposition
mr chairman i do not oppose the amendment but i ask unanimous consent to claim the time in opposition
this amendment would abolish long standing civil rights protections that ensure federally funded jobs in the head start program are not subject to discrimination
head start provides disadvantaged children with a genuine head start in life to outrun the clutches of limited opportunities
while hr 2123 is not a perfect bill it positively maintains the successful federaltolocal structure of head start and wisely promotes smart accountability mr chairman the boustany amendment needlessly dismantles the bipartisan spirit of the underlying bill in an attempt to rectify a nonexistent problem
in fact the boustany amendment could allow discrimination on practically any basis
for instance in deciding who gets hired and fired from head start do we really want an individual s position on contraception or creationism to be equally as relevant as their professional qualifications
a good fight for partisanship perhaps but less good for the poor his words are telling of how some in this body are using religion to divide the nation and to enact federally subsidized discrimination
as many of my colleagues have pointed out and i will repeat for emphasis current law already supports the notion that faithbased organizations can use its own private funds to decide who it wants to hire on the basis of religion they simply can not discriminate in hiring with american taxpayers dollars
faithbased organizations are and will continue to be critical partners in providing these services
mr chairman in this new century so rich with opportunities to right the wrongs of our past let us embrace our democratic values and put the needs of our children ahead of partisan political interests
mr chairman i did not run a program in head start like the gentlewoman from california ms waters xz4004220 but i visited one and then i visited another one because when i first came to congress and the gentleman from maryland mr hoyer xz4001890 was here i did not support head start or wic
i have never seen anybody turned away any religion whether in an emergency or health or wic
we have had a very good process i think in the committee on education and the workforce in moving toward the reauthorization of head start
this is the spirit in which i believe congress ought to work and find compromises and avoid extremes
but regrettably i am going to have to oppose the boustany amendment to strike the language which prohibits religious discrimination in hiring
this issue was vigorously debated in our subcommittee and committee and was not included in the bill
supreme court decisions have clearly stated that religious institutions have a legitimate interest in choosing employees by their religion
employers in governmentfunded programs should not be able to do what government employers may not do
religious education programs run by a mosque a church or synagogue are pervasively religious and discrimination in hiring is appropriate to carry out the religious content
but a program in the same building which is a contract for a head start program is not about religion and discrimination in hiring for jobs paid with federal tax dollars is wrong
head start graduates are less likely to need special education services to be held back a grade or to get in trouble with the law
for all the program s success we know that even the best teachers struggle with overwhelming class sizes particularly with young children and head start s 10 to 1 ratio of students to teachers in the classroom presents clear challenges in helping head start children gain the cognitive skills other children have
there is a proven link between mentoring and reduced substance abuse later in life and improved academic achievement
some of the college student mentors in this initiative will even become head start teachers themselves some day
that is what we have seen in one program which deploys 2 100 college students who devote 15 hours per week during the school year to mentor head start students
there is no substitute for the work of a qualified trained teacher nor would anything in this amendment require local head start centers to offer mentoring programs
mr chairman with this amendment we are simply seeking to supplement the remarkable work of our head start teachers in a way that allows for children to learn at their optimum capacity
mr chairman in closing let me just say that i am excited about the opportunity for this amendment because i think that we can create a partnership with the head start program and with our college students
and we give an opportunity to college students to be stakeholders in an education process
it keeps them involved in their community
it keeps them involved in public life
mr speaker as the father of two young sons i am a strong supporter of the head start program because i want every child in america to have a chance to reach his or her highest godgiven potential
as a person of faith i believe in the important role of faithbased organizations in addressing society s needs including the education needs of children
yet that gentleman and others who support this rule and the boustany amendment would allow faithbased groups using tax dollars to give every individual applying for a job to teach children how to have a better life in the world allow them to give a personal detailed religious test
in education and 30 years of experience in helping young children get a better education we are going to deny you mr jones xz4002092 or mrs smith this federally funded head start job because you did not pass our personal religious test
article vi the only reference to religion in the original constitution before the amendments were passed said basically that no religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under the united states
in early childhood education or even special education simply because of their religious faith they are denied the right to have that job to help children
mr chairman you can use whatever rhetoric you want but at the end of the day this amendment not only legalizes religious discrimination in america it pays for that discrimination using american taxpayer dollars
i think people of faith are going to be offended by the fact that some in this house think that groups have got to be able to discriminate based on religion in order to make their programs work
the fact is this amendment supports and allows and subsidizes racial discrimination in job hiring and no amount of rhetoric can deny that
in education and 20 years of experience helping children get a head start in life they can still put up that sign
i wonder what the majority is going to say and people think they are going to say the first time a christian is denied a job by a muslim group that has received 1 million in federal funding to run a head start program and say no christians need apply here for a job
mr chairman our country has more religious tolerance than any other nation in the world and more religious freedom than any other nation in the world because we have not allowed this kind of discrimination in america
this is a debate we have had before particularly in the committee as we discussed this bill last year
and i have difficulty understanding the rationale for opposing this amendment because it has been established in law for some time that churches have the right to hire on the basis of religion and the activities they pursue
as an example the gentleman from nebraska mr osborne xz4003030 pointed out in the debate last year that one of his local churches operates a head start program but they do not hire fulltime people for that
why then prohibit that person from also teaching in the head start program
and when the call came in after hurricane katrina the red cross was asked to organize a relief effort asked to provide emergency shelter and housing for 500 people
their first call was to grace the grand rapids area ecumenical group which through the churches put together a shelter in a matter of 2 or 3 days
they could not have done that without that but virtually every church in the city worked on it
why exclude such a potent social force from working with the government in cases of emergency or at any other time
that is not the motivation of the churches in grand rapids or across this country
they understand based on their spiritual commitment that they have a responsibility to their fellow human beings and that in the name of god they are to minister to others who are in need
and that is why they are an effective social force in meeting the needs of the poor meeting the needs of those who are hurting and that is the reason that they are an effective agency of the federal government to work with in terms of crisis emergency or simple pain and need on the part of certain people
this amendment that is being offered will allow the continuation of that effort in the head start program and frankly we should allow it in every program
why should we rule out one of the most effective and one of the most potent social organizations in the nation that is religious organizations who are dedicated to doing good who are seeking to do good who are trying to honor their lord by doing good and they can be a very effective force
we should not exclude them in any way from their work and from their participation with the government as partners
it is the most successful school readiness program in the nation
you today can get a bill passed in a bipartisan vote unanimously with everybody understanding because we are investing in america s children and you chose to take that progress and play politics in the most ugly way by pinning american against american based on their religion
it reminds me when i look at today s data why the american people hold this congress in the lowest esteem it has in over 15 years
invest in america s future
the chairman of the committee did a good job in the committee producing a good bill that builds on the progress of the last 40 years and continues to invest in america s children and you chose to put an amendment on this floor unprecedented that chose to divide america not unite it to choose politics over progress and to continue the same policies that has taken this congress to the lowest esteem ever in the american people s history
mr chairman as somebody who worked for president clinton as his senior advisor president clinton did not support nor did he introduce in his welfare bill anything that you are saying and i will say he never promulgated those rules or enforced that
mr chairman in the original welfare reform bill by president clinton this provision was never in it
second it was unconstitutional and it was never promulgated by president clinton in the rulemaking
if you want to support something that president clinton believed in then try fiscal responsibility and start balancing the budget
i know she looks forward to the day as i do that we do get full funding for the head start program for all children who are eligible in this nation and we will work with the gentlewoman toward that end
it has played for four decades now a vital role in the lives of thousands of children and parents across the country and certainly in my home area of san diego and imperial counties of california
we are providing opportunities for children in underserved areas where parents may not be able to afford preschool so they can begin their schooling with a running or head start
now as we know in this year s reauthorization congress is implementing the strongest requirements for teacher qualifications and development in head start s history
in fact we have to answer the question might we be pricing head start right out of the teaching market
we have seen that in another unfunded mandate the socalled no child left behind act which created tougher standards and we all support that but congress did not provide the money to attract and hire the best teachers
so since there is a real possibility of increased teacher requirements leading to a dropoff in the number of experienced head start teachers i hope the house will accept my amendment which calls for the secretary of health and human services to submit to congress a study reporting on head start s teacher retention levels
i also have fond remembrance of being a graduate student at the university of delaware which the gentleman knows very well and appreciate the education in his state of delaware
mr speaker we did obviously get overwhelming consensus in the committee and the vote among the republican members of the committee was something 6 to 1 in favor of the bill
by the way we have had some negotiation since as the gentleman from texas mr delay xz4001040 knows because he has been participating in them
some safeguards were put in
then most recently we decided this is a way to get money if this bill were to pass quickly to do housing so badly needed in the gulf area frankly bypassing some of the normal problems you would have in terms of the need for regulations at omb
well as i read the constitution i did not find the word negotiation in private among the majority party as part of article i i thought bringing bills to the floor and having debates and votes was the way to do it
a bill adopted in an open process with hearings and debates in committee and amendments passes 65 to 5 it has been what months since that bill was voted out of committee and there have been some negotiations
the notion that the bill can not come to the floor until all but three members of the majority are satisfied really flies in the face of democracy
i have voted in the past for this thing called regneg negotiated regulations
we have a bill that has an overwhelming vote in committee
the gentlewoman from california ms waters xz4004220 the ranking member of the subcommittee on housing has said giving assurance to the people of new orleans the poorer people in particular of new orleans and frankly a lot of african american people that we will be committed to rebuilding the city so they can come back home is very important
the question is if a faithbased group wants to take federal money paid for by every taxpayer in this country is it a violation of their religious character to say with that federal money they must not discriminate in hiring
how are episcopalians being deprived of their religious integrity if they are told that you know what when you have federal money in this program if you hire a presbyterian that is okay
i mean this is fundamental we thought in america
again we are talking about federal money and we are talking about not imputing to religious groups an insistence on bigotry and discrimination in the spending of federal funds
this amendment really stands for two simple basic principles number one that those who are in need should have the right to receive vital services from the most effective source in the most effective way possible
now in the vast majority of cases that is going to be a public entity but in some cases and in some places it might just be a faithbased organization
it might be a faithbased organization it might be a religious organization that is the most effective choice for those in need that family in need those children in need
should they not have the right to those services in the most effective way
secondly the second basic principle is if it is a faithbased organization that is providing those services and participating in the program they should not have to surrender their religious character merely because they choose to try to help out
these organizations that are trying to reach out that are taking a chance to help provide these services because they see people in need the government should not say to them if they are going to help out i am sorry they have to surrender much of their religious character
if we fail to adopt this amendment and fail to protect the rights of these faithbased organizations to retain their religious character in such things as hiring it is not these groups that will suffer
it will be our neediest children it will be our families who participate in head start
let us adopt this amendment and stand for the principle that kids need help and they should be able to get it in the most effective way possible
i rise in support of the rule but most especially in support of the rule allowing for the offering of the amendment by the gentleman from louisiana mr boustany xz4006360
it is the one that protects faithbased head start providers and it is so important for us to be very sensitive about this issue as we look to those who are willing to provide some very difficult services and ones that certainly the providers must be very interested in as far as the wellbeing of the student the wellbeing of the families involved in these programs
certainly faithbased organizations are first in mind when it comes to providing the services that require the most care and we would be remiss in not providing an opportunity for this amendment to be adopted
we the congress have specified in several statutes that religious organizations that receive federal funds in the form of grants or contracts must not lose their title vii exemption
in fact former president bill clinton signed four laws that explicitly allow faithbased groups to staff on a religious basis when they receive federal funds
if we tell faithbased groups they can not hire on a faith basis in order to receive federal funds then we will force those organizations out of providing these services
we have had debates before regarding faithbased groups being involved in government contracting
what more important place is there for us to care about results than in head start
mr speaker reclaiming my time the gentleman again is trying to inflame what i think is really an unreasonable discussion in this conversation
in typical fashion however only 12 of those amendments were made in order
unfortunately the house will not have the opportunity to debate this amendment because it was not made in order under the rule
this body likes to talk about readiness in many contexts disaster readiness military readiness emergency readiness
we devise and implement all kinds of plans in order to be ready or prepared for any eventuality
it gives systematically economically and socially disadvantaged children the head start that potentially allows for the navigation and negotiation of hurdles in life s race that they may not otherwise have been able to maneuver without
it is at this very point in the lives of our children that they are introduced to varying themes and concepts that will shape them into the individuals they will become
this was made in order
the gentleman from mississippi s mr thompson xz4004032 amendment calls for the department of health and human services to provide additional assistance in areas affected by hurricane katrina and i suggested to the chair that we broaden that to include any disaster so that children are covered who are in the head start category
i am pleased that they were made in order and enthusiastically support each of these amendments
unfortunately although the underlying legislation has the support of both parties the rule also makes in order a controversial and discriminatory amendment offered by the gentleman from louisiana mr boustany xz4006360 our colleague
even more title vii of the 1964 civil rights act clearly stands in opposition to the gentleman from louisiana s mr boustany xz4006360 amendment the same title vii that was voted on and agreed to by the members of this great body 41 years ago
supporters of the amendment will argue that the supreme court decision in the amos case allows for the amendment to be in order and is therefore constitutional
that decision does in fact allow for the consideration of religion in hiring practices
however it does not allow for the consideration of religion to discriminate in hiring practices
how soon we forget that it is the very same language that made this bill highly controversial in the 108th congress and it will allow for it to be controversial if it passes again
mr speaker if we are serious about the lives of our children if we are serious about readiness if we are serious about reauthorizing head start then it is critical that we continue to work in a bipartisan fashion and reject proposals which seek to divide this body and its members
congress should not be in the business of supporting statesponsored discrimination
mr speaker i am very pleased to yield 4 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from texas mr edwards xz4001180 my good friend and a leader in the fight for education and for veterans and other affairs in this congress
for the gentleman s information the boustany amendment has been made in order
she played piano for all of the churches in town four in altamonte springs
it was very difficult but all of the children in that town went to all of the churches
and for all of those 41 years all of these faithbased organizations have been involved in receiving contracts to do business
the nondiscrimination provision of head start has been reauthorized in 1984 1986 1990 1994 and 1998
no changes were proposed or made in the civil rights provision during those reauthorizations but now the nondiscrimination provision would be thrown out
that is why it is so important not to mix that up in here
since 1965 head start has helped over 20 million children build the confidence and skills they need to succeed in school and to become the leaders and productive citizens of the future
children can not learn when they are hungry sick or too worried about their families to concentrate in school
head start is unique in its comprehensive approach to supporting children and families offering early education health care social services and nutrition services while emphasizing parent involvement and support
i am pleased that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have not pursued their strategy of last year and have worked with members from this side of the aisle to produce a bill that does not include the block grant proposal that was advanced in the last congress
improving teacher quality in head start is critical to increasing overall program quality and helping more children reach kindergarten better prepared to succeed
i hope that this problem is addressed in conference
head start began as a civil rights platform ensuring that all children regardless of race ethnicity or religion get a head start in life
this is an outright assault on religious liberty and civil rights in federally funded programs
to trample on this now will turn back the clock on the progress we have made in protecting the civil rights of the people we entrust to give our children a head start
in california alone over 6 000 apa children are enrolled in head start with over half of them coming from homes where english is not the primary language
i want to support the improvements in head start that this bill will make in order to provide the children in these communities with the opportunities they richly deserve
the first week was somewhat in flux at that point in time
in that regard last week we had thought we probably or might be in tomorrow
we are not going to be in tomorrow
mr speaker reclaiming my time i am presuming and there was some discussion about this last week that at some point in time in the next couple of weeks we are going to have to do some sort of continuing resolution
mr speaker does the gentleman have any thoughts at this point in time regarding the length of time of the initial cr that we would consider
the gentleman from massachusetts mr frank xz4001400 the ranking democrat on the committee on financial services is on the floor and has been very involved in this bill
i am not sure you even know this but the gentleman from massachusetts mr frank xz4001400 informs me that there are very significant sums that would be available to the gulf area for housing in the gse bill which will be regular order and the benefit would be that this money would be available and we know we are going to have to spend money in that area
mr speaker if the gentlemen from texas mr delay xz4001040 does not object let me yield to the gentleman from massachusetts mr frank xz4001400 the ranking member because i know he has worked very hard with the gentleman from ohio mr oxley xz4003070 as you well know in a very bipartisan way
because i think we would all be advantaged in a bill particularly if we could pass it with the overwhelming majority that was received both in the subcommittee and in the full committee
moving on mr leader in addition to the bills you have listed for next week do you anticipate any hurricane katrinarelated legislation will come to floor
in that context i ask that question
we hope it goes through committee and we hope it comes to the floor with an opportunity for members to make suggestions in forms of amendment either cutting or adding or shifting as the case may be those resources
one the 35 billion in mandatory spending cuts among which is 10 billion in medicaid cuts andor the 70 billion in tax cuts that was included in the budget reconciliation instructions
can you tell me whether or not we anticipate a social security bill coming to create private accounts or privatize in some way social security coming to the floor this year
but i want you to be assured that we share your view that we want to make sure that retirement accounts are secure and that americans have opportunities to participate in the creation of retirement accounts
unlike the bill considered by the house in 2003 this legislation does not attempt to block grant head start programs which was controversial
my wife supervised head start in our jurisdiction for many years
while the underlying bill contains longstanding nondiscriminatory provisions and i congratulate the committee for that there is an amendment lurking that will undermine that bipartisanship and not only that undermine an extraordinarily fundamental principle in our country we do not discriminate
i have never had anybody contact me ever and this is my 37th year in public office
for the past 30 years head start has set the foundation for the educational achievement of most young children in this country and has many of today s successful young adults as its proof of effectiveness
along with my colleague from illinois i sought to provide the authorization for head start to implement salary and work incentives to retain trained teachers in the head start program
the amendment was not ruled in order and we have not had the opportunity to even have a discussion about the amendment
i now stand in support of retaining qualified certified and governmenttrained teachers in a head start program free from discrimination prejudice and intolerance
in any case the people will not get that chance
we as a body can not effect a simple reauthorization because each time we get to a bipartisan agreement to move head start in to the 21st century this poison pill provision rears its ugly head
mr chairman this is a sad and unfortunate event in the history of this august body that after over 200 years as a sovereign country with a checkered past at best on discrimination we now debate discrimination by statute in the case of our young and budding leaders of tomorrow
i rise in objection to this amendment to permit discrimination based on religious affiliation in the head start program
i rise in objection to holding the future of head start hostage to this provision
equally important i rise to object to the proverbial slap in the face this amendment visits upon true and significant bipartisanship
mr speaker i rise today in support of the rule and of the underlying head start bill
since i was elected to congress in 2000 we have increased head start funding by 28 percent from 58 billion in 2000 to 68 billion today
mr chairman the head start bill before us today is a good bill i plan on voting for it but i also believe that the souder amendment will make it an even better bill by restoring the full authority of the parent policy councils in the head start program
clearly the parents are in the best position to know what is best for the children and i do not have to guess about that
on august 8 2005 i personally met with 120 head start parents in orlando florida
mr chairman the most important people in a child s life are their parents
the success of head start has been that the parents have been involved at the earliest of ages in their child s development
the amendment by the gentleman from wisconsin mr kind xz4002180 which i rise to support is an amendment that simply says let us take the evidence based on how we should approach education for children and let us apply what we know is the best way to include measurements of a child in their formative years of life
what i think all of us saw in the expeditious movement to put in place these tests was the fact that we rushed into it without taking enough time to take a look at it
all of my head start teachers have told me that the testing that is currently in place is testing that is not effective and that what would be more effective would be finding out through the national academy of sciences what they recommend in terms of the evaluation of those children
so i want to thank the gentleman from wisconsin mr kind xz4002180 and i want to join him in saying that learning as we know and as the chairman knows so well does not begin in first grade
it begins at birth and the parents need to be involved in their child s life
hr 2123 would establish a 35 setaside for indian head start allowing programs to benefit from approximately 45 million in additional resources and i want to thank particularly the gentleman from ohio mr boehner xz4000360 for putting that in his chairman s mark
again i would like to thank all parties that worked together in crafting this bill
mr chairman i reluctantly rise in opposition to the passage of the hr 2123 the school readiness act a bill that reauthorizes the head start program through fiscal year 2011
the adoption of this amendment allows faithbased organizations to discriminate in hiring
from its birth head start and the religious community have developed a strong partnership in the delivery of critical education and social services that have been the building blocks to escaping poverty
this relationship has worked well for generations and now it will be jeopardized if this provision is allowed to remain in the bill
many faithbased organizations who sponsor head start programs have experienced no problems in fulfilling their spiritual mission and honoring the nondiscrimination in hiring requirements under the civil rights act
permitting faithbased organizations to use federal dollars to discriminate in hiring is a step backwards in the continuing struggle for civil rights a step i am not willing to support
for this reason i cast my vote in opposition to hr 2123
i ask my colleagues to withdraw that amendment and let this bill which we do agree on to go forward to serve the children of our nation who are waiting for opportunities to ensure that no child in america is trapped within poverty s grasp to enable every child in america to live up to his or her highest potential
but when it comes to the use of taxpayers dollars no citizen in this country with the protection of the first amendment should have to pass a religious test to qualify
mr chairman i rise today in strong support of the amendment offered by my distinguished colleague the gentlewoman from connecticut ms delauro xz4001030 that would allow head start centers to partner with colleges universities and communitybased organizations to recruit and train college students to serve as mentors and reading coaches to preschool children
for 40 years head start has worked to increase the overall school preparedness for the nation s young children in lowincome communities
this amendment that allows head start centers to partner with an institution of higher education or a communitybased organization in order to recruit and train college students to serve as mentors and reading coaches to preschool children and would allow children to receive the personal instruction and attention they need to be successfully prepared for school
onetoone learning is a proven teaching method that strengthens cognitive skills in young children
back home in my district in connecticut the jumpstart hartford program is an excellent example of this type of comprehensive learning partnership
jumpstart hartford in partnership with the university of hartford facilitates oneonone instruction with students from the university and young children from lowincome families in hartford
the program has made significant gains in narrowing language and literacy gaps with its young children
mr chairman i urge my colleagues to support the delauro amendment that would allow mentor partnerships in head start and make real progress towards preparing all children in head start for success in school and throughout life
mr speaker i rise today to express my sincere disappointment in the committee on rules decision to report a restrictive rule for consideration of the bill before us today the reauthorization of head start the future of our children
several commonsense amendments were not ruled in order
instead several amendments that were ruled in order will weaken head start and the opportunity for our children
in the committee there was support of adding the language faithbased into the bill even though faithbased institutions currently participate in providing head start programs
we were happy to do this in committee i was also along with my colleagues because the equal opportunity employment act is also spelled out clearly in the bill which does not allow for discrimination in hiring
but there was another amendment that was not ruled in order my amendment an amendment which would have protected the privacy of our faithbased organizations and the integrity of our tax dollars
the amendment that i offered in the committee on rules would have simply required faithbased organizations to create a separate bank account a separate bank account in which to receive federal dollars for the head start program a distinct and separate bank account from the private dollars that a religious organization collects to put forward their religious mission
i quote from this publication and i will also include this in the record as well as two other publications that speak to this
then sandra the bookkeeper at a small manufacturing company in kansas came up with a desperate plan
sandra was convicted of embezzlement and sentenced to eighteen months in prison
while fraud at major companies like world com and enron have made headlines in recent years small businesses nonprofits and churches arc particularly vulnerable to embezzlement because of the level of trust given to employees and volunteers and the lack of sophisticated financial controls and oversight
in the past three years guideone which insures 45 000 churches in the united states paid 3 845 claims to churches for losses from theft by people outside the church or embezzlement by people inside the church
in the past ten years at least eleven covenant churches have reported being victims of embezzlement with anywhere from just over 10 000 to more than 300 000 taken by people they trusted volunteer treasurers church staff even a pastor
at least one major embezzlement at a covenant church was discovered in 2002
kent egging interim pastor of bethany covenant church in mount vernon washington has studied embezzlement in churches as part of a doctor of ministry degree program
egging also knows the effects of embezzlement on a church firsthand while he was copastor of a covenant church in portland oregon the church s treasurer embezzled more than 45 000
the embezzlement began in 1992 soon after jim a member of the church became treasurer
his main qualification egging says was not formal training in business or accounting he was willing to do the job soon after starting jim learned that the church had a separate account to handle funds for a campaign to build a christian education ce wing
in april 1993 he admitted at first taking 20 000
in the process egging talked with a friend who worked in the local district attorney s office
the biggest issue in all of this is trust the violation of trust
the trust of leaders in the congregation was in question because of this to prevent any embezzlement from happening in the future the church revamped its entire financial system
that s an area of vulnerability in most churches says egging
i would bet that most churches in america have some or a significant number of financial records at somebody s house in a box or on somebody s home computer he says because home computers are generally better than church computers
that was the case at highland covenant church in bellevue washington during the mid1990s
the church had a number of common financial safeguards in place two signatures were required on every check two people were present whenever collections were counted and the church did an internal audit of its book each year
and in a very trusting environment says kersten that was the big mistake when the first altered check was discovered kersten called the bellevue police and spoke to a fraud detective
invariably when an organization allows a person who is writing the checks to control the bank statements they are very vulnerable while the church s financial reports indicated that it had money in savings and other discretionary funds that proved to be false as well
the books balanced and that was the end of the story the embezzlement came to light in april 1995 after the church let beth go as bookkeeper because of suspicions that something was wrong with the church s finances
she was arrested tried convicted and sentenced to 40 months in jail
but the church was able to recover from the embezzlement and by the time kersten left in 1997 had rebuilt their savings and completed a major fundraising campaign
in the business world embezzlement is the most common financial crime in the nation
having procedures in writing and explaining these procedures to employees and volunteers will promote consistent handling of your organization s finances
in addition to a written policy for handling finances it s helpful to have written position descriptions for all employees and volunteers
keep these records and duplicates if necessary in a safe place
by documenting all financial procedures your organization can detect discrepancies quickly protect honest employees from unwarranted accusations and gather necessary evidence to identify criminals in the event of a financial crime
in many cases at least one other employee or volunteer is aware of or at least suspicious of fraud or embezzlement
develop a program for handling church finances in which the receipt deposit distribution and documentation of church money is carried out by different people
and because significant portions of offerings are made in cash and are usually collected and counted by volunteers the misuse or misappropriation of cash offerings is one of the easier crimes to commit against churches
to protect your church s offerings follow these steps ask your congregants to place financial gifts in envelopes preprinted with their names and addresses before placing them in the offering plate
in addition to financial assets physical property is a favorite target for criminals within an organization
keep important financial records and personnel documents in a safe or a locked filing cabinet
if they re necessary keep them locked in a secure place
keep interior office classroom and supply room doors locked when not in use
this will help you quickly tell if something is missing establish proper insurance protection and allow a faster more comprehensive recovery in the event of a loss
mr chairman i rise in strong support of hr 2123 the school readiness act which will strengthen the head start program by closing the readiness gap that exists between low and upper income children
created in 1965 and located in every community in the country head start has been a valuable part of our nation in preparing lowerincome children for elementary school
however in spite of the good efforts of the program there are still shortcomings that need to be addressed
we can do more to ensure that the disadvantaged children in this country are better prepared for school
a readiness gap still exists between children in head start and their more affluent peers
the bill emphasizes cognitive development and the use of scientificallybased research in topics critical to a child s school readiness
this bill also seeks to protect parents and taxpayers from financial mismanagement in the head start program
the federal government invests nearly 7 billion in the program but sadly dozens of media stories and an independent investigation by the government accountability office revealed problems in the financial management of some head start grantees
mr chairman this bill received unanimous support in committee and i hope that it will also receive the full support of the whole house
at a time when our country is grasping with how to deal with ongoing gaps in wealth poverty and education we must recognize that head start is a critical component to helping those children at a disadvantage get on a more equal ground
in my state alone nearly 20 000 students benefit from head start but we know that over half a million children in new jersey are eligible and never get a chance to get on that equal footing
it is simply not in the national interest and it is the wrong action and the wrong lesson to teach our children
in this bill we are asking more from our early childhood educators yet we are not providing them with more
we need to work to attract talented individuals to continue to enter the field not make it harder for them to stay in it
there is probably no piece of legislation in this congress that is more important to the future of this country and our children and our students than this piece of legislation
i have educated as an educator and have worked over the years to try to get improvement in the quality of head start and i commend all of those involved and also the president of the united states for emphasizing improving the quality of head start
we spend 7 222 per student for some 900 000 students involved in head start and improving the quality
these young people can learn and they should have an academic component and we should have the best personnel in these head start programs and we have gone a long way in that regard
unfortunately over the course of the last years we have had incidents of waste fraud abuse mismanagement even financial abuse of taxpayer dollars in the head start programs and again we have limited taxpayer dollars to expend and we want them expended in the most efficient and proper manner
while a large majority of head start programs have very responsible management and organization in place i think congress has an obligation to improve known problems before they get worse and also insist on correction
weak or failing head start programs are unfair to taxpayers but mostly and most importantly they are unfair to the children who need assistance in these programs not to mention they are unfair to the taxpayers
in conclusion i just want to give a couple of examples
i have one head start program i looked at that has 135 students 17 teachers and none of the teachers are certified in the program
i have other head start programs one in my district where we have 526 students and we reviewed what other preschool programs were paying
the most expensive private prep school in the district costs 8 400 a year
we need to look at what the management what the waste and inefficiencies are in the programs that we have with head start make certain that we are expending this money properly that we eliminate bureaucracy wasteful mismanagement and unfortunately in some instances fraud and abuse
this amendment will go a long way towards achieving that goal and making certain that every one of these taxpayer dollars are spent in the best way to benefit these children and give them truly a head start
in conclusion i know we all saw the pictures that were quite shocking in new orleans and many people were stunned by the level of poverty that we saw when the dikes and the levees broke
much more was broken in that community and our communities and that is the education of our poorest children
no piece of legislation will do more i think in advancing the interests and the educational opportunities for our children than this legislation
so i thank the gentlewoman from california ms woolsey xz4004360 i thank the gentleman from ohio chairman boehner the gentleman from delaware mr castle xz4000700 and others involved in moving this important piece of legislation forward improving the quality and also improving the management making certain with this amendment that every dollar goes towards the betterment of those disadvantaged in our society
mr chairman i thank the gentleman for yielding me this time and i rise in opposition to this amendment
what we tried to do in the committee bill is to make sure that there was a clear line of accountability on some of these fiscal matters
while the vast majority of head start programs are wellrun programs that provide excellent services the services that we have come to expect from those programs on behalf of these children in head start we have had some problems
we have also strengthened the parent policy council to be involved in all aspects of program authorization and we require that the board act on those priorities
the fact of the matter is i think many many people involved in head start believe that this is a very substantial improvement that will avoid the kinds of problems that we have seen in the past that have drained resources from this agency taken away from the services provided to these children
parents have been an integral part of this program from the beginning they continue to be and in fact their position is strengthened in this legislation
but we must deal in a forthright manner with this question of fiscal accountability and we are making those boards more accountable in this legislation and i hope that we would reject the souder amendment
mr chairman i thank the gentlewoman for yielding me this time and i rise in opposition to this amendment
when we look at the low pay and the profitmaking in the nonprofit sector of head start you would think that we would put that into quality to try to raise the pay so we can attract teachers with more education and child development experience and all of the rest of those issues
to now suggest because somebody has put in some efficiencies that money should now go to the forprofits instead of services and extension of the benefits of head start to this population that is in so much need of these services just does not make sense
mr chairman i rise in support of the school readiness act which will reauthorize the head start program but this measure will not get my vote if the amendment allowing for religious discrimination is adopted by this house
as a former mayor of the city of alexandria virginia i know just how important head start programs are to communities because they help to provide our lowincome preschoolaged children much needed services such as child development educational health nutritional activities which help them receive greater advantages in life
in addition to the educational services that are provided by head start programs some of the other services include health screenings such as dental and eye care
in my congressional district one of the most successful head start programs is the alexandria head start
i am concerned however that the school readiness act s authorized funding levels with limitations will allow less than onehalf of the eligible preschoolers to participate in head start
i am saddened that so many children who truly would benefit from participation in a head start program will not be given a chance of doing so and as a result will be far less likely to reach their true potential
another area of concern in this bill relates to teacher quality
in child development or a related field by 2011 and that all new teachers beginning three years after the enactment of the bill have at least an associate s degree or be enrolled in a program to achieve an associate s degree
why would someone who is interested in being a teacher and possesses the education and background the bill requires choose to make 25 000 a year as a head start teacher instead of 41 000 as a kindergarten teacher for a school system that provides its teaches with costofliving adjustments
the nonprofit trust for early education said it best in a recent report if we do not provide appropriate compensation for our prekindergarten teachers they will leave the prekindergarten classroom the school readiness act needs to provide head start programs with the financial ability to recruit and retain our nation s brightest teachers to educate our nation s most disadvantaged
head start teachers and workers not only provide cognitive development services to children they help in the development of children s character
it was once said that education is the great equalizer in a democratic society and if people are not given access to a quality education then what we are doing is creating an underclass of people who will ultimately challenge our very way of life while i recognize the shortcomings of the school readiness act it is a worthwhile effort that will help our lowincome children by working to level a very unlevel playing field so they will be prepared and successful in school
mr chairman i rise in support of the school readiness act which will reauthorize the head start program but this measure will not get my vote if the amendment allowing for religious discrimination is adopted by this house
they help to provide our lowincome preschoolaged children much needed services in the area of child development
these educational health and nutritional activities help them receive greater opportunities in life
in addition to the educational services that are provided by head start programs some of the other services include health screenings such as dental and eye care
in my congressional district one of the most successful head start programs is the alexandria head start
i am concerned however that the school readiness act s authorized funding levels with limitations will allow less than onehalf of the eligible preschoolers to participate in head start
i am saddened that so many children who truly would benefit from participation in a head start program will not be given a chance of doing so and as a result will be far less likely to reach their true potential
another area of concern in this bill relates to teacher quality
in child development or a related field by 2011 and that all new teachers beginning three years after the enactment of bill have at least an associate s degree or be enrolled in a program to achieve an associate s degree
why would someone who is interested in being a teacher and possesses the education and background the bill requires choose to make 25 000 a year as a head start teacher instead of 41 000 as a kindergarten teacher for a school system that provides its teachers with costofliving adjustments
the nonprofit trust for early education said it best in a recent report if we do not provide appropriate compensation for our prekindergarten teachers they will leave the prekindergarten classroom the school readiness act needs to provide head start programs with the financial ability to recruit and retain our nation s brightest teachers to educate our nation s most disadvantaged
head start teachers and workers not only provide cognitive development services to children they help in the development of just as importantly they aid them in their character development skills
it was once said that education is the great equalizer in a democratic society and if people are not given access to a quality education then what we are doing is creating an underclass of people who will ultimately challenge our very way of life while i recognize the shortcomings of the school readiness act it is a worthwhile effort that will help our lowincome children by working to level a very unlevel playing field so they will be prepared and successful in school
this bill really increases competition and accountability in the head start early childhood program
while the vast majority of head start programs are of very high quality i have been concerned about recent reports of mismanagement in some of the head start programs
i firmly believe congress should be doing everything possible to encourage the highestquality providers to become involved in head start
i would also like to point out that forprofit entities are already an allowable grantee under current law as well as hr 2123 so we would not be setting a new precedent in terms of forprofit participation in the program
mr chairman i rise in strong opposition to the amendment offered by the gentleman from louisiana
this amendment betrays our core values by permitting for the first time in the history of the head start program religious discrimination in hiring
it allows taxpayer funds to be used in head start programs that discriminate against teachers and parent volunteers solely because of their religious beliefs
religious discrimination in employment or the imposition of religious tests for federally funded employment in violation of the constitution is reprehensible and an affront to our first freedom
every religious denomination in this country can run a head start program and has
no one says they can not discriminate in who the minister is or they do not want women as ministers or for that matter as janitors but not with those positions funded by the federal government
we have heard terrible allegations from the other side of the aisle and from the administration alleging during the recent confirmation hearings for judge roberts that certain members of the other body have hung a sign on the federal courts saying no catholics need apply while i continue to believe that this slur against conscientious catholic members of the other body is blatantly false and slanderous those making the charge including the president and our colleagues on the other side of the aisle seem to understand that religious discrimination in employment or the imposition of a religious test for federally funded employment in violation of the constitution is reprehensible and an affront to our first freedom
however as has already been stated the civil rights act of 1964 i believe does explicitly protect the rights of faithbased organizations to exercise their civil liberties and take religion into account in their hiring practices and i do not know why we seem to continually have trouble assimilating that into our collective body of knowledge here
we certainly saw this in the recent rescue mission and aid issues down with hurricane katrina where a great number of faithbased groups were the most efficient groups that we saw on the ground there
and certainly they should have the right to bring those people in who share their beliefs even though they may have been receiving in some ways federal dollars
people must be hired in a way that they do share a common sense of mission a common sense of purpose
otherwise these organizations would be totally disrupted in what they are trying to get done
how dare anyone say on this floor that we are allowed to separate with federal money with federal money the horror of tens of thousands of desperately poor americans trapped in an environment of extreme neglect abandoned by its government left behind to fend for themselves without the most basic resources to survive
we witnessed that in the last 3 weeks
i am proud that americans have opened their hearts in the wake of this tragedy to lend a helping hand that the government at first refused
america believes in giving all of its citizens the resources and opportunities to make a decent life for themselves and their families
america believes in bringing the buses in on time so everyone gets out not just the wealthiest among us
head start is bringing the buses in before the floodwaters of poverty trap people in a desperate life of illiteracy unemployment crumbling homes dangerous streets drug addiction and no hope
but do not separate those of us in this room in saying those are for values and these are not for values
in the words of cecile dickey the former executive director of head start in paterson new jersey my home town and a personal hero of mine she was there when we started head start in this nation and she said you can not do anything for the kids without doing something for their parents too
that is why we have programs designed to help them improve themselves through education and job training as well as opportunities for them to be involved in planning activities involving their children
a struggling young mother with two children working in a daycare center she was recruited by head start as a teacher trained at new york university
a struggling young mother with two children working in a day care center she was recruited by head start as a teacher and trained at new york university
nationwide nearly 50 percent of three and four year olds who qualify by their parents income have been denied this opportunity in the last few years
in paterson alone over 2 000 eligible children are on the waiting list
when children are enrolled in preschool programs mothers are better equipped to find stable paying jobs
no rule for more amendments should have been in order
i urge my colleagues in the house to continue to expand its support of a program that every american can be proud of
mr chairman i rise in strong support of the school readiness act of 2005
i would like to pay particular attention and highlight a provision of the bill granting greater flexibility to head start programs wanting to provide early head start to children ages birth to 3 a priority goal of the head start program is to reach out and assist as many of our nation s atrisk children as possible in the most effective and responsible manner possible
in continuing with this tradition i was proud to join with my distinguished colleagues the gentlewoman from illinois mrs biggert xz4000270 and the gentleman from maryland mr van hollen xz4004150 in offering a bipartisan amendment during committee consideration of this measure meant to reach out and serve atrisk children at an age when brain development is occurring rapidly and is perhaps in its most critical phase
the biggertvan hollenplatts amendment which was adopted unanimously in committee gives grantees providing services under head start ages 3 to 5 and early head start birth to age 3 the flexibility to use existing unfilled head start slots for infants and toddlers who are eligible for early head start
in the earliest years infants and toddlers are developing a foundation not only with respect to language and cognition but also with respect to emotion mental health and social behavior upon which all subsequent learning is built
in addition the parents of these children scored significantly higher than control group parents on many aspects of parenting and the home environment
they have the ability to influence the course of young children s lives in a positive way
i hope my colleagues in this chamber will join me in supporting final passage of hr 2123
i thank the chairman for agreeing to this colloquy in order to shine a light on an unfortunate recurring situation in some head start agencies
on february 10 of this year i introduced hr 778 the head start accountability act of 2005 to address the misuse and abuse of federal funds occurring in an agency in my district as well as others
the polk county opportunity council has had a decadelong history in fundamental flaws in both operations and management
they also obtained 90 000 in federal funds to repair some head start facilities reportedly damaged in last summer s hurricanes that tore through florida
i introduced the head start accountability act to immediately address the seemingly unending pattern that was developing in that agency and similar organizations
among the provisions in hr 778 the bill calls for automatic recompetition of all federal head start federal grants every 5 years establishes new board requirements adds tighter fiscal control requirements at the local level
mr chairman i thank the gentleman for recognizing the importance of these provisions and including the key principles in this reauthorization
i look forward to working with my colleague in the future toward further refinement of these accountability measures
mr chairman i rise in strong support of the school readiness act
let me first begin by recognizing the tremendous efforts of my colleagues the gentleman from ohio mr boehner xz4000360 and the gentleman from delaware mr castle xz4000700 in crafting a good bill
as chairman of the laborhhseducation subcommittee of the committee on appropriations funding head start in the amount of 6 billion this bill will achieve a better use of those moneys
by providing educational health nutritional social and other services to the most needy in our society this program prepares children to enter kindergarten and to improve the conditions necessary for their success in later school and life
head start strongly emphasizes the involvement of families in the local community to ensure that the programs are responsive to the unique needs of each community
as you know in the aftermath of hurricane katrina the head start bureau has urged all of its grantees to provide head start services to any displaced children and families now in their communities
mr chairman i would like to emphasize that a good education is the cornerstone for success in life and that it is critical to have the basic skills to build the foundation before entering kindergarten
we have found a large dropout problem in our innercity schools in some cases exceeding 50 percent
in fact the national average is 32 percent
in many cases the students dropping out can not read at beyond the elementary school level and see no reason to stay in school when they can not keep up with the school work
the problems of dropouts and illiteracy do not begin in high school
they manifest themselves in high school but they begin in elementary and preelementary
these problems begin in the school when the students fall behind their classmates in the early years because they did not start with the same skill sets
we need to ensure that these students have an equal start and hr 2123 will help us in the mission
i have long been a supporter of the head start program because each and every year i witness the dramatic positive impact that early intervention services have on children s lives in my congressional district
my district includes many children who are in desperate need of head start services especially those hispanic children who depend on head start services to learn critical early literacy skills
latino children currently make up more than onethird of all eligible head start children and the los angeles county office of education is home to the largest head start program in the nation serving more than 24 000 children
during consideration in the education and the workforce committee this year democrats and republicans worked constructively together to improve the delivery of head start services to the target populations
in particular i highlight the reauthorization bill s provisions to ensure that head start teachers possess at least an associate s degree in early childhood education within three years of the bill s enactment
in addition i applaud the provision that would allocate 5 percent of total funds toward programs that support the children of migrant and seasonal workers an easilyoverlooked populace that is disproportionately latino
faithbased groups have and should continue to play a critical and respected role in the education of our nation s youngsters
in fact many religious organizations specifically oppose discrimination in hiring based on religion including american jewish congress church women united interfaith alliancefoundation union for reform judaism unitarian universalist association of congregations and united church of christ justice amp witness ministries
in particular head start programs are essential to so many children s futures for research shows that early learning is a fundamental piece of a child s education
i have long held a firm belief in the importance of education and have often spoke of our nation s need to ensure that even at the earliest stages our children have access to programs and services that will enrich their education and lives
last year head start helped 912 000 three four and five year olds build a solid foundation so they are ready to tackle reading and math in kindergarten
head start allows children to be ready to succeed in school and in life
mr chairman today we are debating whether or not we should repeal civil rights provisions in head start reauthorization and allow religious organizations that use federal funding to discriminate in hiring and firing based on an individual s religious beliefs
in a time when we are forcefully trying to persuade other countries to include protections against religious discrimination in their constitutions it is astounding that we are here in the united states congress trying to repeal these same protections for our own citizens
the provisions that currently govern head start have been in place and have been working effectively for decades
in fact hr 2123 the school readiness act passed through the education and the workforce committee by a bipartisan unanimous 480 vote
it is unconscionable that members of congress would try to reverse the progress that we have made on civil rights in this country
what message are we sending to the rest of the world including the newlyestablished democracies struggling to find a balance between religious freedom and civil liberties in their own laws and constitutions
adopting the boustany amendment will send our country in the wrong direction
mr chairman i rise today in support of the head start program and the great opportunities that it provides to children parents and families in america
as i received an education and health services my mother learned valuable lessons on how to become a more active and involved parent in america s public school system
i am glad to see that hr 2123 preserves the valuable federaltolocal design that gives parents and local communities the right and the responsibility to be active in their head start program
they have to use the money for head start and they can not discriminate in employment
we are talking about allowing them to discriminate in employment with the federal money
this discussion really represents a profound change in civil rights discussions because there was a time traditionally if an employer had a problem with somebody s religion the employer has a problem because the weight of the federal government would come down supporting the victim
there used to be a time when parents would have to describe to their children why they could not eat at the lunch counter why they had to sit in the back of the bus why they could not get a job at certain firms
any sponsor who will agree not to discriminate in employment if they can sponsor a program with the discrimination amendment they can sponsor the program without that amendment if they would agree not to discriminate
we had this discussion in the 1960s and the consensus back then was that discrimination in employment was so offensive that we made it illegal
all of the supreme court decisions have said it is okay for a church to discriminate in employment with church money
we have heard of our forefathers in 1964
mr chairman i submit for printing in the record letters from numerous organizations including the national head start association which oppose the discrimination amendment and ask us to vote no on the underlying bill if they sabotage civil rights protections
it is a sad day when members of congress try to manipulate compassion evoked by the national tragedy in my state of louisiana caused by katrina to pass a civil rights repeal in head start or jeopardize the passage of this law so important to the children of my state and our nation
faithbased organizations like the ones i oversee can and do fully participate in federally funded programs without discriminating in hiring with those same federal funds
i am greatly concerned that the provision to remove civil rights protections for employees could have a negative impact on the children and families who participate in these programs
tens of thousands of atrisk 3 and 4yearold children currently in head start could lose their teachers who often are the most important adults to whom they have bonded other than their parents not because those teachers are doing a bad job but because they are the wrong religion
as the state president of the louisiana head start association i urge you to reject the boustany amendment to allow discrimination in head start
these concerns are discussed in greater detail below
recompetition procedures which are laid out in detail in section 641 c 1 19 include several areas that are problematic
while we strongly agree that programs that are not providing high quality services should have to recompete for head start funds we are concerned that the language in this section may force more programs regardless of quality to undergo recompetition
yet we also believe that programs that are providing high quality services should not be put in the position of recompeting every five years as this instability makes it difficult for them to recruit and retain the best teachers to invest in facilities and to create lasting partnerships with other community agencies
we continue to have concerns that some of these tests could be evaluated in an arbitrary manner throwing programs into a recompete status regardless of their performance
the head start community does not want to see failing programs continue but we would like reassurances that the recompetition process will be unbiased and consistent in its application by the bureau
degree in 2003 exceeding a congressional mandate that 50 percent of head start teachers in centerbased classrooms attain an aa
fiftyeight percent of head start teachers without a degree or credential were enrolled in an early childhood education or related degree program and 18 percent were in child development associate cda or equivalent training
a key to head start s success in meeting the 1998 mandate was that congress also increased funding which provided scholarships release time and qualified substitutes teacher salary increases and other quality enhancement supports
in the following years funding for the head start program grew and as a result funds available for quality activities increased
however head start funding has not kept pace with inflation in recent years so programs no longer have a growing source of funds to help teachers attain degrees
while we appreciate the modifications made in committee markup to the provisions regarding the head start parent policy councils we strongly believe in the integral and shared responsibilities of board members and parents in head start governing bodies
the high degree of parental involvement in the head start program has provided a role model for early childhood education for 40 years
the nrs a pre and posttest for head start children is not a valid measurement of program impact and should not be used in this manner
further as pointed out in a may 2005 general accountability office report the nrs was found to be invalid and unreliable
hr 2123 limits the ability of parents and staff to travel in order to receive specialized training and career development at national conferences
while the head start community strives for sound collaboration with their respective state officials it is critically important that state officials reciprocate in these collaborative efforts
hr 2123 does not require input as it should and as is now required from state head start officials in the process of selecting staff who will have coordination responsibilities
the head start community believes that state head start associations should have signoff on candidates for state collaboration officers as well as continuing involvement in the planning and implementation of state plans
furthermore there should be clarification regarding states that have existing state advisory councils namely that they are permitted to modify them to meet the requirements in the bill
the head start community including a number of programs administered by religious organizations strongly opposes any effort by this administration to encourage religious discrimination in hiring practices for head start or any federallyfunded program
in spite of its positive provisions if hr 2123 contains a religious discrimination amendment we must reluctantly oppose the bill
in closing we commend the education and workforce committee for their bipartisan efforts in this head start reauthorization bill and we hope that modifications will be made that will result in improvements to the program
sincerely ministers in action washington dc september 16 2005
this bill maintains provisions designed to protect over 198 000 head start teachers and staff and over 1 450 000 parent volunteers from employment discrimination based on religion in federallyfunded head start programs
we agree that religious organizations participating in the head start program make an invaluable contribution to the education of thousands of students in minority communities in particular but do not agree that discriminating against persons based upon their religion is necessary or desirable in order to provide these much needed services
we are optimistic that this bill can gain broad support among religious civil rights labor education health and advocacy organizations but this broad support will end if there is any threat to remove the longstanding critical civil rights protections in head start
in particular we are seriously concerned about a statement released by the committee on education and the workforce on may 5 2005 in which chairman boehner stated that he foresees an amendment on the house floor to rollback longstanding critical civil rights protections
in light of this statement we are asking members to oppose this amendment and not support the head start bill if the antidiscrimination provisions are removed
as leaders of our respective congregations we are committed to providing much needed services in our communities and have done so by respecting the rights of all individuals
therefore we find it particularly insulting to suggest that it is necessary to remove civil rights protections from head start programs in order for this outreach to continue
we urge you to maintain the bipartisan direction of the school readiness act hr 2123 and to not support any agreement that allows for an assault on civil rights protections in federallyfunded programs especially a program as critical as head start
this could destroy the mutually supported nature of the head start program in which the education of young children especially minority children is so dependent upon parental participation and on ongoing close relationships with head start teachers
dear representative on behalf of the antidefamation league we write to urge you to maintain the civil rights protections currently included in the house education and the workforceapproved version of the school readiness act hr 2123 and to oppose any efforts to repeal these important provisions
allowing religiousbased employment discrimination in federallyfunded programs is wrong and to do it on the historic head start antipoverty education program is deeply offensive
the current antidiscrimination language was included in the 1981 head start reauthorization bill signed into law by president ronald reagan and has been included in every head start reauthorization since then in 1984 1986 1990 1994 and 1998
for 33 years these fundamental nondiscrimination protections have worked well allowing thousands of head start programs in communities throughout the country to flourish while maintaining constitutional and civil rights safeguards against religious tests for employment in federallyfunded programs
we have great appreciation for the vital role religious institutions have historically played in addressing many of our nation s most pressing social needs as a critical complement to governmentfunded programs
for decades governmentfunded partnerships with religiouslyaffiliated organizations such as catholic charities jewish community federations and lutheran social services have helped to combat poverty and provided housing education and health care services for those in need
indeed at the same time that safeguards have protected beneficiaries from unwanted and unconstitutional the house has never voted to repeal existing civil rights protections in a floor amendment
to do so on head start an historic antipoverty program universally acclaimed and present in so many communities across the country is odious
we want to express our sincere appreciation for the bipartisan and inclusive process that resulted in unanimous approval of the legislation at the committee level
significantly hr 2123 does not include the controversial block grant proposal that derailed efforts to reauthorize head start in the last congress
however we are concerned that this bill does not address the low pay offered to head start teachers and staff and the lack of financial assistance in meeting new and more rigorous educational requirements
afscme members have worked in head start programs for decades
allowing federallyfunded discrimination in any program is immoral
but it is especially egregious given that the civil rights protections in head start are an integral part of its mission to provide families a ladder out of poverty by encouraging parents to become volunteers and then teachers
dear representative on behalf of the leadership conference on civil rights lccr the nation s oldest largest and most diverse civil and human rights coalition with more than 190 member organizations we urge you to oppose the boehner amendment or any amendment to the school readiness act hr 2123 that would repeal longstanding civil rights protections in the head start program that have been in place since president nixon signed the law in 1972
religious organizations have always served as key partners in providing government services through the head start program and current law has not been a hindrance to their vigorous participation
in the 60 years since franklin d roosevelt signed the first executive order prohibiting discrimination in federally funded activity our nation has made significant progress in the struggle to end employment discrimination and advance equality
in a unanimous decision the us supreme court held that the constitution does not permit the state to aid discrimination id
the principles set out in norwood were affirmed in justice oconnor s opinion in city of richmond v ja
boehner s amendment because current law must not be changed to allow recipients of head start funds to have an explicit statutory right to engage in employment discrimination
dear member on behalf of the national association for the advancement of colored people naacp our nation s oldest largest and most widely recognized grassroots civil rights organization i am writing today to urge you to do all you can to ensure that the longstanding critical civil rights protections that are contained in the current version of hr 2123 the school readiness act are retained during consideration by the full house of representatives
hr 2132 as approved by the committee on education and labor maintains provisions designed to protect the more than 198 000 head start teachers staff and over 1 450 000 parent volunteers from employment discrimination based on religion in federallyfunded head start programs
the critical longstanding nondiscrimination provisions have been included in head start legislation since 1981
the legislation has always received strong bipartisan support from both the house and senate since its enactment in the 97th congress when president ronald reagan signed the legislation into law
the twentyfour year old civil rights provision has worked well since the inception of this program allowing religious organizations to participate in programs while maintaining constitutional and civil rights standards
the naacp both recognizes and celebrates that religious organizations participating in the head start program have made and continue to make an invaluable contribution to the education of thousands of students
however if the repeal of the existing civil rights protections were to become law teachers or parent volunteers working in any head start program run by a religious organization could immediately lose their jobs because of their religion
students participating in head start therefore could lose not only their teachers but also the close programmatic connection with their own parents volunteering in the program
the naacp strongly believes that allowing discrimination based on religion thus i urge you again in the strongest terms possible to support the continued inclusion of these longstanding and critical civil rights protections
should you have any questions about the naacp position or if there is any way in which i can be of help to you as you move this reauthorization through the legislative process i hope that you will feel free to contact me
further if such an amendment is adopted i urge you to oppose passage of hr 2123 repealing this longstanding essential element of head start could subject teachers in these federallyfunded programs to religious discrimination
as passed out of the house education and the workforce committee the bill maintains threedecadeold provisions that prohibit various forms of employment discrimination in head start
ever since president richard nixon signed the legislation into law in 1972 religionbased and other forms of discrimination are prohibited in head start programs thereby ensuring that taxpayer dollars do not underwrite positions for which religion is a factor in hiring decisions
at the same time the existing provisions do not intrude on the autonomy of religious organizations with respect to hiring decisions made in purely private programs
however the bill risks losing critical segments of this support if at any point this initiative is amended to roll back head start s longstanding civil rights protections by exempting religious organizations from the prohibition on religious discrimination in employment decisions
dear representative americans united for separation of church and state urges you to oppose any amendment to repeal longstanding critical civil rights protections contained in the school readiness act hr 2123 and to vote no on final passage of the bill if such an amendment is adopted
hr 2123 unanimously passed out of the committee on education and the workforce on may 18 2005 maintaining a longstanding civil rights provision designed to protect over 198 000 head start teachers and staff and over 1 450 000 parent volunteers from employment discrimination based on religion in federallyfunded head start programs
we are pleased with this bipartisan legislation thus far but are deeply concerned about stated threats to repeal longstanding civil rights protections against religious discrimination in our nation s head start programs on the house floor
we recognize that religious organizations participating in the head start program make an invaluable contribution to the education of thousands of children
however if the repeal of the existing civil rights protection were to become law teachers or parent volunteers working in any head start program run by a religious organization could immediately lose their jobs simply because of their religion or religious beliefs
dear representative the school readiness act of 2005 hr 2123 will soon be considered in the house
we write to urge you to oppose any effort to amend this bipartisan bill in a manner that would repeal current protections against religious discrimination
unfortunately repeated public statements have assured plans for a floor amendment that would allow religious discrimination in federally funded positions
a recent hearing in the subcommittee on criminal justice drug policy and human resources examining the faithbased initiative demonstrated once again that employment discrimination with federal dollars is one of the initiative s most controversial and divisive elements
religious organizations and the government have long worked in partnership to perform important social services
such cooperation has occurred for many years without the danger of government sponsored religious discrimination that is present in the proposed amendment
it would be extremely unwise to allow such a dramatic change in policy to threaten the reauthorization of head start
we appreciate your attention to this issue and urge you to oppose any proposal that would allow religious employment discrimination in government funded programs
dear representative the american civil liberties union strongly urges you to oppose any amendment to repeal longstanding critical civil rights protections contained in the school readiness act hr 2123 and vote no on final passage if such an amendment is adopted when the bill comes to the floor later this week
as unanimously passed out of the committee on education and the workforce hr 2123 maintains longstanding provisions designed to protect over 198 000 head start teachers and staff and over 1 450 000 parent volunteers from employment discrimination based on religion in federallyfunded positions in head start programs
in a statement released by the committee on education and the workforce on may 5 2005 the day hr 2123 was introduced chairman boehner stated that he foresaw an amendment on the house floor to roll back longstanding critical civil rights protections
current law prohibits participants in head start programs from discriminating based on race creed religion color national origin sex political affiliation or beliefs or disability
if amended hr 2123 would allow taxpayer dollars to fund religious organizations that discriminate against head start teachers and parent volunteers in federallyfunded head start classrooms
in fact the provision was first included in head start legislation that was signed by president richard nixon and subsequently by president ronald reagan
throughout its 33year history the civil rights provision has not been an obstacle to the participation of religiouslyaffiliated organizations in head start programs
in fact many religiouslyaffiliated organizations participate in head start and comply with the same civil rights provision that applies to everyone else
the proposed amendment to hr 2123 would reverse the government s long fight against federallyfunded discrimination repealing critical civil rights protections in head start attacks the very core of civil rights protections historically supported by the federal government
if amended hr 2123 would allow a religious organization such as bob jones university that discriminates based on religion to participate in federal head start
in a disturbing result bob jones university could be denied tax benefits because of its racist policies toward its students but could receive federal head start money under hr 2123 to discriminate against teachers and parent volunteers working in head start classrooms simply because the employees do not meet bob jones university s religious tests
moreover in the many religious organizations in which the adherents are all of a single race the result of federallyfunded religious discrimination will effectively be federal funds going to the employment of persons of a single race
the federal government clearly has a compelling interest in applying the head start act s civil rights provision to everyone receiving federal funds including religious organizations seeking to discriminate on the basis of religion in hiring persons to work in head start
repealing critical civil rights protections prohibiting discrimination in employment would be inconsistent with the leading supreme court case on the use of federal funds by religious organizations that discriminate
in bob jones univ
the court decided that the federal government s compelling interest in eradicating racial discrimination in education superceded any burden on the university s religious exercise of enforcing a religiouslymotivated ban on students interracial dating
there is no meaningful difference between the government prohibiting tax benefits to organizations that discriminate based on race and the head start act s statutory prohibition on discrimination based on religion in head start classrooms
in fact the united states itself during the current administration squarely rejected the proposition that intentional religious discrimination gets less protection under the equal protection clause than race
in its october 26 2001 brief defending the religion prong of title vii from an eleventh amendment attack the united states stated that c ontrary to defendant s contention that the supreme court has distinguished claims involving differential treatment on the basis of race and speech from those involving religion there can be no doubt that the equal protection clause subjects state governments engaging in intentional discrimination on the basis of religion to strict scrutiny brief of intervenor united states in endres v indiana state police nd
the proposed amendment s exemption of religious organizations from the prohibition on religious discrimination in the program is contrary to constitutional law and will open the door to governmentfunded discrimination
proponents of allowing religious organizations to use federal funds to discriminate against their employees argue that their position is consistent with a provision in title vii of the civil rights act of 1964 that generally permits religious organizations to prefer members of their own religion when making employment decisions
moreover although the supreme court upheld the constitutionality of the religious organization exemption in title vii corporation of presiding bishop v amos 483 us 327 33639 1987 the court has never considered whether it is unconstitutional for a religious organization to discriminate based on religion when making employment several courts have considered whether a religious organization can retain its title vii exemption after receipt of indirect federal funds eg siegel v truettmcconnell college inc 13 f supp2d 1335 1344 nd
in that decision the court held that the religious employer s claim of its title vii exemption for a position substantially if not exclusively funded with government money in addition to causing the establishment clause violation cited by the court in dodge hr 2210 would also subject the government and any religious employer invoking the right to discriminate with federal dollars to liability for violation of constitutional rights under the free exercise clause and the equal protection clause
although mere receipt of government funds is insufficient to trigger constitutional obligations on private persons a close nexus between the government and the private person s activity can result in the courts treating the private person as a state actor
it is beyond question that the government itself can not prefer members of a particular religion to work in a federallyfunded program
the equal protection clause subjects governments engaging in intentional discrimination on the basis of religion to strict scrutiny
no government could itself engage in the religious discrimination in employment accommodated and encouraged by the proposed rule s employment provision
thus the government would be in violation of the free exercise clause and the equal protection clause for knowingly funding religious discrimination
the supreme court recently explained when there is a sufficient nexus between the government and the private person to find that the private person is a state actor for purposes of compliance with constitutional requirements on certain decisions made by participants in the government program s tate action may be found if though only if there is such a close nexus between the state and the challenged action that seemingly private behavior may be fairly treated as that of the state itself
we have for example held that a challenged activity may be state action when it results from the state s exercise of coercive power when the state provides significant encouragement either overt or covert or when a private actor operates as a willful participant in joint activity with the state or its agents
the extraordinary role that the current administration and the amendment sponsors have taken in accommodating fostering and encouraging religious organizations to discriminate based on religion when hiring for federallyfunded programs creates the nexus for constitutional duties to be imposed on the provider in addition to the requirements already placed on government itself
the clear intent of this amendment to repeal the civil rights provision in the head start act is to encourage certain providers receiving federal funds to discriminate based on religion
the proposed amendment to hr 2123 provision allowing federallyfunded religious discrimination is part of a growing pattern of congressional presidential and regulatory actions taken specifically for the purpose of accommodating fostering and encouraging federallyfunded private organizations to discriminate in ways that would unquestionably be unconstitutional if engaged in by the federal government itself
for example in december of 2002 president bush signed executive order 13279 which amended an earlier executive order which had provided more than 60 years of protection against discrimination based on religion by federal contractors
the bush order provides an exemption for religious organizations contracting with the government to discriminate in employment although religious employers have the right under title vii to apply religious tests to employees the constitution requires that direct receipt and administration of federal funds removes that exemption
in addition the federal government itself has constitutional obligations to refrain from religious discrimination or from establishing a religion
in particular nlc strongly endorses the committee s commitment not to include language that would preempt state and local employment laws thereby permitting discrimination in employment by governmentfunded faithbased social service providers
as you know local governments have a long and rich history of working with faithbased organizations that predates the enactment of the charitable choice provision contained in the welfaretowork act of 1996
in particular we strongly oppose any amendment to repeal civil rights protections for head start teachers staff and volunteers and will oppose the final bill if it does not contain these protections
votes associated with these issues may be included in the nea legislative report card for the 109th congress
head start has a long history of success in this arena having provided highquality early childhood education health social services and parental involvement programs to more than 185 million lowincome children between the ages of 3 and 5 since its creation in 1964
we are very pleased that hr 2123 maintains provisions designed to protect over 198 000 head start teachers and staff and over 1 450 000 parent volunteers from employment discrimination based on religion in federallyfunded head start programs
we recognize the invaluable contributions of religious organizations participating in head start
however we are deeply concerned that a repeal of civil rights protections could allow religious organizations participating in head start to fire teachers or parent volunteers based on their religion
we are concerned however that the bill would require teachers to have higher academic degrees without providing for a substantial increase in funding either for professional development or compensation
we recommend addressing this concern including by providing grants to help teachers meet the costs of earning their bachelor s and associates degrees andor increasing the salaries of those teachers who earn degrees in early childhood education
dear representative the american humanist association aha stands in opposition to any retrenchment of existing civil rights protections and therefore opposes any specific attempt to reverse the nondiscrimination provisions currently in effect in the head start program
on behalf of the oldest and largest humanist organization in the nation i ask you to oppose any such attempt to legalize discrimination with federal funds as you vote on the bipartisan head start reauthorization bill
there is no compelling reason to undo the civil rights protections in the head start program that president nixon signed into law in 1972
if this 33 year old nondiscrimination policy were discarded the head start reauthorization would permit religious organizations to use federal funds to discriminate on the basis of religion even when engaging in purely secular early childhood education activities
humanists are particularly concerned about this potential amendment because many dedicated teachers and volunteers in the head start program would find themselves disenfranchised just because they do not happen to believe as others do
dear representative we the undersigned religious civil rights labor education health and advocacy organizations are writing to urge you to oppose any amendment to repeal longstanding critical civil rights protections contained in the school readiness act hr 2123 and vote no on final passage if such an amendment is adopted
as unanimously passed out of the committee on education and the workforce hr 2123 maintains longstanding provisions designed to protect over 198 000 head start teachers and staff and over 1 450 000 parent volunteers from employment discrimination based on religion in federallyfunded positions in head start programs
the critical longstanding nondiscrimination provisions have been included in head start legislation since 1972
the legislation always has received strong bipartisan support from both the house and senate since its enactment in the 92nd congress when president nixon signed the legislation into law
the 33 year old civil rights provision has worked effectively since the inception of this program allowing religious organizations to participate in programs while maintaining constitutional and civil rights standards
in a statement released by the committee on education and the workforce on may 5 2005 the day hr 2123 was introduced chairman boehner stated that he foresaw an amendment on the house floor to roll back longstanding critical civil rights protections
we recognize that religious organizations participating in the head start program make an invaluable contribution to the education of thousands of students
however if the repeal of the existing civil rights protections becomes law teachers or parent volunteers working in any head start program run by a religious organization could potentially lose their jobs based only on their religion
students participating in head start therefore could lose not only their teachers but also the close programmatic connection with their own parents volunteering in the program
we strongly believe that allowing discrimination based on religion would significantly impede the important goals of head start send a damaging message to head start students and harm their we urge you to maintain current law and reject any assault on civil rights protections in federallyfunded programs especially a program as critical as head start
the dismantling of civil rights will destroy the nature of a program in which the education of young children is so dependent on parent participation and on ongoing close relationships with head start teachers
sincerely african american ministers in action
equal partners in faith
dear representative i write to you today as the president of the interfaith alliance a nonpartisan national grassroots organization dedicated to promoting the positive and healing role of religion in public life to oppose any amendment to repeal longstanding critical civil rights protections contained in the school readiness act hr 2123 and vote no on final passage if such an amendment is adopted
as unanimously passed out of the committee on education and the workforce hr 2123 maintains longstanding provisions designed to protect over 198 000 head start teachers and staff and over 1 450 000 parent volunteers from employment discrimination based on religion in federally funded head start programs as an organization whose membership is comprised of 150 000 people of faith and good will spanning 75 faith traditions i can think of no reason to justify an attempt to roll back these longstanding civil rights and religious liberty protections
indeed in a nation as intentionally and increasingly pluralistic as ours builtin protections prohibiting religious discrimination in federallyfunded programs represent a fundamental commitment towards a society that values the contributions and abilities of people of all faith traditions equally
religious organizations have had a long and proud history in their active participation in head start programs
for years congregations have made substantial contributions to their communities with the existing workplace protections in place
if those in congress who seek to repeal these employment safeguards are successful thousands of teachers and parent volunteers who have dedicated themselves to this program could find themselves no longer welcome at religiouslyaffiliated head start programs because they are of a different faith than the sponsoring organization
this bill has gained broad support among religious civil rights labor education health and advocacy organizations but that broad support will end if there is any threat to remove the longstanding critical civil rights protections in head start
dear member of congress i am writing on behalf of the over 1 050 congregations that make up the unitarian universalist association in regard to hr 2123 the school readiness act of 2005 the legislation to reauthorize the head start program
the unitarian universalist association would like to express our continued support of this program as we believe that head start is a successful and necessary program that helps prepare nearly 20 million lowincome children for success in kindergarten and later life
we are however concerned over proposals by committee leadership to offer a floor amendment to repeal civil rights protections in hiring in head start programs
the uua encourages you to pass a reauthorization bill that is truly bipartisan in recognizing the successes of the head start program and maintaining the high quality of comprehensive services it provides without repeal of longstanding civil rights protections
if such an amendment is included in the final bill we ask that you vote no on final passage of hr 2123
we urge you to oppose the repeal of longstanding civil rights protections designed to protect head start teachers staff and parent volunteers from employment discrimination based on religion in federally funded head start programs
this provision has worked for 24 years encouraging religious organizations to participate in head start and make invaluable contributions to children s education and wellbeing while maintaining constitutional and civil rights standards
this program is an excellent example of how religious organizations such as houses of worship work in partnership with the government without compromising either protections for religious minorities or the integrity of religious organizations
in faith robert c keithan international union clc washington dc september 20 2005
dear representative on behalf of 18 million members of the service employees international union seiu working in health care building services and federal state and local governments including more than 220 000 early education workers throughout the united states i write to encourage you to take a closer look at several key provisions in the head start reauthorization bill that could impact the quality of head start for children
since its inception in 1965 the head start program has enrolled more than 22 million children
head start not only prepares children for school by providing a solid foundation in cognitive learning and socialization skills but also helps make children ready to learn by providing comprehensive health dental and nutritional services critically needed by our atrisk children
seiu is committed to ensuring that children who participate in head start acquire the skills that prepare them for healthy successful lives
further there are no current incentives to retain highly qualified staff in head start programs after attaining degrees
two out of five preschool children about 800 000 and 97 percent of infants and toddlers who qualify for early head start can not participate in the program simply because there are not enough resources invested in the program
in addition the secretary has broad authority in identifying what a deficiency is the finding of which would require programs to recompete their grants
in the event a grantee is unsuccessful in a recompetition seiu continues to have concerns for existing head start workers who may be displaced by recompetition
moreover seiu supports parental involvement in head start programs and encourages members of congress to rethink its plan to diminish the role of policy councils
the bill has gained broad support among diverse advocacy organizations but that support will end if there is a successful effort to remove those protections in head start when the bill goes to the floor
if such an amendment is included in the final bill we urge you vote no on final passage of hr 2123
seiu remains troubled by the bill as it is currently constructed as outlined in the letter and we will endeavor to improve the legislation when the senate takes up reauthorization
dear representative as hr 2123 the school readiness act of 2005 moves towards a full vote in the house of representatives on thursday september 22 the children s defense fund is pleased to support many of the provisions on which the education and workforce committee has worked so thoughtfully and diligently
this unwarranted amendment would repeal the important civil rights protections that currently exist in head start that protect teachers and volunteers working in any head start program run by a religious organization
head start has been an important source of employment for countless parents but this provision could result in numerous parents losing their jobs preventing families of head start children from climbing the ladder out of poverty
parent involvement has played a critical role in the success of head start
head start is a critical program for our country s most vulnerable young children providing them with valuable tools for future success in life
what message does this send to the head start children when their teachers staff and parents are denied opportunities in head start simply because they do not share the federallyfunded employers religious beliefs
we are particularly concerned with statements made by chairman john boehner roh which indicate that his clear intention is to offer an amendment on the floor adding language to reverse the nondiscrimination provisions currently in effect in the head start program
while we do not hold a position on the overall legislation we have serious concerns with a provision that we understand will be offered on the floor that would roll back civil rights protections that have been in place and working effectively since 1972
by abandoning these nondiscrimination protections head start providers would be able to discriminate on the basis of religion in federally funded positions even when engaging in purely secular early childhood education activities
faithbased organizations have been partnering successfully with the government for a number of years without the need to bypass civil rights laws in their efforts to provide social services
this provision works well allowing religious organizations to participate in head start while maintaining constitutional and civil rights standards
dear member of congress on behalf of the national council of la raza nclr the largest national latino civil rights and advocacy organization in the us i write on an issue of great importance to the hispanic community
however nclr is concerned that this bipartisan work will be jeopardized by an amendment that would allow for employment discrimination based on religion in the program
for these reasons nclr has pursued a reauthorization agenda focused on ensuring that head start continues to show progress in its effort to eliminate disparities in access and enhance the quality of services for latino and limitedenglishproficient lep children and their families
we are pleased that members from both sides of the aisle supported this agenda and worked to include provisions in hr 2123 that significantly improve the program for latinos
an accountability provision which ensures that head start providers serve new populations in their local communities through enhanced monitoring and evaluations of annual community assessments
a new requirement that the secretary conduct a study on the status of lep children and their families in head start and early head start programs
a new requirement that the secretary utilize training and technical assistance funds for activities aimed at assisting head start providers to conduct outreach and improve the quality of services to lep populations particularly in states with new and rapidly growing lep populations
a new requirement that all head start parents receive information and services in their home language when possible
a new requirement that in addition to making progress toward acquisition of the english language leps show progress toward the school readiness indicators outlined in the head start education performance standards
in addition while nclr is pleased with the aforementioned provisions in hr 2123 we stand in solidarity with the broader civil rights community in our strong opposition to any amendment that could open the door to employment discrimination based on religion in the head start program
foremost such an amendment is unnecessary for ensuring greater participation from the faithbased sector in the program faithbased providers have served as an important partner in head start since the program s inception
moreover such an amendment will only serve to deter critical attention and debate away from provisions in the legislation that have garnered strong bipartisan support such as improvements to the program for latino children
we urge members of congress in closing nclr affirms its strong support of provisions included in hr 2123 which increase access to and improve the quality of head start for latino children
head start programs not only offer opportunities to thousands of lowincome children they also enrich their communities by providing job opportunities to over a third of the parents whose children have participated in the program
however in a statement released by the committee on education and the workforce on may 5 2005 chairman boehner stated that he anticipates and supports an amendment on the house floor to rollback longstanding critical civil rights protections
this type of amendment would be a direct attack on bipartisan antidiscrimination provisions that have been part of head start since its creation in 1981 and can not be tolerated
people for the american way can not support a compromise that does not ensure that the existing civil rights protections in hr 2123 are not summarily removed on the house floor
proponents of anticivil rights provisions claim there is a need to exempt religious organizations from antidiscrimination laws in order to protect the religious identity of that organization
under this model religious organizations have provided an invaluable contribution to the education of thousands of head start students and to the communities in which they live
congress should not adopt changes that would alter this beneficial relationship particularly when there is no evidence that religious organizations are actively seeking the religious exemption in question
for these reasons we urge you to continue efforts to ensure that this legislation remains bipartisan as well as oppose any attempts to repeal longstanding antidiscrimination provisions in hr 2123
dear representatives on behalf of the union for reform judaism whose 900 congregations across north america encompass 15 million reform jews and the central conference of american rabbis ccar whose membership includes over 1800 reform rabbis i strongly urge you to maintain the bipartisan character of the school readiness act of 2005 hr 2123 by opposing any attempt to repeal longstanding civil rights protections that prohibit faithbased head start centers from discriminating in whom they hire on the basis of religion
this is especially problematic in relation to head start
one s faith does not determine how one reads a book to preschoolers or sings the alphabet song to deny children living in poverty the most qualified teacher is nothing short of an attack on head start s core mission preparing children to succeed in school
in fact the family and child experiences survey prepared in january 2002 for the us department of health and human services found that over 40 percent of head start staff members had children in their households who were current or former head start participants
to plainly state such intentions diminishes the muchheralded bipartisan spirit of the bill and undermines the gains made thus far in the markup process
asked to tell of his special merit he replied i teach children of the poor as well as of the rich i accept no fee from any who can not afford it and i have a fishpond to delight the children and to encourage them to do their lessons since 1965 through its comprehensive services and high quality standards head start has striven to give millions of children an equal opportunity to succeed in school nurturing their love of learning and delight in life
i urge you to protect such opportunity for our nation s teachers parents and children by opposing any attempt to repeal the civil rights protections in hr 2123
the bill approved 480 by the house committee on education and the workforce that reaches the house floor is the product of many months of hard work resulting in a strong bipartisan agreement
it maintains critical civil rights protections in head start preventing religious discrimination in federally funded head start positions
we stand united to oppose this unwarranted attack on a vital civil rights provision that protects over 16 million teachers and parent volunteers from having to choose between their religion and their participation in the local head start program
as religious institutions we support preserving the autonomy of religious organizations with respect to hiring decisions made in privately funded programs
the longstanding nondiscrimination provision included in head start legislation since 1972 strikes the appropriate balance between religious autonomy and nondiscrimination
dear representative omb watch strongly urges you to oppose the any attempt to include charitable choice provisions in the head start program which would allow religious organizations to discriminate on the basis of the religion when hiring for federally funded programs
religious organizations play a meaningful role in the delivery of social service programs
we do not question the right of religious organizations to participate in federal programs nor their ability to avail themselves of an exemption under title vii of the civil rights act of 1964 that allows religious organizations to hire coreligionists with their own money
however we do question whether federal dollars should fund discrimination by the very few religious organizations that refuse to follow the same rules that all other organizations participating in federal programs follow
in addition the federal government has constitutional obligations reinforced by chief justice rehnquist s majority opinion in bowen v kendrick 487 us 589 1988
the court stated that although the constitution does not bar religious organizations from participating in federal programs it requires 1 that no one participating in a federal program can discriminate on the basis of religion and 2 that all federal programs must be carried out in a lawful secular manner id
the acceptance of federal funds taxpayer money should require all recipients to practice nondiscrimination in hiring as it relates to those funds
in fact if my colleagues read the cases they point out that if you are using federal money you can not discriminate
i believe it is critical to head start that we put this back in
but two points first off i thank the chairman and the committee on rules for allowing an amendment in order that they do not support and i appreciate that and i want to thank them for that
we need to address it in conference if we do not today but it is the number one empowerment program in america
but i want to again thank the chairman for his leadership in trying to clean up the financial problems
mr chairman first i want to again thank the chairman for making my amendment in order
after the great society was less than sensitive to many urban areas in the united states empowerment movements developed in america led actually by a leftist named sal olinsky that said local people when they are being displaced ought to have more input into the decisions that are being made in their lives
this happened originally in chicago and it is something that we are looking at doing in new orleans in the name of empowerment
we saw when the republicans came to power in the 1980s and to the presidency president reagan put jack kemp in charge of hud housing and urban development and we had tenant management and resident management moving to homeownership and we said let the people make the decisions themselves
head start when it came in the 1970s as part of richard nixon s efforts to block grant to give more local empowerment to react to the programs of the 1960s the heart and soul of this program was to say we are going to let the parents in these preschool situations in these lowincome situations we are going to let them make the decisions
it is not going to be like ptas in schools where often they become fundraising supplements and they are allowed to give their opinions but they have no vote
this bill unfortunately because of a broader concern about how to address some of the problems in head start removes the voting rights the actual powers of those parents
there is no reference to the parents in the gao report other than one
it is not because of the boards because in the gao report the boards are only mentioned twice because they had financial problems
the underlying part of the bill addresses the financial difficulties that we have and we have added in our amendment to make sure that fraud is actually addressed because there the board has legal liability if there is fraud but not what is being served for lunch or what textbook or even who is hired and fired
how are we going to move ahead in new orleans with this attitude
we can not one week strip the number one empowerment program in america and the next week say we are going to empower in new orleans
the only reference in the hearings i believe was actually on the senate side from the deputy mayor of memphis who complained that he did not have decisionmaking powers to make some changes that he wanted to make but it was not financial abuse or financial waste
there are problems in the whole system but mostly it is the grantees and the board that have been the problems
in this case it is not a question of whether the parents have veto power
the board tends to be leading citizens of the community who come in and review that
we just went through this in highintensity drug trafficking areas where we tried to take the voting power away and we resisted that in congress
this is a tremendous reversal for either side of the aisle to make of the number one parent advisory program in america
two of which have been enrolled and ongoing participants in cani s headstart program my third child is going into her 2nd grade year with adams elementary fort wayne community schools
it has not only allowed for me to be more involved in the decisions that affect my children it has also allowed me to be involved in some of the decisions that affect my community
i believe it would be an injustice to take this away from so many who are currently involved and those in the future that have yet to benefit
dear congressman souder i am writing to urge you to support the restoration of full authority to parent policy councils in head start reauthorization legislation
it is my observation that parents provided with a meaningful governing role in their children s head start education gain valuable skills that will help them to proactively support their children s education in elementary middle high school and beyond
the personal growth of parents involved in the head start program is a natural consequence of their participation in head start governance
weakening or eliminating this role will eliminate a valuable training resource for parents and will make them less effective in supporting their children s future education
i have been a community representative on the cani head start policy council in fort wayne for two years
this group provides many opportunities for fathers grandfathers uncles and other adult males to interact significantly with their children in positive ways
this is particularly significant in lowincome communities where children need positive adult male role models
i hope that my views will be addressed in your vote for the reauthorization of head start
sincerely indiana pta hammond in july 11 2005
the program offers opportunities early in the lives of children to build skills that will be needed in school and in life
research shows that the sooner children are in a structured educational environment the better their performance is throughout their formal education
i became involved in head start in 1995 when my son entered the program and have continued to volunteerwork with head start though the years
it is because of the parent involvement component of the head start program that parent involvement became so important in my life
many of these children continue on to kindergarten because they have a head start in education and their parents realize how important early intervention is
since kindergarten is not mandated in indiana many children come to school for the first time when entering the 1st grade
mr chairman i rise today in opposition of hr 2123 the school readiness act of 2005
that bill s new teacher qualifications and increased accountability would have greatly improved the educational outcomes for children in the head start program
instead the republican majority has added an amendment which would for the first time in head start s 30year history allow a faithbased sponsored head start program to use federal taxpayer dollars to discriminate against highly qualified teachers and other employees solely because of their religious views
groups including the baptist joint committee american jewish congress and african american ministers in action oppose the notion that head start should allow religious discrimination
perhaps what is most abhorrent is that the republican party wants to institutionalize discrimination in a program that provides early childhood development and educational services that are intended to prepare lowincome children to enter kindergarten and improve their success later in life
including children with disabilities in head start programs can be a rewarding experience for all involved children parents and of course head start employees
however the underlying legislation i think perhaps can be strengthened in this area
include families who have one or more children with disabilities in the list of training course subjects the secretary is directed to provide for head start training employees so they can cope with that
i know the worry and concern parents feel when they entrust the most precious being in their lives to the care of a stranger
proper training of head start employees will enable them to anticipate possible challenges evaluate the current difficulties that they may or may not have and will educate the employees in current strategies and resources which are available to parents
for parents piece of mind it is imperative that those individuals caring for their children are simply equipped to handle any situation that may arise in that classroom
when required to include a student with disabilities in her classroom she then received the necessary training to do it
on november 3 2001 i never thought anything good could come out from having him in my class
they are also able to give children specific strategies to handle these feelings their feelings on their own so that they in turn will feel more in control
by attending head start programs staffed with trained professionals children will experience less stress be more comfortable with their peers accustom themselves with the behavioral expectations of classrooms and learn strategies to deal with the inevitable distractions that are in a school setting
mr chairman i rise in support of this bill
what we have to remember is this is about the children children whose families are trapped in poverty trying to get a head start on education which is the surest way out of poverty
it is disappointing to me there are some in here because we provide some level of flexibility and perhaps in some community it is a faithbased operation that can deliver the services best to a poor child in need of these services that there are some willing to kill head start because of that level of flexibility
in my hometown thankfully it is the public school systems that have taken over the head start program because we suffered through the difficulties of financial problems
fortunately omaha public schools have taken over head start in omaha nebraska providing over a thousand children an opportunity to have a coordinated head start educational program a better education program with assurances to the parents that it is going to be there next year
in fact they have even got a very progressive system for head start children based on educare an outstanding private preschool program that involves a holistic approach of the entire family
i want to end by thanking the gentleman from ohio mr boehner xz4000360 because he also recognizes there was a glitch a glitch that eliminated some of the lowerlevel rankandfile service men and women from having their children in head start programs because of privatization of military housing
a national review of 36 studies on the longterm impact of early childhood education programs found that lowincome children who participated in such programs were less likely to be held back less likely to be placed in special education classes more likely to succeed in school more likely to graduate and more likely to be rated as behaving well in class and better adjusted in school
researchers have also concluded that there is a greater chance of these positive outcomes when young children are taught by teachers with bachelor s degrees in early childhood education
one of the largest national studies in this early education field was conducted by the national institute for child health and human development
it showed that caregiver education and training were among the strongest predictors of quality in programs for preschoolers
that is why it is a good thing that this bill has in it a provision that half of the head start teachers have to hold bachelor s degrees within a few years
we talked in committee about the fact that it is necessary for us to try to help that population of teachers be able to afford that
in massachusetts my state they make less than half the salaries of kindergarten teachers
that is why it was unanimous approval essentially in committee
i am afraid some of the recommendations that are being put forward in the amendments here today are spectacular efforts to drive a wedge between the parties on this to make it a lessthanunanimous bill
it is unnecessary it is unfortunate and i hope there is no discrimination in hiring practices
mr chairman i rise in support of this bill though i have concerns about one specific provision that would go too far to allow discrimination
the basic tenet of head start is as true today as it was a generation ago quality early education programs can be instrumental in helping children overcome barriers to learning
this program not only plays an important role in providing opportunities for the next generation but also has an important impact on our economy
removing the outside forces that result in underprepared students opens up children s minds to learn and gain an education
head start is one of the most important programs in our government and i am pleased to see this bill come to the floor with bipartisan support
unfortunately i have concerns about an amendment passed by this body that allows faithbased head start grantees to discriminate in hiring based on religion
federally supported programs should never support discrimination in its programs on any level
since head starts inception in 1972 it has never discriminated in hiring for faith based and other organizations
while forprofit head start grantees play an important role in school readiness i do not support allowing them to collect a profit from federal grants provided to serve lowincome students
so mr chairman i am voting in favor of this bill
i was pleased to join with many of my colleagues on the other side in offering amendments that were supported on a bipartisan basis that i think strengthen the head start program
i am very sorry that that bipartisan consensus may be shattered and it will be shattered if we later adopt the boustany amendment because make no mistake about it the boustany amendment is in fact an attack on religious liberty in this country
we have seen it in response to hurricane katrina
the question is whether we should eliminate the protections in current law against discrimination based upon religion or whether we should preserve those protections
in all of the hearings that we have held in our committee on this issue no faithbased organization has ever come up and said gee we could do a better job of teaching children if only we were allowed to discriminate in hiring teachers
mr chairman in solidarity with the national head start association the children s defense fund and countless other lifelong advocates of the head start program it is with a heavy heart that i must oppose this final amended version of the head start reauthorization on the floor today
it was nt perfect and it did not reflect in every respect the head start reauthorization i would have written
but unlike failed initiatives in the recent past the committee reported bill did not walk down the misguided path of block granting the head start program
with the inclusion of the boustany amendment this bill for the first time seeks to legitimize publicly funded religious discrimination in the head start program
it takes money from taxpayers and then turns around and tells those same taxpayers they can be excluded from federally funded jobs in a head start center solely on the basis of their religious beliefs
in effect it is a green light for religious bigotry
it has no place in the head start program and it is precisely the wrong message to be sending to our nation s children
prior to ever being elected to office and serving in the state legislature or congress i worked 6 years for head start
i love head start and i have a great appreciation for what my government has done in creating this program to give poor kids and the kids of working families an opportunity to get a head start to get prepared for kindergarten and to get prepared for success
it teaches parents that they can have involvement in their children s educational destiny
i think the committee did a good job in working through some of the problems
the gentleman knows he is killing head start by putting this amendment on the floor to put religious involvement in the program
a faithbased initiative has no place in head start
on sunday morning in america religion is the most segregated sector of our society
whites go to white churches blacks go to black churches greeks go to greek churches muslims are in their mosque jews are in their synagogue and that is all right
do not say to people because you are a different faith you can not work in this head start program
mr speaker i rise in opposition to this rule
the committee on education and the workforce voted for this head start bill unanimously 48 to 0 but many of our republican colleagues today would destroy this bill making it partisan by allowing religious discrimination in hiring while using federal funds using taxpayer dollars
in a country as wealthy as ours this is not acceptable
the good news is that our committee worked in a bipartisan way to report out a bill by a vote of 48 to zero
in other words there is no state block granting
it is unusual for me to be the one explaining to my republican colleagues how market forces work but in this case it is pretty clear they do not get it
apparently the problem is that religious organizations want to discriminate in hiring when they are using public funds your tax dollars
we are talking about using federal funds taxpayers dollars or they are talking about it in order to enhance religious discrimination
mr chairman in response to the chairman we are talking about taxpayers money to support religious discrimination
the more diverse our teachers are the better they will be able to understand the experiences of children in our evermore diverse society and the better they will be able to help those children learn
and the children will also learn better because they will have models that they are missing in their lives right now
it goes hand in hand
but this administration rushed to test hundreds of thousands of children and in so doing used tests that are invalid and unreliable
moreover in its rush the administration also seems to have virtually no idea how to use this unreliable data
this amendment will improve outreach and coordination of services for these very children and this will help ensure that they receive the services they need to succeed in school and in life
mr chairman i rise in strong opposition to the musgrave amendment
that is unless this amendment passes and the grantee is a forprofit organization in which case under my colleague s amendment the difference between the 15 percent and lower expenses simply would be in the pocket of the forprofit organization
i only hope that the majority will be as willing to spend federal dollars on serving the children as they would be in giving those dollars to forprofit companies
this amendment allows displaced families to enroll their children under the age of 5 in head start
in mississippi 44 head start centers were impacted by hurricane katrina 18 centers will be closed indefinitely and 26 more are in need of repair
in the aftermath the number is expected to double
in the neighboring state of louisiana 117 centers were impacted 83 remain closed and 34 centers are providing partial services
in alabama 9 centers were impacted 3 centers will be closed indefinitely and 6 are in need of repair
this amendment provides a waiver for 6 months for those families that do not have proof of immunizations and income levels to participate in the head start program
if you want families to come back and restore their communities their children need to be safe and healthy in environments where they can learn and play
i hope that the majority will also join us in the coming days to appropriate supplemental funds for these same children
under current law religious organizations can and do participate in head start and they always have from the very beginning
as the state president of the louisiana head start association i strongly oppose such an amendment then she goes on to say i am greatly concerned that the provision to remove civil rights protections for employees could have a negative impact on the children and families who participate in these programs
tens of thousands of atrisk 3 and 4yearold children currently in head start could lose their teachers who often are the most important adults to whom they have bonded other than their parents not because those teachers are doing a bad job but because they are the wrong religion that was barbara pickney st
it will strip civil rights protections by allowing religious organizations to discriminate in hiring on the basis of religion for head start positions and i repeat using federal taxpayers money
mr chairman i thank the chairman for yielding me this time and allowing me to participate in this discussion
we know that children who begin kindergarten and first grade prepared both socially and mentally to learn have a much greater opportunity of success not just in school but in life
the school readiness act addresses financial management weaknesses found in the current head start system and publicly documented in various news accounts
the director of a head start program in gardenville maryland was indicted on charges that she stole more than 350 000 from the organization over a 4year period
a former director of a head start program in charleston west virginia was sentenced up to 5 months in federal prison after admitting he used an agency credit card for a personal trip to the kentucky derby and preparing a false invoice for computer repairs
rather than investing money in student nutrition this director took this money from school cafeterias and went to the horse races
the executive director of the kansas city missouri head start operation earned a salary in excess of 300 000 annually and drove a luxury suv leased in part with federal head start funds
mr chairman it is a priority of this republican congress to ensure that the necessary financial controls are in place to safeguard against these abuses and to protect the public s confidence in this important school readiness program
safeguards against financial abuse in this bill include an independent financial audit annually an annual report detailing how their money is spent and the sources of their funding oversight by a local governance board and a requirement that administrative costs may not exceed more than 15 percent of the total program cost
congress must not ignore the evidence that much money invested in the head start program currently never reaches the disadvantaged children it is intended to serve
mr speaker i rise in opposition to the rule and in strong opposition to the boustany amendment and to add my name to the chorus of religious individuals and organizations that oppose this illconceived and harmful amendment
as an ordained minister of the united methodist church i recognize the important role faithbased organizations play in providing educational health and social support services to lowincome children and their parents
the faithbased community has long played an active role in operating head start programs and has done so while upholding the constitution and civil rights standards
in fact my first job after college was working in catholic charities which received tens of millions of federal dollars to run programs
in my religious tradition we give great recognition to the apostle paul who said there is neither greek nor jew circumcision nor uncircumcision barbarian scythian bond nor free and it goes on to say put on therefore as the elect of god holy and beloved tender mercies kindness humbleness of mind meekness long suffering that is not in this amendment
tens of thousands of children currently in head start could lose their teachers to whom they have bonded
and their parents could be denied the chance to climb out of poverty by moving from head start discriminating against current and potential teachers because of religion causing children to lose one of the most important adults in their lives denying parents the chance to elevate themselves out of poverty
there is no doubt in my mind that these things are not only harmful they are immoral
i am proud to be an american for so many reasons first among them because i am able to think speak and believe whatever i want freely as stated in the first amendment to our constitution
our children deserve the very best education and if a religious organization is going to provide that education better then we must not stand in the way
are we going to deny many of the poorest and less fortunate children the opportunity to learn in these early childhood education programs simply because it is a church that is administering it
this nation is second to none in charitable giving and at helping others in need
mr chairman i rise in support of the boustany amendment which seeks to include important protections for religious organizations in this bill
as i stated in my remarks during consideration of the rule this nation is second to none in charitable giving and in helping others in need
yet groups that are religious in nature are not allowed to hire according to their ideology and mission
i rise in support of the boustany amendment
it could be if the government wants to take advantage of the location let us say of a hebrew school in downtown new york that it is the best possible route of caring for people in need in that area
in a 1987 case corporation of the presiding bishop v amos the court supported this kind of approach
i am familiar with this working with the texas migrant council in my district laredo texas
this is a case where a small increase in funding can make a big difference to a lot of children changing the path they are on
i know that for the migrant farm worker population facing a unique set of challenges working on a seasonal basis migrant families often have to move from state to state during the year making it extremely difficult for the children to get in and remain in highquality educational programs
when they are in the fields parents often work 12 hours a day or more making it very difficult for child care
mr speaker i rise today in support of a program that works head start and our efforts today to reauthorize the program in this school readiness act
an investment of 100 000 means that ultimately you would see 700 000 in your account
in fact with those returns we should be authorizing a higher level of funding
earlier this year i visited two of the over 110 head start centers in sacramento county in my district
with a goal in mind maybe not consciously outlined but still a hint of an idea these children began to dream about the positive benefits of education and where in life an education can take them
head start emerged from the civil rights platform of equality and minimizing the reach of poverty in this nation
mr chairman i rise in support of hr 420 the lawsuit abuse and reduction act lara and i oppose the substitute amendment
in particular lara would make mandatory the sanctions and monetary penalties under federal rule 11 of the federal rules of civil procedure for filing frivolous lawsuits and abusing the litigation process
it would also permit monetary sanctions including reimbursement of reasonable attorneys fees and litigation costs in connection with frivolous lawsuits
it would extends rule 11 s provisions to include state cases in which the state judge finds the case substantially affects interstate commerce
this legislation protects the integrity of the judicial system by penalizing the bad actors in litigation both plaintiffs and defendants i might say
this is in essence legal blackmail and needs to be ended
mr chairman i want to first of all commend the gentleman from texas for his leadership in this area
i think he does us all proud by pushing for this and ultimately i believe being successful in its passage
it is reassuring to once again see that the congress is taking measures to help rid our court system of lawsuits that are costly and hurt both consumers and businesses in our country
the legislation is aimed at enforcing the laws that govern attorneys in relation to filing frivolous lawsuits
in 1993 the civil rules advisory committee an unelected body decided that sanctions against attorneys who file frivolous lawsuits should be optional
justice david brewer once wrote america is the paradise of lawyers in my opinion this paradise has resulted in increased prices for consumer goods and higher insurance premiums and a decrease in domestic manufacturing which has been one of the things that we have heard more and more discussion about in this country the loss of manufacturing jobs
hr 420 seeks to rein in lawsuithappy litigators by restoring mandatory sanctions for filing frivolous lawsuits a violation of rule 11 of the federal rules of civil procedure
finally the bill would apply a threestrikesandyouareout rule as we have heard to attorneys who commit three or more rule 11 violations in federal district court
most business decisions today are made with this new reality in mind
it will allow business owners to focus on hiring new employees which is really critical in this economy that we are faced with and expanding the availability of products and services and improving the american economy
mr chairman i again want to thank the gentleman from texas for his leadership in introducing this important piece of legislation
it is time that we put an end to these frivolous lawsuits that are impacting the economy that are hurting especially small businesses and are resulting in the loss of jobs of many many americans in this country
it waives all points of order against consideration of the bill and it provides that the amendment in the nature of a substitute recommended by the committee on the judiciary now printed in the bill shall be considered as an original bill for the purpose of amendment and shall be considered as read
it makes in order only those amendments printed in the rules committee report accompanying the resolution
it provides that the amendments printed in the report may be offered only in the order printed may be offered only by the member designated in the report shall be considered as read shall be debatable for the time specified in the report equally divided and controlled by the proponent and an opponent shall not be subject to amendment and shall not be subject to a demand for division of the question in the house or in the committee of the whole
this resolution waives all points of order against the amendments printed in the report and it provides one motion to recommit with or without instructions
madam speaker i rise today in support of house resolution 508 and the underlying legislation hr 420 the lawsuit abuse reduction act of 2005
on october 24 we passed and sent to the president s desk s 397 the lawful commerce in arms act of 2005 by a vote of 283 to 144 in the house
i might add that in the spirit of bipartisanship 59 democrats and one independent joined 223 republicans in passing this landmark legislation that refocuses liability for gun violence on the actual criminal the person who pulled the trigger
additionally in this house 226 republicans along with 80 democrats passed hr 554 the personal responsibility in food consumption act of 2005
last week there were probably millions of people across this country who tuned in ticket in hand to see if they had won a 340 million powerball jackpot
unfortunately there are also people who look to the courts legal briefs in hand as if it were the powerball lottery
in fact the current tort system is estimated to cost american people well over 200 billion per year
clearly the lawsuit abuse reduction act of 2005 is a bill that is sorely overdue sorely needed and i might add was approved by this house in the last congress by a vote of 229 to 174
madam speaker hr 420 also would prevent forum shopping by requiring that personal injury cases only be brought in those jurisdictions either where the plaintiff the defendant or a related business resides or where the alleged injury or surrounding circumstances occurred
this act would also institute a threestrikesandyoureout sanction that would suspend an attorney from practicing in federal court if a federal judge determines the lawyer has violated rule 11 on three or more occasions
personal responsibility and professional accountability should be the rule for those in the legal field too and that is why this house should pass this bill
in closing madam speaker i would just emphasize that house resolution 508 is a straightforward rule and hr 420 is a straightforward bill
madam speaker in response to some of the comments that were made i just want to hold up this document that lists over 300 groups in support of lara the lawsuit abuse reduction act of 2005 and i will include them in the record
i would like to also point out that the federal judicial center was in opposition to class action reform which we passed in the previous congress and in the 108th by a vote in this body of 279 to 149
chamber of commerce for anderson amp madison county in
crawfordsvillemontgomery chamber of commerce in
so i think that there is a little balance there if that be true in either instance
contrary to what the opponents of legal reform might say the underlying bill as well as other recent bills do not demonstrate contempt for our legal system or the esteemed profession of attorneys but rather demonstrate respect for the important and historic role of our judicial system in defending the rights and ensuring the constitutional application of the laws
for the sake of the courts and for the sake of the american people we in this house need to push forward with this additional meaningful and genuine reform
i rise in opposition of hr 420 and in support of the substitute
in fact my concern about it is it is unnecessary and it will infringe on states being able to manage their own court systems
rule 11 of the federal rules of civil procedure was amended in 1993 to its current state because it was being abused by defendants in civil rights cases who filed a series of rule 11 motions to harass the men and women who challenged discrimination
usually this type of change in civil procedure goes through a process of the rules enabling act
but in this instance we have decided to circumvent the united states judicial conference and the united states supreme court
additionally this bill dictates where plaintiffs can file a personal injury lawsuit against a corporation in a state court
do we really want to get into the jurisdictional battles in our states
we simply do not have the right to tell state and county courthouses across the nation how to enforce sanctions in their courtrooms or where the plaintiff may file a lawsuit in the state courts
mr chairman i rise in opposition to hr 420 a measure that purports to reduce frivolous lawsuits
hr 420 substantially changes state court procedure by forcing state judges within 30 days of a case being filed to conduct an extensive and lengthy pretrial hearing to determine whether federal sanctions must be imposed in a state proceeding
this would require a judge to examine evidence in detail and even to make a pretrial judgment as to what the outcome of a case might be
state courts should not be forced to spend scarce taxpayer money to conduct an expensive hearing in order to apply a federal rule that mirrors a mechanism they already have in place
mr speaker while the committee on rules reported out a rule that made in order a substantive amendment offered by the gentleman from california mr schiff i rise in opposition to it h res 508 because the legislation underlying is pernicious
as i mentioned during the committee on the judiciary s oversight hearing on this legislation during its first iteration in the 108th congress and reiterated in my statement for the markup one of the main functions of that body s oversight is to analyze potentially negative impact against the benefits that a legal process or piece of legislation will have on those affected
in the case of hr 4571 the lawsuit abuse reduction act the oversight functions of the judiciary committee allowed us to craft a bill that will protect those affected from negative impacts of the shield from liability that it proposes
this legislation requires an overhaul in order to make it less of a misnomer to reduce abuse rather than encourage it
tort law always assigns liability to the party in the best position to prevent an injury in the most reasonable and fair manner
in looking at the disparate impact that the new tort reform laws will have on ethnic minority groups it is unconscionable that the burden will be placed on these groups that are in the worst position to bear the liability costs
national uniformity is also an important consideration in federalism congress exclusive jurisdiction over interstate commerce has allowed our economy to grow dramatically over the past 200 years
this legislation would reverse the changes to rule 11 of the federal rules of civil procedure frcp that were made by the judicial conference in 1993 such that 1 sanctions against an attorney whose litigation tactics are determined to harass or cause unnecessary delay or cost or who has been determined to have made frivolous legal arguments or unwarranted factual assertions would become mandatory rather than discretionary to the court 2 discoveryrelated activity would be included within the scope of the rule and 3 the rule would be extended to state cases affecting interstate commerce so that if a state judge decides that a case affects interstate commerce he or she must apply rule 11 if violations are found
this legislation strips state and federal judges of their discretion in the area of applying rule 11 sanctions
why is the discretion of the judge not sufficient in discerning whether rule 11 sanctions should be assessed
if this legislation moves forward in this body it will be important for us to find out its effect on indigent plaintiffs or those who must hire an attorney strictly on a contingent fee basis
because the application of rule 11 would be mandatory attorneys will pad their legal fees to account for the additional risk that they will have to incur in filing lawsuits and the fact that they will have no opportunity to withdraw the suit due to a mistake
furthermore hr 4571 as drafted would allow corporations that perform sham and noneconomic transactions in order to enjoy economic benefits in this country
i believe in his unabiding commitment to the integrity to the judicial system
that is why i rise to quote him when he says that there is a premise that we all deserve justice and that justice in essence should not be denied
it is interesting in the backdrop of the united states promoting democratization in iraq challenging iran and now with the proceedings against saddam hussein and the very basis of our dependence upon a fair and impartial judicial system that will allow lawyers to be able to petition for their client or defend their client that we would stand here on the floor of the house today and in essence create the lawsuit elimination legislation rather than the suggestion that we are preventing abuse
that means that in essence it forces state judges within 30 days of a case being filed to conduct an extensive and lengthy pretrial hearing to determine whether federal rule 10 must be imposed
we already know that federal rule 11 has given the court system an effective tool to ensure if you will that if there is frivolous activity in the courthouse or a lawyer files a frivolous case that lawyer can be sanctioned
because you may be able to sue in a state court but the state court may not have jurisdiction over that foreign corporation leaving the victim of products liability the victim of a terrible heinous accident left without remedy in a state court
then for myself as an african american and someone whose very existence is based upon the privileges that thurgood marshall had and many other lawyers to go into the courthouse and at that time and era in the early 1940s and 1950s speak language that could have been considered frivolous i would suggest that just in a general sense whether or not this particular legislation speaks particularly to that issue there are many times in our history where lawyers may be considered frivolous because they are speaking a language that opposes society
it should be left to the judges in rule 11
mr chairman i would simply say this is a bill that has no basis in need and we should unanimously defeat it
mr chairman i rise in opposition to the base bill before the committee of the whole hr 4571 the lawsuit abuse reduction act of 2005 and state my support for the substitute offered by the gentleman from as california mr schiff
as i mentioned during the committee on the judiciary s oversight hearing on this legislation during its iteration in the 108th congress and reiterated in my statement for the markup one of the main functions of the congress before it passes legislation is to analyze potentially negative impact against the benefits that it might have on those affected
in the case of hr 4571 the lawsuit abuse reduction act the oversight functions of the judiciary committee allowed us to craft a bill that will protect those affected from negative impacts of the shield from liability that it proposes

because the application of rule 11 would be mandatory attorneys will pad their legal fees to account for the additional risk that they will have to incur in filing lawsuits and the fact that they will have no opportunity to withdraw the suit due to a mistake
furthermore hr 4571 as drafted would allow corporations that perform sham and noneconomic transactions in order to enjoy economic benefits in this country
the benedict arnold corporation refers to a company that in bad faith takes advantage loopholes in our tax code to establish bank accounts or to ship jobs abroad for the main purpose of tax avoidance
the percentage of increase in the number of tax havens held by these corporations since between 857 percent and 9 650 percent
this significant increase in the number of corporate tax havens is no coincidence when we look at the benefits that can be fund in doing sham business transactions
some of these corporations are benedict arnolds because they have given up their american citizenship however they still conduct a substantial amount of their business in the united states and enjoy tax deductions of domestic corporations
in the context of the judiciary s consideration of the terrorist penalties enhancement act hr 2934 my colleagues accepted an amendment that i offered that ensured that corporate felons were included in the list of individuals eligible for prosecution for committing terrorist offenses
mr chairman i was listening to the gentleman framing the question and the gentleman framed the question i think in the way that we should ask our colleagues for them to give us an answer
i think what the gentleman has suggested in his very detailed and eloquent presentation there is a judicial system in place that is functioning and functional
therefore if there are issues that we can improve in the judiciary let us do it
but i am just looking at some information here that tells me that federal litigation is in fact decreasing
a 2005 report issued by the us department of justice says that the us district courts in some areas of course fell 79 percent fell 79 percent the cases the tort cases between 1985 and 2003
according to the administrative office of the us courts tort actions in the us district courts went down from 29 percent from 2002 to 2003 so it fell 28 percent
in addition over the last 5 years federal civil filings have not only decreased 8 percent but the prefilings that are personal injury cases has also declined
mr chairman i rise in opposition to hr 420 legislation that would have a chilling effect on a plaintiff s ability to seek recourse in court
what is very interesting is even though my colleague cited john kerry john edwards president bush and the judiciary committee not one of them have sat as a judge in a case making decisions about rule 11 cases
i am proud to say that i served as a judge for 10 years in the trial court in the state of ohio and have had the ability to review complaints review discovery decisions review pleadings
and judges should be vested with the same discretion they are vested with in other situations and not be subjected to this rule 11 sanctions piece that is being proposed by this legislation
what is going to make business do better in the united states of america is this country having a policy that encourages business
what is going to make people work better in the united states of america is having greater opportunity for business and you can not blame business not doing well on lawsuits just as you can not blame doctors running all over creation because of medical malpractice
i encourage all of my colleagues to take a close look at what this legislation will do to take a close look and listen to the arguments that are being made by my colleagues with regard to this legislation and vote in opposition to hr 420
most importantly we need to protect those small business people who are out there creating 70 percent of all new jobs in america
second this bill has teeth in it by having a threestrikesandyoureout penalty
three strikes and you re out means if a judge finds that they have violated rule 11 bringing a frivolous claim on three separate occasions they will be suspended from practicing law in that particular federal court for 1 year and will have to reapply for practice there
he said in newsweek magazine december 15 2003 frivolous lawsuits waste good people s time and hurt the real victims
if a lawyer files three junk lawsuits he will lose the right to appear in federal court for 3 years
three strikes and you re out the austin american statesman summarized president bush s plan as saying bush s plan includes stiffer penalties for lawsuits determined by judges to be frivolous including a threestrikesandyoureout rule for lawyers who repeatedly file such claims on the day before we marked up this bill in the judiciary committee may 24 2005 i visited with president bush in his personal residence and asked him mr president do you still stand by this policy that we need three strikes and you re out to crack down on frivolous lawsuits
it is the same language that we had in the class action legislation which was approved on a bipartisan basis by both the house and the senate and signed into law
for example if you lived in orlando florida like i do and you went to your local mcdonald s and you slipped on a puddle of water you could bring your suit in orlando where it should be
what you could not do is say well i know that madison county illinois is a judicial hellhole and there are lots of plaintifffriendly judges and mcdonald s does business up in madison county illinois
in short this is a commonsense bill that provides tough mandatory sanctions to crack down on frivolous suits and includes provisions that enjoy bipartisan support
i also commend the gentleman from new york mr nadler xz4002890 for the important issues that he has raised in regards to this important legislation
mr chairman i think we can all concede or stipulate that no one is in favor of frivolous lawsuits in this country
as a former special prosecutor state prosecutor in wisconsin and as a young lawyer who used to handle corporate litigation in a large law firm i saw firsthand some of the abuses that take place in the judicial process
but i believe that there is a right and a wrong way of moving forward in dealing with the frivolous lawsuit situation in the country
there has been a lot of rhetoric from some of our colleagues here claiming that the real bane of the judicial system today are a bunch of trial attorneys running around chasing ambulances filing needless personal injury cases clogging the court system driving up litigation costs increasing the expenses of corporations and that is what is to be blamed in regards to dealing with frivolous lawsuits when in fact the facts indicate just the opposite
a recent comprehensive study by public citizen has shown that the explosion in the filing of lawsuits has really rested with the corporations of this country who have been filing four to five times more claims and lawsuits than individual plaintiffs in this country
furthermore when rule 11 sanctions have been applied they have been applied in 69 percent of the cases against corporations that are abusing the discovery process or filing needless lawsuits
so it is not these moneygrubbing trial attorneys that so many want to believe that exist out there that are causing a lot of the problem in the judicial system it is rather corporations that are increasing it
it is those who are most eager to support the majority base bill who are most likely to take advantages of the opportunities of filing lawsuits in our country
when congress passed that it was a recognition that we here really do not have a lot of good expertise and we are not in the trenches dealing with these rules every day
finally and as the gentleman from california indicated we have a shortterm memory problem in this congress
this has been tried between 1983 and 1993 and the rules were changed because it was not working because we were taking away too much discretion from the judges in the application of rule 11
it had a disproportionate impact on the filing of civil rights actions in this country
this is significant because as the gentleman from california pointed out that when there were attempts to stifle meritorious claims from going forward or increasing the litigation costs in lawsuits it was usually in the civil rights actions that were taken during this period which led to the change and the reform of mandatory sanctions back to a discretionary system allowing the judges to decide the application of the appropriate penalties based on the facts and circumstances of the case
it is about a young mother of two who took a job in the taconite mining company in northern minnesota and entered an atmosphere and environment of pervasive sexual harassment that not only applied to her but all the women that were working in that company
she was the first to file a class action suit on behalf of herself and the other women in the country and the nation
because she was meritorious she prevailed in that lawsuit that lead to incredible changes in regards to the treatment of women in the modern workplace
that is what is at stake in allowing the civil rights actions to at least go through
we allow that in the substitute and i ask adoption of the substitute
now we are here considering another bill that will pass the house and go nowhere in the senate
there are 45 million americans who have no health insurance in this country
where is the increase in the minimum wage
it was comical to see the republican leadership gather at a press conference the other day in reaction to the news that oil companies are making record profits
over 2 000 americans have lost their lives in iraq and all we get from this leadership and all we get from this white house is stay the course well stay the course is not a policy it is a sound bite
where is the genuinely independent 911style commission to investigate the botched response to hurricane katrina and to make recommendations on how to prevent such another tragedy in the future
where is the fully constituted functioning ethics committee to look into the numerous ethics charges that are mounting in this body
i will leave it to these members to explain the intricacies of the federal code and the rules of civil procedure and how rule 11 fits in
the judicial conference was created by this very congress in 1922
in a threepage letter to chairman sensenbrenner in short they say it is unnecessary and it is harmful
if they were less judicious in their choice of words they would say what i say it stinks
in fact in their letter to the judiciary committee chairman they say that federal district judges are united in their opposition to any legislation which seeks to amend rule 11
frankly i would laugh if i did not think that the majority was so sincere in their attempts to undermine the constitutional rights of every single american
i would also like to insert in the record the text of the letter that i mentioned in my opening speech from the judicial conference of the united states which very strongly opposes this legislation
hr 420 seeks to roll back rule 11 of the federal rules of civil procedure to an earlier 1983 version of the rule which would undermine carefully crafted standards that were enacted in 1993
those changes expanded responsibilities of litigants while at the same time providing greater constraints and flexibility in dealing with violations of the rule
in fact department of justice statistics show that the number of lawsuits is declining in both federal and state courts
history shows that mandatory rule 11 sanctions imposed in 1983 and to which hr 420 would have us return were used disproportionately against plaintiffs particularly civil rights attorneys and those attempting to extend the law in support of unpopular causes
more than a decade ago civil rights organizations including some of the undersigned organizations worked to nationwide surveys about the former rule found that motions for sanctions were most frequently sought and granted in civil rights cases
expressing his concerns about the former rule 11 the honorable robert l carter united states district court judge for the southern district of new york noted i have no doubt that the supreme court s opportunity to pronounce separate schools inherently unequal in brown v board of education would have been delayed for a decade had my colleagues and i been required upon pain of potential sanctions to plead our legal theory explicitly from the start the language of hr 420 purporting to protect civil rights claims provides insufficient protection for victims of discrimination moreover hr 420 not only changes the rules for federal courts it is unprecedented in that its reach extends to state court cases
finally the vast majority of the federal judiciary opposes the changes contained in hr 420
the judicial conference of the united states headed by the late chief justice rehnquist clearly stated in a letter to chairman sensenbrenner that the proposed changes to rule 11 will not help deter litigation abuses but will increase satellite litigation costs and delays the letter also notes there is a remarkable consensus among federal district court judges in opposition to changing the rule
dear representative i write regarding hr 420 the lawsuit abuse reduction act the american bar association strongly opposes this legislation and respectfully urges you to vote no when it is brought to the floor of the house of representatives in the near future
without any demonstrated problem with the enforcement or operation of rule 11 hr 420 would 1 impose mandatory sanctions for any violation of rule 11 of the federal rules of civil procedure and remove its current safe harbor provisions 2 enforce a mandatory suspension from practicing law of an attorney who has violated rule 11 three times 3 impose federal mandatory rule 11 sanctions upon any civil state court claim that materially affects interstate commerce and 4 impose specific venue designation rules upon any personal injury claim filed in any state or federal court
as a threshold matter the aba strongly opposes the legislation because these amendments to the federal rules of civil procedure are being proposed without utilizing the process set forth in the rules enabling act
the aba fully supports the rules enabling act process which is based on three fundamental concepts 1 the essential and central role of the judiciary in initiating judicial rulemaking 2 the use of procedures that permit full public participation including participation by members of the legal profession and 3 provision for a congressional review period
we view the proposed rules changes to the federal rules in hr 420 as an unwise retreat from the balanced and inclusive process established by congress when it adopted the rules enabling act
in 28 usc
this wellsettled congressionally specified procedure contemplates that evidentiary and procedural rules will in the first instance be considered and drafted by committees of the united states judicial conference will thereafter be subject to thorough public comment and reconsideration and will then be submitted to the united states supreme court for consideration and promulgation
this timeproven process proceeds from separationofpowers concerns and is driven by the practical recognition that among other things 1 rules of evidence and procedure are inherently a matter of intimate concern to the judiciary which must apply them on a daily basis 2 each rule forms just one part of a complicated interlocking whole rendering due deliberation and public comment essential to avoid unintended consequences and 3 the judicial conference is in a unique position to draft rules with care in a setting isolated from pressures that may interfere with painstaking consideration and due deliberation
not following the processes set forth in the rules enabling act would frustrate the purpose of the act and potentially harm the effective functioning of the judicial system
the aba opposes the provisions in hr 420 to enforce a mandatory suspension of an attorney for rule 11 violations
it is however important to remember that rule 11 violations can be levied even when in hindsight there may have been a legitimate claim especially for civil rights cases or environmental litigation
attorneys practicing in these areas may be subject to more rule 11 sanctions than attorneys who handle other types of cases
a system that provides for mandatory suspension of attorneys with three rule 11 violations would have an extremely chilling effect on the justice system and could disproportionately impact attorneys who practice in particular areas such as civil rights or environmental law
this type of mandatory suspension is even more damaging when taken in combination with efforts to require mandatory sanctions for rule 11 violations which can not be appealed until after a judgment is rendered in a case
earlier this year the conference of chief justices adopted a resolution in opposition to federal usurpation of state court authority as guaranteed by the united states constitution
this resolution strongly opposed the enactment of any federal legislation that would drastically change the traditional state role in determining ethics jurisdiction and venue rules in state litigation the determination of the states to establish and operate their judicial systems in accordance with principles important to each state is entitled to respectful deference from the federal government
the report was prepared at the request of the judicial conference s advisory committee on civil rules to provide information as part of the advisory committee s study of proposals introduced in congress to amend rule 11
since 1995 legislation has regularly been introduced that would reinstate a mandatory sanctions provision of rule 11 that was adopted in 1983 and eliminated in 1993
the 1983 provision was eliminated because during the ten years it was in place it did not provide meaningful relief from the litigation behavior it was meant to address and generated wasteful satellite litigation that had little to do with the merits of a case
in 1983 rule 11 was amended to require judges to impose sanctions for violations that could include attorneys fees
the judicial conference noted that these problems included creating a significant incentive to file unmeritorious rule 11 motions by providing a possibility of monetary penalty engendering potential conflict of interest between clients and their lawyers who advised withdrawal of particular claims despite the clients preference exacerbating tensions between lawyers and providing little incentive and perhaps a distinct disincentive to abandon or withdraw and thereby admit error on a pleading or claim after determining that it no longer was supportable in law or fact
the committee stands ready to address any deficiency in the rules including rule ii
although the committee is mindful of congressional concerns about frivolous filings addressed in pending legislation the committee has not received any negative comments or complaints on existing rule ii from the bench bar or public
the results of the federal judicial more than 80 percent of the 278 district judges surveyed indicate that rule 11 is needed and it is just right as it now stands 87 percent prefer the existing rule 11 to the 1983 version or the version proposed by legislation eg hr 4571 or hr 420 85 percent strongly or moderately support rule 11 s safe harbor provisions 91 percent oppose the proposed requirement that sanctions be imposed for every rule 11 violation 84 percent disagree with the proposition that an award of attorney fees should be mandatory for every rule 11 violation 85 percent believe that the amount of groundless civil litigation has not grown since the promulgation of the 1993 rule with 12 percent noting that such litigation has not been a problem 19 percent noting that such litigation decreased during their tenure on the federal bench and 54 percent noting that such litigation has remained relatively constant and 72 percent believe that addressing sanctions for discovery abuse in rules 26 g and 37 is better than in rule 11
the judges experiences with the 1993 version of rule 11 point to a marked decline in rule 11 satellite litigation without any noticeable increase in the number of frivolous filings
rule 11 in its present form has proven effective and should not be revised
mr chairman i rise in reluctant opposition to the lawsuit abuse reduction act
hr 420 treads unnecessarily on judicial independence and makes litigation overly burdensome for legitimate cases to have their fair day in court
i strongly believe that the integrity of the judiciary is in question if we impose our own set of rules on this independent body particularly as congress continues to limit judicial discretion
furthermore i believe this bill inhibits legitimate cases from having their day in court
plaintiffs that have just cause for action particularly in cases dealing with civil rights may reconsider because of the threat of mandated sanctions and the elimination of the 21day safe harbor rule
in fact recent studies indicate that frivolous litigation is declining
mr chairman i will continue to approach tort reform with the objective of ensuring that any legitimate cases have their day in court
this bill would revert rule 11 back to the 1983 version and unduly affects plaintiffs in civil rights cases
the current rule 11 was adopted in 1993 specifically to correct abuses by defendants in civil rights cases
the honorable robert carter united states district court judge for the southern district of new york who was one of the pioneers in civil rights legislation and worked on the brown v board of education case stated i have no doubt that the supreme court s opportunity to pronounce separate schools inherently unequal in brown v board of education would have been delayed for a decade had my colleagues and i been required upon pain of potential sanctions to plead our legal theory explicitly from the start this is a good example of the dreadfully detrimental effect of this rule on civil rights cases
in the case of a foreign corporation that does not exist in the united states
because it provides for reasonable attorneys fees in the case of a sanction because many rule 11 sanctions are minor and in any complex case there are almost invariably going to be some the current law first of all permits the judge discretion whether to impose sanctions or not
it is no surprise that the united states judicial conference the national association for the advancement of colored people the alliance for justice public citizen people for the american way the american association of people with disabilities the lawyers committee for civil rights in law the american bar association the national conference of state legislatures national partnership for women national women s law center the center for justice and democracy consumers union the national association of consumer advocates and the naacp legal defense fund all oppose the bill
in other words if members care about civil rights if they care about the ability of the consumer to have justice with a large corporation if they care about civil liberties if they care about people being able to use the federal or state courts they must vote against this bill
president bush assured us there were weapons of mass destruction in iraq and a lot of other nonsense
i will summarize in a few words what we are really talking about
there are also novel legal claims which some may consider frivolous but which in the fullness of time yield legal progress
the association of state chief justices are not in favor of this
the judicial council of the united states is not in favor of this
what this bill is mr chairman is another attempt another in a series of attempts the class action bills the various other bills we have had here to close the courts to close the courts to anyone who would try to hold giant corporations accountable
mr chairman i do not seek recognition in opposition to the amendment
mr chairman i am pleased that chairman sensenbrenner has included in the manager s amendment two provisions that i offered in the judiciary committee markup of the bill and i thank the chairman for his support
the first amendment included in the manager s amendment provides for mandatory sanctions for destroying documents relating to a court proceeding
because this can result in the complete inability to hold these defendants accountable for their wrongful acts parties who knowingly destroy relevant and incriminating documents should be severely sanctioned
secondly the second amendment bans the concealment of unlawful conduct when the interests of public health and safety outweigh the interest of litigating parties in concealment
very often in civil litigation a company producing an unsafe product or an unsafe procedure will settle with the plaintiff
but meanwhile hundreds of thousands of people may continue to be injured by that product in the future
when it comes to public health and safety people must have access to information about an unsafe product not only to protect themselves but also to serve as a deterrent against companies that may continue to place the public in harm s way
the amendment says that an agreement to keep a settlement secret the terms and conditions of settlement secret can not be approved by the court unless the court determines that the interests of the parties in secrecy perhaps legitimate interests outweigh the interests of the public in knowledge of whatever it is
again i would like to thank chairman sensenbrenner for working together in addressing these issues
i believe the manager s amendment provides some positive changes in what is otherwise an egregious bill
mr chairman i thank the gentleman for yielding me time and i congratulate him and the gentleman from wisconsin mr kind xz4002180 for their leadership in proposing this good democratic substitute
just when we should be talking about creating good jobs for the american people expanding access to quality health care broadening opportunity in education having a strong national defense and doing it all in a fiscally sound way the republicans are wasting the time of this congress and testing the patience of the american people with legislation that is frivolous
it is something that is again another reflection of the culture of cronyism that exists under the republican leadership in washington dc
the outrageous venue provisions in the republican bill give defendant corporations special advantages by overriding state minimumcontact provisions and limiting the locations in which a suit can be brought and could render foreign corporations out of reach of the american justice system
the gentleman from georgia mr barrow xz4006280 will be offering a motion to recommit to make sure that politically connected cronies and nobid contractors that defraud and cheat the government in providing goods and service after a natural disaster will never again be able to use these special bids
mr chairman i really want to congratulate the gentleman from wisconsin mr kind xz4002180 and the gentleman from california mr schiff xz4003610 for putting together a really excellent substitute to get rid of loopholes in the republican bill that favors big corporate interests and foreign corporations and to protect civil rights claims
that we will have threestrikesyouareout for doing that is a very important provision in the substitute
the substitute seeks to stop the madness that exists on the floor of this house when it is used as a venue to promote the special interests in our country
i rise today to offer an amendment in the nature of a substitute to hr 420 the lawsuit abuse reduction act of 2005 with the gentleman from wisconsin mr kind xz4002180
however i am forced to oppose the legislation in its current form as it contains a number of serious deficiencies which i believe the substitute amendment will remedy
second the legislation would inappropriately involve the states in the application of the federal rules of civil procedure
unlike the base bill these frivolous proceedings and pleadings could have been filed in any court
the mandatory sanctions begin after the very first violation but after the third the attorney shall be found in contempt of court and referred to the appropriate state bar associations for disciplinary proceedings including suspension
our substitute amendment also has strong threestrikesandyouareout provisions for attorneys who engage in frivolous conduct during discovery including causing unnecessary delay or needless increases in the costs of litigation
again mandatory sanctions begin after the first violation and a third violation in any federal court can include suspension and even disbarment
the venue provisions however in section 4 of the base bill would recast state and federal court jurisdiction and venue in personal injury cases
this means that it would be far more difficult to pursue a personal injury or product liability action against a foreign corporation in the united states
in fact this section could operate to make it impossible to sue a foreign corporation in this country only further promoting the disturbing process of corporations in our country relocating their headquarters overseas to avoid us taxes
and our substitute amendment includes language to ensure that jurisdiction for such legal actions is not limited in this manner
this is due to the fact that much if not most of the impetus for the 1993 changes stemmed from abuses by defendants in civil rights cases namely the civil rights defendants were choosing to harass civil rights plaintiffs by filing a series of rule 11 motions intended to slow down and impede meritorious civil rights cases
a 1991 federal judicial study found that the incidence of rule 11 sanctions or sua sponte orders is higher in civil rights cases than in some other types of cases
another study found that there is ample evidence to suggest that plaintiffs in civil rights cases plaintiffs in particular were far more likely than defendants to be the target of rule 11 motions and the recipient of sanctions
it cracks down on frivolous lawsuits in a tough fashion but without jeopardizing civil rights claims or providing unnecessary shields to foreign corporations
mr chairman before i recognize my colleague from texas i want to respond to a couple of points made by my other colleague from texas that is comparing the strength of the three strikes and you re out provisions in the substitute and base bill
the three strikes language in the democratic substitute would apply to frivolous proceedings that are filed in any court
the base bill on the other hand would apply the three strikes provision only to the specific court in which the violation occurred
with the second the attorney is held in contempt with a monetary fine
and then the third provision of referral to the state bar for possible disbarment compared to the base bill which calls for a 1year suspension only in the specific court where the three violations occurred
the violations have to occur in the same court
in fact when you ask the judges who have operated under both systems the one that is proposed by the base bill and the one that is proposed by the substitute the courts were quite clear that the earlier form of rule 11 which we would go back to in the base bill spawned a cottage industry where someone would file a rule 11 motion the opposing counsel would file a rule 11 motion on the rule 11 motion and then you would have litigation over whose rule 11 motion should succeed
in fact in 1993 the judicial conference remarked that the experience with the amended rule since 1993 since we got away from what the base bill would take us back to has demonstrated a marked decline to rule 11 satellite litigation without any noticeable increase in the number of frivolous filings
in my concluding comments i want to reiterate some of the points that have been made with respect to the civil rights provisions and quote from the testimony of professor theodore eisenberg who testified before the house committee on the judiciary in the 108th congress and said a congress considering reinstating the feeshifting aspect of rule 11 in the name of tort reform should understand what it will be doing
it will be discouraging the civil rights cases disproportionately affected by the old rule 11 in the name of addressing purported abuse in an area of law personal injury tort found to have less abuse than other areas i would also like to cite the testimony of the honorable robert l carter us district judge for the southern district of new york when he stated i have no doubt that the supreme court s opportunity to pronounce separate schools inherently unequal in brown v board of education would have been delayed for a decade had my colleagues and i been required upon pain of potential sanctions to plead our legal theory explicitly from the start we do not want to put off a brown v board of education civil rights case like that for a decade because of a rule 11 that has been rejected by the federal courts already
the language in the substitute makes it clear that neither the sanctions approach we have taken in the substitute nor the sanctions approach taken in the base bill would apply in civil rights cases and while there is some language of suggestion in the base bill it is not definitive
in fact the naacp wrote in respect to the language in the base bill while language nominally intended to mitigate the damage that this bill will cause to civil rights cases has been added it is vague and simply insufficient in addressing our concerns so on the basis of a need not to chill civil rights legislation which i think we have only seen the greater importance with as katrina ripped off the veneer of poverty and inequality in the country once again for all to see as we consider that the base bill would implement a change that the courts themselves have rejected and found spawned a cottage industry in meritless rule 11 litigation and as the base bill has a stronger and i think more sensible threestrikesandyouareout provision i would urge my colleagues to support the democratic substitute in preference to the flawed base bill
mr chairman i rise in support of hr 420 the lawsuit abuse reduction act
it is imperative we reform our tort system and it seems to me this legislation is an important step in this direction
frivolous lawsuits have discouraged product development stifled innovative research and cost millions in insurance and legal fees costs that often get passed on to consumers
a pennsylvania man sued the fritolay company claiming that doritos chips were inherently dangerous after one stuck in his throat
after 8 years of costly litigation the pennsylvania supreme court threw out the case writing that there is a commonsense notion that it is necessary to properly chew hard foodstuffs prior to swallowing but of course the defendants had to absorb hundreds of thousands of dollars in legal fees
in a new jersey little league game a player lost sight of a fly ball hit because of the sun
he was injured when the ball struck him in the eye
today almost any party can bring any suit in almost any jurisdiction
it is a problem that even the american trial lawyers association has tried to address in its own code of conduct by declaring no american trial lawyers association member shall file or maintain a frivolous suit issue or position however atla has not disciplined a single attorney for violation of this code of conduct in the last 2 years
they ve got large populations of voters who are in on the deal
they re getting their piece in many cases
and so it s a political force in their jurisdiction and it s almost impossible to get a fair trial if you re a defendant in some of these places
the plaintiff lawyer walks in there and writes the number on the blackboard and the first juror meets the last one coming out the door with that amount of money
any lawyer fresh out of law school can walk in there and win the case so it does nt matter what the evidence or law is forum shopping is a part of lawsuit abuse and we must pass legislation to stop it from occurring
for instance the john kerry for president campaign endorsed national legislation in which lawyers who file frivolous cases would face tough mandatory sanctions and former vice presidential candidate senator edwards stated lawyers who bring frivolous cases should face tough mandatory sanctions the lawsuit abuse reduction act is sensible reform that will help restore confidence to america s justice system
youth sports are shutting down in the face of lawsuits for injuries and even hurt feelings
the girl scouts in the metro detroit area alone have to sell 36 000 boxes of cookies each year just to pay for their liability insurance
the supervisor of district operations wrote if a person falls you are more liable than if you had never plowed at all unfortunately the times we are in allow for a much more litigious environment than common sense would dictate
founded in 1855 the tilley firm could not handle the cost of liability insurance which had risen from 6 percent of sales a decade ago to 29 percent while never losing an actual court judgment
the workers of john s tilley ladders never faced a competitor they could not beat in the marketplace but they were no match for frivolous lawsuits
in fact as currently written rule 11 allows lawyers to entirely avoid sanctions for filing frivolous claims by withdrawing them within 3 weeks
such a rule actually encourages frivolous claims because personal injury attorneys can file harassing pleadings secure in the knowledge that they have nothing to lose
the class action fairness act which was recently signed into law after receiving broad support in both houses prohibits the unfair practice of forum shopping for favorable courts when the case is styled as a class action
any lawyer fresh out of law school can walk in there and win the case so it does not matter what the evidence or the law is america s system of justice deserves better much better
it incorporates into the base bill provisions imposing sanctions for the destruction of relevant documents in a pending federal court proceeding an amendment setting standards for a court s determination that certain court records should be sealed and an amendment providing for a presumption on a rule 11 violation when the same issue is repeatedly relitigated
this manager s amendment also makes clear that in the antiforumshopping provisions if there is no state court in the county in which the injury occurred the case can be brought in the nearest adjacent county where a court of general jurisdiction is located
finally the manager s amendment makes clear that the legislation does not affect personal injury claims that federal bankruptcy law requires to be heard in a federal bankruptcy court
i urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this bipartisan manager s amendment
mr chairman i rise in opposition to this substitute amendment
and i have to point out that this same substitute amendment was defeated in the last congress
in fact the substitute provides that following three violations of its provisions the court shall refer each such attorney to one or more appropriate state bar associations for disciplinary proceedings the substitute does not say the attorney shall be suspended from the practice of law
specifically the base bill states that after three strikes the federal district court shall suspend that attorney from the practice of law in that federal district court the base bill contains a substantive threestrikesandyouareout provision that will prevent attorneys who file frivolous lawsuits from getting into the courtroom
in addition the substitute for the first time without penalty allows defendants to file papers with the court that include factual denials of the allegations against them that are not warranted by the evidence and not reasonably based
the proponent of this amendment claims that the antiforum shopping standards in hr 420 regarding where a personal injury lawsuit can be brought are somehow unfair even though they are the very same standards contained in the vast majority of state venue laws
in fact the gentleman from california s own state venue law provides as follows if the action is for injury to person or personal property or for death from wrongful act or negligence the superior court in either the county where the injury occurs or the injury causing death occurs or the county where the defendants or some of them reside at the commencement of the action is the proper court for the trial of the action insofar as foreign corporations can not be sued in some limited circumstances in this country that is not the fault of hr 420 nor is it the fault of california s venue law
she also used the phrase special interests but again i think anyone listening to this debate today and anyone knowing firsthand the agony and the losses and the destruction caused by frivolous lawsuits realizes that the special interests that this bill hopes to protect are really the special interests of the american people who have stuttered and staggered and been burdened by frivolous lawsuits too many times and much too often in our history
the special interests if there are any involved in this legislation again are obvious to those who listened to the debate the trial lawyers of america and mr chairman let me take a minute here just to dwell on that subject because i happen to believe the vast majority of trial lawyers or personal injury lawyers are honorable people and they are members of an honorable profession
i think one of the aspects of the debate that most troubles me is in fact the lack of sanctioning lawyers who engage in frivolous lawsuits by the trial lawyers of america
their own code of conduct reads as follows no atla member shall file or maintain a frivolous suit issue or position we checked and not a single member of the trial lawyers association not a single lawyer had been sanctioned in the last 2 years and in fact no one can even tell us when the last time any attorney was sanctioned for filing a frivolous lawsuit
i think the trial lawyers would have a lot more credibility on this subject if in fact they had monitored their own ranks and in fact had sanctioned just a single trial lawyer for filing one of those tens of thousands of frivolous lawsuits that have been filed
that as i say is discouraging and i hope the trial lawyers of america will see fit in the future to sanction some attorney somewhere somehow who has filed a frivolous lawsuit
a new jersey man filed suit against galloway township school district claiming that assigned seating in a school lunchroom violated his 12yearold daughter s right to free speech
after a wreck in which an indiana man collided with a woman who was talking on her cell phone the man sued the cell phone manufacturer
in every one of these instances and in thousands of others the individuals sued were forced to spend considerable amounts of money time and effort to defend themselves
in other words mr chairman this substitute amendment does not provide any relief to those who would be unfairly targeted by frivolous lawsuits
mr chairman i urge my colleagues to oppose the substitute amendment and vote yes on the underlying bill which in fact would deter lawsuit abuse
mr speaker i rise in opposition to the motion to recommit
first nothing in hr 420 the lawsuit abuse reduction act prohibits anyone from being sued for fraud to the full extent of federal law
there is no flaw in the bill that needs to be corrected but even if there were the motion to recommit fails to correct it because it relates to contract claims rather than personal injury claims
this statement reads as follows the administration supports house passage of hr 420 in order to address the growing problem of frivolous litigation
hr 420 would rein in the negative impact of frivolous lawsuits on the nation s economy by establishing a strong disincentive to file such suits in federal and state courts
the administration believes the bill is a step in the right direction toward the goal of ending lawsuit abuse mr speaker i urge my colleagues to oppose this absolutely irrelevant motion to recommit and support the underlying bill
mr chairman i rise in opposition to the socalled lawsuit abuse reduction act because it would hurt all americans by exposing them and their attorneys to motions intended to harass them and slow down the legal process a tactic often used by wealthy defendants in civil rights trials
prior to 1993 defendants in civil rights cases would file a crushing number of motions alleging frivolous actions on the part of the plaintiff in a blatant attempt to delay the case
in 1993 the rules were changed and judges were empowered to determine sanctions for frivolous lawsuits on a casebycase basis removing this delay tactic from wealthy defendants
if that makes me a friend of the trial lawyers then i proudly stand with the brilliant litigators thurgood marshall and abraham lincoln in opposition to political hacks like karl rove and george w bush
mr chairman i rise in opposition of hr 420 the lawsuit abuse reduction act of 2005
this legislation runs roughshod over states rights forcing state courts to enact onerous procedures and stripping states jurisdiction in certain cases
this bill also protects foreign corporations at the expense of consumers in that it unfairly dictates to states where their citizens can enforce legal right against a corporation based outside of the united states
while hr 420 allows a victim to file a claim in a court in his or her home state because of existing jurisdictional rules that state may be unable to exercise power over the foreign corporation
for example a corporation in mexico sells cribs in the united states and those cribs are shipped to kansas and sold in nebraska
the cribs turn out to be defective and one collapses on a baby in nebraska killing it
it may be impossible under this proposed bill for that nebraska family to file a lawsuit in nebraska
the family may have to file the suit in kansas but would have to take the case to mexico under hr 420
i can not in good conscience support a bill preventing a family in this situation from filing a lawsuit in its own state
however the bill has such serious flaws that i can not support it in its current form
part of the bill would change rule 11 of the federal rules of civil procedure in ways that would basically restore that rule as it was in 1992
as a result lawyers filing frivolous lawsuits in federal courts would face mandatory sanctions in the form of payments to those who were victimized by those lawsuits
however i am not enthusiastic about the idea of congress s attempting to micromanage the state courts or to take over the job of regulating the practice of law in state courts in the way that this bill would do
and i am definitely opposed to changing the rules in ways that could make it impossible for people with valid claims to receive proper consideration of their cases
for that reason i must object to the provisions of the bill which as the nonpartisan congressional research service explains would preclude litigation in united states courts that would be authorized under current law
if a corporation has stores factories offices or property anywhere in the united states
a federal suit might be brought against it in one of the judicial districts where
but i find it even more unacceptable that prime beneficiaries of these provisions could be american companies who have chosen to fly a foreign flag in order to escape paying their federal taxes
yes mr speaker in its present form
mr speaker if bills in this chamber required names that accurately describe their consequences this bill would best be called the frivolous litigation proliferation act and not the lawsuit abuse reduction act
for example some sort of rule 11 procedure exists in virtually every state in the country
to impose a new federal law in every state court action will make state courts conduct a minilawsuit on federal validity before conducting a minilawsuit on state law validity before they ever get to the merits of the case
and if there is any area where we want to make it easier to get to the merits of the underlying claim not harder it is an area of lawsuits against federal contractors who are engaged in defrauding the public
right now the government is awash in government contracts awarded on a nobid basis
there has never been more opportunity for waste fraud and abuse in the conduct of the public s business than right now
it says that federal contractors engaged in price gouging in disaster relief work can still be sued anyplace where they can be sued now in any state where both the laws of the state and the us constitution says it is okay to sue them
one such protection the only one addressed by this motion to recommit is the right to avoid lawsuits in states where the constitution says it is okay to seek justice
this house has voted time and again to protect companies that are gouging consumers in the wake of natural disasters and national tragedies
if members vote against this motion to recommit they are voting to give the same special protections that we give to honest corporations to federal contractors who are engaged in price gouging in public relief work
mr speaker the folks i represent back home in georgia want relief from price gougers not relief for price gougers
