the sponsors of the bill before us today insist and i think rightfully so on the importance of elections
we are here having this debate we have debates every day because people differ on what the right thing is to do
you had a mock debate in the committee on the judiciary in which the distinguished chairman presented my bill without allowing me the courtesy or dignity to defend it myself
and on that you proudly say you defend democracy
here is the fundamental question for us my friends and it is this the american people are watching television and an announcement comes on and says the congress has been destroyed in a nuclear attack the president and vice president are killed and the supreme court is dead and thousands of our citizens in this town are
apparently according to the committee on the judiciary subcommittee on the constitution chairman 45 days of marshal law rule of this country by an unelected president with no checks and balances
the distinguished chairman of the committee on the judiciary made some comments recently that suggested that somehow terrorists would oppose this bill and by some implication would favor the bill the gentleman from california mr rohrabacher xz4003430 and i have put forward because it seems to support their autocratic views of government
in fact what our bill would do is tell the terrorists you could come on a single day and set off a nuclear weapon in this town and kill every single member of us and though we would be missed the very next day the congress would be up and functioning with every single state every single district having full representation by statesmen and stateswomen at a time of national crisis
if terrorists hit us today when we finally vote on this let us suppose a few democrats do not make it over here
if the terrorists were to strike your conference retreat where the president speaks to the republican house and senate members and kill hundreds of house and senate members on the republican side the democrats at that point claim the majority
it depends on a fantasy immediate or quick election
the other day a gentleman testified before the committee on the budget and said this the lack of preparation for continuity for true continuity invites attack you are inviting attack
mr chairman i rise to make two fundamental points before we proceed to vote on this
that person could move on to become the president
vote no on this bill and insist on true debate on true continuity of congress in a responsible way that protects the balance of power assures real succession to the presidency and most importantly assures that your constituents will have representation at a time when our nation may well go to nuclear war institute a draft appropriate trillions of dollars suspend habeas corpus and impose marshal law
mr chairman i thank my distinguished colleague and i appreciate his leadership on this issue
madison is quoted on this topic but let me quote madison from federalist 47
he said the accumulation of all powers legislative executive and judiciary in the same hands whether of one a few or many and whether hereditary selfappointed or elected may justly be pronounced the very definition of tyranny now i would like if i may to ask my colleagues before we pass this appropriations bill with legislative language in it alleging to maintain continuity to maybe address a couple of questions before my colleagues vote on this and i will yield time
mr chairman i do not have it on the top of my head my friend but i can say that it is much faster than 7 weeks
if that is what you are voting for then let us be honest with the american public as apparently the chairman of the committee on the judiciary has been
we need a full and open and extensive debate on this
i have heard the chairman of the committee on the judiciary point out that in the days post911 it was an elected congress not an appointed congress that made decisions
people on the other side of this argument have said oh if we have anything but a direct election the terrorists have won
i think we need to spend more time on constitutional issues than we spend on horse manure but we have not
hr 2888 2001 emergency supplemental appropriations act for recovery from and response to terrorist attacks on the united states
the resolution authorized the president to use all necessary and appropriate force against those nations organizations or persons he determines planned authorized committed or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on sept
this bill provided 15 billion in assistance to the us airline industry to help stabilize the financial condition of the industry in the wake of the terrorist attacks on sept
and i am afraid that if we slip a year then we slip another year we end up putting a burden on the people who run the library of congress and we put part of that collection in jeopardy
i know the committee has a difficult time because there are tight spending restraints but i would urge the committee on appropriations and indeed each member of this body to take a careful look at our stewardship responsibilities for the library of congress
and i hope that our distinguished chair and ranking member of the committee on appropriations will be able to in fact deal with this in conference in a serious manner because it is not just a matter here of saving over 5 million a year just in printing costs and it is not a matter of saving some 57 tons of paper
what this is about is being able to with all due deference to the ranking member not impose on this congress a regimen of printing 6 000 copies of a relic of the past that is not necessary for everybody
we have heard sort of grand philosophical statements of our allegiance to democracy on the floor of this house but at the same time we need to be practical about what actually can work in a time of national crisis
i think my friends on the other side of the aisle have glossed over the problems that especially military voters the elderly others who do not have access on an election day to the polls the kind of problems that they would face
i supported legislation last year that as the gentleman from wisconsin chairman sensenbrenner said was defeated but could be considered in the light of understanding how elections actually work in that there needs to be a time line to get candidates on the ballots to get the ballots printed to get them sent to the armed forces around the world and get those ballots back in time for an election
i support the millendermcdonald amendment because appointing the process if we could do that down the line and i understand that is not on the table today but to do them in 45 or 49 days simply is not practical and too many people will be denied the right to vote
mr speaker by direction of the committee on rules i call up house resolution 125 and ask for its immediate consideration
mr speaker i ask unanimous consent that all members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks on this resolution
mr speaker on march 1 the committee on rules met and granted a structured rule for hr 841 the continuity in representation act of 2005
while i was not a member of congress on september 11 2001 i was in an office directly across lafayette park from the white house
one of the most significant memories i have is the bipartisan response to the tragedy where members stood on the steps of the capitol and let it be known to the world that our government would continue to operate
mr speaker this legislation should not be very divisive based on the fact that a similar measure passed the house by a substantial bipartisan margin of 365 to 97 in the last session of congress
what we do know however is that we are engaged in a real genuine and taxing global war on terror
mr speaker i want to thank the gentleman for his kind words and i look forward to working with him as we move ahead and i learn from him as i already have in the context of the deliberations of the committee on rules
mr speaker i yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from california mr dreier xz4001150 the distinguished chairman of the committee on rules
the potential for this was underlined by what occurred on september 11
mr speaker i yield back the balance of my time and move the previous question on the amendment and on the resolution
mr speaker my motion to recommit would simply require that each state provide a minimum required number of functioning and accurate voting machines and poll workers for each precinct on the day of any special election
they used a formula based not on the number of registered voters but on past turnout
additionally the work of one mounted officer is akin to the work of 10 officers on foot
the gao study as the chairman stated said that it is hard for them to quantify the benefits of the horse patrol because the performance measures are evolving he failed to say the rest of it and that data is still being collected on these measures
i am quoting from the gao results that they gave when they appeared before the committee on appropriations
yes the police officers do have the bicycles but i would venture to say the guys on the bicycles are not sitting up as high as the guys and gals on top of the horses
i want to begin by congratulating him on his superb service on the committee on rules
i also want to express appreciation to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle
in the last congress while it has not happened in this congress i was very pleased that the distinguished ranking minority member of the committee on the judiciary the gentleman from michigan mr conyers xz4000800 joined as a cosponsor of this legislation as well as my good friend and colleague the gentleman from california mr berman xz4000250
my judgment has often been questioned because i was the last human being to walk out of this building on september 11 of 2001 and probably correctly
and i will say that when i left the building on september 11 2001 i did so when one of the great capitol hill policemen said to me that there was a plane headed towards this building and we all know now that that is the plane that went down with those very courageous passengers in pennsylvania
when we think back on september 11th obviously it was one of the darkest days in the history of our republic and it has led us to spend a great deal of time thinking about the unthinkable
because of september 11th we have had to ponder things that we would never even possibly consider because of the fact that we had not seen that kind of attack on us soil
if you recall on september 11th late that afternoon when members of both houses of congress both political parties stood on the east front of the capitol singing god bless america
the reason that members stood on the east front of the capitol was to let the american people and to let anyone know who would want to do us in that we as a nation are strong and this institution the greatest deliberative body known to man was continuing to function
some of those recommendations that came from members of the minority on this issue extended roll calls lasting days at a time and excluding any time in recess so that members can contact the house and let us know that they can come to vote
the united states house of representatives does not operate unilaterally so there will always be a check on any action taken under the mass incapacitation quorum provision
the gentleman from florida mr hastings xz4001701 has just alluded to something and while i know we do not enjoy the strong support of the minority on this we have made a step in that we are going to have a manager s amendment made in order that would allow us to move in the direction of what it is that the minority wants and that is allowing for 49 days which would be a full 7 weeks
let me say that this legislation addresses a number of very important matters and it incorporates a number of suggestions made again by members on the other side of the aisle
and i want to thank particularly the distinguished ranking minority member of the committee on armed services the gentleman from missouri mr skelton xz4003770 for his fine work in that area and his commitment to ensure that we address the issue of military and overseas voters
i also have to say that on this rule itself we are very happy to have made in order the amendment of my colleague and neighbor the very distinguished gentlewoman from california ms millendermcdonald xz4002750 who has offered an amendment calling for 60 days
i also want to congratulate her mr speaker on her new assignment as the ranking minority member of the committee on administration
and i remember that date because we convened the congress in philadelphia to mark the bicentennial of the connecticut compromise back on july 16 of 1987
we all know that james madison was the father of our constitution as well as having been president of the united states he as a matter of fact was a member of the first committee on rules
and a relative of mine served on that committee on rules at the founding
in federalist 52 madison wrote it is essential to liberty that the government in general should have a common interest with the people so it is particularly essential that the branch of it under consideration should have an immediate dependence on and an intimate sympathy with the people
frequent elections are unquestionably the only policy by which this dependence and sympathy can be effectively secured he went on in federalist 57 and wrote who are to be the electors of the federal representatives
a gradual abridgement of this right has been the mode in which aristocracies have been built on the ruin of popular forms i think it is very important for us to understand that there have been times in our nation s history where we have faced greater difficulty than the difficulty that we face today or even greater difficulty than we faced following september 11 of 2001 and that was the civil war
that is why when we looked at some of the other options to provide for our continuity as an institution such as the standin appointments provision that the house overwhelmingly defeated last year we should ask what we lose if we for one moment give up on elections
that race had 135 candidates on the ballot and they were running among a populace of 35 million people
and i again thank my colleagues the gentleman from ohio mr ney xz4002930 and the gentleman from wisconsin mr sensenbrenner xz4003650 and others who have worked long and hard on this
mr chairman i thank the distinguished gentleman from california the chairman of the committee on appropriations for yielding me this time and i want to congratulate him on the fine work that he has done not only on this legislation but on all of the appropriations bills
we have had three markups on this issue two in the committee on house administration one in the committee on the judiciary and we had 122 democrats who joined with us in support of a responsible piece of legislation which in fact encourages the madisonian vision of an elected people s house
it was the distinguished chairman of the committee on appropriations who just said we had that debate
the only reason that we are here at this moment having this debate is that the other body has refused last year and since march of this year to proceed with acting on this house s housekeeping matter
now i think that if we look at the debate that we have had if we look at the fact that we have continued since september 11 of 2001 to focus on a wide range of matters that impact this institution and the challenge that we never faced in our history i believe that having this very important legislation that was passed by a margin of 329 in this congress 329 to 68 that including it now in the legislative appropriations bill is the most appropriate way to deal with it
we chose in the committee on rules to allow the gentleman from washington mr baird xz4000110 to have an opportunity to strike this measure and in just a few minutes we are going to once again have a vote on whether or not we allow the process of elections to go ahead
now it is very true it is very true that it would be difficult it would be messy it would be ugly but walter dellinger the former solicitor general a great constitutional scholar from duke university made it very clear in his testimony before the committee on rules when we talked about this issue that he would prefer to see a house of representatives that is comprised of fewer members that are actually elected by the people than would be appointed
so when this comes up i am going to urge a no vote on the baird amendment
mr chairman i would like to begin by yielding 2 minutes to the gentleman from wisconsin mr sensenbrenner xz4003650 the distinguished chairman of the judiciary committee with whom i have been very pleased to work on this issue really since september 11 2001
now we regularly talk about the fact that the worst the worst attack on our soil was what took place on september 11 2001
and this notion of creating a scenario whereby people could serve in the people s house without having first been elected is anathema to the entire basis on which the united states of america was founded
and so mr chairman i urge my colleagues to reject the baird amendment and create an opportunity for us to let the other body act on a house provision which is so vitally important to the deliberative nature of this great body
mr chairman i congratulate the gentleman from washington for his longtime leadership on this issue
mr chairman i support this amendment to strike legislation which has nothing to do with the appropriations process legislation which has been improperly placed in this bill the text of hr 841 the continuity in representation act of 2005 that bill has already passed the house twice in slightly different forms in the spring of 2004 and most recently on march 3 2005
the senate refused to consider it the first time and it is currently pending on the legislative calendar in the senate where it will remain unless objections by various senators are dealt with
as ranking member of the committee of actual jurisdiction the committee on house administration i have never been consulted by the majority about beginning negotiations with the senate to try to resolve the objections and get a bill which can clear both chambers
it was obvious that the committee had no idea what it was being asked to do and based on the thunderous chorus of nays on the voice vote was reluctant to be forced to do it
mr chairman hr 841 is under the jurisdictions of the committee on house administration
attempting an end run around the regular order on what is despite their spin a very controversial bill does nothing to enhance credibility in potential negotiations with the senate
for us to go on printing 6 000 of these a day when we simply do not need them is not right
today even though times have changed the spirit of mason lives on
and my point is that after september 11 partisan bickering was on the back burner and we were able to come together and do great things for the american people
in the event of the unthinkable this bill strikes a blow to the heart of the terrorists and allows this body to reconstitute itself as quickly as possible therefore carrying on the spirit of mason and of this great nation
mr speaker i rise today in opposition to this closed rule which limits debate on how this body should operate if it experiences mass causality
the decision of the majority to place any restrictions on this body prohibiting members from offering amendments and freely debating the subject is not responsible
even more the product of 3 years of discussion on the issue that the majority is bringing to the floor is incomplete unrealistic and fails to consider the implications of changing statute when we should be amending the united states constitution
when the committee on house administration took testimony from state and local election officials it was told that 45 days is not enough time to pull off a primary and general election
late last night we were informed that my friends on the republican side are now seeking to amend the rule so that they may offer a manager s amendment which will increase the time elections must be conducted from 45 to 49 days
all of this is happening at the same time my friends in the majority have blocked democratic members from offering three different amendments to the bill all of which were germane and all of which were turned in on time
this is a fair approach and one which should be considered on equal footing as the underlying legislation
all of these concerns underscore the need for this body to consider this legislation in an open and much larger discussion on the continuity of our government during times of mass causality
on that commission a significant number of outstanding individuals from america a broad crosssection of them came up with the notion that it was critical that we have a constitutional amendment to go forward
let me name some of the people that were on that commission lloyd cutler alan simpson philip chase bobbitt kenneth duberstein tom foley former speaker of the house robert michel minority leader newt gingrich former speaker of the house nicholas b katzenbach jamie gorelick robert katzmann kweisi mfume lynn martin donna shalala and their senior counselors were norman orenstein and thomas mann
and the chairman of the committee on rules spoke of james madison
we had a vote on whether or not there should be an open rule in this important process for america and we had an amendment offered by a distinguished member of this body the gentleman from minnesota mr sabo xz4003540 requiring states to offer sameday voter registration for special elections held in accordance with this bill
seems reasonable that people would be scattered and other things on their minds in a crisis such as we had experienced on 911
and the gentleman from michigan mr conyers xz4000800 the ranking member of the committee on the judiciary offered an amendment that would require states to equally and fairly distribute election personnel and equipment when it conducts the special elections contemplated in this bill
i end by saying that thomas mann of the brookings institution who was one of the lead authors of the continuity commission s report stated in front of the committee on house administration the following the inability to swiftly constitute the house and senate would deprive the country of a fully functioning first branch of government at a time of grave national crisis
unable to achieve a quorum or relying on a questionable quorum interpretation allowing a small minority possibly a handful of surviving members to act for the full chamber congress would be unable to legitimately elect a new speaker or confirm a new vice president both critical links in presidential succession
this amounts to roughly 28 billion for the legislative branch appropriations bill and it is no reflection on the chairman or the ranking member
they have done some very good things in here particularly in that hole of waste we have in the east front of our capitol which goes on and on and on
in the spirit of collegiality i realize that we have a rule but i gained a sense that the committee on house administration would be supportive of this substitute which would only allow an added 5 days for an appeal from 2 days less than a week
i would inquire of the chairman of the committee on the judiciary would the gentleman allow that to move forward by unanimous consent
number 2 of this amendment is a provision for an expedited appeals process to the united states district court for matters rising out of the special election process because a 45day deadline for special state election already places significant constraints on the electoral process and on the citizens represented due to its brevity taking away the right to an appeal to the us district court
because the 45day deadline for special state elections already places significant constraints on the electoral process and on the citizens represented due to its brevity taking away the right to an appeal from the us district court would excessively curtail the procedural due process rights enjoyed by citizens
mr chairman i yield 30 seconds to the gentlewoman from california ms millendermcdonald xz4002750 the ranking member of the committee on house administration
we have been talking about this 44 45 49day deadline for special state elections and it already places significant constraints on the electoral process and on the citizens represented due to its brevity
it does not in any way cause a sufficient delay that would not allow us to restore this body to its ability to do business on behalf of the american people
i believe we should show that we are not afraid of them by upholding the constitution and due process on behalf of the american people
first of all this language has no business being in this appropriations measure it clearly legislates on what is supposed to be a spending bill
first of all this language has no business being in this appropriations measure it clearly legislates on what is supposed to be a spending bill
special elections on average take four months
in the event of a catastrophic disaster elections should be held on an expedited time schedule
mr chairman first of all i want to extend thanks to the chairman of the full committee on appropriations the gentleman from california mr lewis xz4002391
the most magnificent facility on the capitol campus is the library of congress
it includes the lawyers who make sure that we do things correctly and all of the people who work hard day and night to keep this building open keep members on the right track and make sure that the things we do are done by the book
the architects have had many masters on this visitors center unfortunately
i congratulate the speaker for trying to get something done on this
i ask every member to consider the good work that goes on around here the fact that this is the bill that funds all of this
mr chairman i will address it in this way i was here on 911 as the gentleman was
mr chairman as ranking member of the committee on house administration which has jurisdiction over the united states capitol police i rise to oppose the amendment offered by my friend from virginia ms jo ann davis
the uscp mounted unit was not authorized by either the committee on house administration nor the senate s committee on rules and administration
however on those occasions where crowds needing control may develop on the capitol grounds and these occasions are usually well anticipated the capitol police can easily ask for assistance from their park police colleagues who are well trained in the use of horses and can also be trained about the capitol and working here
maybe there is value in that when elsewhere on and around the grounds other capitol police officers are routinely brandishing automatic weapons
i urge a no vote on the amendment
many of my colleagues including the gentleman from washington mr baird xz4000110 the gentleman from california mr cox xz4000830 the gentleman from ohio mr ney xz4002930 and the gentlewoman from california ms millendermcdonald xz4002750 have tried to encourage dialogue on this matter but this bill simply does not address many of the concerns raised by members and outside experts during the last 3 12 years
mr chairman although we did not agree on every item on this bill we worked very closely with the gentleman from wisconsin mr obey xz4003000 to produce a bipartisan bill for the legislative branch
the bill also was reported out of the full committee on a voice vote
that commission is made up of leaders on both sides of the aisle and frankly i am very hesitant to interfere with their responsibility or their work
i think i probably will discuss it with my wife as well but in the meantime you and i work together on the committee and i am happy to work with you on almost any issue you might raise
as he is aware the speaker controls the placement of plaques on the house side of the capitol
as part of the currently proposed cvc exhibits are detailed sections on the history of the capitol and included in this is the fact that when the capitol was originally built it was used for more than legislative meetings
mr chairman i rise to yield time to the gentleman from california mr dreier xz4001150 but before doing so i just want to mention that the previous speaker had a constitutional amendment regarding the issue of continuity in the last congress and on that constitutional amendment the vote was 63 yeas and 353 nays
some prefer a constitutional amendment and yet we have tried that on more than one occasion
so the speaker has asked us to go forward with an idea that will be worked on carefully between now and the time we finish our work with the senate
my colleague the gentleman from wisconsin mr obey xz4003000 and i early on in this congress were not active supporters of a cvc
mr speaker by way of suggesting that the leadership on both sides of the aisle made the decision about building our visitors center and that process has gone forward and many a fit and start but nonetheless it is going to be the largest expansion of the capitol in modern time
the gentleman from wisconsin mr obey xz4003000 and i have been on the other side of that issue in the past but nonetheless like the visitors center the speaker has suggested we include the continuity of government item in this package
i read with some alarm the roll call article of december 6 2004 on this subject and i will quote from that article the country is going to be under martial law until we have elections anyway that was actually said by the gentleman from ohio mr chabot xz4000710 chairman of the constitution subcommittee
on that fateful day the enemies of freedom clearly targeted the pillars of our nation
in fact only the heroic actions the unbelievable bravery of those brave passengers on flight 93 prevented that particular plane that particular flight from reaching its intended target
additionally it is important for us to remember that the us representative position would really be the only one on the ballot which would dramatically ease printing programming and testing
regardless it has been my observation and my personal experience that the fine men and women who administer our elections always rise to the occasion to complete the required work on time
clearly it is incumbent on us to find a solution to this issue which honors the wishes and the wisdom of the founding fathers that the house of representatives remain the people s house
first let me congratulate the gentlewoman from michigan in joining our committee the committee on house administration
members on our side of the aisle were split almost down the middle last april in the vote on this legislation because they felt pressured to do something
the senate not surprisingly never acted on it
last year s bill originally banned primaries entirely but the gentleman from ohio mr ney xz4002930 improved this bill during our committee markup by removing the prohibition on primaries
it was suggested on the house floor last year that in the circumstances that the entire house was wiped out it would be up to the people to come together and make the determination as to the rebuilding process and how it begins
is it not the responsibility of congress to anticipate and find solutions to problems when it enacts laws and not to rely on some vague national town meeting if the bill fails to work
in fact hr 841 that we consider today has improved on the previous bill by addressing the following reservations that some members of the house and some of the states had regarding that bill
hr 841 as it stands would allow for congress to reconstitute and to act on such an important matter
additionally it is again very important to remember that the us representative position would really be the only race on the ballot
uniformity of election equipment in a state will enable vendors to always have a cameraready template on the ballot and then all they have to do is just fill in the name of the nominees for us representative and go to print
mr chairman i yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from wisconsin mr sensenbrenner xz4003650 the distinguished chairman of the committee on the judiciary who has been a driving force in bringing this legislation to the floor today
each additional day beyond the 45 day minimum time frame creates greater confidence in the process mr chairman i prefer to come down on the side of the interest of democracy and my instincts after campaigns for local state and federal office tell me 49 days is simply too short
a number of other bills have been introduced by members on both sides of the aisle proposing amendments to the hava bill
the committee on house administration has scheduled hearings on these issues including in the state of ohio i would say and we will be considering all of these bills in due course
so let us focus on what needs to be done to provide for expedited special elections so that we can have a functioning house as soon as possible if there is a horrible catastrophic attack
mr chairman i thank the ranking member of the committee on appropriations for yielding me this time but most particularly for his leadership
we have a ban on smoking in all federal buildings but we exempt congressional office spaces
with that i would like to enter into a colloquy with the chairman of the full committee on this because i do think we need to address it
because that main designated area is the only place available on that floor for smoking it gets pretty asphyxiating according to many of the staff who have contacted me
i thank the chairman and i thank the interest of ms johnson the lead staff for the committee on legislative branch issues
mr chairman as the ranking member of the joint committee on printing i oppose the amendment offered by my friends from arizona mr flake and oregon mr blumenauer
speaking for the minority side of the joint committee on printing i am certainly willing to examine this question further
we are so pleased to have the gentlewoman on the committee on house administration and thank her for managing this bill
and of course house administration does a wide variety of things but we also oversee federal election laws so we appreciate her carrying this bill through and also her perspectives on it
and again we like the working relationship we have had on the issues
he had varied opinions on how long frankly this process could take
as we all know ever since 911 the demands on these officers have grown significantly
i commend the committee on appropriations for bringing us a bill that funds the operations of this house at levels generally consistent with the levels authorized under the fiscal year 2006 budget resolution
james madison and alexander hamilton eloquently made this point in federalist 52 as it is essential to liberty that the government in general should have a common interest with the people so it is particularly essential that the branch of it under consideration should have an immediate dependence on and an intimate sympathy with the people
otherwise the citizenry has no check on the inevitable tendency of government to infringe on the people s liberties at such a time
mr chairman i would like to commend chairman lewis the committee and the staff for their fine work on this bill and the process
this bill focuses on the continuity of the election process rather than the continuity of congress
this is hollow a very hollow approach to democracy suggesting that this would permit people to be elected when in fact it will be the party bosses that will be deciding who the voters will have a chance to vote on
just as the vice president of the united states is elected as part of a ticket with the president alternate representatives would go on the ballot and be elected as a ticket with their representative so that in times of crisis there would be immediate representation for the united states congress and for the people throughout our country
hr 841 on the other hand does nothing to address incapacity and in the case of death allows as many as 99 districts at a time to go without representation for months
on 911 we lived through a crisis that at times seemed bizarre and even surreal
many otherwise competent leaders were in a state of shock and at one moment when we gathered on the capitol steps to send a message to the american people representative baird and i realized more was needed and began singing god bless america
this is a time of crisis when american people will be counting on us to do our best and to set up something that will work in a time of crisis
on 911 we lived through a crisis which at times seemed bizarre and even surreal
many otherwise competent leaders were in a state of shock and at that moment on 911 did not necessarily know or were incapable of doing exactly what the right thing was
many of us gathered at the capitol on that fateful day we gathered on the steps to back up our leadership
and let me note that on that day that time of crisis when we were all in confusion standing on the capitol about ready to break up representative barrett and i looked at each other in our eyes and said this is not enough
it will create a huge crisis for america at the moment that it needs to have something laid down for them something solid on which to rely upon at a time of crisis
i am pleading with my republican friends to please open their eyes and not let the ego of the people on this task force who put together this and now will not look at any other alternative get in the way of watching out for the people of the united states
the alternative to what we have been offered by this task force which as i say lost their way on this is that we should change the way we do things so that we can cope with the challenge of this type of threat to our society that is we will run we will select an alternate to run with us the voters will vote for a team of people so that if we are incapacitated or murdered the alternate can take that seat right away and congress will not cease to function for 7 weeks
we have got to get rid of these blocks on thinking what will happen
on september 11 2001 the fourth hijacked plane was headed toward the nation s capital
for example i worked with the gentleman from missouri mr skelton xz4003770 ranking member of the committee on armed services to craft provisions that govern absentee ballots cast by members of the armed forces and overseas voters whose ballots would be counted if they are received within 45 days after the state transmits them
further i have worked with the gentleman from michigan mr conyers xz4000800 ranking member of the committee on the judiciary to add a provision that all federal laws governing the administration of elections for federal office are explicitly preserved
during the committee on house administration s markup of the bill a substitute amendment offered by the gentleman from ohio chairman ney was adopted which includes further changes that directly respond to concerns expressed by the minority
while some take the pessimistic view of the resiliency of the electoral process following an attack on the nation s capital i have a different view
he died on january 1 that was 63 days ago and his seat is still unfilled
we did have a full debate on the floor of the constitutional amendment that both the gentleman from washington mr baird xz4000110 and the gentleman from california mr rohrabacher xz4003430 supported
twenty votes are necessary for the twothirds majority necessary to propose amendments to the constitution on any subject and i believe that the house of representatives at that time clearly and emphatically spoke in favor of maintaining elections as the only way one could enter the house of representatives the people s house
i would respond to that simply by saying if virginia repopulates the house or its delegation to the house within 12 days and it takes at least 62 days for wisconsin to do so 50 days will elapse or almost 2 months will elapse while wisconsin has either a reduced or no delegation in the house but the house keeps on legislating
this house is firmly on record against an appointment procedure however it is done
the membership has been preparing for the debate on this bill with the amendment made in order under the rule
i do not think that is fair to the membership who have prepared debate on the bill so the answer is no
they will result in new representatives coming with mandates rather than having the frustration of lawsuits that go on interminably
that should have closed the issue of having appointed members serve even on a temporary basis
throughout the 1800s the speaker s podium in the old house chamber was converted into a preacher s pulpit on sundays for church services
mr chairman i thank the gentleman and i appreciate so much his working with me on this and look forward to appropriately recognizing the fact that there have been religious activities in this capitol from the beginning of our nation through the first 70 or 80 years
i thank the gentleman for the eloquence and the simplicity of his statement and as a new member here i certainly respect my senior member s opinions on this matter and i do concur
as the ranking member of the joint committee on printing i can appreciate the gentleman s interest in reducing excessive printing and diverting the funds to more useful purposes
mr chairman i would urge that the point of order be rejected on grounds that the language my friend cites explicates and explains a limitation
mr speaker by direction of the committee on rules i call up house resolution 287 and ask for its immediate consideration
this resolution provides for an open rule on hr 2361 the interior appropriations act for fiscal year 2006 and provides for 1 hour of general debate equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking member of the committee on appropriations
actually mr speaker it does not but until you say that magic word the media does not send its attention to the fact that the house is actually continuing on with the input of good government in our processes so this bill actually for which i am pleased to stand before the house and support the rule on the underlying legislation is the interior appropriations act
it also provides for a record amount of funding to the national fire plan and gives the department flexibility in these accounts to help prevent and fight the annual onslaught of raging fires on public lands in the west which have plagued many areas especially california in recent years
it is also very nice to note that the committee on appropriations which is tasked with trying to prioritize needs and fund those that are truly significant in that prioritization and in this particular situation the gentleman from north carolina chairman taylor and the gentleman from washington mr speaker i reserve the balance of my time
if we add military lands on top of that it is almost 80 percent owned by the federal government
all of the money that was budgeted for that year s critical rescue missions was expended on that one individual entering from the east using all of these public lands
this is one of the issues in this freeflowing open rule that we will be discussing later on
this is an issue where i commend the chairman for doing what he has done in this bill and urge him to continue on because the citizens of the west the kids in the west the education system of the west have been harmed too long by policies that all of us in congress for over 30 years have been implementing
the gentleman from wisconsin is free to come here on the floor and talk about whether he believes the prioritization of this committee is accurate or not whether he believes the democrat approach would be a tax increase or not
it is rent that is due on that land and if you prioritize the budget you prioritize those programs first before you expand anything else
the text of the amendment previously referred to by mr hastings xz4001701 of florida is as follows previous question on h res 287 rule for hr 2361 fy06 interior appropriations at the end of the resolution add the following new sections sec
l 10827 shall be reduced by 1562 percent lt p gt mr speaker i yield back the balance of my time and i move the previous question on the resolution
mr speaker i object to the vote on the ground that a quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not present
mr chairman i want to thank the gentlewoman from california for her leadership on this issue and for yielding me this time and i want to thank the chairman for accepting our amendment
it violates the post world war ii nuremburg code which outlawed medical testing including pesticide testing on people
we need to pass the solisbishop amendment to ensure epa s research is based on sound science with the highest ethical standards
the republican leadership of the house decided to sit on their hands and wait for president bush to pull out of the air a number
while we were sitting on our hands the three surgical operating rooms at the white river junction in vamc was closed on june 27 because the heating and air conditioning system was broken
mr speaker i rise today in support of the motion to instruct conferees on hr 2361 department of interior environment and related agencies appropriations act for fiscal year 2006
perlin of vha at a full committee hearing on health care modeling and forecasting
the secretary returned from meetings with his staff on june 30 bringing to us a number of 975 million
yet the number was not even dry on the paper when in fact days later we were then informed that number was really 1275 billion and they needed an additional 300 million
now the challenge we have is they passed a number on the senate interior appropriations bill of emergency supplemental
so what we are doing is rolling one on top of another
now we are going to vote for an instruction to the conferees on 15 billion on emergency supplemental
but when we look at vha s forecasting performance which has been the focus at some of our animated hearings in the house 3 over the last several weeks in april they provide notice to the committee on appropriations that they are going to reprogram 600 million
then in the latter part of june when we hold our hearing they testify they are short 975 million but they have workaround solutions then a few days later while we are on our july break we learn that the number was short 300 million
we just held a hearing on the 2006 budget amendment which is just under 2 billion and then we told them that we are going to do some handholding as they prepare the 2007 budget
mr speaker i would say everyone wants the modeling to be correct and for us to reestablish trust and confidence on our predictability of a budget number
the gentleman from new york mr walsh xz4004200 touched on it and so did the gentleman from tennessee mr wamp xz4004210
over the recess other committee on veterans affairs members staff and i will personally visit va health care facilities because there is no substitute for bootsontheground examination
i want to make sure these allegations are correct so i am going to go on the ground to see if it is true
i have also asked the gao to review the va s budget process and i think that will be very important for some other eyes on this issue
unspent funds from this appropriation will be available for their use as down payments on the 2006 budget supplemental so that all funds will be put to good use
mr chairman i raise a point of order against section 413 of hr 2361 on the grounds that this provision changes existing law in violation of clause 2 b of house rule xxi and therefore is legislation included in a general appropriation bill
that is a very significant hit on these accounts in this important agency
i am always surprised that this issue takes on a partisan tone because i really believe each member cares about veterans
it is just that there seems to be an unwillingness on the part of this administration to face up to the reality of how much money is needed to take care of the veterans
we have been reading about posttraumatic stress syndrome and the consequences and the effect on the lives of these soldiers and sailors and marines when they come home after having been involved in the kind of violent combat that is being seen in iraq
i think mr nicholson has not been as forthright as he should have been in telling the various committees on the hill what was needed
has the committee held any hearings on why they are having all of these financial difficulties
some individual cities could have to spend as much as 100 million on this or perhaps even more
we held a hearing on this
there is a lot of misunderstanding on this issue
we need to have more work on this before we leap into this very complicated situation
in february in fact of 2004 nearly a year and a half ago republican chairman of the house committee on veterans affairs the gentleman from new jersey mr smith xz4003802 and his democratic ranking member the gentleman from illinois mr evans xz4001260 in a bipartisan letter predicted the administration request for va health care for this year would be 25 billion short
they fired the gentleman from new jersey mr smith xz4003802 from his job as chairman of the house committee on veterans affairs and even took him completely off the committee
at every step of the way over the past 2 years in the committee on the budget in amendments there in the committee on appropriations in amendments there in the 302 b allocation the amount of money for veterans care in the committee on appropriations in all of these places and on this house floor repeatedly the house leadership has fought against the money needed to adequately support our veterans health care needs during a time of our war on terrorism
it is time for republicans and democrats alike today to do the right thing and to instruct the conferees on the interior appropriations bill to support the same 15 billion emergency veterans health care funding that was approved by a bipartisan vote of 96 to 0 weeks ago in the senate
standing up for veterans may have cost the gentleman from new jersey mr smith xz4003802 his job as chairman of the house committee on veterans affairs but it was the right thing to do
mr speaker i thank the gentleman from wisconsin for yielding me this time and for his leadership on behalf of our nation s veterans leadership which has sorely been lacking in this house
the head of the office of management and budget actually had the nerve to testify before the committee on the budget that over the last 3 years the veterans administration had received 5 billion more than it actually needed more than it actually needed when we have waiting lists which the gentleman outlined when we have nursing and medical vacancies when we have maintenance backlogs when we have people waiting a year for an appointment for a dentist and months and months for surgeries that are needed
we had a mathematical model that did not take into account the fact that there was a war going on and thousands of troops were coming back with significant injuries and with posttraumatic stress disorder
we did not know a war was going on so we underfunded the va
that is an insult to our nation s veterans that we did not know a war was going on and we did not provide the money
and mr speaker when we had a chance to help the veterans before our last recess the chairman of the committee on veterans affairs said we can only give 975 million that that was the right number while the senate did 15 billion which we are now instructing our house to accept today
this could have been signed by the president several weeks ago yet in my hometown of san diego we have 1 000 people on a waiting list just to have their first appointment
so everybody who talked about our nation s veterans when we had memorial day when we had our july 4th celebrations and we will hear it on november 11th as we have heard today that we all support our veterans
the democrats in this congress have tried at every level on the committee on the budget on the committee on appropriations in the senate in the house and we tried on the floor of this house to give the independent budget numbers the force of law but we were voted down on pure partyline votes
this amendment if it is passed will be a rule of unintended consequences on what happens to the management of these horses
that is because we can not manage 20 000 horses on land which does not look like kentucky does not look like west virginia
this is what you get with this kind of policy horses that are starving to death on the range
horses on the range will most likely starve to death
because of the overwhelming cost of these facilities at the expense of the federal government the number of horses on the range is still well above the appropriate management levels called for in law
currently there are 8400 horses in these long term facilities that need to be moved on through the program in order to prevent malnutrition and starvation that is associated with the overpopulation of the range land herds
vote no on the rahallwhitfield amendment
but the rules committee on a straight party line vote prohibited the house from considering the gentleman s amendment
mr speaker i commend the gentleman from north carolina chairman taylor and the gentleman from washington mr dicks xz4001090 for their hard and perhaps most importantly bipartisan work on this legislation
mr speaker individuals in our country on their own are not going to force power companies to reduce mercury emissions from smokestacks
individuals on their own are not going to conduct major environmental restoration and they certainly do not have the capacity to clean up our drinking water
mr speaker i yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from massachusetts mr mcgovern xz4002630 with whom i serve on the committee on rules
mr speaker i am a bit confuzzled by the continuing argument of my colleague and friend on the committee on rules that his state is impacted by virtue of education formulas
mr speaker i yield 7 minutes to the gentleman from wisconsin mr obey xz4003000 ranking member of the committee on appropriations
if the previous question is defeated i will amend the rule so we can consider the amendment of the gentleman from wisconsin mr obey xz4003000 that was rejected in the rules committee last night on a straight partyline vote
we can fix this today if we allow the obey amendment to be considered on the floor
i want to assure my colleagues that a no vote will not prevent us from considering the interior appropriations bill but a no vote will allow members to vote on the obey amendment
i urge my colleagues in the house to vote no on the previous question
in an effort to cut down on the time constraints let me just briefly explain the amendment
in adopting my amendment congress will call on epa to move forward with the identification of atrisk minority and lowincome communities so appropriate steps can be taken to improve their health and wellbeing
evaluation report epa needs to consistently implement the intent of the executive order on environmental justice report no
thus the implementation of environmental justice actions is dependent not only on minority and income status but on the epa region in which the person resides
furthermore we recommended that epa develop and articulate a clear vision on the agency s approach to environmental justice
agency comments and oig evaluation in the response to our draft report the agency disagreed with the central premise that executive order 12898 requires the agency to identify and address the environmental effects of its programs on minority and lowincome populations
dear representative on behalf of our organizations members and supporters nationwide we write to express our support for representative alcee hastings dfl environmental justice amendment that will be offered to the interiorepa appropriations bill
the hastings amendment will ensure that funds spent at the us epa can not be spent in any way that conflicts with the 1994 executive order federal actions to address environmental justice in minority populations and lowincome populations eo 12898 directs each federal agency to develop an environmental justice strategy that identifies and addresses disproportionately high and adverse human health or environmental effects of its programs policies or activities on minority populations and lowincome populations with the goal of achieving equity in federallyfunded programs for those communities
the agency s failure to move forward on the important issue of environmental justice has been the hastings amendment does not place new requirements on the epa but rather provides direction for the agency to fulfill its longstanding obligation to ensure that minority and lowincome populations are not exposed to dangerous and disproportionately high levels of air pollution water contamination toxic hazards or other environmental and health threats in their communities
the amendment would trim a penny on the dollar across the agencies funded by this bill
some years ago as a member of the house interior committee i heard testimony on deaccessioning the kennedy center from the national park service
he said the center needed millions of dollars in structural repairs yet he could not move forward on them because of the park service contracting requirements and inflated costs
had i been present i would have voted no on rollcall no
we should be focused more on strengthening the federal commitment to water infrastructure which we all know has been stagnant for many years now
i plan soon on reintroducing my bill the clean water infrastructure financing act which will authorize funding levels in the clean water state revolving fund which better reflect the considerable depth of our nation s wastewater infrastructure needs
thanks to his work and members on both sides of this aisle the epa has largely accepted what this amendment would have already laid out and have stopped this regulation
it is going to listen to the congress on environmental protection and i really want to thank my subcommittee chairman for accepting this amendment
throughout the years this law has been eroded and currently there are only 35 000 wild horses living on our lands today
mr chairman on rollcall no
mr speaker on may 19 2005 i was unable to be present for rollcall vote no
190 on ordering the previous question to provide for consideration of hr 2361 making appropriations for the department of the interior environment and related agencies for the fiscal year ending september 39 2006 and for other purposes
had i been present i would have voted yea on rollcall vote no
mr chairman when epa proposed to issue a new policy document on sewage blending i was concerned that it could cause an increase in the frequency of blending by those communities that current use the practice and an increase in the number of communities that use the practice
sewage blending is the practice of taking partially treated wastewater mixing it with fully treated wastewater and then relying on the dilution to meet discharge limits
even the proponents of blending acknowledge that blending is used only in limited high flow circumstances at all other times the sewage otherwise receives full secondary treatment the current acknowledged limitations on the use of blending lead to the question if blending constitutes secondary treatment then why is it not acceptable all the time or if it does not constitute secondary treatment why is it allowed at all
mr speaker i will be voting against the previous question on the rule and after the bill is considered unless it is substantially changed i will be intending to vote against the bill itself for a variety of reasons
every time that those of us on this side of the aisle point to the shortcomings in the budget that the republican majority has just passed we hear well we ca nt do anything about these shortages in the appropriation bills because after all we have limited resources the gentleman who just spoke the gentleman from utah said the appropriations process quote should prioritize our needs i fully agree
but i do believe that people who are the most blessed in our society ought to pay their fair share and the budget resolution which was imposed on this committee by this house does not allow us to reach that kind of fair distribution of tax burden
so if we object to that what i regard to be not just illadvised but immoral allocation of resources the only device that we have to try to change that is to try to make our point on each of these appropriation bills trying to get the majority party to understand that just as they reconsidered their unilateral actions on ethics committee changes a couple of weeks ago we would also like them to reconsider their poor judgment on the budget resolution
i am an old real estate broker so i have nothing against real estate developers but i do not think they ought to be able to get their gloms on the most pristine land in this country and turn it into a shopping mall when we have our population increase by onethird since i came to this body and when we have an increased need for resources that the average family can enjoy
how any member votes on this bill is in my view up to that member
i am not going to be asking any member to vote any way on any appropriation bill but i will be voting no and i would like to briefly explain why
this bill does all of those things not because the gentleman from north carolina mr taylor xz4003981 wanted to but simply because of what the majority leader said 2 weeks ago when he said this is the budget the american people voted for when they voted for a republican house a republican senate and a republican white house i do not agree with mr delay xz4001040 on much but i agree with him in that assessment
mr speaker for the past 3 years a number of us on this side of the aisle including the gentleman from texas mr edwards xz4001180 myself and several others have tried to bring the administration to the realization that we needed many more dollars in the veterans health care funds than in fact they requested each year
i would point out also that in my view some members of this house have paid a very high price for speaking out on behalf of our veterans
we saw earlier this year news stories which reported the fact that the majority caucus not only removed from his chairmanship but removed from the committee itself the member on the other side of the aisle who chaired the committee in charge of veterans funding because he had been too insistent in agreeing with those of us on this side of the aisle who kept insisting that we needed more funding for veterans health care
mr speaker i yield 3 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from texas mr edwards xz4001180 who has been a key leader on this issue as the ranking member of the subcommittee on military quality of life and veterans affairs and related agencies
mr speaker how much time do we have remaining on each side
mr speaker let me conclude on this side by making four simple points
thirdly i would simply say that the administration s denial of the truth on this matter follows a pattern
we have a war going on
mr speaker on that i demand the yeas and nays
mr chairman i thank the chairman for yielding me this time and for his leadership on this issue
the loss of this new tool in selling would only mean that priority funding will keep going to care for and feed unadoptable animals instead of managing the number on the range and in balance with the demands of our other resources
in fact it would have no effect on any currently permitted uses of blending
mr chairman our communities are on the front lines in their attempts to meet the requirements of the clean water act
a limiting amendment which stops work on the blending issue will not benefit our environment and it will not benefit the public health
the amendment constitutes legislation on an appropriations bill
under the amendment the limit on funds does not apply to roads under construction on the date of enactment of this bill making this determination is far from simple
therefore determining the construction status of roads in the tongass would take considerable effort on the part of the forest service
appropriations without authorizations or that exceed authorized levels violate house rule xxi clause 2 this amendment enforces this rule by not allowing moneys to be spent for 10 specified programs within the committee on resources sole jurisdiction which are not authorized to be funded in fiscal year 2006 until the committee on resources authorizes them
for those programs which are authorized but the amount appropriated exceeds the authorized level such as in the case for the council on environmental quality then the amendment restricts the funding to the authorized level
one of the major problems that we have is the committee on appropriations gets in the position of having to continue to appropriate money on these unauthorized programs because they are important programs
the gentleman from north carolina mr taylor xz4003981 and the gentleman from washington mr dicks xz4001090 have worked with us on a number of different things that are in this bill over the past year
but when it comes to some of these major programs that we have not been able to get an authorization on i believe the time is now for us to move forward and begin to fence off those moneys until we can get an authorization done
in restricting the ability of the bureau of land management blm to sell wild horses and burros under the wild horse and burro act of 1971 we are also restricting opportunities for responsible owners or groups to purchase horses that might have otherwise been sentenced to spend their lives in holding facilities or to starve on our rangelands
i applaud the blm for their proactive stance on this issue and i am hopeful that their initiatives will be successful so that other horses are sent to slaughter
our wild horses are already competing for scarce sources of food and water on rangelands in arid states like nevada causing many of them to waste into skin and bones
this incentive will be dependent on a number of requirements one of which will be that these animals can not be sold to slaughter
i look forward to working with my colleagues on this issue
mr chairman i am offering this amendment on behalf of myself the gentleman from kentucky mr whitfield xz4004310 the gentleman from new york mr sweeney xz4003930 and the gentleman from south carolina mr spratt xz4003860
with no public notice or comment this rider trashed 33 years of national policy and lifted the prohibition on the commercial sale of america s wild horses
so their meat can end up on menus in france belgium and japan where it is considered a delicacy
from florida stacey wrote knowing that the horses wo nt be there for my kids has made me feel sad hurt and angry at our government a former west virginian named valerie who now resides in nevada wrote i and our friends have enjoyed going on to the desert to see wild horses roaming free jeremy from oregon wrote your support will help to restore the public s confidence by assuring us that congress operates under the principles of for the people and by the people we must restore the people s faith
i am wearing on my lapel a pin here a symbol which bears the likeness of ferdinand who won the 1986 derby and the 1987 breeders cup classic notable achievements
and i would say to the distinguished chairman of the subcommittee in defense of the gentleman from california mr pombo xz4003220 and myself on the authorizing committee this change was made in an appropriation bill not in an authorization bill
mr speaker on rollcall no
i urge my colleagues to vote yes on the stupakshawpallonemiller amendment
left unmanaged wild horses not only degrade our public lands but they also create conditions where many times these horses would be unable to survive on their own
this amendment would ensure that the environmental protection agency could not use funds in this legislation to accept consider or rely on studies from outside parties that intentionally expose human beings to pesticides
without these safeguards the epa should not be conducting tests which dangerously expose humans to pesticides nor should it be developing policy based on third party studies which fail to meet even basic internationally accepted standards
my colleagues the solisbishop amendment is supported by environmental and diverse religious organizations and among more than 80 000 others who have written to me saying they oppose the cheers study and support a moratorium on this type of testing
i urge you to support our amendment and prevent the unregulated and unethical testing of pesticides on humans
i know many of my colleagues are hearing that this amendment will pose astronomical costs on local communities
congress needs to send a strong clear message on behalf of our constituents
as a step in the right direction vote yes on the bipartisan stupakshawpallonemiller amendment

mr chairman i thank the gentleman for his question but our amendment does not intend to have any impact on any of the existing policies of epa regions and states that allow blending or on any clean water act permit that allows blending
mr chairman i yield 1 minute to the gentleman from pennsylvania mr fitzpatrick xz4006460 who has been helping us on this amendment
mr chairman i yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from illinois mr kirk xz4002220 who has been very helpful on this amendment
we accept his courtesy that he will accept our amendment and make it a part of the bill and we look forward to working with him on this and other related matters
i want to thank the gentleman from tennessee mr duncan xz4001160 also for his work in this area along with the gentleman from washington mr dicks xz4001090 and the members on our side
mr speaker i ask unanimous consent that during further consideration of hr 2361 in the committee of the whole pursuant to house resolution 287 no further amendment to the bill may be offered except pro forma amendments offered at any point in the reading by the chairman or ranking minority member on the committee on appropriations or their designees for the purpose of debate amendments printed in the record and numbered 3 6 8 11 13 and 17 amendments printed in the record and numbered 1 4 5 and 14 which shall be debatable for 20 minutes an amendment by the gentleman from florida mr hastings xz4001702 regarding environmental justice which shall be debatable for 20 minutes an amendment by the gentleman from wisconsin mr obey xz4003000 regarding a 500 million increase in clean water state revolving fund and tax matters an amendment by the gentleman from wisconsin mr obey xz4003000 regarding a 100 million increase in clean water state revolving fund which shall be debatable for 20 minutes an amendment by the gentleman from ohio mr gillmor xz4001500 regarding state and tribal assistance grants an amendment by the gentleman from ohio mr chabot xz4000710 or the gentleman from new jersey mr andrews xz4000080 regarding the tongass national forest which shall be debatable for 20 minutes an amendment by the gentleman from california mr pombo xz4003220 regarding making spending on certain accounts subject to authorization an amendment by the gentlewoman from california ms solis xz4003840 regarding intentional dosing an amendment by the gentleman from wisconsin mr obey xz4003000 to amendment no
each such amendment may be offered only by the member named in this request or a designee or the member who caused it to be printed in the record or a designee shall be considered as read shall not be subject to amendment except as specified and except that the chairman and ranking minority member of the committee on appropriations and the subcommittee on interior environment and related agencies each may offer one pro forma amendment for the purpose of debate and shall not be subject to a demand for division of the question in the house or in the committee of the whole
mr chairman this issue is about the proper management of wildlife and public lands and the committee on appropriations is in charge of trying to adequately fund the united states agencies
we in the committee on appropriations have a situation where wild horses and burros cost the taxpayers 40 million annually
now this is more than blm spends on all wildlife management activities on public lands
mr chairman i yield 1 12 minutes to the gentleman from virginia mr goodlatte xz4001540 the distinguished chairman of committee on agriculture
the draft policy received extensive public comment and has been the subject of considerable ongoing discussion and debate including being the focus of a recent hearing before the house subcommittee on water resources and environment
based on our review of all of the information received we have no intention of finalizing the blending policy as proposed in november 2003
mr chairman i yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from tennessee mr duncan xz4001160 the distinguished chairman of the subcommittee on water resources and environment
does the gentleman intend his amendment to have any impact on the policies of the epa regions and states that allow blending today and have issued permits allowing blending
this is a new area a new part of the committee and i would like to work with him as we go on with the bill toward conference
would the chairman rule on that and inform me
this subcommittee has conducted extensive oversight using the inspector general and the government accountability office on the use of foreign travel on large conferences
accordingly the committee rose and the speaker pro tempore mr bass xz4000190 having assumed the chair mr hastings xz4001701 of washington acting chairman of the committee of the whole house on the state of the union reported that that committee having had under consideration the bill hr 2361 making appropriations for the department of the interior environment and related agencies for the fiscal year ending september 30 2006 and for other purposes had directed him to report the bill back to the house with sundry amendments with the recommendation that the amendments be agreed to and that the bill as amended do pass
mr speaker we will soon i think hear from our chairman of the subcommittee on military quality of life and veterans affairs and related agencies who will be speaking on this
some 68 percent of our veterans are from world war ii and korea and we know when we go out on the plaza and see the monument to the world war ii veterans the sacrifices paid
mr speaker i yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from new york mr walsh xz4004200 chairman of the subcommittee on military quality of life and veterans affairs and related agencies a member of the party which as we all know has supported our veterans with increases every year
at a minimum major rules by the epa should go through a science advisory board and rules should then be audited by a neutral third party to ensure that our environmental regulations are based on scientific facts and not emotional theory
the rule requires that businesses report annually on how much lead is used
in june 2002 a small business owner from baltimore maryland testified before the regulatory reform and oversight subcommittee of the committee on small business on how this particular epa reporting rule causes harm to her business
some of nancy s work can even be found in the house gift shop and but because of the epa s toxics release inventory lead rule nancy s business is forced to compile daily records on how much color is used for the mugs because the color contains a very small amount of lead
but all the american people get from these thousands of reports are estimates on how much lead is being consumed but our air is not any cleaner
so in conclusion we must not move forward with our government to implement regulatory burdens like this on the american public because it drives jobs overseas it increases the trade deficit it reduces the federal revenue and it moves us toward a thirdrate economy
mr chairman i rise in opposition to this amendment and i certainly am one who is not in favor of the slaughtering of wild horses but i am also as a fiscal conservative who is concerned about what happens along the way because we are looking at a price of somewhere on the order of 20 million a year to take care of the horses that nobody wants to adopt right now
there are some 37 000 wild horses and burros roaming on blm managed lands in 10 western states
so i urge a no vote on this amendment
mr speaker i thank the chairman of the subcommittee on interior environment and related agencies of the committee on appropriations for calling for this motion to instruct conferees and i rise in support of that motion and i thank him for his hard work and support on this issue
we conducted lengthy extensive hearings as did the authorizing committee the committee on veterans affairs and we have been receiving different information all the way along
mr nicholson now has an opportunity to make his impression on the veterans administration and the key here is accountability
but to cite the estimates this year we need to reflect those against all of the preceding years and i think by and large we have been on the money
i stand on that record
for all of the right reasons we hired the gentleman from indiana as the chairman of the committee on veterans affairs because of what he is doing and we need to do in terms of reforms and accountability at the va
on issues like homeland security and veterans members can always say it is not enough money to try to appeal to people
this body does not exert enough oversight on how the money is being spent
but what this is really about it is about the fact that we have 18 000 permits issued by the bureau of land management to ranchers in the west on 214 million acres of land of which these ranchers are paying less than six cents per acre per year
they are grazing over 8 or 9 million cows on this land and we are talking about 31 000 wild mustangs and burros on this 214 million acres of land and the ranchers do not want any wild mustangs or burros on this land
i might also add that these 18 000 permits of ranchers on these grazing lands in the west provide only 2 percent of the cows slaughtered in america and we all like a good steak
do we have to get to the point of rivers catching on fire again
it is time that we started moving forward and not backward on protecting our rivers and our oceans
that said i am not categorically opposed to the sale of wild horses that live on federal lands and will seek to work with my colleagues to find a feasible solution to the federal land management challenges that underlie this issue
i urge chairman pombo of the house committee on resources to hold hearings on this matter so that we can ascertain the status of the blm s management authorities and resources
in the meantime because i believe that a oneyear moratorium on blm s sale authority for wild horses is needed to allow this debate i offer my support to the rahall amendment
mr chairman on rollcall no
mr speaker on rollcall no
i urge my colleagues to vote in favor of the amendment and ensure that the epa does not change its mind again and attempt to impose an imprudent sewage blending policy on america at some point in the future
to help us workers farmers and businesses and america s longterm economic security congress should take decisive action to bring about fair trade with china instead of squandering this opportunity on a weak republican bill
because the central american free trade agreement can not pass on its merits its supporters are attempting a lastminute bid to win desperately needed votes later this evening probably very late this evening on the central american free trade agreement
but what it is is just another cynical attempt to buy what is very well documented in this nation s profree trade procafta media very well documented in the media this is just another cynical attempt to buy votes on cafta among other cynical attempts to buy votes on cafta
we should not have to approve a jobkilling trade deal with central america in order to get the chance to vote on a toothless china bill
i will say that again we should not have to approve a jobkilling trade deal with central america in order to get a chance to vote on this toothless china bill
the gentleman from michigan mr levin xz4002380 and the gentleman from maryland mr cardin xz4000640 members of the committee on ways and means they want it to be but it should have nothing to do with cafta
in the past 5 years our government has refused to enforce domestic trade laws with regard to china failed to take advantage of wto mechanisms to challenge china s violations of international trade rules balked at taking any concrete action on china s manipulation of its currency what i hear from my manufacturers in akron in lorain and in elyria almost every week
congress may get only one chance mr speaker to act on china trade this year
wasting that opportunity on this ineffective bill is a betrayal of america s working families of our small manufacturers and of our longterm economic security
a toothless bill on china will not make cafta any better
mr speaker normally the gentleman from pennsylvania mr english xz4001230 and i are on the same side when it comes to antidumping and countervailing duty bills
we differ on this bill
this bill is on the suspension calendar
in regard to currency manipulation by china an issue that many of us have talked about on this floor what does this bill do it sets up another study by the treasury department
it would allow action to be taken in regards to the safeguards that we have negotiated with china on the wto accession agreement
we should have a full and open debate on our relationship with nonmarket economies
i listened to the gentleman from pennsylvania mr english xz4001230 talk about this being the key trade vote of the year and i think we should understand that the committee on rules is responsible to make sure that we have a fair and open debate by the manner in which they propose rules
there has never been an opportunity to offer a single amendment to this bill anywhere along the process whether in the subcommittee the full committee or here on the floor
mr speaker i understand that trade promotional authority gives the right of the administration to submit a tradenegotiated bill to the congress after consultation and after a mock markup on an upordown vote
the minority normally gets an opportunity to offer a substitute on a major bill
china does not adhere to international standards on protecting intellectual property
it provides some relief on one hand but makes it more difficult on the other
i hope we will listen to what the gentleman from the committee on rules is saying on the democratic side
give us a chance to have a full debate on china
the provision that we have in our legislation on china currency is to direct that a claim be brought within the wto not inconsistent with the wto so that we would use the dispute settlement resolution process within the wto which is certainly within the rights that we have
i just really wanted to clarify the record on currency manipulation
trade issues is an interest but i do not know the ins and outs but i want to speak as someone who is not on the committee that sees it in a little different way
mr speaker the vote that we are voting on today when we talk about amendments this is the same exact bill that we voted on yesterday in suspension
i understand while many of my colleagues on the other side and some on our side have difficulty with china it is a very difficult policy
and that is where the administration and republicans and democrats need to come together to try and help those sectors that have lost jobs because in other sectors jobs have increased and those presidents like many members on the floor feel that the overall policy is good
that is a good thing and that is why we are here today to vote on the same bill that we voted on yesterday
mr speaker the argument from the other side of the aisle that this issue is somehow tied to cafta i think is particularly striking and particularly odd because the underlying bill that we are considering today should be on the consent calendar it should not be controversial with the bulk of people in this congress who care about the american economy
mr speaker today the house has the opportunity to vote on a bill that will take the largest step toward strengthening our trade remedy laws in over 15 years
this bill would establish a strong and external system to audit china s compliance with trade obligations on intellectual property rights market access and transparency and it would place congress strongly on the record as opposing attempts to use the wto to water down domestic trade law protections
we need this legislation passed by a congress willing to come together to put aside its political differences and certainly not vote down this legislation merely for political positioning on another trade agreement
this is the top trade vote of this year and everyone will be counted on it
mr speaker i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from florida mr shaw xz4003690 the distinguished chairman of the subcommittee on trade
madam speaker i yield 1 minute to the gentleman from arizona mr hayworth xz4001730 a distinguished member of the committee on ways and means
madam speaker i yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from connecticut mrs johnson xz4002051 a distinguished member of the committee on ways and means
madam speaker i yield 1 minute to the gentleman from indiana mr chocola xz4000720 a distinguished member of the committee on ways and means and an authentic advocate of fair trade
madam speaker i yield 1 minute to the gentleman from new york mr reynolds xz4003380 a distinguished advocate of fair trade and a member of the subcommittee on trade
madam speaker i yield 1 minute to gentlewoman from pennsylvania ms hart xz4001680 a distinguished member of the committee on ways and means and a member of the executive committee of the congressional steel caucus
i realize our friends on the other side of the aisle never engaged on the sos bill the underlying core of this bill nor cosponsored it
i realize that they have been behind the curve on this
we have to move today and put this on the calendar today so that we can move quickly to send a message to china that we are going to close the loopholes that we are going to audit their compliance with their trade obligations that we are going to oppose the wto watering down our domestic trade relations and we are determined to put more money into trade so that we can enforce these agreements
let me say i do not look particularly becoming in a fig leaf and the gentleman from new jersey who is hanging his hat on the fig leaf that has been introduced by the other side which is not taken seriously by anyone does not look particularly becoming hanging back behind that either
it is just that the minority in the committee on ways and means never had much interest in issues like cvd before
the truth was blurted out may i tell the members mr speaker today in the hill magazine in which it quoted a spokesman for the committee on ways and means democrats as saying the minority s near unified opposition to the bill stemmed as much from its role in the cafta battle as from the strength of its content this is all about cynicism
they would rather stop a significant first step in dealing with china if it inconveniences their strategy on cafta
and i urge all of my colleagues including those intrepid democrats who supported us on this bill yesterday to join with us to get it through today and if they want to vote no let them do it
madam speaker i rise in opposition to hr 3283 on both process and policy grounds
this legislation is on the floor this week simply to provide political cover for members who vote for the flawed central american free trade agreement
let me remind my colleagues that our goal here is to get tough on china not give them a free pass while holding our friends with market economies to a tougher standard
the bill also imposes extra burdens on the us that raises serious issues with regard to both sovereignty and separation of powers
this provision is a serious infringement on the power of the legislative branch and strips the congress of much if not all authority to deal with our country s trade concerns with china
i rise in support of this bill and i am mystified by the opposition on the other side of the aisle
while rules exist to provide countervailing duties on such products rules do not take into account the advantages enjoyed by nonmarket economies like china
meeting with businesses in my district the three main complaints i have heard from my district regarding china have been piracy of product the dumping of products on our market and the currency pegging issue
madam speaker perhaps it is the eternal lament of a minority within a legislative body to focus constantly on process and to share their frustrations with process
but perhaps it is better to focus on policy and what this legislation which i support will do
the legislation on the floor today deals with verification
vote yes on this legislation
madam speaker i would like to thank my colleagues representative english chairman shaw and chairman thomas for their work on this matter
the majority has chosen to play politics on the floor today rather than seriously address the issues resulting from china s currency manipulation and the resulting trade imbalance that has ballooned between the united states and china
as one who advocated china s entry into the wto i am concerned and disappointed with china s passage of a law on government procurement that incorporates strong preferences for domestic goods and services fostering discrimination against for example software companies that have made a substantial commitment to the development of the chinese software industry
madam speaker i call on the chinese government to immediately enter into negotiations to accede to the agreement on government procurement of the wto as they committed to 3 years ago and to suspend the implementation of its law on government procurement
i urge my colleagues to vote overwhelmingly for this bill to send a very strong message to china on all the fronts the bill covers not the least of which is government procurement
remember we were told that a memorandum of understanding on prison labor with china would remove their competitive advantage and restore balanced trade
remember china s agreement to lower tariffs on imports
remember china stopped arbitrary limits on maintaining agricultural imports
mr speaker i have had the opportunity tonight to listen to an hour that was presided over by my colleague on the committee on ways and means on the majority side the gentleman from ohio mr turner xz4004110 and his fellow republicans and the statements of my colleagues on the democratic side
they have made commitments that they can not on their own keep
and then there has been the same process regarding sugar in order to try to win some votes from people who object to the provisions on sugar
one estimate is that in terms of gdp the impact of cafta on the us would be less than onefifth of 1 percent
as to central american countries there is evidence on all sides of the issue including dislocation that would occur
the headline was in latin america richpoor chasm stifles growth and i quote because of an abundance of natural resources and a large indigenous population latin american nations group up relying on raw materials cheap manual labor to exploit them and low government taxation
the system concentrated land ownership and wealth in a few hands deprived governments of money to spend on education and other incentives and essentially ordered the incentives for the elite to invest not in human capital or technology
latin america has also historically relied on monopolies and franchises leaving few opportunities for entrepreneurs to advance through hard work and innovation if you look at the history of trade agreements there has been an effort to begin to have them relate to workers to take into account the capital of workers as well as financial capital
there has been an effort to obscure what the reality is on the ground in central america but state department reports make it clear the ilo reports make it also very clear
that is the reality on the ground and there are so many cases that prove it
in a special order that i took on some weeks ago i spelled out one example in el salvador
i want to say to my colleagues on both sides of the aisle what undermines stability and security is when people are impoverished when people have no opportunity to climb up the ladder to the middle class
as i saw a few years ago in central america in the maquilas in three of the countries there are no rights of workers on the ground in reality
now they are going to come here on this floor in just a few days and what they are apparently going to try to do once again instead of getting 250 to 300 votes on a truly bipartisan basis they are going to essentially headstrong i think headinthesand in terms of good trade policy see if they can squeeze out a victory by one or two votes
the gentleman from new york mr rangel xz4003330 raised the issue why this is on suspension
and i want to ask the chairman of the subcommittee the gentleman from pennsylvania mr english xz4001230 and the gentleman from california chairman thomas why not put this bill not on suspension but regular order
this bill should be voted down so that we can have an honest discussion and debate on this floor about the way to handle this problem
i urge everybody to vote no on this bill and give this congress this house that is supposed to be the people s house a chance to discuss this bill with amendments
this is another example of the abuse of power by this majority stifling debate trying to stuff things through on suspension 40 minutes no amendment
what is going to happen is i think that this bill will be voted down so that we can take an honest serious look at this problem on a bipartisan basis
mr speaker quickly on process we are not asking for an open rule we are asking for the ability to bring up a substitute and three specific amendments number one
number three what you are doing is limiting debate on this and also on cafta
here is a reason why we need to have long debate on this issue and on cafta
we have been limited to 2 hours on cafta
i just saw an article from la nacion in costa rica about this alleged agreement on textiles and here is a quote from the minister the trade minister of costa rica
quickly on the china bill the gentleman from florida mr shaw xz4003690 said that the rangel substitute calls for unilateral sanctions
the currency thing i heard another colleague on the republican side say we need more information
this time the house decided it wanted a real debate on china s unfair trade practices and how best to remedy them
last night the republican majority on the rules committee reported out a closed rule for hr 3283 a closed rule that only allows for 1 hour of debate and no amendments well except for the one amendment offered by the back room author of this bill in the first place the gentleman from california mr thomas xz4004010 the distinguished chairman of the committee on ways and means
last night the committee on rules heard testimony on three amendments that would seriously address some of the major challenges facing us trade with china and other nonmarket economy nations
first there was the amendment modeled on the bipartisan bill originally introduced by the gentleman from ohio mr ryan xz4003522 the gentleman from california mr hunter xz4001910 and the gentleman from alabama mr davis xz4000922
then there was a amendment offered by the distinguished ranking member of the committee on ways and means the gentleman from new york mr rangel xz4003330 a comprehensive amendment that addresses the real problems facing america in its trade with china currency manipulation export surges barriers to us export of goods and services and the right of american private sector companies and workers to challenge china s agricultural and manufacturing subsidies
each of these concrete proposals presented to the committee on rules last night deserve debate and would significantly enhance the underlying donothing legislation
sadly mr speaker the committee on rules has become a place where democracy comes to die
heaven forbid that this house might actually have a real debate on these matters and heaven forbid that the republican majority might actually allow votes on these serious unfair trade practices
mr speaker i have sat in this chamber and heard over and over members on the other side of the aisle give 1minute speeches demanding that the senate have upordown votes on judicial nominations
this house has had enough time this week to provide 40 minutes of debate each to the naming of half a dozen post offices but we do not have enough time or interest to give the ryanhunterdavis amendment 10 or 15 minutes or the courtesy to give the ranking member of the committee on ways and means 10 or 15 minutes to offer a substitute amendment
in fact if press reports are to be believed this bill is being brought to the floor today as ineffective as it is so members on the other side of the aisle can have some cover to vote for cafta later on today
the gentleman complains that those on our side are criticizing the way this rule has been put together
we are sending a great message to china about democracy when the committee on rules last night shut off all debate when it says to members who have legitimate amendments that have bipartisan cosponsorship on amendments by the way you can not have an opportunity to offer your amendments on the floor
we have spent an entire week debating naming of post offices but we do not have the time to have a serious debate on this
mr speaker i yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from new york ms slaughter xz4003780 the ranking member of the committee on rules
i would suggest to the gentleman from indiana if he really wants a policy debate that he will join with us on this side and vote no on the previous question so we can bring up some very reasonable thoughtful amendments that will put some teeth into this bill
i think one of the reasons why they are not being made in order is because the leadership on your side believes that in fact these amendments will actually carry the day
this is the bill that the gentleman from pennsylvania introduced and then mysteriously this is the bill that came out of nowhere out of the committee on ways and means no hearings no markup nothing
mr speaker i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from maryland mr cardin xz4000640 the ranking member on the trade subcommittee
we can not even have a debate on those
we can not have an upordown vote on it
my colleagues talk about how the senate should vote up or down on judicial nominees
why can we not vote up or down on these thoughtful amendments
i am going to urge my colleagues to vote no on the previous question so that i can amend the rule to allow the house to consider the rangel substitute
the substitute was offered in the committee on rules last night but was blocked on a straight partyline vote
mr speaker i ask unanimous consent to print the text of the amendment immediately prior to the vote on the previous question
mr speaker whatever position members have on this legislation they should vote against the previous question so we can consider another and i believe a better approach to our trade troubles with china
the rangel proposal contains a countervailing duty mechanism that american businesses could actually use to fight these unfair trade practices and at the very least the house deserves a debate on the rangel proposal but it is not going to get one here today unless we defeat the previous question
three closed rules were reported from the committee on rules last night
so vote no on the previous question so we can include this important amendment
my friends on the other side of the aisle supporting this bill rightly have stated that china is stealing our jobs but this bill and cafta later is going to give our jobs away
again vote no on the previous question let us make this flawed bill significantly better
mr speaker on that i demand the yeas and nays
i want to thank my good friend the gentleman from michigan mr levin xz4002380 a distinguished member of the committee on ways and means
this week the house is expected to vote on a trade agreement that only promises job losses and devastation
it is time to get off the fast track of lost jobs and shattered dreams and on to the right track for fair trade agreements
tomorrow the house is expected to vote on hr 3283 the socalled united states trade rights enforcement act
this bill does nothing to effectively address china s unfair trade practices and their adverse impact on us workers and manufacturers and the nation s economy
americans should wonder what kind of witchcraft is being passed on the house floor as we consider cafta in the dead of night
so i hope members on both sides of the aisle will take a good hard look at this trade policy because we can not sellout the american workers
we must reverse these trade policies to once again put the united states of america on the path of growth
china limits foreign participation in the wireless market by imposing severe regulatory requirements on telecommunications imports
they have a valueadded tax on all nonchinese semiconductors which also hampers american manufacturers ability to export to them
consideration of this bill is an important part of what we need to be doing in an extensive selection of things to hit back on china
the majority realizes if they simply put cafta on the floor they do not have even the muscle in this instance to put this legislation through
i think that if they put a study in front of this house we all ought to take a test on it in 2 years
on customs duties they have a 3year but listen to this temporary measure to deal with the issue
how much more emphasis can we put on that issue in this institution
an emphasis on that term recalibrate our trading relationship with china
when we get done with this legislation today and there is some question as to whether or not they can pass it i am just going to close on this note
we have a highly regarded regular order in this institution of the responsibilities of the committee on ways and means the committee that many members of this institution desire to be on
you have hearings with a respected tradition in this house of representatives for the committee on ways and means
on both sides of the aisle regardless of how trade bills and this is trade day i guess on the floor of the house regardless of how these bills go up or down the american public knows who is exposing and who is extending and who is sending jobs overseas
we have had two administrations now that have given the store away one democrat and one republican administration and you come on this floor and want us to believe that you are going to pass this legislation and teach china a lesson
that it is even being considered on this floor to buy a few votes is an embarrassment to the house of representatives
people from both sides of the aisle have stated on the record what those abuses are
we can not even get in to see what is going on in those factories
it is on the front page of the financial times and the wall street journal and the new york times
one hundred four small manufacturing business owners told us they did not think cafta would have any impact on their business
we gave up article i section 8 of the constitution what we learn in the eighth grade commerce belongs in the house of representatives not on the president s desk
in reality this bill which appeared out of the blue on the house floor as a suspension bill is part of a deal made with several members in return for a few votes on cafta
first there is sufficient precedent to suggest that doing this would have very little effect on china s trade surplus with the united states
mr speaker i commend my colleagues who have just completed their hour discussing on the house floor tonight why we should enact cafta
it is an enormous privilege to serve on the ways and means committee the committee of jurisdiction on trade matters
i could spend my time tonight going into the whats and the whereases and the whatfors but i think it might be more fruitful to discuss this in the broader perspective perspective first of all involving the track we are on relative to our trade agreements and our nation s economy
we have been on a track of these trade deals part of our participation in the global economy for some years now
it would just seem natural that as you stroll to the table and negotiate on behalf of the country you represent that you advocate the nation s interests the nation s jobs the nation s opportunity to sell more under these agreements
this year 2005 we are on the brink of importing more food than we export
clearly this trade path that we are on is not working and quite clearly cafta is more of the same
and i represent people third generation fourth generation on the land families that broke the prairie under the homestead act to begin their family s farming experience and now making a go of it because they raise sugar beets in the red river valley
just another chapter in this global trade path we are on that has cost us so much and brought us the deepest deficit in the history of the country
it is just wrong to link federal highway appropriations to preferred votes on trade deals
they are the ones who are counting on you tonight
i urge my republican colleagues who are on the fence on this trade deal getting tremendous pressure from the leadership i urge you to stand your ground stand with your constituents
they need you badly on this vote
we are on the brink of winning this important vote
mr speaker by direction of the committee on rules i call up house resolution 387 and ask for its immediate consideration
mr speaker house resolution 387 is a closed rule that provides 1 hour of debate in the house equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the committee on ways and means
the rule waives all points of order against consideration of the bill and provides that the amendment in the nature of a substitute printed in the committee on rules report accompanying the resolution shall be considered as adopted
specifically the bill would establish a monitoring system to track china s compliance with its trade obligations on intellectual property rights market access for us goods services and agriculture and accounting of chinese subsidies so that we open it up and have that transparency that has been lacking to date
the system would require that the president issue semiannual reports to congress on china s progress in meeting these commitments
the bill also tightens the rules on antidumping duties by requiring cash deposits and suspending for 3 years the availability of bonds for new shippers in antidumping cases in order to prevent those shippers from defaulting on their obligations
hr 3283 increases funding for the us trade representative to improve the monitoring and enforcement of us trade agreements something that we hear about an awful lot on this floor the lack of enforcement of prior trade agreements
the bill also authorizes funding for the us international trade commission and requires the commission to conduct a comprehensive study on the sensitivity of us trade and jobs to current policies
this bill was up for a vote yesterday on the suspension calendar
so for the second day we will have an opportunity to devote the time and resources to debate the need for our country to enforce trade agreements with china to keep our commitments that have been negotiated and passed in the congress to make sure that the resources are in the department i am happy to yield mr speaker 5 minutes to the gentleman from indiana mr souder xz4003850 another leader on this issue
the gentleman on the other side of the aisle for whom i have a great deal of respect from new jersey represents a major industrial state lots of manufacturers
mr speaker i yield 3 12 minutes to the gentleman from pennsylvania mr english xz4001230 the sponsor of this legislation and someone who has worked for years very diligently on all the issues relating to china
as the gentleman is aware house rules allow for the motion to recommit and sets aside time for debate on the democratic alternative to the legislation that we are considering here
lauderdale florida mr shaw xz4003690 the chairman of the trade subcommittee of the committee on ways and means
but at the end of the day this is a real worthwhile enforcement tool that gives members the opportunity to show the folks back home where they are on fair level trade with china
the application of us countervailing duty law on nonmarket economies is not an empty gesture
a system of comprehensive monitoring of chinese compliance with their trade obligations on intellectual property rights market access for our american goods services and agriculture an accounting of the chinese subsidies increased transparency so that we know what the government ownership is we know what they are subsidizing we know how much
and funding for the itc and an itc report on the sensitivity of us trade and jobs to the currency policy something that on a bipartisan basis we have heard a great deal of angst about from members of congress
that is a reflection of what is going on in the countryside that there are genuine fears out there about currency manipulation
this bill gives us an opportunity to get our arms around how extensive that is and what effect the reforms and the step forward the chinese government made this week will have on our economy and our employment base
we have debated it now this is the second day first on the suspension calendar admittedly with the belief that it would garner twothirds support from this chamber in the belief that everyone would share in the need to crack down on chinese abuse of trade agreements that everyone would agree that we need to put as many tools in the tool kit as possible to enforce and monitor their compliance to bring about that transparency so that the world community can see what is going on can see where there are distortions can see where there is manipulation and now it is back today for a straight upordown vote

one would hardly believe that this bill is on the calendar today for purposes of improving our trade relationship with the people s republic of china
but at the same time we truly believe that these bills should not be the rangel bill with democrats or the english bill with republicans but rather a bill that we can say as members of the committee on ways and means and as member of congress that we have taken it to the committees we have had hearings and we have come out with a position that you do not have to check the party to know whether it is right or whether it is wrong
we hope that a vote against this bill will send a message to democrats and republicans not to use the procedures of the house for political purposes to not put controversial bills on the suspension calendar and to take them to the committee of jurisdiction where they belong so that they can be discussed debated and then brought to the floor in a bipartisan way so that we can look at it
mr speaker i hope this bill is pulled so that we do not have to take a vote on it
mr speaker i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from maryland mr cardin xz4000640 the distinguished ranking member of the subcommittee on trade
mr speaker i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from michigan mr levin xz4002380 a former ranking member of the subcommittee on trade of the committee on ways and means
i think this discussion especially the opposition to the rangel bill by the gentleman from pennsylvania mr english xz4001230 just shows the complexity as well as sincerity of those people that would like to put some checks on the conduct of the chinese trade people and i think emphasizes why this bill should not be on the suspension calendar
madam speaker i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from massachusetts mr neal xz4002910 a member of the committee on ways and means
how can anyone perceive as one of the members on the other side said the most important trade legislation that we ever had will be put on just for 40 minutes debate
all the members of the committee on ways and means feels the same way about trying to do something to contain the overreaching of china
putting this on the suspension calendar in my opinion is an insult to members on both sides of the aisle and is an insult to those people who oversight what we do because the suspension calendar means that we never thought that they would ever have a problem with it and that is why we did not share what is in this bill
i also think that it is really unfair to have the members of congress to believe that this bill comes to the floor because of its importance and therefore has to be passed on the suspension calendar
we have plenty of time to work in the committee on ways and means in dealing with this so that we can be proud that we do not have a rangel bill or an english bill or a republican bill or a democratic bill
the pride should come when we have a congressional bill which we can say both sides have an opportunity to hear witnesses to see what the impact is going to be whether it is going to work or not work to see whether those who have fought to put checks on china feel satisfied that we have done it and to be able to say to foreigners that we may have differences among ourselves political differences but when it comes to trade policy we speak with one voice
what we should be doing is bringing these issues up in the committee that has jurisdiction and we are so proud of it and to make certain that the best we can is to have this as a bipartisan effort on both sides
so this is not the first time that the committees of jurisdiction have had to have members bypassed in terms of their input bypassed in terms of the ability to have amendments and bypassed in terms of saying that we have to find some way to find some bill that we can get bipartisanship on it
but trade bills should not be on the suspension calendar
madam speaker on that i demand the yeas and nays
whether it is currency manipulation or unfair subsidies it is clear that our local employers have long had enough of the way china cheats on trade
i commend the gentleman from pennsylvania mr english xz4001230 and the gentleman from california chairman thomas for their hard work on this issue and i urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this legislation
i recently hosted roundtables with manufacturers in my district and whether it s currency manipulation or unfair subsidies it s clear that our local employers have long had enough of the way china cheats on trade
i commend congressman english and chairman thomas for their hard work on this issue and i urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this bill
madam speaker i thank the gentleman from pennsylvania mr english xz4001230 for yielding me this time and i thank the chairman for working on this bill
we should vote on the bill that will make a difference
we have the chance today for the first time to put a law enforcement trade officer in charge so that when they get up in the morning the first thing they do is work on how to stop china from doing exactly this and stealing jobs from our economy
i plead with those on the other side if they truly care about labor if they care about the individual that gets up in the morning plays by the rules and is trying to compete in a world market they will vote for this bill
given a level playing field we will compete with any nation on the face of the earth
this product right here you can not tell the difference in these two products except what is on the inside
check this out traditionally the data that we use to determine whether or not a subsidy takes place is used by basing that data on comparable market economies
we are going to be basing our decisions on data that is gathered by the people s republic of china
i first want to recognize the gentleman from pennsylvania mr english xz4001230 a member of the committee on ways and means subcommittee on trade for his persistence in bringing this bill to the house floor
in this bill we create an extensive monitoring of the chinese market and its compliance on a range of issues such as intellectual property enforcement whether the currency mechanism is being implemented properly market access to the united states goods and its accountability of chinese subsidies
we must continue engaging the chinese government on the importance of a complete movement toward a managed float of its currency
i might say it too that he is absolutely correct because there is a substantial provision in there that was written by the gentleman from new york mr rangel xz4003330 the ranking democrat on the committee on ways and means
let us talk about an open rule on a trade bill something coming out of the committee on ways and means
fortunately for all americans that plot failed and the measure was defeated on the floor
the leadership once more has shut the door on the delivery of democracy by providing just 1 hour of debate on this measure
and more importantly on a partyline vote the republicans voted to prevent any amendment by any member of congress from even being considered on the house floor today which would strengthen this bill
this is like being given an opportunity to vote in an election with only one candidate on the ballot
it has no teeth and that is exactly how the majority wants it long on rhetoric and short on substance
it fails to include real solutions proposed by members on both sides of the aisle
buffalo color is the victim and it has already been adjudicated of illegal chinese dumping of indigo dye on the american market
i want members to understand that the unfair trade practices are going on because this administration will not stop them
i hope the sad irony of this is not going to be lost on anybody here today because buffalo color should be able to count on its federal government to provide protection from unfair trade practices
it has been alleged here on the house floor that this is a trade for cafta to get some of our votes
i took it to the president the vice president our trade ambassador the secretary of state because we have had no action on china
whether it was a democratic president or a republican president we have had no action on china
whether it was a democratic congress or a republican congress we had no action on china
and those critics of those of us who have been putting pressure on china in the last few weeks said we could never get them to reevaluate their currency
so rather than declare victory and rather than saying we finally it looks like are going to pass a bill on china the other side wants to take it down or at least a few members
while i applaud this movement on the part of the chinese there is much more that needs to be done
hr 3283 will explicitly allow them to impose cvds on nonmarket economies
i am one of many members that withheld support for cafta in exchange for concrete action on china
mr speaker i would like to address a few questions on process and some on policy
they rolled us on vote after vote and we can not get their attention
if you do not have any data like this bill is asking us to collect when i went in and worked with the gentleman from pennsylvania mr english xz4001230 and others to try to put this bill together in the beginning the main problem is that most of the proposals on the table are not workable
furthermore as i worked with ambassador zoellick and with now ambassador portman and josette shiner and others who are working and lobbying china is that as you confront them on these issues it was questionable whether they had the power to invoke countervailing duties
now for all the rhetoric that comes through and we come down here on the floor and we pound on china and lose another vote and pound on china and lose another vote the fact is they have reevaluated their currency this past week
all the rhetoric of congress got nothing but when we leveraged on cafta which quite frankly is a little tiny peanut compared to a great big elephant when we are talking about china very important in central america very important to those democracies important to a few people in our country and certain trading agreements but just a little tiny trade thing and china is a huge trade thing but they will not talk to me or others about china either party unless you leverage your vote when it becomes a critical time
the pressure was so great out of congress on the markets and manipulation that they made a small concession
normal participation going through the ways and means committee means it would have been buried so deep we would not have even seen the letters with the hr on it
quite frankly when i first saw that bill go down last night i thought the china lobby won again the china lobby on our side that wanted to bury it and the china lobby on the other side that wanted to bury it
this provision could place wto dispute settlement tribunals on a special footing when dealing with us laws
in fact this bill does little to address serious trade issues with china and it is on the house floor for only one reason to garner votes for cafta later this week
this despite the fact that china joined the world trade organization wto in 2001 and should be well on its way to reducing trade barriers and opening up their markets to us goods and services
if the leadership were serious about china we would be voting on this meaningful legislation today
it is true that there are monitoring provisions dealing with agreements that china has voluntarily laid on the table for example moving away from the government of china using counterfeit software and therefore protecting intellectual property rights and china assigned itself the date of the end of calendar year 2005
i am pleased to say that the gentleman from new york mr rangel xz4003330 and the gentlewoman from connecticut mrs johnson xz4002051 have examined and offered a resolution on the government procurement agreement of the world trade organization urging china to fully participate
this bill is designed to meet a number of members particular concerns focused on world trade not just china
yes it includes the office of china affairs but i do want members to know it also includes the office of japan korea and asian pacific affairs because there are several provisions in here monitoring frankly the government of japan based upon its unfair trade practices most focused on the use of socalled sanitary and phytosanitary measures as in fact nontariff trade barriers
some of the other measures and we saw that in the hearings that the committee on ways and means has had over china and other trade concerns this bill is backed by hearings notwithstanding what the gentleman from new york mr rangel xz4003330 said
further by placing this legislation on the suspension calendar which is reserved for noncontroversial legislation the republican leadership has refused to offer a full debate to members to consider alternative plans to strengthen enforcement of our trade policies and hold countries accountable for their trade practices
head start has long lasting effects on those most in need
this bill was passed unanimously out of the committee on education and the workforce in may
unfortunately the boustany amendment would jeopardize this important bill by allowing for employment discrimination based on religion
instead of trying to tack on a partisan amendment we should pass a bill that maintains head start s high standards and allows head start centers to hire the most qualified teachers
i urge my colleagues to vote no on the boustany amendment
mr chairman the committee on education and the workforce learned that more head starteligible children ages 3 to 5 are participating in state prekindergarten programs because there are more of them leaving some of the head start programs with unused slots
mr speaker by direction of the committee on rules i call up house resolution 455 and ask for its immediate consideration
the resolution before us provides for a structured rule for the consideration of hr 2123 the school readiness act of 2005 and makes a good number of important amendments in order and will provide for a full and wideranging debate on all the aspects of the head start program
mr speaker hr 2123 was passed out of the committee on education and the workforce unanimously
they put greater emphasis on language skills prereading premath and cognitive skills
especially important is this particular thing that in the text of this particular bill it puts a greater emphasis on tying head start programs to a state s curricular standards
the committee on rules instead in addition to the manager s amendment recommended 11 additional amendments five by republicans six by democrats
one was withdrawn before our committee on rules
mr speaker it is my pleasure to yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from ohio mr boehner xz4000360 the chairman of the committee on education and the workforce
i understand her feelings about not being allowed to have an amendment placed in order on the floor
i would simply point out that the particular amendment to which the gentlewoman refers was offered in the committee itself and was defeated on a bipartisan vote in that committee
it was one of the concepts that we thought was not necessary to replow all old ground over and over again and that is probably one of the reasons why this particular amendment was not placed in order by the committee on rules
mr speaker what we are talking about is the rule on if an amendment should be debated which is far different than actually debating the amendment itself
this debate is going to be extremely lively during its proper time and place during the debate on the floor when the amendment is presented
i have always enjoyed his comments in the committee on rules and i have oftentimes agreed with his comments in the committee on rules
i would point out that contrary to what we sometimes hear on the floor the minority s first approach on this particular amendment was to try to ban it and take it off the table so it would not be discussed
i am sure when the amendment is actually before us it will be a remarkable discussion based on what we have had right now on the rule on if we discuss the amendment
mr speaker as we conclude the debate on this rule i would remind people that the underlying bill provides for the head start program in many different areas
it provides for academic refocusing on class readiness and to close the class readiness gap
mr speaker i yield back the balance of my time and i move the previous question on the resolution
i am happy to see some improvement offered in the school readiness act of 2005 such as abandoning blockgranting increasing accountability on academic performance and content and teacher quality
instead of focusing on getting more eligible children into the program the republican leadership is once again attempting to repeal civil rights protections by introducing an amendment permitting religious organizations to use federal funds to discriminate in hiring and firing decisions
mr speaker i want to thank my colleague from utah for yielding time and mr speaker today we have an opportunity to act on behalf of the nearly 1 million disadvantaged children in the united states who participate in the head start early childhood education program every year
the bill before us the school readiness act was introduced by the gentleman from delaware mr castle xz4000700 my friend and colleague and approved unanimously by the committee on education and the workforce in may
they focus on issues from job training to child care and everything in between
president bush has called them the armies of compassion and these armies are always on the front lines when our nation needs them most
the 1964 civil rights act made clear that when faithbased groups hire employees on a religious basis it is an exercise of the group s civil liberties
former president bill clinton signed four laws explicitly allowing faithbased groups to staff on a religious basis when they receive federal funds and a 1987 supreme court decision unanimously upheld this right
i want to commend the chairman of the subcommittee on education reform the author of this bill and my good friend the gentleman from delaware mr castle xz4000700
today i urge members to support an amendment that i will be offering on behalf of the gentleman from louisiana mr boustany xz4006360 to restore the hiring protections in the head start program so that faithbased institutions can participate fully without giving up their mission and character that make them such an effective partner for programs like head start that serve those in need
once again i would like to thank the author of the bill the gentleman from delaware mr castle xz4000700 for his hard work on behalf of the nearly one million children served each year by the head start program
mr chairman i am pleased to yield 6 minutes to the gentleman from delaware mr castle xz4000700 the author of the bill and the chairman of the subcommittee on education reform
there has been a great deal of effort been put into this bill on a bipartisan basis and it has been pointed out it came out of committee 480
one of the reasons that there is some concern is that members on both sides of a question over the role of faithbased organizations there are meaningful differences on both sides but we have nothing to fear in allowing the house to work its will
so later today we will have an amendment that i will offer on behalf of the gentleman from louisiana mr boustany xz4006360 to allow those organizations to have their rights protected under the 1964 civil rights act and still provide these necessary services
now if you disagree with that go to the committee on the judiciary and rewrite the 1964 civil rights act
unfortunately my colleagues know that we are likely to win because we have won on this case time and time again as this debate has occurred in this house
mr chairman i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from california mr george miller xz4002780 the ranking democrat on the committee
mr chairman i suggest to my colleagues that the amendment the gentleman from wisconsin offers he and i have worked together on this closely over the course of this year
nobody has asked me for it i am not suggesting there is going to be a rush to come in with innovation but without some opportunity at getting a return on your investment will the innovation ever come
we have had this debate many times before here on the house floor
former president bill clinton signed four laws explicitly allowing faithbased groups to staff on a religious basis when they receive federal funds the 1996 welfare reform law the 1998 community services block grant act the 2000 community renewal tax relief act and the 2000 substance abuse and mental health services administration act
countless times he has called on congress to send him the same language protecting religious hiring that president clinton signed on four other occasions this amendment answers the president s call once again
we should not be denying compassionate professional faithbased providers the opportunity to serve our children and i want to urge my colleagues to vote yes on this amendment
but the american people elected us to come here and make decisions on their behalf
it has passed every time on a bipartisan basis and i expect it will pass on a bipartisan basis again today
now if you want to change the 1964 civil rights act and say to religious organizations you can have your exemption on hiring unless you take a federal dollar fine
go have that debate in the judiciary committee bring it out here and we will vote on it
and for the members who have been paying some attention to this we know that members on different sides of the aisle and frankly it is on a bipartisan basis have deeply held convictions about this
but this is an issue that the house really should decide and the house should vote on
i will speak more when the bill is on the floor
mr speaker we worked very hard to make this a piece of legislation that could be supported by all of us and i think we succeeded on that as was shown by the unanimous vote coming out of the committee on education and the workforce
i thank the staff on both sides who had a great deal to do with that
i also would like to say that i think the committee on rules has been extremely fair
we may disagree and in fact i disagree with a couple of the amendments but i agree with most of them on both sides
i have listened to part of the debate here on the faithbased that is going to go on all day i suppose
but on the other hand there are strong views on that and i think they have a right to be recognized and a vote needs to be taken on that too
we all can agree on the need for head start and its successes
the gao made a couple of recommendations on how we can strengthen the oversight structure to prevent abuses and protect good grantees
i would say finally although we may have some disagreement about some of the amendments on this legislation that ultimately getting all these children up to the starting line equal in school and particularly those who are at 100 percent of poverty or less is in the best interests of all of us in congress and all the kids out there in the united states of america
i am pleased to offer this amendment which i indicated was drafted on a bipartisan basis
specifically the amendment would revise the financial audit language to ensure that financial audit requirements for head start programs are consistent with those required under the single audit act amendments of 1986 that it builds on parental consent requirements included in hr 2123 as reported to further clarify that any health service available to children in head start may not be performed without the prior written consent of the parent and included a number of technical and conforming amendments
in fact i very much like that the house bill keeps in place the policy council with the role i had in mind for it while putting above it a board of directors with what i see to be some good requirements for membership on this board
in fact the boustany amendment could allow discrimination on practically any basis
for instance in deciding who gets hired and fired from head start do we really want an individual s position on contraception or creationism to be equally as relevant as their professional qualifications
at a hearing held by the government reform subcommittee on criminal justice drug policy and human resources of which i am the ranking member david kuo former deputy director of the white house office of faithbased and community initiatives testified that at the same time many members of the president s own party expressed equal parts apathy and antipathy towards this agenda
all we really need to do is make sure that we have a huge political fight over religious charities right to hire and fire based on their own faith
as many of my colleagues have pointed out and i will repeat for emphasis current law already supports the notion that faithbased organizations can use its own private funds to decide who it wants to hire on the basis of religion they simply can not discriminate in hiring with american taxpayers dollars
i encourage my colleagues to vote no on the boustany amendment and if passed to vote no on final passage
i would say that a friend of mine said that when we are talking about the religious aspect of this he said when you come to congress and somebody will say you wear the lord on your shoulder he said you tell them that is wrong you wear them on your whole body
we have had a very good process i think in the committee on education and the workforce in moving toward the reauthorization of head start
when our taxes are used to hire people should the decision be based on whether that person is a baptist a roman catholic a mormon a muslim a hindu or a jew
one of the strengths of head start has been encouraging parents to volunteer and tens of thousands of parents as we know have gone on to develop skills to become a paid aide or teacher
they are more likely to go on to college and to have professional careers
we all know the benefits of mentoring whether it is after school on weekends or during the school day mentoring programs change young peoples lives
but also as a person of faith someone who has revered my religious freedom under the constitution i am deeply disappointed and offended that the republican leadership of this house has allowed an amendment on the floor today that would deny potentially hundreds of thousands of american citizens a governmentfunded job simply because of their religious faith
i wonder how the gentleman from utah mr bishop xz4000291 who is the floor manager on the republican side of this rule would feel mr speaker if right now i asked him to answer my 20point religious test
shame on the republican leadership for endorsing and subsidizing religious discrimination
it is disappointing to me and i think to the vast majority of americans that on the same day we are pleading with iraqis to provide religious freedom to their citizens the republican leadership and this house with this amendment is saying it is okay to force an american citizen to choose between his or her faith and his or her job
i think people of faith are going to be offended by the fact that some in this house think that groups have got to be able to discriminate based on religion in order to make their programs work
and i have difficulty understanding the rationale for opposing this amendment because it has been established in law for some time that churches have the right to hire on the basis of religion and the activities they pursue
obviously they should be allowed to hire on the basis of religion for the operations of the church
they could not have done that without that but virtually every church in the city worked on it
again all of these workers were affiliated with churches and were hired partly on the basis of their religious faith
they understand based on their spiritual commitment that they have a responsibility to their fellow human beings and that in the name of god they are to minister to others who are in need
and that is why they are an effective social force in meeting the needs of the poor meeting the needs of those who are hurting and that is the reason that they are an effective agency of the federal government to work with in terms of crisis emergency or simple pain and need on the part of certain people
you today can get a bill passed in a bipartisan vote unanimously with everybody understanding because we are investing in america s children and you chose to take that progress and play politics in the most ugly way by pinning american against american based on their religion
the chairman of the committee did a good job in the committee producing a good bill that builds on the progress of the last 40 years and continues to invest in america s children and you chose to put an amendment on this floor unprecedented that chose to divide america not unite it to choose politics over progress and to continue the same policies that has taken this congress to the lowest esteem ever in the american people s history
i just would read the amendment not later than one year after implementation of the head start teacher qualifications and development under amendments made by this act the secretary of health and human services shall submit to congress a report on head start teacher retention levels i rise to support this amendment and i want to thank the gentlewoman from california ms woolsey xz4004360 my good friend who for the 13 years she has been here has been a tireless advocate for head start and all other education programs that provide access of all our country s children to the quality education that they deserve
the government gets it right on head start
i was on the san diego school board for 4 years where i watched children successfully matriculate into elementary schools from head start programs from all around our city
so since there is a real possibility of increased teacher requirements leading to a dropoff in the number of experienced head start teachers i hope the house will accept my amendment which calls for the secretary of health and human services to submit to congress a study reporting on head start s teacher retention levels
these early results will tell us if we are on the correct path or if we need to modify some of the rules before there is more damage
not everything was done that we liked on our side
it would not go on the deficit
this would be hundreds of millions of dollars because it comes from the profits of fannie mae and freddie mac not on the deficit
the gentlewoman from california ms waters xz4004220 the ranking member of the subcommittee on housing has said giving assurance to the people of new orleans the poorer people in particular of new orleans and frankly a lot of african american people that we will be committed to rebuilding the city so they can come back home is very important
the longer we delay on this bill the longer we delay giving people what is very important reassurance at a critical time
again we are talking about federal money and we are talking about not imputing to religious groups an insistence on bigotry and discrimination in the spending of federal funds
in fact former president bill clinton signed four laws that explicitly allow faithbased groups to staff on a religious basis when they receive federal funds
if we tell faithbased groups they can not hire on a faith basis in order to receive federal funds then we will force those organizations out of providing these services
some examples of laws that we have passed that allow for faithbased groups to continue to hire on their continued basis are the personal responsibility and work opportunities reconciliation act or welfare reform of 1996 the substance abuse and mental health services administration act of 1998 the community service block grant act which everyone has been very supportive of as well as the community renewal tax relief act of 2000
i think it is important for us as members of the united states house of representatives to be very careful as we move forward on this bill
the committee on education and the workforce has worked very hard to craft it
mr speaker yesterday the committee on rules reported out a restrictive rule providing for the consideration of the school readiness and head start reauthorization act
a total of 24 amendments were submitted to the committee on rules on this bill 16 by democratic members and eight by republicans
as all members should know head start was created to address the preparatory educational deficiencies among economically disadvantaged children as a part of the war on poverty
even more title vii of the 1964 civil rights act clearly stands in opposition to the gentleman from louisiana s mr boustany xz4006360 amendment the same title vii that was voted on and agreed to by the members of this great body 41 years ago
title vii provides every citizen broadbased protection against employment discrimination based on race color religion sex and national origin
mr speaker i am very pleased to yield 4 minutes to the distinguished gentlewoman from california ms matsui xz4006631 my good friend with whom i serve on the committee on rules
mr speaker i am very pleased to yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gentlewoman from california ms woolsey xz4004360 my classmate the ranking member of the subcommittee on education reform the subcommittee of relevant jurisdiction for this legislation
my distinguished friend on the committee on rules never ceases to amaze me but he has done it again
mr speaker i object to the vote on the ground that a quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not present
mr chairman today on the floor we have what is increasingly rare these days a bipartisan bill a bill that would help thousands of head start children and their families
if members do not want to go back to those days vote no on the amendment
i am pleased that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have not pursued their strategy of last year and have worked with members from this side of the aisle to produce a bill that does not include the block grant proposal that was advanced in the last congress
i am glad that hr 2123 has a strong focus on early childhood educator professional development
this is an outright assault on religious liberty and civil rights in federally funded programs
to trample on this now will turn back the clock on the progress we have made in protecting the civil rights of the people we entrust to give our children a head start
allowing discrimination based on religion would significantly impede the important goals of head start as well as sending a damaging message to students
first of all on the general proposition for the month of october we had had discussions last week and it is clear that the second week of october it will not be practical to meet because of the various important dates on that week
could the majority leader bring us up to date on where currently the thinking of the leader s office is on where we will be on the first week of october
i realize the problems of doing that but many of our members particularly those who come from far away are concerned about traveling on that wednesday as the gentleman knows which makes it problematic because we will have to be very late thursday
can the majority leader give us a view on what might be the status of next friday
the gse the gse bill was initially our thought was that would be on the floor this coming week
the gentleman from massachusetts mr frank xz4001400 the ranking democrat on the committee on financial services is on the floor and has been very involved in this bill
can you tell me why the gse bill is not on the floor
democrats and republicans came together worked on it came out with a bill and it is a very good bill
moving on mr leader in addition to the bills you have listed for next week do you anticipate any hurricane katrinarelated legislation will come to floor
and if so will those bills go through the committee of jurisdiction and be considered under rules on the floor that allow full debate
but i think everybody on the floor was concerned about the level of information we had about what had been spent of the 10 billion how much was going to be spent on what of the 52 billion
the overwhelming majority of us on both sides of the aisle have voted for all of the bills that you just referenced on the theory as you said that we need to move ahead on the pell grants and tanf and on the dollars themselves on liability issues
on the supplemental the president has indicated there is going to be a need for another supplemental
do you have any idea on that
two last bills i will ask you about mr leader and i appreciate the time we are taking on this
the president put it on the agenda the social security privatization private accounts act
let me say on behalf of the minority the democrat side of the aisle shares your concern and commitment to assuring retirement security for our people
if we do not reject that amendment the overwhelming majority of us on this side of the aisle are going to vote against this bill
i submit to you mr chairman it is not too much to spend and it is right on time
what they will hear is a debate on an amendment designed to reintroduce discrimination and disadvantage to a program created to overcome the vestiges of poverty racism and academic neglect
this house will debate an amendment today to permit faithbased recipients of federal head start dollars to discriminate against individual based on their individual guaranteed right of free religious affiliation
mr chairman this is a sad and unfortunate event in the history of this august body that after over 200 years as a sovereign country with a checkered past at best on discrimination we now debate discrimination by statute in the case of our young and budding leaders of tomorrow
i rise in objection to this amendment to permit discrimination based on religious affiliation in the head start program
i raise the highest objection that i can to rolling back over 200 years of progress on justice harmony and tolerance
i commend the chairman and the ranking minority on the education and workforce committee for their commitment to the children of this nation by presenting a bill free of polarizing provisions
unlike so many contentious issues brought before the house bipartisanship was not doa dead on arrival instead a bipartisan thought provoking legislative initiative was dua dead under attack mr chairman i urge my colleagues to reject this amendment and let head start get on with the business of preparing america s youth for tomorrow
a good head start program will make sure that lowincome 4yearold children will know their abcs be able to count to 20 have the building blocks they need to hit the ground running on their first day of kindergarten
i am proud of congress increased support for lowincome children through the head start program and i urge my colleagues to vote yes on the rule and yes on the head start reauthorization bill
mr chairman the head start bill before us today is a good bill i plan on voting for it but i also believe that the souder amendment will make it an even better bill by restoring the full authority of the parent policy councils in the head start program
specifically it removes their ability to vote on program policy and instead makes them merely an advisory committee to the board
on august 8 2005 i personally met with 120 head start parents in orlando florida
the amendment by the gentleman from wisconsin mr kind xz4002180 which i rise to support is an amendment that simply says let us take the evidence based on how we should approach education for children and let us apply what we know is the best way to include measurements of a child in their formative years of life
they will not learn unless they have the best emotional and social development from early on because they will not be able to sit still they will not be able to focus they will not be able to do those things that we are going to be testing them for down the line
with that i thank the chairman of the committee on education and the workforce for this time
i would also like to thank the committee leadership on both sides of the aisle for ensuring that all interested parties had a seat at the table during our second try at reauthorizing the head start program
i want to specifically thank ruth friedman for her years of work on behalf of the head start children
all committee members should be proud of the bipartisan work on this legislation
the boustany amendment permits faithbased organizations providing head start service to hire and fire on the basis of religious affiliation
i ask my colleagues to withdraw that amendment and let this bill which we do agree on to go forward to serve the children of our nation who are waiting for opportunities to ensure that no child in america is trapped within poverty s grasp to enable every child in america to live up to his or her highest potential
the program places special focus on developing stronger language literacy social and initiative skills
mr speaker i rise today to express my sincere disappointment in the committee on rules decision to report a restrictive rule for consideration of the bill before us today the reauthorization of head start the future of our children
the amendment that i offered in the committee on rules would have simply required faithbased organizations to create a separate bank account a separate bank account in which to receive federal dollars for the head start program a distinct and separate bank account from the private dollars that a religious organization collects to put forward their religious mission
sandra was behind on a number of other bills and her creditors were calling
i thought just this one time just to get back on my feet she told fortune small business fsb magazine
the embezzlement was discovered when sandra went on vacation
egging also knows the effects of embezzlement on a church firsthand while he was copastor of a covenant church in portland oregon the church s treasurer embezzled more than 45 000
all financial statements were kept at the church and all accounting work was done on the church s office computer rather than on a volunteer s home computer
i would bet that most churches in america have some or a significant number of financial records at somebody s house in a box or on somebody s home computer he says because home computers are generally better than church computers
a church wants to make it easy for a volunteer who s working on church finances embezzlement can happen even when a church has taken steps to prevent financial losses
the church had a number of common financial safeguards in place two signatures were required on every check two people were present whenever collections were counted and the church did an internal audit of its book each year
for the most part beth the church s bookkeeper generated highland s checks on her computer
early on she had asked that all of the church s bank statement be sent to her home
develop a list of such people and periodically rotate those on the list when offerings are counted
also using colored ink rather than black ink on rubber stamp images makes it harder to use a copy machine to forge them
use keys with serial numbers on them to keep track of which employee or volunteer has which key
this is a blatant attack on civil rights and this sanctions discrimination
this would allow organizations to discriminate based on religion as well as fundamentally changing disability laws discrimination paid for by us tax dollars
i want to thank my good friends chairman boehner and congressman castle for their hard work on this important piece of legislation
at a time when our country is grasping with how to deal with ongoing gaps in wealth poverty and education we must recognize that head start is a critical component to helping those children at a disadvantage get on a more equal ground
in my state alone nearly 20 000 students benefit from head start but we know that over half a million children in new jersey are eligible and never get a chance to get on that equal footing
i am relieved we are debating a bill that does not produce devastating effects on this program but instead keeps it intact and provides a number of improvements
first i want to thank the gentleman from ohio chairman boehner also the gentleman from illinois mr davis xz4000931 the gentleman from delaware mr castle xz4000700 the subcommittee chairman and others who have worked on this legislation
while a large majority of head start programs have very responsible management and organization in place i think congress has an obligation to improve known problems before they get worse and also insist on correction
but the cost for the program is 900 000 and we are spending 72 000 per student on this one head start program
what we tried to do in the committee bill is to make sure that there was a clear line of accountability on some of these fiscal matters
we struggled long and hard on this committee with the question of fiscal management and mismanagement of a number of these programs
while the vast majority of head start programs are wellrun programs that provide excellent services the services that we have come to expect from those programs on behalf of these children in head start we have had some problems
we have also strengthened the parent policy council to be involved in all aspects of program authorization and we require that the board act on those priorities
whether they agree or disagree they must act on it
when we have a program here that is failing to meet the demand for head start it would seem to me if this is a highquality program and it has the difference between 13 percent and 135 percent and 15 percent which could be a couple hundred thousand dollars on a 10 million grant which is not that unusual that ought to be plowed into the program to extend the opportunity of this highquality program to these children
unfortunately the cost of the iraq war and massive tax cuts have produced a fiscal crisis which now translates into the underfunding of critical programs like head start and others focused on our lowincome citizens
if a head start program is being administered by a faithbased institution and it is receiving federal funding for the program it must not be permitted to discriminate on religious grounds when making employment decisions
unfortunately the cost of the iraq war and massive tax cuts have produced a fiscal crisis which now translates into the underfunding of critical programs like head start and others focused on our lowincome citizens
if a head start program is being administered by a faithbased institution and it is receiving federal funding for the program it must not be permitted to discriminate on religious grounds when making employment decisions
first of all i want to commend the chairman on the good work that he did
we have heard terrible allegations from the other side of the aisle and from the administration alleging during the recent confirmation hearings for judge roberts that certain members of the other body have hung a sign on the federal courts saying no catholics need apply while i continue to believe that this slur against conscientious catholic members of the other body is blatantly false and slanderous those making the charge including the president and our colleagues on the other side of the aisle seem to understand that religious discrimination in employment or the imposition of a religious test for federally funded employment in violation of the constitution is reprehensible and an affront to our first freedom
it is time to make good on the promise of this nation that we are all created equal that all children are entitled to a decent education and that no one should ever have to decide between a job helping our children and their religious faith
we seem to go through these on a regular basis and i certainly admire the tenacity with which the gentleman from virginia mr scott xz4003641 and others defend their position
when faithbased groups hire employees on a religious basis they are exercising their civil liberties
the civil rights act made clear when faithbased groups hire employees on a religious basis it is an exercise of the groups civil liberties
it does not mean that the people that they hire are discriminated against on the basis of what religion they have what their ethnicity might be but rather simply the ability to hire people who share their common beliefs who share their sense of mission
we certainly saw this in the recent rescue mission and aid issues down with hurricane katrina where a great number of faithbased groups were the most efficient groups that we saw on the ground there
we keep having this circular debate on so many issues
we have mentioned over and over title vii civil rights act 1964 states specifically and this is the verbiage this subchapter shall not apply to an employer with respect to the employment of aliens outside any state or to a religious corporation association educational institution or society with respect to the employment of individuals of a particular religion to perform work connected with the carrying on by such corporation association educational institution or society of its activities there is no way we can change this
mr speaker i oppose the rule on the basis of an exclusion of some very pertinent amendments but i have to respond to what i just heard
how dare anyone say on this floor that we are allowed to separate with federal money with federal money the horror of tens of thousands of desperately poor americans trapped in an environment of extreme neglect abandoned by its government left behind to fend for themselves without the most basic resources to survive
america believes in bringing the buses in on time so everyone gets out not just the wealthiest among us
in paterson alone over 2 000 eligible children are on the waiting list
i hope that the house today will vote for this good bipartisan bill and will vote down any poison pill amendment that will allow hiring and firing on the basis of religious affiliation
a major study of the early head start program by mathematica policy research and columbia university found that 3yearold head start children performed significantly better on a range of measures of cognitive language and social and emotional development than a control group
in addition the parents of these children scored significantly higher than control group parents on many aspects of parenting and the home environment
i thank the chairman for agreeing to this colloquy in order to shine a light on an unfortunate recurring situation in some head start agencies
on february 10 of this year i introduced hr 778 the head start accountability act of 2005 to address the misuse and abuse of federal funds occurring in an agency in my district as well as others
i could go on and on listing examples of financial mismanagement at this agency
as chairman of the laborhhseducation subcommittee of the committee on appropriations funding head start in the amount of 6 billion this bill will achieve a better use of those moneys
mr chairman after years of hard work on both sides of the aisle to create a head start reauthorization bill that treats our nation s neediest children fairly it is with a heavy heart that i must oppose the final passage of hr 2123
the boustany amendment which promotes discrimination on the basis of religion for faithbased organizations destroys the principle of fairness that i believe is central and crucial to the success of head start
i have long been a supporter of the head start program because each and every year i witness the dramatic positive impact that early intervention services have on children s lives in my congressional district
my district includes many children who are in desperate need of head start services especially those hispanic children who depend on head start services to learn critical early literacy skills
as a member of the appropriations subcommittee on labor health and human services and education i have continuously supported strong and sustained funding for the head start program
in fact many religious organizations specifically oppose discrimination in hiring based on religion including american jewish congress church women united interfaith alliancefoundation union for reform judaism unitarian universalist association of congregations and united church of christ justice amp witness ministries
mr chairman today we are debating whether or not we should repeal civil rights provisions in head start reauthorization and allow religious organizations that use federal funding to discriminate in hiring and firing based on an individual s religious beliefs
never before has congress ever repealed existing civil rights protections by adopting an amendment on the house floor without the benefit of committee hearings debate or expert testimony
mr boustany xz4006360 knows that democrats will note vote for an amendment that allows federally funded organizations to discriminate against any americans on any grounds
it is truly a shame that members of this house are playing politics with a bill that affects millions of our young children and which millions of americans have come to trust and rely on
it is unconscionable that members of congress would try to reverse the progress that we have made on civil rights in this country
i urge a no vote on the boustany amendment
as i received an education and health services my mother learned valuable lessons on how to become a more active and involved parent in america s public school system
on the other hand i urge the house to oppose the amendment that would allow faithbased head start programs to use federal tax dollars to discriminate against teachers and employees solely on the basis of their religion
they sponsor the programs just like everybody else on a level playing field
if we are talking about religion we are also talking about race because if you can discriminate based on religion some religions are virtually all white others virtually all black
so if you can discriminate based on religion you can discriminate based on race
the victim needs to be protected and the weight of the federal government will fall down on the side of the victim
mr chairman i submit for printing in the record letters from numerous organizations including the national head start association which oppose the discrimination amendment and ask us to vote no on the underlying bill if they sabotage civil rights protections
boustany rla to the head start bill on the house floor today that would give faithbased organizations providing head start services the right to discriminate with federal funds against employees who are of different faiths
i know firsthand that head start is a model for demonstrating that a strong prohibition on religious employment discrimination with federal funds is fully compatible with federal assistance to faithbased charities
i am greatly concerned that the provision to remove civil rights protections for employees could have a negative impact on the children and families who participate in these programs
dear chairman boehner and ranking member miller on behalf of the more than 25 million children and families program staff and volunteers that comprise the head start and early head start community we are writing to you today to address certain issues regarding the reauthorization of the head start act
we also acknowledge that the teacher requirements are based on national goals and that training and technical assistance is funded at two percent with 50 percent of that amount going directly to programs
additionally we know that the head start bureau is spending more than 21 million annually on the nrs an expenditure that does not even begin to take into consideration the costs of preparing for and administering the test at the program level
the head start community has no objection to unannounced site visits when they concern health and safety issues or are following up on prior compliance matters
the head start community believes that state head start associations should have signoff on candidates for state collaboration officers as well as continuing involvement in the planning and implementation of state plans
dear member of congress as pastors and leaders of predominately african american congregations across the country we urge you to stand up for the civil rights and religious freedom of all americans and to maintain the bipartisan direction of the school readiness act hr 2123 by opposing any attempt to repeal longstanding critical civil rights protections on the house floor
this bill maintains provisions designed to protect over 198 000 head start teachers and staff and over 1 450 000 parent volunteers from employment discrimination based on religion in federallyfunded head start programs
we have continually supported these provisions because this is consistent with our commitment to protecting the as religious figures we provide leadership grounded by theological interpretations of scripture and focus on issues of concern to our parishioners and our community
in particular we are seriously concerned about a statement released by the committee on education and the workforce on may 5 2005 in which chairman boehner stated that he foresees an amendment on the house floor to rollback longstanding critical civil rights protections
we urge you to maintain the bipartisan direction of the school readiness act hr 2123 and to not support any agreement that allows for an assault on civil rights protections in federallyfunded programs especially a program as critical as head start
this could destroy the mutually supported nature of the head start program in which the education of young children especially minority children is so dependent upon parental participation and on ongoing close relationships with head start teachers
dear representative on behalf of the antidefamation league we write to urge you to maintain the civil rights protections currently included in the house education and the workforceapproved version of the school readiness act hr 2123 and to oppose any efforts to repeal these important provisions
allowing religiousbased employment discrimination in federallyfunded programs is wrong and to do it on the historic head start antipoverty education program is deeply offensive
since 1972 agencies that receive government funding for head start including religious organizations and houses of worship that host head start programs have been prohibited from discriminating on the basis of religion when hiring or firing staff within the federallyfunded program
to do so on head start an historic antipoverty program universally acclaimed and present in so many communities across the country is odious
dear representative on behalf of the 14 million members of the american federation of state county and municipal employees afscme i am writing with respect to certain provisions of hr 2123 which would reauthorize the head start program
we support hr 2123 s focus on raising standards for head start teachers including the provision calling for 50 percent of all current head start teachers to have a bachelor s degree within five years and all new head start teachers to have an associate s degree
we are also deeply concerned that chairman boehner intends to offer a controversial amendment on the floor to repeal longstanding civil rights protections from the head start program
if the amendment is adopted afscme urges you to oppose the bill on final passage
sincerely charles m loveless on civil rights washington dc september 16 2005
dear representative on behalf of the leadership conference on civil rights lccr the nation s oldest largest and most diverse civil and human rights coalition with more than 190 member organizations we urge you to oppose the boehner amendment or any amendment to the school readiness act hr 2123 that would repeal longstanding civil rights protections in the head start program that have been in place since president nixon signed the law in 1972
if language repealing civil rights protections is added to the bill during consideration on the house floor we urge you to oppose final passage of hr 2123
we believe based on analysis of amos that if federal funds are used by religious organizations to hire only persons of their own faith then the federal government is affirmatively acting to advance employment discrimination
any attempt to allow organizations to discriminate on the basis of religion with federal funds would drastically impede that progress and erode a longstanding principle of our nation s civil rights policy that federal civil rights obligations follow federal dollars regardless of who receives them
the leading case on the question of governmentaided discrimination is norwood v harrison 413 us 455 1973
dear member on behalf of the national association for the advancement of colored people naacp our nation s oldest largest and most widely recognized grassroots civil rights organization i am writing today to urge you to do all you can to ensure that the longstanding critical civil rights protections that are contained in the current version of hr 2123 the school readiness act are retained during consideration by the full house of representatives
specifically i urge you to reject and work against the anticipated boehner amendment which will repeal existing longstanding head start provisions that prohibit religious organizations and churches from discriminating on the basis of religion when hiring or firing staff from positions within this federallyfunded program
hr 2132 as approved by the committee on education and labor maintains provisions designed to protect the more than 198 000 head start teachers staff and over 1 450 000 parent volunteers from employment discrimination based on religion in federallyfunded head start programs
the naacp strongly believes that allowing discrimination based on religion thus i urge you again in the strongest terms possible to support the continued inclusion of these longstanding and critical civil rights protections
dear representative on behalf of the american jewish committee the nation s oldest human relations organization with 33 chapters nationwide representing over 150 000 members and supporters i urge you to oppose any amendments to the school readiness act hr 2123 that roll back crucial civil rights safeguards
at the same time the existing provisions do not intrude on the autonomy of religious organizations with respect to hiring decisions made in purely private programs
however the bill risks losing critical segments of this support if at any point this initiative is amended to roll back head start s longstanding civil rights protections by exempting religious organizations from the prohibition on religious discrimination in employment decisions
thank you for considering our views on this important matter
dear representative americans united for separation of church and state urges you to oppose any amendment to repeal longstanding critical civil rights protections contained in the school readiness act hr 2123 and to vote no on final passage of the bill if such an amendment is adopted
hr 2123 unanimously passed out of the committee on education and the workforce on may 18 2005 maintaining a longstanding civil rights provision designed to protect over 198 000 head start teachers and staff and over 1 450 000 parent volunteers from employment discrimination based on religion in federallyfunded head start programs
we are pleased with this bipartisan legislation thus far but are deeply concerned about stated threats to repeal longstanding civil rights protections against religious discrimination in our nation s head start programs on the house floor
specifically chairman boehner after championing the committeepassed bill stated that an amendment may be offered on the house floor that would repeal these protections
the parents and communities that rely on head start programs should not have to choose between the renewal of the head start program and longstanding civil rights protections that are a cornerstone of this invaluable program
if you have any questions about hr 2123 or would like further information on any other issue of importance to americans united please contact aaron d schuham legislative director
a recent hearing in the subcommittee on criminal justice drug policy and human resources examining the faithbased initiative demonstrated once again that employment discrimination with federal dollars is one of the initiative s most controversial and divisive elements
dear representative the american civil liberties union strongly urges you to oppose any amendment to repeal longstanding critical civil rights protections contained in the school readiness act hr 2123 and vote no on final passage if such an amendment is adopted when the bill comes to the floor later this week
as unanimously passed out of the committee on education and the workforce hr 2123 maintains longstanding provisions designed to protect over 198 000 head start teachers and staff and over 1 450 000 parent volunteers from employment discrimination based on religion in federallyfunded positions in head start programs
however we are troubled by the threat of repealing these protections on the house floor
in a statement released by the committee on education and the workforce on may 5 2005 the day hr 2123 was introduced chairman boehner stated that he foresaw an amendment on the house floor to roll back longstanding critical civil rights protections
current law prohibits participants in head start programs from discriminating based on race creed religion color national origin sex political affiliation or beliefs or disability
more than 60 years ago the first success of the modern civil rights movement was a decision by president franklin roosevelt to bar federal contractors from discriminating based on race religion or national origin
if amended hr 2123 would allow a religious organization such as bob jones university that discriminates based on religion to participate in federal head start
the federal government clearly has a compelling interest in applying the head start act s civil rights provision to everyone receiving federal funds including religious organizations seeking to discriminate on the basis of religion in hiring persons to work in head start
repealing critical civil rights protections prohibiting discrimination in employment would be inconsistent with the leading supreme court case on the use of federal funds by religious organizations that discriminate
the court decided that the federal government s compelling interest in eradicating racial discrimination in education superceded any burden on the university s religious exercise of enforcing a religiouslymotivated ban on students interracial dating
there is no meaningful difference between the government prohibiting tax benefits to organizations that discriminate based on race and the head start act s statutory prohibition on discrimination based on religion in head start classrooms
in its october 26 2001 brief defending the religion prong of title vii from an eleventh amendment attack the united states stated that c ontrary to defendant s contention that the supreme court has distinguished claims involving differential treatment on the basis of race and speech from those involving religion there can be no doubt that the equal protection clause subjects state governments engaging in intentional discrimination on the basis of religion to strict scrutiny brief of intervenor united states in endres v indiana state police nd
26 2001 brief is available on wwwusdojgov
if critical civil rights protections are repealed hr 2123 would be unconstitutional hr 2123 if amended would abet unconstitutional employment discrimination based on religion
the proposed amendment s exemption of religious organizations from the prohibition on religious discrimination in the program is contrary to constitutional law and will open the door to governmentfunded discrimination
moreover although the supreme court upheld the constitutionality of the religious organization exemption in title vii corporation of presiding bishop v amos 483 us 327 33639 1987 the court has never considered whether it is unconstitutional for a religious organization to discriminate based on religion when making employment several courts have considered whether a religious organization can retain its title vii exemption after receipt of indirect federal funds eg siegel v truettmcconnell college inc 13 f supp2d 1335 1344 nd
although mere receipt of government funds is insufficient to trigger constitutional obligations on private persons a close nexus between the government and the private person s activity can result in the courts treating the private person as a state actor
the equal protection clause subjects governments engaging in intentional discrimination on the basis of religion to strict scrutiny
the supreme court recently explained when there is a sufficient nexus between the government and the private person to find that the private person is a state actor for purposes of compliance with constitutional requirements on certain decisions made by participants in the government program s tate action may be found if though only if there is such a close nexus between the state and the challenged action that seemingly private behavior may be fairly treated as that of the state itself
the extraordinary role that the current administration and the amendment sponsors have taken in accommodating fostering and encouraging religious organizations to discriminate based on religion when hiring for federallyfunded programs creates the nexus for constitutional duties to be imposed on the provider in addition to the requirements already placed on government itself
the clear intent of this amendment to repeal the civil rights provision in the head start act is to encourage certain providers receiving federal funds to discriminate based on religion
for example in december of 2002 president bush signed executive order 13279 which amended an earlier executive order which had provided more than 60 years of protection against discrimination based on religion by federal contractors
for these reasons the aclu strongly urges you to vote no on any proposed amendment to the head start reauthorization school readiness act hr 2123 that would create an unconstitutional loophole allowing federallyfunded religious discrimination and to vote no on final passage if an amendment is adopted
dear committee member on behalf of the 18 000 cities represented by the national league of cities nlc i want to commend members of the education and workforce committee on the passage of bipartisan head start legislation hr 2123 the school readiness act of 2005 head start is critical to helping to alleviate the plight of children of the working poor
nlc asks members of the house of representatives to maintain the committee s bipartisan direction and oppose any attempts to repeal longstanding antidiscrimination protections during deliberation on the house floor
dear representative on behalf of the national education association s nea 27 million members we would like to offer our views on the school readiness act of 2005 hr 2123 scheduled for floor debate this week
nea believes that children s learning begins well before they enter school and that the transition to school must be founded on strong school readiness
we are very pleased that hr 2123 maintains provisions designed to protect over 198 000 head start teachers and staff and over 1 450 000 parent volunteers from employment discrimination based on religion in federallyfunded head start programs
however we are deeply concerned that a repeal of civil rights protections could allow religious organizations participating in head start to fire teachers or parent volunteers based on their religion
we strongly believe that allowing discrimination based on religion would significantly impede the important goals of head start as well as send a damaging message to students
we are very pleased that hr 2123 has a strong focus on early childhood educator professional development
hr 2123 allows a study of and recommendations on appropriate assessments for young children
we thank you for your consideration of our views on these important issues
congressman john boehner oh has indicated his intent to roll back vital civil rights protections by introducing on the house floor an amendment to hr 2123 the school readiness act
on behalf of the oldest and largest humanist organization in the nation i ask you to oppose any such attempt to legalize discrimination with federal funds as you vote on the bipartisan head start reauthorization bill
if this 33 year old nondiscrimination policy were discarded the head start reauthorization would permit religious organizations to use federal funds to discriminate on the basis of religion even when engaging in purely secular early childhood education activities
as humanists we persistently oppose federal funding for discrimination especially discrimination done on the basis of religion or lack thereof
if religious or secular organizations wish to utilize taxpayer dollars to operate on our government s behalf they must also abide by the standards set for public service
should you have any questions about our position please do not hesitate to contact roy speckhardt on our staff
dear representative we the undersigned religious civil rights labor education health and advocacy organizations are writing to urge you to oppose any amendment to repeal longstanding critical civil rights protections contained in the school readiness act hr 2123 and vote no on final passage if such an amendment is adopted
as unanimously passed out of the committee on education and the workforce hr 2123 maintains longstanding provisions designed to protect over 198 000 head start teachers and staff and over 1 450 000 parent volunteers from employment discrimination based on religion in federallyfunded positions in head start programs
however we are troubled by the threat of repealing these protections on the house floor
in a statement released by the committee on education and the workforce on may 5 2005 the day hr 2123 was introduced chairman boehner stated that he foresaw an amendment on the house floor to roll back longstanding critical civil rights protections
however if the repeal of the existing civil rights protections becomes law teachers or parent volunteers working in any head start program run by a religious organization could potentially lose their jobs based only on their religion
we strongly believe that allowing discrimination based on religion would significantly impede the important goals of head start send a damaging message to head start students and harm their we urge you to maintain current law and reject any assault on civil rights protections in federallyfunded programs especially a program as critical as head start
if these longstanding critical civil rights protections are repealed we urge you to vote no on final passage of hr 2123
the dismantling of civil rights will destroy the nature of a program in which the education of young children is so dependent on parent participation and on ongoing close relationships with head start teachers

dear representative i write to you today as the president of the interfaith alliance a nonpartisan national grassroots organization dedicated to promoting the positive and healing role of religion in public life to oppose any amendment to repeal longstanding critical civil rights protections contained in the school readiness act hr 2123 and vote no on final passage if such an amendment is adopted
as unanimously passed out of the committee on education and the workforce hr 2123 maintains longstanding provisions designed to protect over 198 000 head start teachers and staff and over 1 450 000 parent volunteers from employment discrimination based on religion in federally funded head start programs as an organization whose membership is comprised of 150 000 people of faith and good will spanning 75 faith traditions i can think of no reason to justify an attempt to roll back these longstanding civil rights and religious liberty protections
while the interfaith alliance is supportive of the right of sectarian organizations to hire based on religious preference for purposes of furthering their institutional ministry we believe that houses of worship forfeit that right once they accept federal taxpayer dollars to implement social service programs that are intended to serve all
further any attempt to politicize the head start program a federally sponsored preschool program conceived to meet the needs of disadvantaged children since 1965 through a floor amendment to add the highly controversial religious exemption language is not only unnecessary but a sad commentary on the state of those political leaders who seek to attach religious exemption language to every social service program that comes before the congress

dear member of congress i am writing on behalf of the over 1 050 congregations that make up the unitarian universalist association in regard to hr 2123 the school readiness act of 2005 the legislation to reauthorize the head start program
we remain pleased with the general direction of the house bill as it comes out of the committee on education and the workforce
we ask that you vote against any amendment on the floor that would repeal civil rights protections
if such an amendment is included in the final bill we ask that you vote no on final passage of hr 2123
we urge you to oppose the repeal of longstanding civil rights protections designed to protect head start teachers staff and parent volunteers from employment discrimination based on religion in federally funded head start programs
allowing discrimination based on religion would significantly impede the important goals of head start send a damaging message to head start students and harm their education by separating students from their own teachers and parent volunteers
on behalf of the unitarian universalist association of congregations i thank you for your consideration of our views on head start reauthorization
we urge the house to pass a bipartisan bill that will continue the success of head start without eliminating important civil rights provisions by voting no on any proposed amendment eliminating such provisions and voting no on final passage of a bill including such provisions
dear representative on behalf of 18 million members of the service employees international union seiu working in health care building services and federal state and local governments including more than 220 000 early education workers throughout the united states i write to encourage you to take a closer look at several key provisions in the head start reauthorization bill that could impact the quality of head start for children
head start provides an array of comprehensive services to lowincome parents and children that they may not otherwise have access to on their own
head start teachers on average make 23 564 annually
if such an amendment is included in the final bill we urge you vote no on final passage of hr 2123
dear representative as hr 2123 the school readiness act of 2005 moves towards a full vote in the house of representatives on thursday september 22 the children s defense fund is pleased to support many of the provisions on which the education and workforce committee has worked so thoughtfully and diligently
the following are concerns raised by the amendment teachers and staff could be hired based on their religion rather than their qualifications
dear representative on behalf of the more than 600 000 members of the human rights campaign we write to express our grave concerns with certain provisions of the school readiness act hr 2123 that we understand may be added as the legislation moves to the floor for a vote
we are particularly concerned with statements made by chairman john boehner roh which indicate that his clear intention is to offer an amendment on the floor adding language to reverse the nondiscrimination provisions currently in effect in the head start program
if an amendment is added on the floor which would roll back these civil rights protections we urge you to oppose final passage of the school readiness act hr 2123
as the nation s largest gay lesbian bisexual and transgender civil rights organization we oppose using federal funds to discriminate on any basis including religion which unfortunately has been used as a proxy for discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity
while we do not hold a position on the overall legislation we have serious concerns with a provision that we understand will be offered on the floor that would roll back civil rights protections that have been in place and working effectively since 1972
by abandoning these nondiscrimination protections head start providers would be able to discriminate on the basis of religion in federally funded positions even when engaging in purely secular early childhood education activities
just as it is important these vital programs continue to provide services it also remains important that federal funds are not used to discriminate on the basis of religion or sexual orientation or gender identity
a vote on an amendment permitting federally funded discrimination will be considered a key vote for the human rights campaign
should you have any questions please do not hesitate to contact angela clements on our staff at 202 2161520
dear representative on behalf of the 90 000 members and supporters of the national council of jewish women ncjw i am writing to ask you to oppose the boehner amendment to hr 2123 the school readiness act of 2005 and to oppose final passage of the bill if this amendment is adopted
ncjw believes that taxpayer funds should never be used to subsidize discrimination on any basis
house consideration of hr 2123 should focus on meeting the needs of disadvantaged children improving policy and providing sufficient funds to extend head start to all eligible children
for over a century ncjw has been at the forefront of social change raising its voice on important issues of public policy
dear member of congress on behalf of the national council of la raza nclr the largest national latino civil rights and advocacy organization in the us i write on an issue of great importance to the hispanic community
on thursday the house of representatives is scheduled to vote on legislation to reauthorize the head start program the school readiness act of 2005 hr 2123
this legislation is the result of bipartisan work of the committee on education and the workforce to address muchneeded improvements to the program for latino children
however nclr is concerned that this bipartisan work will be jeopardized by an amendment that would allow for employment discrimination based on religion in the program
for these reasons nclr has pursued a reauthorization agenda focused on ensuring that head start continues to show progress in its effort to eliminate disparities in access and enhance the quality of services for latino and limitedenglishproficient lep children and their families
a new requirement that the secretary conduct a study on the status of lep children and their families in head start and early head start programs
in addition while nclr is pleased with the aforementioned provisions in hr 2123 we stand in solidarity with the broader civil rights community in our strong opposition to any amendment that could open the door to employment discrimination based on religion in the head start program
dear representative on behalf of the more than 750 000 members and supporters of people for the american way we urge you to maintain the bipartisan direction of hr 2123 the school readiness act of 2003 and oppose any attempt to repeal longstanding antidiscrimination protections
we commend you on your bipartisan efforts on head start reauthorization legislation
however in a statement released by the committee on education and the workforce on may 5 2005 chairman boehner stated that he anticipates and supports an amendment on the house floor to rollback longstanding critical civil rights protections
this type of amendment would be a direct attack on bipartisan antidiscrimination provisions that have been part of head start since its creation in 1981 and can not be tolerated
people for the american way can not support a compromise that does not ensure that the existing civil rights protections in hr 2123 are not summarily removed on the house floor
dear representatives on behalf of the union for reform judaism whose 900 congregations across north america encompass 15 million reform jews and the central conference of american rabbis ccar whose membership includes over 1800 reform rabbis i strongly urge you to maintain the bipartisan character of the school readiness act of 2005 hr 2123 by opposing any attempt to repeal longstanding civil rights protections that prohibit faithbased head start centers from discriminating in whom they hire on the basis of religion
one s faith does not determine how one reads a book to preschoolers or sings the alphabet song to deny children living in poverty the most qualified teacher is nothing short of an attack on head start s core mission preparing children to succeed in school
since its founding head start has prided itself on the strength of its family involvement component
on the day this bill becomes law faithbased head start programs could fire such staff members because of their religious beliefs
experience teaches us that a broad exemption for religious organizations would permit religious groups to use government money to discriminate based on race sexual orientation and marital status
however on the day that hr 2123 was introduced representative john boehner roh stated his intention to offer an amendment to rollback the current civil rights protections within the head start program when the bill is considered by the full house
the bill approved 480 by the house committee on education and the workforce that reaches the house floor is the product of many months of hard work resulting in a strong bipartisan agreement
we stand united to oppose this unwarranted attack on a vital civil rights provision that protects over 16 million teachers and parent volunteers from having to choose between their religion and their participation in the local head start program
the bipartisan bill that passed unanimously out of the committee on education and the workforce has the potential to garner support from a broad range of groups including all of the religious groups on this letter but not if the proposed language is included
boehner s planned floor amendment to change this crucial program by stripping its civil rights protections and allowing providers to discriminate on religious grounds
dear representative omb watch strongly urges you to oppose the any attempt to include charitable choice provisions in the head start program which would allow religious organizations to discriminate on the basis of the religion when hiring for federally funded programs
the court stated that although the constitution does not bar religious organizations from participating in federal programs it requires 1 that no one participating in a federal program can discriminate on the basis of religion and 2 that all federal programs must be carried out in a lawful secular manner id
it goes to the heart and soul of the head start program and that is whether parents have voting rights or whether they are just going to get a pat on the head and told we like their opinions
but two points first off i thank the chairman and the committee on rules for allowing an amendment in order that they do not support and i appreciate that and i want to thank them for that
when you go into head start programs they get to vote on what they are going to serve for lunch they get to vote on the textbooks they get to hire and fire the teachers
but we made it clear that the board has the legal liability on fraud and they have the decisionmaking power on fraud
the only reference in the hearings i believe was actually on the senate side from the deputy mayor of memphis who complained that he did not have decisionmaking powers to make some changes that he wanted to make but it was not financial abuse or financial waste
we are gutting for a pat on the head saying we like your opinion but not your vote
mr chairman i yield 1 minute to the gentleman from florida mr keller xz4002120 a member of the committee on education and the workforce and a leader on education issues
please pass on our plea meaning the parents employees and even more important our children that you work for keeping the current programs well established within cani s headstart program
on behalf of parents of cani headstart
i have been a community representative on the cani head start policy council in fort wayne for two years
one of the most rewarding benefits of my participation on the policy council has been to watch the growth and development of the male involvement committee
it is because of these beginnings that i continue to advocate for children on all levels
many of these children continue on to kindergarten because they have a head start in education and their parents realize how important early intervention is
some of the issues that indiana pta will be focusing on are early intervention literacy parent involvement advocacy and drug use
i would have preferred that bill provide more funding to ensure all eligible children can receive head start services but on balance the bipartisan bill was worth voting for
most recently the majority has sought to impart their religious views on historically secular programs such as the workforce investment act and the community services block grant
it is time we had a head start reauthorization bill that focuses on improving the educational development of our children and is not being used as a vehicle to teach our children one of the world s ugliest lessons discrimination
on november 3 2001 i never thought anything good could come out from having him in my class
they are also able to give children specific strategies to handle these feelings their feelings on their own so that they in turn will feel more in control
what we have to remember is this is about the children children whose families are trapped in poverty trying to get a head start on education which is the surest way out of poverty
in fact they have even got a very progressive system for head start children based on educare an outstanding private preschool program that involves a holistic approach of the entire family
a national review of 36 studies on the longterm impact of early childhood education programs found that lowincome children who participated in such programs were less likely to be held back less likely to be placed in special education classes more likely to succeed in school more likely to graduate and more likely to be rated as behaving well in class and better adjusted in school
i congratulate the chairman for working with us on the higher education act to make sure there is a loan forgiveness program 5 000 for 5 years commitment to teach early childhood education that will help with this particular issue
i am afraid some of the recommendations that are being put forward in the amendments here today are spectacular efforts to drive a wedge between the parties on this to make it a lessthanunanimous bill
this program not only plays an important role in providing opportunities for the next generation but also has an important impact on our economy
for every dollar spent on head start we receive seven dollars back
unfortunately i have concerns about an amendment passed by this body that allows faithbased head start grantees to discriminate in hiring based on religion
federally supported programs should never support discrimination in its programs on any level
i was pleased to join with many of my colleagues on the other side in offering amendments that were supported on a bipartisan basis that i think strengthen the head start program
i am very sorry that that bipartisan consensus may be shattered and it will be shattered if we later adopt the boustany amendment because make no mistake about it the boustany amendment is in fact an attack on religious liberty in this country
in all of the hearings that we have held in our committee on this issue no faithbased organization has ever come up and said gee we could do a better job of teaching children if only we were allowed to discriminate in hiring teachers
mr chairman in solidarity with the national head start association the children s defense fund and countless other lifelong advocates of the head start program it is with a heavy heart that i must oppose this final amended version of the head start reauthorization on the floor today
i sit on the education and workforce committee which reported a genuinely bipartisan head start bill to this house
for example an amendment i offered to fully fund the program so that every eligible child could reap its benefits was defeated on a party line vote
it even included an amendment i offered on a bipartisan basis with representatives platts and biggert to provide grantees new flexibility to serve additional needy children when program slots became available
it takes money from taxpayers and then turns around and tells those same taxpayers they can be excluded from federally funded jobs in a head start center solely on the basis of their religious beliefs
there are people who are suffering and people who are depending on us
i started as assistant teacher and i went on to be the supervisor of parent involvement and volunteer services
the gentleman knows he is killing head start by putting this amendment on the floor to put religious involvement in the program
on sunday morning in america religion is the most segregated sector of our society
the committee on education and the workforce voted for this head start bill unanimously 48 to 0 but many of our republican colleagues today would destroy this bill making it partisan by allowing religious discrimination in hiring while using federal funds using taxpayer dollars
it is also not acceptable that while denying democrats a debate on expanding access for children we will debate an amendment from the gentlewoman from colorado mrs musgrave xz4002870 to allow some providers to divert public funds to private profit
well actually religious organizations have never asked any of us to waive their discriminatory rights and privileges that they are asking for over on the other side of the aisle
mr chairman i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from michigan mr kildee xz4002160 a member of the committee on education and the workforce
mr chairman i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from ohio mr kucinich xz4002270 a member of the subcommittee on education reform
shame on the gentleman for thinking that it is any other way
mr chairman i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from new jersey mr holt xz4001840 a member of the committee on education and the workforce
i want to thank the subcommittee chairman the gentleman from delaware mr castle xz4000700 for his hard work on this bill
this amendment will bring a critically needed scientific perspective to bear on the administration and keep them from implementing this program until they do it right
so i support my colleague s interests and understanding on making this happen
i only hope that the majority will be as willing to spend federal dollars on serving the children as they would be in giving those dollars to forprofit companies
mr chairman i am offering this amendment on behalf of the gentleman from mississippi mr thompson xz4004032 who is unable to be here this afternoon
we are talking about whether if a religious organization chooses to accept federal funds for head start it should be allowed to discriminate using those funds which by the way is exactly what president bush called on congress to do earlier this year
paragraph number 1 i have become aware that an amendment has been offered by representative boustany a republican from louisiana to the head start bill on the house floor today that would give faithbased organizations providing head start services the right to discriminate with federal funds against employees who are of different faiths
as the state president of the louisiana head start association i strongly oppose such an amendment then she goes on to say i am greatly concerned that the provision to remove civil rights protections for employees could have a negative impact on the children and families who participate in these programs
it will strip civil rights protections by allowing religious organizations to discriminate in hiring on the basis of religion for head start positions and i repeat using federal taxpayers money
mr chairman i ask the members of this body think before you vote yes on this
think before you set a precedent that has federal funding paying for discrimination based on religion
the director of a head start program in gardenville maryland was indicted on charges that she stole more than 350 000 from the organization over a 4year period
imagine if this money were spent on students rather than stolen from head start
in my religious tradition we give great recognition to the apostle paul who said there is neither greek nor jew circumcision nor uncircumcision barbarian scythian bond nor free and it goes on to say put on therefore as the elect of god holy and beloved tender mercies kindness humbleness of mind meekness long suffering that is not in this amendment
james united methodist church which i pastor they know that they are going to be considered for employment based on their qualifications and there is no subterfuge for bigotry
mr speaker as we consider the rule i want to speak on some important amendments that are going to come up to provide important protections for religious organizations
a secular group such as planned parenthood or the sierra club that receives government money is currently free to hire based on its ideology and mission but still use federal funds for certain programs and activities they provide
it is the ultimate of arrogance on the part of the federal government
and to those who are concerned about the constitutional issues may i remind my colleagues the supreme court actually ruled on this matter
mr chairman i want to focus on the extra provisions dealing with the migrant and seasonal head start programs
this is a case where a small increase in funding can make a big difference to a lot of children changing the path they are on
i know that for the migrant farm worker population facing a unique set of challenges working on a seasonal basis migrant families often have to move from state to state during the year making it extremely difficult for the children to get in and remain in highquality educational programs
imagine those returns on the stock market
head start is about ensuring children are on the right path as they begin their education careers
lara tells those attorneys who are intent on filing a lawsuit to take the responsibility to review the case and make sure it is legitimate before filing or be ready for sanctions
i would like to thank the gentleman from texas the chairman of the subcommittee on courts the internet and intellectual property for having prepared this legislation and moved it forward as he has
this bill will help make american small businesses more competitive by lowering their unnecessary legal expenses allowing business owners to focus on hiring new employees and expanding available products
it will allow business owners to focus on hiring new employees which is really critical in this economy that we are faced with and expanding the availability of products and services and improving the american economy
madam speaker by direction of the committee on rules i call up h res 508 and ask for its immediate consideration
it provides for 1 hour of general debate equally divided and controlled by the chairman and the ranking minority member of the committee on the judiciary
it waives all points of order against consideration of the bill and it provides that the amendment in the nature of a substitute recommended by the committee on the judiciary now printed in the bill shall be considered as an original bill for the purpose of amendment and shall be considered as read
first i want to commend the gentleman from wisconsin mr sensenbrenner xz4003650 the distinguished chairman of the committee on the judiciary not just for the underlying bill but for a number of recent bills aimed at strengthening our legal system by protecting people s rights under the law and shielding them from frivolous proceedings
additionally i want to thank the gentleman from texas mr smith xz4003802 the chairman of the subcommittee on the courts the internet and intellectual property for sponsoring hr 420
on october 24 we passed and sent to the president s desk s 397 the lawful commerce in arms act of 2005 by a vote of 283 to 144 in the house
i might add that in the spirit of bipartisanship 59 democrats and one independent joined 223 republicans in passing this landmark legislation that refocuses liability for gun violence on the actual criminal the person who pulled the trigger
this bill would require that courts impose an appropriate penalty on attorneys law firms or parties who continue to file frivolous lawsuits
this act would also institute a threestrikesandyoureout sanction that would suspend an attorney from practicing in federal court if a federal judge determines the lawyer has violated rule 11 on three or more occasions
therefore i would like to urge all of my colleagues on both sides of the center aisle to support this rule and the underlying bill
madam speaker i yield back the balance of my time and i move the previous question on the resolution
a motion to reconsider was laid on the table
in fact my concern about it is it is unnecessary and it will infringe on states being able to manage their own court systems
by doing this again we take away states discretion to impose sanctions on improper and frivolous pleadings
this bill is another example of congress intruding on states rights
mr speaker while the committee on rules reported out a rule that made in order a substantive amendment offered by the gentleman from california mr schiff i rise in opposition to it h res 508 because the legislation underlying is pernicious
as i mentioned during the committee on the judiciary s oversight hearing on this legislation during its first iteration in the 108th congress and reiterated in my statement for the markup one of the main functions of that body s oversight is to analyze potentially negative impact against the benefits that a legal process or piece of legislation will have on those affected
in looking at the disparate impact that the new tort reform laws will have on ethnic minority groups it is unconscionable that the burden will be placed on these groups that are in the worst position to bear the liability costs
if this legislation moves forward in this body it will be important for us to find out its effect on indigent plaintiffs or those who must hire an attorney strictly on a contingent fee basis
this is a bad rule that will have terrible implications on our legislative branch and i ask that my colleagues to defeat the rule defeat the bill and support the substitute offered by mr schiff
we must carefully consider the longterm implications that this bill as drafted will have on indigent claimants the trial attorney community and facilitation of corporate fraud
it is interesting in the backdrop of the united states promoting democratization in iraq challenging iran and now with the proceedings against saddam hussein and the very basis of our dependence upon a fair and impartial judicial system that will allow lawyers to be able to petition for their client or defend their client that we would stand here on the floor of the house today and in essence create the lawsuit elimination legislation rather than the suggestion that we are preventing abuse
it says to our judges that although you have gone to the highest litmus test confirmation on the federal bench elections and bar scrutiny we are telling you that we are going to pierce your courtroom and we are going to take away the rights of rule 11 where you have discretion and we are going to simply tell you to throw a lawyer out
as i mentioned during the committee on the judiciary s oversight hearing on this legislation during its iteration in the 108th congress and reiterated in my statement for the markup one of the main functions of the congress before it passes legislation is to analyze potentially negative impact against the benefits that it might have on those affected
in looking at the disparate impact that the new tort reform laws will have on ethnic minority groups it is unconscionable that the burden will be placed on these groups that are in the worst position to bear the liability costs
if this legislation moves forward in this body it will be important for us to find out its effect on indigent plaintiffs or those who must hire an attorney strictly on a contingentfee basis
we must carefully consider the longterm implications that this bill as drafted will have on indigent claimants the trial attorney community and facilitation of corporate fraud
but the question is it is not broken and here we are putting heavier burdens on the court system that literally shuts the door closed to a number of individuals and i think that is completely unacceptable for the responsibility of this congress
mr chairman i rise in opposition to hr 420 legislation that would have a chilling effect on a plaintiff s ability to seek recourse in court
as i have listened to my colleagues on the floor talk about threestrikesandyouareout with regard to a counsel you would think this was a criminal situation
it is unconscionable that the claim that businesses get on with more business or they can hire more employees to use that to play against the ability of a plaintiff to bring a lawsuit
what is going to make people work better in the united states of america is having greater opportunity for business and you can not blame business not doing well on lawsuits just as you can not blame doctors running all over creation because of medical malpractice
we need tough mandatory sanctions to crack down on frivolous lawsuits
this bill will help crack down on these frivolous suits by doing three key things
three strikes and you re out means if a judge finds that they have violated rule 11 bringing a frivolous claim on three separate occasions they will be suspended from practicing law in that particular federal court for 1 year and will have to reapply for practice there
you will see that senator edwards running mate senator john kerry told the associated press on october 10 2004 lawyers who file frivolous cases would face tough mandatory sanctions including a threestrikesandyoureout provision that forbids lawyers who file frivolous cases from bringing another suit for the next 10 years president george w bush back when he was a candidate february 9 2000 said as president i will bring common sense to our courts and curb frivolous lawsuits
three strikes and you re out the austin american statesman summarized president bush s plan as saying bush s plan includes stiffer penalties for lawsuits determined by judges to be frivolous including a threestrikesandyoureout rule for lawyers who repeatedly file such claims on the day before we marked up this bill in the judiciary committee may 24 2005 i visited with president bush in his personal residence and asked him mr president do you still stand by this policy that we need three strikes and you re out to crack down on frivolous lawsuits
so we have the democrat presidential candidate mr kerry the democrat vice presidential candidate mr edwards the president of the united states and the judiciary committee on a voice vote adopted this threestrikesandyoureout provision
it is the same language that we had in the class action legislation which was approved on a bipartisan basis by both the house and the senate and signed into law
for example if you lived in orlando florida like i do and you went to your local mcdonald s and you slipped on a puddle of water you could bring your suit in orlando where it should be
in short this is a commonsense bill that provides tough mandatory sanctions to crack down on frivolous suits and includes provisions that enjoy bipartisan support
i urge my colleagues to vote yes on this important legislation
mr chairman i thank the gentleman from california for yielding me this time and for the leadership that he has shown on the issue
unfortunately the majority base bill today i think is the wrong approach whereas the substitute that we are offering here cures a lot of defects that the majority is offering and would put some substance behind cracking down on the filing of frivolous lawsuits
it had a disproportionate impact on the filing of civil rights actions in this country
this is significant because as the gentleman from california pointed out that when there were attempts to stifle meritorious claims from going forward or increasing the litigation costs in lawsuits it was usually in the civil rights actions that were taken during this period which led to the change and the reform of mandatory sanctions back to a discretionary system allowing the judges to decide the application of the appropriate penalties based on the facts and circumstances of the case
she was the first to file a class action suit on behalf of herself and the other women in the country and the nation
where is the genuinely independent 911style commission to investigate the botched response to hurricane katrina and to make recommendations on how to prevent such another tragedy in the future
the fact is the republican leadership does not care much about these issues and i know they are out of step with the american people on these issues
later today we will hear from members of the house judiciary committee who have particular subject expertise on the specifics of this legislation
under this rule and under this bill republican fundraisers are rewarded while the majority party continues its unabashed assault on the judicial branch of this nation
shame on you
shame on all of you for trying to eviscerate the constitution all for a few extra campaign dollars because that is what this is about
on the contrary it is outright political grandstanding
madam speaker if i could inquire from the gentleman how many more speakers he has because i am the last speaker on my side
dear representative we urge you to oppose hr 420 a bill that would restore the discriminatory impact of the old version of rule 11 of the federal rules of civil procedure trample on states rights to run their own courts and increase the extent and expense of litigation rather than reduce it
the aba fully supports the rules enabling act process which is based on three fundamental concepts 1 the essential and central role of the judiciary in initiating judicial rulemaking 2 the use of procedures that permit full public participation including participation by members of the legal profession and 3 provision for a congressional review period
this timeproven process proceeds from separationofpowers concerns and is driven by the practical recognition that among other things 1 rules of evidence and procedure are inherently a matter of intimate concern to the judiciary which must apply them on a daily basis 2 each rule forms just one part of a complicated interlocking whole rendering due deliberation and public comment essential to avoid unintended consequences and 3 the judicial conference is in a unique position to draft rules with care in a setting isolated from pressures that may interfere with painstaking consideration and due deliberation
a system that provides for mandatory suspension of attorneys with three rule 11 violations would have an extremely chilling effect on the justice system and could disproportionately impact attorneys who practice in particular areas such as civil rights or environmental law
we respectfully urge you to vote no on this legislation
the report was prepared at the request of the judicial conference s advisory committee on civil rules to provide information as part of the advisory committee s study of proposals introduced in congress to amend rule 11
the 1993 change followed several years of examination and was made on the judicial conference s recommendation with the supreme court s approval and after congressional review
on january 26 2005 representative lamar smith introduced the lawsuit abuse reduction act of 2005 hr 420
a cottage industry developed that churned tremendously wasteful satellite sanctions litigation that had everything to do with the 1993 amendments to rule 11 were designed to remedy major problems shown by experience with the 1983 rule allow courts to focus on the merits of the underlying cases rather than on rule ii motions but still provide a meaningful sanction for frivolous pleadings
hr 420 would amend rule 11 to restore the 1983 version by removing a court s discretion to impose sanctions on a frivolous filing and by eliminating the rule s safeharbor provisions
the judicial conference based its position on the problems caused by the 1983 version of rule 11 which hr 420 would restore
the judicial conference noted that these problems included creating a significant incentive to file unmeritorious rule 11 motions by providing a possibility of monetary penalty engendering potential conflict of interest between clients and their lawyers who advised withdrawal of particular claims despite the clients preference exacerbating tensions between lawyers and providing little incentive and perhaps a distinct disincentive to abandon or withdraw and thereby admit error on a pleading or claim after determining that it no longer was supportable in law or fact
the advisory committee on civil rules regularly monitors the operation of the civil rules inviting the bench bar and public to inform it of any problems
although the committee is mindful of congressional concerns about frivolous filings addressed in pending legislation the committee has not received any negative comments or complaints on existing rule ii from the bench bar or public
the results of the federal judicial more than 80 percent of the 278 district judges surveyed indicate that rule 11 is needed and it is just right as it now stands 87 percent prefer the existing rule 11 to the 1983 version or the version proposed by legislation eg hr 4571 or hr 420 85 percent strongly or moderately support rule 11 s safe harbor provisions 91 percent oppose the proposed requirement that sanctions be imposed for every rule 11 violation 84 percent disagree with the proposition that an award of attorney fees should be mandatory for every rule 11 violation 85 percent believe that the amount of groundless civil litigation has not grown since the promulgation of the 1993 rule with 12 percent noting that such litigation has not been a problem 19 percent noting that such litigation decreased during their tenure on the federal bench and 54 percent noting that such litigation has remained relatively constant and 72 percent believe that addressing sanctions for discovery abuse in rules 26 g and 37 is better than in rule 11
i urge you on behalf of the judicial conference to oppose legislation amending rule 11
sincerely leonidas ralph mecham madam speaker i think the reason why we have no other speakers on this side is because everything that possibly could be said was said last year
hr 420 treads unnecessarily on judicial independence and makes litigation overly burdensome for legitimate cases to have their fair day in court
primarily this legislation encroaches on the judicial rulemaking process by changing the federal rules of civil procedure over which congress has no rightful jurisdiction
furthermore the requirement that state courts apply these new federal rules is an intrusion on state judicial authority
i strongly believe that the integrity of the judiciary is in question if we impose our own set of rules on this independent body particularly as congress continues to limit judicial discretion
this chilling effect on meritorious legal claims does not offer honest americans justice
the honorable robert carter united states district court judge for the southern district of new york who was one of the pioneers in civil rights legislation and worked on the brown v board of education case stated i have no doubt that the supreme court s opportunity to pronounce separate schools inherently unequal in brown v board of education would have been delayed for a decade had my colleagues and i been required upon pain of potential sanctions to plead our legal theory explicitly from the start this is a good example of the dreadfully detrimental effect of this rule on civil rights cases
to mandate that attorneys be sanctioned on any technicality to say that an attorney may not correct his own mistake you must sanction him to say that three sanctions on three technicalities means he can not practice anymore is to tell attorneys do not try novel legal arguments do not argue new claims
this is an attempt again to shut the courthouse doors to people who need access to the courts and on the most fundamental grounds of justice this bill ought to be soundly rejected
that is the condition that the defendant company puts on it
the defendant company forces the plaintiffs never to discuss the problems with anyone else no one knows about it and more people keep getting hurt because the product remains on the market
once again the republicans must prove that they are the handmaidens of the special interests by putting this bill on the floor today
the substitute seeks to stop the madness that exists on the floor of this house when it is used as a venue to promote the special interests in our country
i thank the rules committee for affording us this opportunity to offer and debate our substitute amendment on the floor today
mr chairman the base bill certainly has an important and worthy stated goal of cracking down on the filing of frivolous lawsuits
first the legislation would revert to a failed regime that has been soundly criticized by those best equipped to comment on the proposed changes the federal judiciary
instead i ask my colleagues to support the schiffkind substitute amendment a proposal that would crack down vigorously on frivolous lawsuits
members on both sides of the aisle agree that our laws and rules of procedure must prohibit frivolous litigation
this important provision will help ensure that information on dangerous products and actions is made available to the public
it cracks down on frivolous lawsuits in a tough fashion but without jeopardizing civil rights claims or providing unnecessary shields to foreign corporations
the base bill on the other hand would apply the three strikes provision only to the specific court in which the violation occurred
in fact when you ask the judges who have operated under both systems the one that is proposed by the base bill and the one that is proposed by the substitute the courts were quite clear that the earlier form of rule 11 which we would go back to in the base bill spawned a cottage industry where someone would file a rule 11 motion the opposing counsel would file a rule 11 motion on the rule 11 motion and then you would have litigation over whose rule 11 motion should succeed
in my concluding comments i want to reiterate some of the points that have been made with respect to the civil rights provisions and quote from the testimony of professor theodore eisenberg who testified before the house committee on the judiciary in the 108th congress and said a congress considering reinstating the feeshifting aspect of rule 11 in the name of tort reform should understand what it will be doing
in fact the naacp wrote in respect to the language in the base bill while language nominally intended to mitigate the damage that this bill will cause to civil rights cases has been added it is vague and simply insufficient in addressing our concerns so on the basis of a need not to chill civil rights legislation which i think we have only seen the greater importance with as katrina ripped off the veneer of poverty and inequality in the country once again for all to see as we consider that the base bill would implement a change that the courts themselves have rejected and found spawned a cottage industry in meritless rule 11 litigation and as the base bill has a stronger and i think more sensible threestrikesandyouareout provision i would urge my colleagues to support the democratic substitute in preference to the flawed base bill
today s legislation would restore mandatory sanctions on lawyers and law firms filing frivolous lawsuits and eliminate the current safe harbor provision that allows lawyers to avoid sanctions by quickly withdrawing meritless claims
frivolous lawsuits have discouraged product development stifled innovative research and cost millions in insurance and legal fees costs that often get passed on to consumers
frivolous lawsuits bankrupt individuals ruin reputations drive up insurance premiums increase health care costs and put a drag on the economy
frivolous lawsuits are brought for example when there is no evidence that shows negligence on the part of the defendant
defendants on the other hand can unfairly lose their lifetime savings their careers their businesses and their reputations
they ve got large populations of voters who are in on the deal
the plaintiff lawyer walks in there and writes the number on the blackboard and the first juror meets the last one coming out the door with that amount of money
today results of frivolous lawsuits are written on all manner of product warnings that aim to prevent obvious misuse
a warning label on a baby stroller cautions remove child before folding a fiveinch brass fishing lure with three hooks is labeled harmful if swallowed and household irons warn never iron clothes while they are being worn small businesses and workers suffer the most
when business week published an extensive article on what the most effective legal reforms would be it stated that what is needed are penalties that sting as business week recommends give judges stronger tools to punish renegade lawyers before 1993 it was mandatory for judges to impose sanctions such as public censures fines or orders to pay for the other side s legal expenses
it incorporates into the base bill provisions imposing sanctions for the destruction of relevant documents in a pending federal court proceeding an amendment setting standards for a court s determination that certain court records should be sealed and an amendment providing for a presumption on a rule 11 violation when the same issue is repeatedly relitigated
this reasonable request was made by the national bankruptcy conference committee on legislation
currently rule 11 allows sanctions against frivolous filers whose denials of factual contentions are not warranted on the evidence or are not reasonably based on a lack of information or belief
furthermore the base bill provides that those who file frivolous lawsuits can be made to pay all costs and attorneys fees that are incurred as a direct result of the filing of the pleading motion or other paper that is the subject of the violation the substitute does not include that critical language which is necessary to make clear that those filing frivolous lawsuits must be made to pay the full costs imposed on their victim by the frivolous lawsuit
mr chairman i believe i have the right to close and i am the remaining speaker on this side so i will reserve the balance of my time
the special interests if there are any involved in this legislation again are obvious to those who listened to the debate the trial lawyers of america and mr chairman let me take a minute here just to dwell on that subject because i happen to believe the vast majority of trial lawyers or personal injury lawyers are honorable people and they are members of an honorable profession
i think the trial lawyers would have a lot more credibility on this subject if in fact they had monitored their own ranks and in fact had sanctioned just a single trial lawyer for filing one of those tens of thousands of frivolous lawsuits that have been filed
after a wreck in which an indiana man collided with a woman who was talking on her cell phone the man sued the cell phone manufacturer
mr chairman i urge my colleagues to oppose the substitute amendment and vote yes on the underlying bill which in fact would deter lawsuit abuse
hr 420 would rein in the negative impact of frivolous lawsuits on the nation s economy by establishing a strong disincentive to file such suits in federal and state courts
prior to 1993 defendants in civil rights cases would file a crushing number of motions alleging frivolous actions on the part of the plaintiff in a blatant attempt to delay the case
in 1993 the rules were changed and judges were empowered to determine sanctions for frivolous lawsuits on a casebycase basis removing this delay tactic from wealthy defendants
justice delayed is justice denied and i am proud to stand up for our constitution judicial system and all americans by voting no on this bill
this bill would also force restrictive venue provisions on all state courts which essentially tells state courts they do not have jurisdiction over certain claims brought by its own citizens
the cribs turn out to be defective and one collapses on a baby in nebraska killing it
to impose a new federal law in every state court action will make state courts conduct a minilawsuit on federal validity before conducting a minilawsuit on state law validity before they ever get to the merits of the case
right now the government is awash in government contracts awarded on a nobid basis
whether it is disaster relief or the war on terror we have never done so much of the public s business on a nobid basis
