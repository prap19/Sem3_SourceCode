mr speaker i rise in opposition to the rules package that we have before us today
as the highest body of elected officials in our country we should be held to the highest ethical standards
by requiring a majority of the ethics committee before an investigation can even begin we are in great danger of diminishing the integrity of our great institution
mr speaker the resolution we are preparing to consider the proposed rules for the 109th congress in my judgment violates the united states constitution which we were just sworn to uphold and defend
just moments ago everyone in this body took an oath to uphold and defend the constitution and now our first official vote is by rule to undermine a fundamental principle of that constitution ie what is a quorum
mr speaker i rise in strong support of this balanced rules package
the homeland jurisdiction being proposed in this package strikes the right balance between a system that is too centralized and one that is too diffuse
but having a single committee that can look across the department of homeland security from an authorizing perspective is also a sensible move and the new committee created in this package will do that
a structure that overly centralized homeland security oversight would make it harder to evaluate the department of homeland security in the context of the other activities of the federal government
but in reality it is simply intellectually lazy to assume that a centralized structure would enable congress to do its work more effectively
so i want to applaud the house leadership for doing what it has done and i stand in strong support of this rules package
mr speaker the chairman of the committee on standards of official conduct is correct when he says that ethics reform must be bipartisan and if the house is to have meaningful bipartisan ethics process changes of this magnitude can be made as they were in 1997 only after thoughtful careful consideration on a bipartisan basis
there has been no effort to look at the rules changes on ethics in a bipartisan manner
in 1997 when i cochaired the committee on ethics reform along with bob livingston the changes that we made were done after deliberation and after democrats and republicans working together came before the house and we did make major changes
and we instituted the 45day rule for assigning a proper complaint for investigation but we changed the rules in 1997
the rules as they are currently configured in order to move a complaint past the committee you have to have the bipartisan agreement of the committee because you have to have a vote in the committee
it guarantees a process will move forward in a bipartisan manner and in fact the committee on standards of official conduct has operated in a bipartisan manner because of the way the rules are configured
if this rule is changed you are making it much more likely that the committee on standards of official conduct will act in a very partisan matter because they will be able to delay for 45 days which does not take a lot of effort to figure out how to delay for 45 days
you should not have that in this rule
mr speaker we are making a terrible mistake here today by changing the rule in terms of the provision that would simply require no action after a 45day period because as the earlier speaker immediately preceding me indicated what we will have done is change a nonpartisan committee that is based on a nonpartisan process into one that provides for a partisan veto over action where the behavior of an individual member or members is at question
it is the confidence of the american people in the integrity of this institution
and when the american people understand very clearly that we now have a committee on standards of official conduct in which either side has a veto it will undermine the confidence of the people in our ethical process
mr speaker i rise in support of this rules package
i am also rising in support of the historic legislative agenda it will govern for today marks the beginning of what historians will likely look back upon as the most productive and significant congress in decades
the mandate granted the majority evidenced by our increased majorities in both houses of congress and the first presidential majority in 16 years is clear
we will hold rogue regimes accountable for their mischief and hold fast to our friends around the world from defiant democrats in israel and taiwan to longstanding comradesinarms like the british and australians to our resurgent allies in new europe
we will work with our everexpanding coalition of the willing to secure the fledging democracies in afghanistan and iraq and with every political economic diplomatic and military tool at our disposal see the war on terror through to victory
we will continue the work begun in president bush s first term to cultivate an opportunity society of economic choice and independence
and while the 109th congress helps increase our national security and prosperity we will also help american families raise their children in a society defined by the values that made our nation secure and prosperous in the first place
we will continue to better protect and educate our children to protect the institution of marriage to protect the constitution from judicial activism and protect the role of family and faith in the public square
to my friends on the other side of the aisle i would remind them all that i know what it means to be in the minority to go into contentious votes certain of defeat to always react to an agenda set by opponents
but i must also remind them that when republicans were in the minority we engaged in the battle of ideas
in the 10 years since that vision was endorsed by our countrymen we have been honored to work with all members of the minority on one issue or the other to develop successful legislative coalitions
mr speaker i am honored to once again serve as leader but even with all of the gratitude i feel toward you our conference and toward this body the source of the honor i feel today is not all in this chamber
the source of the honor each of us rightfully feels today is our friends and families who have given us their love the american people who have given us their trust the men and women in uniform who put their lives on the line for us every day and our heavenly creator who knitted us together in the womb
it will do nothing to stop the abusive practices in this house such as the 3hour vote on the medicare bill in the middle of the night
in fact it allows the speaker added discretion to reconsider votes that the republican majority loses
in addition the new rules require an affirmative vote by the ethics committee before any action can be taken
this in effect gives my republican colleagues the right to block any investigation
in 1980 some members of the house believed that it would be wise to create an energy committee
it used a careful process in which a committee on committees was created consisting of democrats and republicans
in contrast we are now being asked to consider a proposal which was sent to us just yesterday
it was hatched in secret by our republican colleagues without the input of any democrats
in addition thoughtful bills addressing aspects of homeland security reported by the existing committees will now be delayed as the new committee will seek referrals
i would also like to say that on this question that is being brought forward by my friend it is very clear to me based on statements that have been made by a wide range of constitutional scholars that what we are doing in the rules package that we are about to consider is in fact constitutional
in fact before the committee on rules the very distinguished former solicitor general walter dellinger said the following it is simply inconceivable that a constitution established to provide for the common defense and promote the general welfare would leave the nation unable to act in precisely the moment of greatest peril
accordingly it is very appropriate that one of the first orders of business for this 109th congress will be to adopt a rules package which is both true to the traditions and very forward thinking in its outlook for the work of this congress that lies ahead
during the initial stages of compiling this rules package back in november the committee on rules received 40 different proposals from both democrats and republicans
in addition to that our committee staff has actively sought the input of the officers of the house its committees and its caucuses to get their perspectives on the kinds of changes we can make to facilitate the work of the house
all of the ideas contained in this resolution reflect the considered judgment of our colleagues and will ultimately improve our ability to carry out our constitutional responsibilities
mr speaker i include for the record at this point detail on each of these changes in a sectionbysection analysis
sectionbysection summary of h res 5 adopting house rules for the 109th congress the rules of the house of representatives for the 108th congress are adopted as the rules of the house for the 99th congress with amendments as provided in section 2 and with other orders as provided in section 3 a committee on homeland security
adds to the required list of content included in each standing committee s adopted oversight plan as submitted to the committees on government reform and house administration a review of federal programs with a view to insuring against duplication of such programs
rule x clause 5 c 2 d 1 privileged motions in committee recess subject to the call of the chair
allows for a privileged motion in committee to recess subject to the call of the chair for a period less than 24 hours
allows remarks in debate to include references to the senate or its members
provides for continuity of legislative operations in the house in the event of catastrophic circumstances
the rule allows for the house to conduct business with a provisional quorum only after a motion to compel members attendance as prescribed under clause 5 a of rule xx has been disposed of and the following occur in sequence without the house adjourning a a call of the house or a series of calls of the house totaling 72 hours without producing a quorum b the speaker with the minority and majority leaders receive from the sergeantatarms or his designee a catastrophic quorum failure report and shall consult with the minority and majority leaders on the contents of such report and shall announce the contents of such report to the house and c a further call of the house or series of calls are conducted for a total of 24 hours without producing a quorum
adds the motion to reconsider tabling motions to reconsider and amendments reported from the committee of the whole among those votes the speaker may postpone to a designated place in the legislative schedule within two additional legislative days
10883 and mirrors rules that took effect in the senate in 2002
affords members the opportunity to be heard in the event the standards committee alleges the member has violated or may have violated the code of conduct
it also makes a section 303 point of order requiring adoption of budget resolution before consideration of budgetrelated legislation applicable to text made in order as an original bill by a special rule
establishes that the provisions of the senate concurrent resolution 95 of the 108th congress shall have effect in the 109th congress until such time as a budget resolution for the fiscal year 2005 is adopted
a waiver of rule x clause 5 d is granted for armed services and transportation amp infrastructure for 6 subcommittees and international relations for 7 subcommittees in the 109th congress
in the 109th congress the first 10 numbers for bills hr 1 through hr 10 shall be reserved for assignment by the speaker to such bills as he may designate when introduced
we are also making the ability to consider suspensions on wednesdays permanent in this congress after the very successful experiment we had with suspensions on wednesday in the 108th congress
the package includes important provisions to allow us to function in situations where large numbers of members are incapacitated
we are living in a post911 world and it is very important that we continue to expend a lot of time and energy dealing with the institutional challenges as well as the challenges that our nation faces under these circumstances
this was originally intended to make it easier to consider legislation making corrections to outright errors that are in law but it turned out to after a while become more cumbersome than other procedures that we already have to deal with that such as the suspension calendar
and yes mr speaker in a change guaranteed to draw applause from my colleagues on both sides of the aisle the house rules will now allow us to make reference to the senate and its members so long as those references are confined to the question under debate and that they avoid personality
i know that my colleagues and i share the desire to maintain our traditions of dignity and decorum in proceedings and i believe that we can do that even with the rules change that i have just discussed
the first gives members the same rights to choose their counsel before the ethics committee that they would enjoy if they were a respondent in a court case
the second change addresses an inequity in the standards committee process requiring an investigative subcommittee if the chairman and ranking member do not act within 45 days
this change restores the presumption of innocence in our process
let me say that we are going to be hearing from the distinguished chairman of the committee on standards of official conduct in just a few minutes mr speaker
as important as each of those changes are perhaps the most important change in this resolution will be as the speaker said in his very thoughtful opening statement here today the creation of a new standing committee on homeland security
over the past 3 years the congress has asked the american people to accept change in countless ways
this change in house rule x which governs the committees and their legislative jurisdictions is a delicately crafted architecture
it creates with this jurisdiction and the legislative history that i will be placing in the record the department of homeland security will have more certainty as to which committee has the primary responsibility for homeland security
finally mr speaker as we discuss this resolution i will look forward to questions from my colleagues about jurisdictional matters but i will say that clearly the issue of referral lies solely in the hands of the speaker
i will in no way be responding in a manner which would infringe on that power of the speaker
once again i want to say on all of these issues and especially the last one which was a great challenge in trying to fashion a new committee on homeland security with jurisdiction that emerged from many other committees was not an easy task
i want to congratulate speaker hastert for the leadership that he has shown on this and i want to thank all of the committee chairmen who were involved in this process
let me say after having heard from two of my committee on rules colleagues that i anxiously look forward to working with them in a bipartisan way to try to proceed with the deliberations in consideration of measures of this house
i would like to respond to my very good friend from maryland by saying that i may not be as eloquent today as i was when i was in the minority but i continue to share my very strong commitment to ensure the integrity and the behavior of members of this institution
let me say we are in the midst of a discussion about ethics at this point
the idea behind this change that is included in this rules package is that members should not be required to carry two separate cell phones with them
but the law which prevents the solicitation of campaign contributions from federal property in fact is maintained and is one we that feel very strongly about
in any federal building whatsoever
this rules package allows for the establishment of a new permanent standing committee on homeland security as the speaker outlined in his opening remarks here today
he understands that the provisions included in this package will in fact maintain the integrity of this institution
the issue of bipartisanship is important because in this package we ensure that we will not see the politicization of the ethics process which tragically we have seen in the past because it will require bipartisanship which all members are talking about if we do proceed with the investigatory process
that is the right thing to do and i believe this package should in fact enjoy the support of democrats and republicans alike because it is designed to protect this institution and its members
accordingly it is appropriate that one of the first orders of business of the 109th congress will be to adopt a rules package which is both true to its traditions and forwardthinking in its outlook
during the initial stages of compiling this package back in november the rules committee received 40 difference proposals form both democrats and republicans
in addition our committee staff has actively sought the input of the officers of the house its committees and its caucuses to get their perspectives on the kinds of changes we can make to facilitate the work of the house
mr speaker all of the ideals contained in this resolution reflect the considered judgment of our colleagues and will ultimately improve our ability to carry out our constitutional responsibilities
while i will detail each of these changes in the sectionbysection that i will place in the record i want to elaborate on just a few of these changes
there are a number of instances where we are conforming the rules to reflect current house practice such as with the designation of leadership members of the budget committee and the taking of recesses in committee to allow flexibility on our schedules
we are also making the ability to consider suspensions on wednesdays permanent in this congress after our successful experiment in the 108th congress
the package includes important provisions to allow us to function in situations where large numbers of members are incapacitated
as we search for permanent solutions to the problems facing us in the post911 era this is an important step in meeting our responsibilities
while this was originally intended to make it easier to consider legislation making corrections to outright errors in law it turned out to be more cumbersome than other procedures such as consideration under suspension of the rules
and yes mr speaker in a change guaranteed to draw applause from my colleagues the house rules will now allow us to make reference to the senate and its members so long as those references are confined to the question under debate and avoid personality
i know that my colleagues and i share the desire to maintain our traditions of dignity and decorum in proceedings and will do so even with this rules change
the first gives members the same rights to choose their counsel before the ethics committee that they would enjoy if they were a respondent in a court case
the second change addresses an inequity in the standards committee process requiring an investigative subcommittee if the chairman and ranking member do nt act within 45 days
this change restores the presumption of innocence in our process
as important as each of those changes are mr speaker perhaps the most important change in this resolution will be the creation of a new standing committee on homeland security
over the past 3 years the congress has asked the american people to accept change in countless ways
this change in house rule x which governs the committee and their legislative jurisdictions is delicately crafted architecture
it acknowledges the expertise and experience residing in other committees and leaves with them jurisdiction that may have a homeland security implication but not a direct policy relationship
however we envision a system of purposeful redundancy by that we mean more than one level of oversight and an atmosphere in which the competition of ideas is encouraged
with this jurisdiction and the legislative history that i will place in the record the department of homeland security will have more certainty as to which committee has the primary responsibility for homeland security
by approving this resolution the house will do what the speaker and the 911 commission has asked it to do consolidate jurisdiction of the house in one committee
mr speaker in making these changes i want to note several points for the record
first referrals to the select committee on homeland security in the 108th congress will not be considered a precedent for referrals in the 109th congress
third because the department continues to evolve references to a department agency bureau office or subdivision include a reference to successor entities to the extent that the successor engages in homeland security activities now conducted by the department agency bureau office or subdivision referred to in the legislative history
however i want to caution all members that referrals are solely within the speaker s power and in my answers i will not infringe upon the power
surgical addresses of homeland security policy in sundry areas of jurisdiction occupied by other committees would not be referred to the committee on homeland security on the basis of overall homeland security policy jurisdiction
nothing in this clause shall be construed as prohibiting or otherwise restricting the authority of any other committee to study and review homeland security activities to the extent that such activity directly affects a matter otherwise within the jurisdiction of that committee
the committee on homeland security shall have jurisdiction over intelligence the permanent select committee on intelligence shall retain jurisdiction over the intelligence and intelligencerelated activities of all departments and agencies of the federal government including the office of the director of national intelligence and the national counterterrorism center as defined in the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act of 2004
the science the committee on science shall retain some jurisdiction over the research and development activities of the department of homeland security as such matters are incidental to the committee on science s existing jurisdiction except where those activities are in the jurisdiction of another committee
however the committee on homeland security has jurisdiction over port security and some coast guard responsibilities in that area will fall within the jurisdiction of both committees
in general the committee on homeland security would have jurisdiction over bills addressing the transportation security administration and the committee on transportation and infrastructure would have jurisdiction over bills addressing the various entities within the department of transportation having responsibility for transportation safety such as the federal aviation administration and the federal motor carrier safety administration
the jurisdiction of the committee on homeland security does not ways and means the jurisdiction of the committee on ways and means over customs revenue is intended to include those functions contemplated in section 412 b 2 of the homeland security act of 2002 and includes those functions as carried out in collection districts and ports of entry and delivery
subject delegation from the secretary of the treasury to the secretary of homeland security of general authority over customs revenue functions vested in the secretary of the treasury as set forth in the homeland security act of 2002
by virtue of the authority vested in me as the secretary of the treasury including the authority vested by 31 usc
consistent with the transfer of the functions personnel assets and liabilities of the united states customs service to the department of homeland security as set forth in section 403 1 of the act there is hereby delegated to the secretary of homeland security the authority related to the customs revenue functions vested in the secretary of the treasury as set forth in sections 412 and 415 of the act subject to the following exceptions and to paragraph 6 of this delegation of authority a i the secretary of the treasury retains the sole authority to approve any regulations concerning import quotas or trade bans user fees marking labeling copyright and trademark enforcement and the completion of entry or substance of entry summary including duty assessment and collection classification valuation application of the us harmonized tariff schedules eligibility or requirements for preferential trade programs and the establishment of recordkeeping requirements relating thereto
ii the secretary of the treasury shall retain the authority to review modify or revoke any determination or ruling that falls within the criteria set forth in paragraph 1 a i and that is under consideration pursuant to the procedures set forth in sections 516 and 625 c of the tariff act of 1930 as amended 19 usc
the secretary of homeland security periodically shall identify and describe for the secretary of the treasury such determinations and rulings that are under consideration under sections 516 and 625 c of the tariff act of 1930 as amended in an appropriate and timely manner with consultation as necessary prior to the secretary of homeland security s exercise of such authority
the secretary of homeland security shall provide a copy of these identifications b paragraph 1 a notwithstanding if the secretary of homeland security finds an overriding immediate and extraordinary security threat to public health and safety the secretary of homeland security may take action described in paragraph 1 a without the prior approval of the secretary of the treasury
however immediately after taking any such action the secretary of homeland security shall certify in writing to the secretary of the treasury and to the chairman and ranking member of the committee on ways and means and the chairman and ranking member of the committee on finance the specific reasons therefor
any references in this delegation of authority to the secretary of the treasury or the secretary of homeland security are deemed to include their respective delegees if any
this delegation of authority is not intended to create or confer any right privilege or benefit on any private person including any person in litigation with the united states
16509 maintenance of delegation in respect to general authority over customs revenue functions vested in the secretary of the treasury as set forth and defined in the homeland security act of 2002 dated february 28 2003 is rescinded
and despite what i read in the morning papers the republican leadership is eliminating a major traditional ethics standard of the house
america was intended to be a city on a hill with the highest standards for the government in the world and sadly today we are lowering those standards
when we are guided by only political consideration in the house leadership today the house abandons its principles and the moral compass
i do know something about legislative ethics having first been elected to the state house of representatives after a tremendous sharpstown bank scandal in texas 1972
born and raised in texas i understand what it means about conservative government but i can not begin to explain how eliminating a traditional ethics standard is conservative in the slightest
however the people recognize this for what it is a weakening of our government s ethics in pursuit of political parity by one party be it democrat or republican
but i am disappointed that the majority has only given shared jurisdiction to the homeland security committee in some areas
in 4 out of the last 5 years the majority has made a massive omnibus bill the only option to fund the government
the results of this practice are ballooning deficits the cbo confirmed that the 2004 deficit is the largest in history 413 billion a lack of followthrough to determine how appropriated funds are being spent
without proper oversight as a backstop problems in the executive branch can spin out of control
this kind of lax or nonexistent oversight contributes to situations like we saw in abu ghraib prison
now we have learned about secret permanent detention facilities in the united states where possible terrorists are held indefinitely without any legal status
i think some of the recommendations that are in here are ill conceived and i would hope to work with the chairman again in a bipartisan way with him and his committee and with the leadership to make some additional changes as we go through the process
but i want to thank him and thank the speaker and the leadership for accommodating my concerns about some of the amendments that i thought were the most difficult and the ones that created the biggest problem in trying to implement the code of official conduct
each of us in fact all of us individually and collectively have a responsibility to maintain the highest standard of conduct for this house
and changes in the rules as was said by the previous speaker should strengthen not weaken those standards
i would not be standing up here encouraging people to support the rules package if in any way i thought we were gutting it
we are tweaking it and as i said earlier we are tweaking some of it in a way that i wish we were not tweaking it but it does not gut it
i could not have a better partner in this ethics process than the gentleman from west virginia mr mollohan xz4002810
to have a bipartisan process any significant change in the ethics rules must be made only after careful thorough bipartisan consideration as was done in 1989 and 1997
in 1989 and 1997 ethics reform came only after a broad consensus developed for change
despite the deletion of the amendment that i found the most objectionable to the code of conduct the rules package includes a number of provisions that would make major changes in the ethicsrelated rules but as to which neither the committee on standards of official conduct nor members outside the rules process were consulted
in 1997 the house through a bipartisan task force carefully studied the committee on standards of official conduct s enforcement procedures made a series of changes
i think that creates a problem in trying to implement a fair and evenhanded ethics process
when in 1997 the bipartisan task force report was before the house the house significantly rejected on a bipartisan vote of 181 to 236 an amendment that would have required automatic dismissal of any complaint after 180 days not 45 days
the reason for rejection of that amendment as set out in the floor debate is that such an artificial time limit on the life of a complaint would serve to encourage deadlock within the committee and partisanship among committee members
the process in the house is not perfect
we were told the president wants to proceed on a bipartisan fashion in the next 4 years to deal with the important issues that confront our nation
it was when democrats were in charge it is now when republicans are in charge
but as the gentleman from colorado mr hefley xz4001740 has so correctly pointed out there was an exception and that exception was dealing with the ethics of this institution which in fact deals with the confidence that the american public has in this institution
mr speaker the opening day of a new congress should be one in which the interests of this institution are paramount
today as i think has been attested to by the gentleman from colorado mr hefley xz4001740 the house moves in the wrong direction
the most egregious attempt is the one before us now currently remaining in this rule
in sharp contrast however the rule before us will have a concrete demonstrable effect on every ethics complaint filed from this day forward
when we weaken the committee we weaken the standards that we are all expected to uphold and we erode public confidence in this institution
the gentleman from california mr dreier xz4001150 spoke eloquently to the maintenance of the status quo when he was in the minority urging us to be vigilant in rooting out unethical behavior in this institution
he is not correct now in offering this rule which weakens that process
i think the gentleman from colorado mr hefley xz4001740 was right in his letter
but i tell my friend that the most egregious longlasting impacting change remains in this package
mr speaker in accordance with clause 2 of rule xi of the rules of the house of representatives i am submitting the rules of the committee on armed services for printing in the congressional record

mr speaker i rise in opposition to the proposed changes to the house rules under the privileged resolution before the committee of the whole house
a change like this would be an embarrassment to what this nation calls a democracy furthermore by allowing members to intentionally deadlock the vote of the ethics committee to kill a claim we would be acting in contravention of the spirit of the us constitution that guarantees procedural due process
moreover members should be given adequate time in which to read legislation that will be voted upon
since the legislation that we pass in this august body affects the entire nation which includes the districts represented by minority members it is an injustice that insufficient time has been given for review of legislation
in the proposal that has been brought before the house does not contain the changes that are needed
because the department is still in its infancy stages it is critical that committee oversight be applied to track and quickly eradicate deficiencies
dhs will be an important partner to our intelligence agencies in order to keep america safe
in addition with the challenges that we have had with adequately funding first responders it is very important that congress retain a close relationship to the department
mr speaker i strongly oppose the radical new provision included in this rules package resolution which would violate the constitution by allowing the speaker and a small group of members to usurp the powers of a majority of the house and act with only a provisional quorum instead of the real thing
for each house member deprived of the right to exert an impact on the work of the house either through physical presence in or absence from the chamber the approximately 600 000 persons represented by each member would be deprived of their rights to democratic representation in the legislative body structured to be closest to the american people
article i section 5 of the constitution states that a quorum consists of a majority and in the absence of a majority all that the remaining minority of members of the house can do is either adjourn from day to day or vote to compel the attendance of absent members
the constitution does not guarantee that a minority of the house will necessarily succeed in compelling the attendance of absent members to create a constitutional quorum
suppose that in the aftermath of a catastrophic emergency which caused mass casualties and disrupted transportation and communications nationwide a presiding officer existed in the house who might either be the speaker or another member of the house acting as speaker pro tempore from a list of names left by a deceased speaker
these members seats would not be considered vacant but they would fall into a kind of extraconstitutional limbo until the missing members or a majority of the total membership reappeared in the house
it is even possible that some states might seek to replace members who do not answer the provisional quorum call in the house by ordering special elections even though the members might be known to be alive
all members are equal under the constitution and the right to membership in this house is not determined by a speaker speaker pro tempore or a rump of a minority of the body
the supreme court has ruled that the house may not add qualifications for membership beyond those expressly stated in the constitution
members who are trapped at an airport because the transportation system is inoperative for example do not simply cease to exist nor can their powers be vested in other members willingly or not
the resolution would also do an end run around the issue of disability a matter not addressed in the constitution and one which requires a constitutional amendment to resolve as the 25th amendment did in the case of the president
disabled members whom we might describe as those either physically injured or mentally incapable so as to be incapable of participating in the work of the house have the same status as those who are fully functional
at the very least the house should debate the provisional quorum issue as a separate resolution following hearings by the rules committee with the speaker in the chair to signal the historic nature of the debate and the radical action proposed to be taken
even though prospects for passage of a constitutional amendment were extremely slim a substantial debate would have served to educate the congress and the american people on the importance of these issues and perhaps provide impetus in a search for alternatives
neither house passed simple legislation which would have corrected an oversight in the legislation creating the department of homeland security in 2002 which failed to place the supposedly critical new cabinet officer somewhere anywhere in the statutory line of success to the presidency
though hearings were held neither house addressed significant issues of presidential succession such as the role of the speaker and president pro tempore and lame duck cabinet members in the succession lineup and the ability of some officials to bump others serving as acting president under the current federal statute
mr speaker i plan to urge further action on congressional continuity issues in the new year to work with my colleagues on the committee on house administration to assert our own jurisdiction more effectively and to push other relevant committees to do the same
clause 4 a 1 of rule xiii requires committeereported bills to lay over for three days before consideration in the house
the purpose of this rule which dates from the legislative reorganization act of 1970 is to give members who did not participate in committee deliberations time to consider the committee s work
when he was a minority rules committee member chairman dreier explained the importance of this rule in the following way why is it that we have the 3day layover
very simple mr speaker i do not think you would enter into a business agreement or purchase a home or engage in any kind of major activity without having read it first
it is there so that we may in fact allow members to have the opportunity to review legislation before they exercise their constitutional right and vote for it or against it althoug chairman dreier was very critical of special rules that waived the 3day layover when he was a minority rules committee member his committee routinely reports special rules waiving 3day layover of committeereported legislation
in the 108th congress the rules committee waived the 3day layover of committeereported legislation 31 times
it would allow the house to adopt a rule waiving the 3day layover of committeereported legislation only with a twothirds vote in the same way the house must approve a rule calling for sameday consideration of a bill by a twothirds vote
as chairman dreier wrote back in 1993 deliberative democracy is just as important at the end of the legislative process as it is at the formative subcommittee stages or the amendatory floor stage
in fact the case can be made that it is even more important that congress be fully informed and deliberate on that final product since that is the version that will become law because only a restricted group of house members participate in conferences and because conference reports can contain significant policy changes from the houseapproved version of a bill the standing house rules provide members a number of protections against the conference process
perhaps the most important protection is the one found in clause 8 a 1 a of house rules xxii which requires conference reports and joint explanatory statements to lay over for three days after publication in the congressional record
since most members do not participate in the conference they need time to study and familiarize themselves with the conference product
conference reports on major legislation run sometimes hundreds although conference reports are privileged and could come directly to the floor for consideration without a rule they are routinely considered under special rules because they are often in technical violation of one or more sections of rule xxii or the budget act of 1974
while it is understandable that the majority may need to use special rules to waive certain points of order against the content or consideration of conference reports in particular situations the majority has made it the practice to grant blanket waivers to virtually every conference report the house considers
some of these conference reports reconfirm the truth of the old saying that the devil is in the details chairman dreier made this very same argument when as a minority rules committee member he opposed waiving the 3day layover on conference reports
the energy bill conference added scores of obscure provisions that had not appeared in the house or senate bills including the embarrassing greenbonds initiative which turned out to be subsidy to build a hooters restaurant in shreveport louisiana
previous questions for h res 5 109th congress opening day rules package in section 2 amendment to h res 5 offered by ms slaughter xz4003780 of new york strike section 2 k 2 relating to dismissal of complaints and redesignate the succeeding paragraph accordingly lt p gt
mr speaker i strongly oppose the changes in the house ethics rules that the republican majority is seeking to adopt today
the proposed republican rule changes would cripple the ethics process in the house and dramatically lower the bar for standards of official conduct
late yesterday the republican majority in the house released the details of its rules package for the 109th congress
there is no doubt that if the proposed rule change had been in effect during the last congress no action would have been taken against the members of the house who were reprimanded as a result of the ethics committee s investigation of bribery allegations raised in connection with the vote on the medicare prescription drug act of 2003
at a time when public confidence in congress is so low and the nation faces so many challenges it is inexplicable that the first order of business in the new session is to water down the ethics rules in the house and make it even more difficult to discipline lawmakers who abuse their office
i urge all my colleagues to join me in opposing this assault on ethics enforcement in the house
mr speaker i rise in opposition to the proposed changes in the ethics rules
in the 8 years i served we had unanimous votes
we are at tremendous risk for a cyberattack and the changes in that area will make us less safe
instead the leadership of this house is beginning the new year in the worst possible way by gutting the ethical standards of the united states house of representatives
in the rules package before us today the republican leadership is sending a very clear message
mr speaker the republican party regained a majority of seats in this body in 1994 in part by promising greater accountability and a more honest system in the nation s capital
today is just one more example of the ethical lapses we have seen in this house a house where major legislation is now written by industry lobbyists a house where members are not even given the courtesy of being able to read bills before they are voted on and a house where bad behavior is not reprimanded but rewarded
that means not dancing around the law and that means conducting ourselves in a manner that reflects credibility on the house at all times
facing the possible indictment of a member of their leadership the republicans attempted in secret to change the rules to protect their ethically challenged colleagues
however in the face of mounting public controversy the public leadership caved last night and rescinded the change
but mr speaker let us be clear that the republican leadership did not find religion in this issue
if they believed that what they were about to do was truly wrong they would not have proposed these rule changes in the first place
but while republicans try to pull a fast one claiming that the majority leader fell on his sword for the good of his party the truth is that the rules package for the 109th congress still in a very meaningful way fundamentally weakens the ethics system here in the house of representatives
remember as the gentlewoman from new york stated that the ethics committee is evenly divided between democrats and republicans and to ensure that partisan politics did not prevail in the ethics process a tie vote ensures a formal investigation
in other words mr speaker the chairman of the committee whoever that may be could stonewall the process refuse to call for a vote and ultimately kill any ethics complaint without any action
mr speaker i rise in opposition to the rules package
i came to this house 30 years ago and our historic incoming class brought with it one of the strongest tides of reform ever seen rules were changed chairmen were replaced procedures were modernized so that the voice of the people was heard and respected in this house of the people
that s not hard to understand we should not be passing bills that are hundreds of pages in length sometimes over 1 000 pages without ever having seen what is in the bill
in fact our former colleague assumes his job with phrma today just as we are taking our oaths of office
mr tauzin will reportedly be earning a salary nearly 13 times what he earned when he wrote that proindustry bill one of the best paid lobbyists in washington
in fact a top aide to the republican leadership was quoted last january 24 on cnncom as saying that republican congressman tauzin s negotiation with pharma does nt look very good it does nt look very good today either as millions of seniors face higher drug prices thanks to the tauzin bill and bill tauzin takes office to improve the tattered image of the drug industry
and at the same time let s put an end to the outrageous practice of voting on complex and lengthy bills before congress has had time to read them bills like that prescription drug bill bill tauzin wrote while he was listening to pharma s whispers in his ears
is nt it bad enough that republicans majority writes the bills in secret without input from the democrats who represent 48 percent of the country
without review by the public must we also vote on secret legislation without reading it without knowing the tax breaks and earmarked spending for special interests that have been stuck in without any review
i urge all members to put party aside and vote the way your constituents would want you to vote an end to private job negotiations while serving in public office and full disclosure of the contents of legislation before we vote
contrary to this morning s press reports the republicans have nt backed away from their attempts to shield delay from further investigation they ve simply become a little more deceptive in how they re doing it
last year when the ethics committee admonished delay three times it deferred action on another serious charge his role in funneling illegal soft money into texas races through his state pac until after the investigation against him had been completed
changing the ethics rules would permit the republicans to halt any investigation of the abramoff scandal and the members who could be implicated in their outrageous looting of native americans
mr speaker i would like to address the ethicsrelated provisions that are in this package at the insistence of the committee on rules
i had the honor of serving as ranking member of the committee on standards of official conduct in the last congress
it was an honor to serve with the gentleman from colorado chairman hefley as he always managed to chair the committee in a completely bipartisan manner
the headlines in this morning s paper say gop abandons ethics changes it turns out that the headline is at best only half right
it is true that the most outrageous ethics undermining provision has been deleted from the rules package but other provisions provisions that would make major changes in the way the committee on standards of official conduct handles enforcements of the rules they remain
there should be no misunderstanding that these provisions that remain would seriously undermine the ethics process in the house both because of the changes they would make in committee procedures but and equally important because of the partisan way in which they are being adopted
if there is to be a meaningful viable ethics process in the house it must be a genuinely bipartisan process
and to have a bipartisan process it is absolutely essential that any major changes in the rules be made on a truly bipartisan basis
what is more because of the importance and the sensitive nature of the ethics rules it is also essential that any proposed changes be considered in a thoughtful considered and open way with all members being given the opportunity for input democrats and republicans
until today the house has not attempted to make major changes in the ethics rules or the committee on standards of official conduct procedures in a slapdash way with literally only hours of consideration and on a party line vote
the rules that have been in effect since 1997 clearly provide that at any time that a complaint is before the chairman and ranking member for consideration either one of them may place the complaint on the committee s agenda and when either one of them does that an investigative committee can not be established without a majority vote of the committee
when you turn to the actual text of the due process amendments you find that what these amendments are concerned with is not committee actions that impose sanctions or determine violations but instead on committee letters or statements that reference the official conduct of a member it may be well that the rules should provide certain rights to a member whose conduct is going to be discussed in a letter or statement that the committee issues publicly but what should those rights be
but one specific right that this proposed rule provides to those members is the right to demand an immediate trial in front of an adjudicatory subcommittee of the committee on standards of official conduct
but in the circumstances that the rule addresses that trial would take place before the committee has conducted any formal investigation of the matter
no committee that is serious about conducting its business would allow itself to be put in that circumstance
i d like to address the ethicsrelated provisions that are in this package at the insistence of the rules committee
i had the honor of serving as ranking member of the ethics committee in the last congress and i also served on the committee for 6 years during another time of controversy in the late 1980s
it was an honor to serve during the last 2 years with chairman hefley as he always managed the committee in a completely bipartisan manner
a headline in this morning s newspaper says gop abandons ethics changes it turns out that the headline is at best only half right
it s true that the most outrageous ethicsundermining provision has been deleted from the rules package but other provisions provisions that would make major changes in the way the ethics committee handles enforcement of the rules remain
there should be no misunderstanding that these provisions that remain would seriously undermine the ethics process in the house both because of the changes they would make in committee procedures and equally important because of the partisan way in which they would be adopted

but in the circumstances that the rule addresses that trial would take place before the committee has conducted any formal investigation of the matter
no committee that is serious about conducting its business would allow itself to be put in that circumstance
when the house last considered ethics committee procedures in 1997 it rejected on a bipartisan vote an amendment that would have required the automatic dismissal of any complaint that is not acted upon within 180 days
yet now this provision for automatic dismissal has reappeared and this time it has a far shorter time frame for committee consideration than the nearly identical provision that the house soundly rejected in 1997
i want to close by asking all members including all members of the leadership on both sides of the aisle to give some serious consideration not just today but in the weeks and months ahead to whether you genuinely want to have a meaningful ethics process in the house and what we as members individually and collectively have to do in order for such a process to exist
it has to be recognized that the basic purpose of the process is to consider and address legitimate ethics concerns and if members are successful in using the process for partisan political purposes it is going to fail
mr speaker i rise in support of the point of order
the question of course before us in this debate is a majority of what
what is the denominator in that equation
removal by action of the house is also a defined term expulsion by a vote of twothirds in article 1 section 5 the constitution also gives the house the authority to compel attendance when members do not answer the call of the chair in such manner and under such penalties as each house may provide
and in fact the sergeant at arms has been sent to gather members by force on prior occasions
if this is triggered in a time of national emergency the consequences could be dire
mr speaker we heard the distinguished chair or maybe he is only the presumptive chair of the committee on rules at this point but in any event the gentleman from california mr dreier xz4001150 said a moment ago that this proposed rules change is constitutional because the constitution could not have contemplated that the house could not function
but the constitution did not contemplate that the majority of the members of the house might in fact be the victims of an act of mass terrorism
certainly before we take such a measure it deserves much more extensive debate and hearings and discussion than it can have by three or four speakers in this context now
this may provoke court action and we should not adopt this now in the context of an overall rules change with this very serious amendment to the constitution which is what it amounts to it can not receive adequate consideration in terms of its constitutionality either in terms of its merit
res 95 which is currently in effect as a concurrent resolution on the budget in the house under h res 5
the first table in the report compares the current levels of total budget authority outlays and revenues with the aggregate levels set forth by s con
this list is needed to enforce section 401 of the budget resolution which creates a point of order against appropriation bills that contain advance appropriations that are i not identified in the statement of managers or ii would cause the aggregate amount of such appropriations to exceed the level specified in the resolution
enactment of measures providing new budget authority for fiscal year 2005 in excess of 46 377 000 000 if not already included in the current level estimate would cause fiscal year 2005 budget authority to exceed the appropriate level set by s con
res 95 enactment of measures providing new outlays for fiscal year 2005 in excess of 21 374 000 000 if not already included in the current level estimate would cause fiscal year 2005 outlays to exceed the appropriate level set by s con
enactment of measures that would reduce revenue for fiscal year 2005 if not already included in the current level estimate would cause revenues to fall further below the appropriate level set by s con
enactment of measures resulting in revenue reduction for the period of fiscal years 2005 through 2009 if not already included in the current level estimate would cause revenues to fall further below the appropriate levels set by s con
this report is submitted under section 308 b and in aid of section 311 of the congressional budget act as amended
in addition under section 402 of s con
the effects of the actions listed above are detailed in the accompanying report
mr speaker i rise in opposition to h res 5 to the republican rules package
i oppose this grant of jurisdiction not because of some desire to protect existing committees turf but because transfer of these security issues to a new committee divests from the responsibility for those issues from those members who have substantial experience and expertise in some cases developed through decades of work on them
the most effective way to influence policy is to be part of the debate and discussion in the early stages of policy formation simply voting yes or no when legislation makes it to the house floor is generally not sufficient participation to craft policy
i take this position on the basis of my 30 years of experience in the house during which time i have given high priority to security particularly the security of our transportation system
however transportation and port security can not be considered in a vacuum
in addition security mandates are only one type of requirement imposed on transportation industries
any security legislation or regulation must be considered in the context of the costs and benefits of all such requirements governing transportation industries
in the aftermath of the pan am flight 103 tragedy the t amp i committee developed the landmark aviation security improvement act of 1990 pl
in the aftermath of the september 11 attacks the t amp i committee developed and considered the aviation and transportation security act of 2001 atsa
it will take years for the new committee to develop the institutional background and expertise that currently resides in our committee
finally the republican conference drafted these changes to rule x in isolation
democrats were afforded no role in crafting this critical security policy
mr speaker i rise in opposition to what i consider a shameless rules package which will undermine the ethical standards held by this house
after the elections in november the first thing the republican majority did was to lower the house s ethical standard
in an act of unprecedented shamelessness they changed the rule of their party to permit an indicted member of their party to remain in a leadership position
yesterday in the face of an overwhelming bipartisan and public condemnation they changed their rules back
what is shocking is that they ever considered it in the first place
it says a member shall conduct himself at all times in a manner that should reflect creditably on the house of representatives
instead of a bipartisan effort to strengthen the ethical process the republicans have engaged in a completely partisan exercise that should be an affront to every member on either side of the aisle who has served in this body
the proposed changes which are still in this rules package are destructive and they are unethical
it is bipartisan evenly divided and we came up with new ethics rules some of which survived the floor that year in 1997
so it was put forth and has been the rules of the house and the committee on standards of official conduct that in order to cease or dismiss a case we had to have a majority of the committee on standards of official conduct
either party with half the votes in the committee evenly split could cease and desist any complaints from going forward
the point of the committee on standards of official conduct is to have a process in which to deal with ethics complaints against members
they did blink on a couple of different scores but the fundamental challenge to the ethical standard of the house being enforced is still in this rules package and it should be rejected
one of them is to remove this change and that would be a vote on the previous question and then on the motion to recommit we address two other abuses of power that should be addressed in this bill
one is what i will call the tauzin rule and the democratic motion to commit would forbid a member of congress to negotiate with an outside entity that has business before his or her committee and before the congress in the current congress or in a previous congress called the tauzin rule because mr tauzin who managed the medicare bill was at the time being courted by the pharmaceutical industry which was to benefit from provisions in the prescription drug bill a rumored 2 million a year salary for selling america s seniors down the river
in our motion to commit we also address the 3day rule
as many of my colleagues recall in recent memory there was occasion on the floor when a huge bill of many thousands of pages containing nine appropriations bills seven of which never appeared on the floor of the united states senate came before this house where the matter was overnight passed in the committee on rules came to the floor the next morning without any chance of members being able to read the bill
it was important that day because there was a great deal in that bill that members did not know about that they were voting on and should not they know that but very specifically in that bill and it was not found out until the because of the egregiousness of that and the violation of privacy of the american people i insisted that the members come back to vote on that rather than just have it be done by unanimous consent to remove that provision from the law
so that the american people will know because of the abuse of power in this house ignoring of the 3day rule that members can not even see what they are voting on before they vote on it and something like looking at your tax returns could be sneaked into the bill without any safeguards to protect people from that
in our motion to commit we address the abuse of power of a powerful chairman negotiating for a job while he was a member of congress who had control of the bill over the industry which was offering him 2 million a year
that is how much it cost to sell the american seniors down the river and i hope that even if you separate yourself from any of the examples and just say i sent you to congress to represent me you do that in what you say there and how you vote and i expect that you know what you are voting on
a vote for the motion to commit stops the unethical process of members negotiating with people outside whose bills they are managing inside this congress in this congress or in the previous congress
the previous question vote would say no to the republicans in their evisceration of the ethical process of this house by saying that you do not need a majority to dismiss a case you can just do it if all the members of your party on the committee decide to stick with you on it
everything that we have done in the ethics process has had some level of respect to the extent that it has because it has been bipartisan bipartisan in writing the rules evenly divided committee cooperation between the chair and ranking member
today is a major departure from that and i guess maybe i have just spent too many long hours for too many long years in the committee on standards of official conduct room trying to respect the rights of members and our higher responsibility to uphold an ethical standard
mr speaker all over washington and in the country people are talking today about the majority s lastminute decision to abandon rules changes that would have eviscerated longstanding ethical guidelines in this house and with that the integrity of the institution
and while in the end the majority was right to withdraw these provisions they hardly deserve our congratulations
the republicans simply succumbed to tough criticism from every major ethics group in washington several major news organizations and house democrats
the rules changes in question were so egregious that rankandfile republicans would not support their leadership s plan
the measure was similar to a conference rule the house republican conference passed last fall to protect its leadership in the event that one of them is indicted
the fact that they ever considered changing the rules of the house in this disgraceful manner is a sad commentary on the ethical compass of this body s leadership
this standard is similar to the one that exists for the men and women serving in our military
how could they even think about changing the house rules in this regard when to do so would mean demanding a higher ethical standard from an 18yearold private in the army than we who sit in this hallowed chamber
it is hard to believe that there was a time in the not too distant past when the republicans touted their high ethical and moral standards
how can we as the guardians of democracy spread the values of selfgovernance across the world if we refuse to govern ourselves right here in this chamber
mr speaker though we should all be relieved that the republicans were shamed into abandoning the most overtly egregious provisions the remaining ethics provisions in today s legislation will still destroy the house ethics process
mr speaker the committee on standards of official conduct is the only evenly divided committee in the house
in practical terms the republicans have granted themselves veto power over any complaint it does not deem palatable
mr speaker we can be sure that if these rules changes had been in place in the last congress no ethics complaints would have seen the light of day
under the republicans the ethical climate in washington has eroded enormously
when i speak to constituents i find myself telling them to forget what they learned in school about how a bill becomes a law
in times past our laws were written to serve the public interest
the medicare drug bill that was rammed through congress in the dead of night stands as a potent example of the ethical erosion of the house of representatives
they deserve to be able to trust their elected leaders and have faith in the integrity of this institution
when bills are rushed to the floor cobbled together at the last minute warm from the machine pages are missing or worse outrageous provisions are slipped in by committee staff
mr speaker i urge my colleagues to vote to strike the egregious ethics changes in this package
mr speaker i ask unanimous consent to insert the text of the amendment in the record immediately prior to the vote on the previous question
my motion to commit will prohibit sitting members of congress from negotiating for future employment with any person who has a direct interest in the legislation referred to any committee on which that member serves
it also includes a rules change that would require a twothirds vote in the house to waive the requirement in our standing rules that members must have 3 days to read the committee reports
mr speaker i realize that september 11 was a tragic day in america certainly a wakeup call within the states
i also remind the members of this body that in the war of 1812 this building was occupied by a foreign army
so for the gentleman from california mr dreier xz4001150 to say that they could not have foreseen these circumstances taking place what in the heck is he talking about
it is my hope that allowing campaign cell phones to be used in a congressional office is not in any way a backdoor attempt to allow a member to use a campaign cell phone from their congressional office or any federal facility to raise funds to get around this prohibition that currently exists in law
just for a clarification the use of a campaign cell phone in this building
12 i was in the chamber seeking recognition but the vote was closed
mr chairman i thank the gentleman from ohio mr oxley xz4003070 for his support of the legislation as well as his managing of it here today and his general goodwill for all people in this country
mr chairman i rise in support of hr 54 the congressional gold medal enhancement act of 2005 and i do urge its immediate adoption after consideration of the amendments today
congress created the congress gold medal honor in 1776 to recognize military leaders and awarded the first medal to george washington for his heroic service in the revolutionary war as the chairman indicated earlier
the legislation we consider today seeks to maintain the prestige of the medal by limiting the number that may be awarded in any given year
to understand the need for such legislation a little history of the medal is in order
as i mentioned the first congressional gold medal was struck in 1776 in paris for america had no appropriate facilities at that point at the behest of the continental congress which had not yet declared independence from great britain
the recipient was general george washington and the act that inspired the medal was his leadership of the continental army in driving the british from boston
in the next dozen years congress awarded six more gold medals to individuals for heroic action in the revolutionary war
by comparison in the 108th congress we authorized five medal programs honoring seven individuals and one couple
in the 106th congress we authorized seven medal programs but because of multiple recipients the number of medals totaled more than 300
while commemorative coins are not as prestigious as congressional gold medals both are used to recognize moments in history
in response mr chairman i authored and congress approved the commemorative reform coin act
since these reforms were enacted in the 104th congress commemorative coins have not cost the taxpayers a dime
in the last 100 years congress awarded 86 medals including 20 in the past decade since the commemorative coin reforms
i feel it is important to note that proposals in the past have been sponsored in about equal numbers by republicans and democrats and i do not really recall any discussion of the recipients or the sponsors party affiliations
in my view any such discussion would be inappropriate as these awards should be awarded in true bipartisan fashion
in practice however not through statute the committee on financial services requires a twothirds cosponsorship before considering proposals to award medals a practice that the senate has now adopted
i encourage my colleagues to join me in maintaining the integrity of the congressional gold medal by supporting this measure
that is only something that has happened in the more recent couple of decades perhaps a couple of times
that obviously created some problems because of the volume of the medals and it was done in sort of an unusual procedure
the congressional gold medal of honor has always been bestowed upon an individual in a very special ceremony to honor that individual
that is the intent of what we are trying to do in the legislation
i just wanted to make that point in the history of it
looking at the history of these congressional gold medals though i think is very telling in terms of what we are doing because the history has always been to individuals for outstanding achievement
so in terms of the groups i really think we should honor that
that is not disrespectful of any group that has gotten it or all the other groups who are potentially eligible out there if you use them in that criteria of measurement
in fact if anything it would be an expansion over what the total history of it has been
by the time you go through a legislative session and you gather 290 signatures and you go through committee and you go to the floor and i have handled these bills they often happen the last day by the way so it is always very confusing in terms of what we are doing i think you are going to find this is not as limiting as one might think
again i recognize the fact that it is a bigger country that there is much more going on in the country and that kind of thing but we are really trying to make sure that this is truly an honor for somebody who does something extraordinary in science or the arts or an elected official or somebody of that nature usually a president i think the only elected official who has ever been honored people in religion people who have just absolutely stood out in their circumstances
this is not an unreasonable amendment and the sponsor has certainly always been a very reasonable member of congress and we are arguing at the margins here in terms of what we are doing and i recognize that
we sort of learn techniques in this when we have done it
the gentleman from new jersey mr payne xz4003120 will always be a hero in my mind because he took it amongst the democrats and got a lot of signatures when i was struggling with it on a bill that i did last year and i appreciate that a great deal
but my judgment is four in total in the course of 2 years is sufficient
it was something like 45 medals in the first 120 years and now 10 times that many in the last 10 years
that means that this has increased i think at a rate that is too rapid and again i do not in any way belittle anyone who has received this because they are all very distinguished people
i do not know if one party is ever going to have 290 members or not i sort of doubt it at least in the time most of us are around here and you need both parties in order do this
i can not tell you and hardly anyone can tell you whether benjamin franklin was or would have been a republican or a democrat in his history
we do not know the politics of people like george washington and certainly the people who have been from other countries a number of individuals who received medals here in the congress of the united states
in the history of the gold medals as i believe the gentleman from new york mr crowley xz4000870 pointed out it has been as much democrats even more so than republicans
even on the business of the commemorative coins a number of the sponsors in the senate have been democrats as well
i just have never noticed a lot of politics in this i guess is my point
so i do rise in opposition to this
mr chairman reclaiming my time and i will be glad to yield further in a moment it typically has not worked that way
typically the way you do it is somebody comes to you with the idea maybe it is a thomas edison or somebody of that ilk of that nature and you generally will then go to your leadership or to the leadership on the other side or to the chairman of the committee and say look i am interested in getting this done
in fact i would be dumbfounded if you had two on one side and two on the other
as the gentleman knows on commemorative coins they can be done in out years
but almost always you work it out in advance
it is almost always worked out in advance and agreed upon
so there is much more bipartisanship in this process than almost anything i know about in this congress
i have never seen a bit of politics in these medals
i think a large part now is because you need all those signatures you just can not do it in a partisan sense
i think it brings in an element of politics that frankly we just do not have in the legislation
in fact the chairman of the full committee on financial services the gentleman from ohio mr oxley xz4003070 who holds jurisdiction over this legislation even requested during his committee on rules testimony last night a more open process for debate on this bill and i thank the chairman for those comments
i would also like to take a moment to specifically thank and welcome our new committee on rules ranking member my friend and colleague the gentlewoman from new york ms slaughter xz4003780 who will serve as a true and tireless fighter for democrats and our rights in the minority on the committee on rules over the next 2 years
mr chairman the bill we are debating today hr 54 the congressional gold medal enhancement act of 2005 while introduced in the previous congress was never debated in committee because no hearings were convened and no markup was held
in my view we are rushing to act on an issue that does not represent a problem
in the last several congresses congressional gold medals have been considered in the house under a wellestablished and a bipartisan process that works well
regular order for consideration of gold medals involves the need under the rules of the committee on financial services to gain the cosponsorship of twothirds of the house before the legislation is considered in committee a full twothirds sponsorship of the house before it is considered in committee
the bar for consideration for gold medals is set relatively high for a reason gaining a twothirds cosponsorship ensures that a solid bipartisan majority of the house is in full support of honoring a particularly noteworthy individual or individuals
this is especially key as in the 108th congress we awarded five congressional gold medals
dorothy height president of the national council of negro women jackie robinson the first black player in major league baseball the reverend dr
martin luther king posthumously and his widow coretta scott king the civil rights icons and the posthumous awarding to reverend joseph a delaine harry and eliza briggs and levi pearson the leaders in our nation s efforts to desegregate public schools that led directly to the case brown et al
while i tend to agree with the notion that distributing what is an exceptional honor to too many individuals could devalue the symbolic worth of a gold medal there are occasions when more than one person is justified to receive the medal for their honorable actions in tandem with others
in the last congress we enacted into law legislation awarding the congressional gold medal posthumously as i mentioned before to reverend joseph a delaine harry and eliza briggs and levi pearson in recognition of their contributions to the nation as pioneers in the effort to desegregate public schools that led directly to the landmark desegregation case of brown v the board of ed
in previous congresses the house has awarded gold medals to other groups such as native american code talkers who were critical to the safety of allied communications during world war ii to the little rock nine the civil rights pioneers who led to the integration of our public schools and to ronald and nancy reagan in honor of their contribution to our country
for example my good friend and republican colleague the gentleman from new york mr king xz4002202 offered an amendment in the previous congress which the house passed to honor the officers emergency workers and other employees of the federal government and any state or local government including any interstate governmental entity who responded to the attacks on the world trade center in new york city and who perished in that attack on september 11 with a congressional gold medal
again while i urge my colleagues to support my two amendments that were made in order i am dismayed that this third amendment was not made in order
i feel this is a serious oversight in the base of this bill
that was not passed in the committee on rules and therefore we are here today working a bill that does not have that provision in it
in listening to the sponsor in terms of the need for this legislation one could intimate by the introduction that possibly medals were given out in a haphazard manner
i mentioned before it takes twothirds of the members of the house the entire body to introduce a gold medal for its consideration in the committee on financial services a bar that i believe is a very very high bar and one that is not easily attained
harry and eliza briggs levi pearson and reverend joseph armstrong delaine were all issued the medal in one provision
who that received this medal in the past was not worthy of it
martin luther king and coretta scott king was it reverend delaine harry and eliza briggs and levi pearson was it jackie robinson was it dorothy height tony blair in the last congress
in the 106th congress was it nancy reagan was it pope john paul ii was it charles schulz the great cartoonist
therein lies the flaw in this bill
mr chairman would it be safe to say under regular order if this legislation were passed that the code talkers under regular order and that was an extraordinary provision made in the appropriations process under regular order would they be eligible to receive this medal in the future if this bill were to pass
that would preclude them from getting this medal in the future
i recognize that the first person who received this medal was general george washington prior to him becoming president of the united states when the country was brand new when we did not have the richness of diversity and of events that have taken place throughout the history of our country ever since this first medal was given to george washington that we have grown as a nation in size and in stature and that there have been many events that have occurred throughout our history since the striking of the first medal that have inured greatly to the advancement of our country that from time to time need to be recognized
but certainly we have grown in size both in states from thirteen colonies and states to 50 states and the number of people in this country have grown incredibly since the founding of this nation and the events that have occurred throughout our history has certainly changed the shape of the distribution of this medal as well
the reality is though a country of 300 million people only 20 medals have been awarded in the past decade
this is not done as i mentioned before in a willynilly manner
i do understand the difficulties in that but i hope the gentleman understands the appreciation that has been set forth by my testimony here today as well as my good friend from texas ms jacksonlee xz4001990 that sometimes not ofttimes it is not just individuals but it is groups who are responsible for incredible incredible events in this country and i believe are deserving of the congressional gold medal
i know that one of the amendments your side has accepted or that was accepted in the rules committee it remains to be seen whether it passes or not that would evenly divide the number of gold medals that did not exist in the coin bill that passed
in terms of bipartisanship it has not been very bipartisan in terms of coins that have been established
that is also i think some of the fear in terms of changing the rules for lack of a better word on the gold medal has stirred up consternation on our side of the aisle
i just do not think that we should be limiting ourselves as the house of representatives and as a congress in reducing our leverage or our ability to honor groups of individuals who have done incredible incredible works on behalf of this nation
i think that is what that provision of the bill will actually end up doing is limiting tying our hands from honoring groups in the form of the congressional gold medal
that is why i stand in opposition to that
he had concerns that the bill in its current form would make members hesitate before introducing their own congressional gold medal bills until late in the first year waiting to see if others had more noteworthy recipients then late in the first year rushing to introduce i too share some of those concerns and believe we can address this by passing this amendment
finally this amendment is needed in the most practical purpose yet
in the last congress we awarded five congressional gold medals
dorothy height president of the national council of negro women jackie robinson the first black player in major league baseball reverend dr
martin luther king jr posthumously and his wife coretta scott king the civil rights icons and posthumously awarded to the reverend joseph a delaine harry and eliza briggs and levi pearson the leaders in our nation s efforts to desegregate public schools that led directly to the case of brown versus the board of ed
additionally we granted six medals in the 106th congress and six in the 105th congress
in the 106th congress we passed into law three democratic sponsored bills and three republican sponsored bills
and in the 105th congress two democratic sponsored bills and four republican sponsored bills for medals became law
in fact the existing committee on financial services rule requiring twothirds cosponsorship of the house for a gold medal which by definition represents broadbased bipartisan support prevents the awarding of frivolous and undeserved medals to groups of individuals
i trust that twothirds of the house represents a solid bipartisan consensus of the will of the house and therefore believe that this acts as a check on any effort to award medals to any groups of individuals who in the opinion of the house do not deserve such award
i think it is a reasonable amendment one that i do not think in any way disrupts what the intention of the bill by the gentleman from delaware mr castle xz4000700 the sponsor is that is to limit the number
we certainly are limiting the number in this amendment to six as opposed to what the gentleman from delaware mr castle xz4000700 would do per calendar year which would be four
i think in the most recent history we have not done more than six within a congress
i would just like to point out again that the founding fathers in their wisdom did not have as many people that they had to honor during that time
i hope that some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle though do recognize that not only are there compelling arguments that they are reasonable and that it is a reasonable amendment and therefore deserves to be voted in favor of
my second amendment made in order under the rule would allow for the equitable distribution of these medals between the majority and the minority
using the process currently in place that has worked so well for us the two parties in the house have evenly split sponsorship of these medals
in fact this amendment probably makes more sense with republican support in it than democrats as in the 108th congress five congressional medals were awarded and four of those were sponsored by democrats only one by a republican
i therefore believe if we are to limit the number of gold medals and if we are to obtain the bipartisanship that has characterized the process my amendment should be passed by the chamber my fear being that if we limit it to only four then leadership will decide who will sponsor those four and we in the minority may find ourselves on the short end of that stick
just to add that yes we do work in a very bipartisan way
if the chairman and i were making decisions as to who would receive the gold medal i think we would work it out amongst ourselves to make sure that it was done in a very bipartisan way
that unfortunately has not been the history of the house and i just point out for instance as i mentioned earlier back when we created the commemorative coin legislation in 1999 out of the 16 coins that have been created 15 have been introduced by republican members only one by the minority
i do not think that is a very fair and balanced way in which we can collectively and bipartisanly recognize those who have made tremendous sacrifices or achievements or contributed to this country
and i believe that we are limiting it to in this case this legislation if passed the way it does four congressional gold medals that we in the minority may very well find ourselves in a very difficult position in that we may not have any of our honorees awarded the medal even though we go through the process of collecting the twothirds
it then becomes a political decision as to which honorees will get the gold medal in that particular year and which will not
i do not think it is unreasonable to ask that it is done in this way
that is the spirit in which i think we can work in a bipartisan way to ensure that every person who receives this gold medal besides getting a twothirds vote it is done in a bipartisan way
i know that the gentleman does not approach this in any other fashion but a bipartisan fashion
as the gentleman mentioned before this is not done in a very quick fashion
this is done in a bipartisan way
but when we limit it to two per year we are putting a cap on it i think we can in the future find ourselves in a situation where all right maybe five on each side is a little much maybe two on each side
unfortunately i think you are creating more politics in this bill
that is what i am trying to in a sense avoid by evenly dividing between democrat and republican majority minority the ability for both sides to equally participate in this process
unfortunately i think that in the past there may have been some politics involved
i understand that one of my colleagues on this side had achieved the requisite number of signatures for a commemorative gold medal for the columbia 107 in the last congress in the middle of the last congress and that was never awarded
i do not know if there was any reason for that when the requisite number of signatures were given that that bill was not taken up in the committee and that member was not successful in getting that award to the columbia 107
it is the pay grade issue i am concerned about as the gentleman mentioned as to who makes these decisions and as to why some individuals are successful in garnering a gold medal for an individual or group and maybe another is not
that is a nuance to work through as well in terms of working in a bipartisan way
this simply ensures that both republicans and democrats are working in a bipartisan way beyond the twothirds vote that medals are not being used for political purposes but are being given because the individuals deserve them
yes i am opposed to the bill in its current form
mr speaker today we begin the 109th congress in earnest and we do so by considering a bill that we do not need to act on for a problem that in our view and in the view of many of my colleagues simply does not exist
we considered this bill today not in the spirit of openness and bipartisanship that should categorize the democratic debate in the house but with a restrictive rule that did not allow us to have a debate on a key issue whether one of the highest honors that can be bestowed upon citizens of our country for their extraordinary deeds a congressional gold medal can be awarded to one individual or more for their collective honorable or heroic actions
mr speaker if this bill passes in its current form not only would it limit medals to two per year but it would prevent the house of representatives and the senate from awarding medals in the future to any group of individuals for their collective heroic deeds such as those of the hundreds of first responders that perished in the 911 terrorist attacks
and i am even more puzzled that we would fix a process that is not broken that is bipartisan in nature and that works remarkably well for all members
the bipartisan process we have in place has allowed us to honor the reverend martin luther king and coretta scott king nancy and ronald reagan betty and gerald ford pope john paul ii the little rock nine the leaders of brown v the board of education jackie robinson civil rights leader dorothy height the navajo code talkers general henry shelton charles schulz john cardinal oconnor archbishop of new york father theodore hesburgh rosa parks nelson mandela mother teresa frank sinatra ruth and billy graham ecumenical patriarch bartholomew british prime minister tony blair and others
in the 108th congress the gentlewoman from texas worked hard to gain the requisite twothirds cosponsorship of the house for a bill that would honor these fallen american heroes posthumously with the congressional gold medal
since the majority party gained control of this house in 1995 20 gold medals have been enacted into law either to an individual or a group of individuals
using the process we currently have in place 10 gold medal bills out of 20 were sponsored by republican members and 10 were sponsored by democratic members
unfortunately the bipartisan spirit that has characterized the house s consideration of gold medals in the past has not carried over to the debate on this bill
not only did we do not have an open rule but today represents the first time this house is debating this issue in any form
the limited debate over this bill on the house floor may culminate in the passing of a bad bill unless my colleagues join me in voting in favor of sending this bill back to committee where we can have a meaningful debate and where we can determine whether limiting gold medals is truly in the interest of the public and in the interest of the house
does this action foretell what lies ahead in terms of the existence of bipartisanship throughout this congress
i urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to do the right thing to vote in favor of my motion to recommit this bill back to the committee on financial services and to allow this house to take a closer look at this legislation to determine whether it really meets the interests of the american people
we have heard new commitments to work across party lines and calls for civility and camaraderie in the halls of the capitol
the rhetoric starts reality sets in
it is the first day of normal legislative business in the 109th congress and the house is already considering a restrictive rule for a bill that has not gone through proper house procedures
they just spent a week in a refresher course on how a bill becomes a law
the proponents of the underlying legislation will try to argue that it is not a new bill because it was first introduced in the 108th congress
while that might be true the committee on financial services did not act on the bill in the 108th congress and it has not acted on it in this year
think about it this way the first bill that the house is considering in the 109th congress under normal rules actually makes it harder to pass legislation and create laws honoring our country s greatest heroes
as the gentleman from texas already noted the rule does make in order two amendments offered by my good friend the gentleman from new york mr crowley xz4000870
while i intend to support both of these amendments and certainly appreciate them being made in order the committee on rules failed to make in order a third crowley amendment which would have maintained the status quo
can anyone in this body honestly suggest that the individuals aforementioned and organizations are unworthy of this institution s top award
is there an epidemic of distributing too many congressional medals of honor to unworthy recipients that somehow or another has escaped at least me in knowing about them
on the contrary if today is any indication perhaps we ought to be just a bit more concerned about the integrity of procedure in the house of representatives than about the integrity of a system that is dependent upon bipartisan cooperation
it is interesting that this legislation would come without going to the full committee in this session to be able to have the oversight of the committee structure and then to be reminded of the fact that we took great joy and pleasure in honoring both president reagan and mrs reagan dr
king and mrs king and of course legislation that i proposed to acknowledge the columbia seven that tragically lost their lives on our behalf as astronauts and heroes in space
it speaks to denial and it denies the congress its authoritative right to make decisions on who has represented america in the most honorable way to deserve a congressional gold medal
i agree as well that the committee on financial services has put in place a very effective very effective oversight of this process
let me thank the gentleman from new york mr crowley xz4000870 for his insight in his amendments that would expand the numbers for the congressional session and also bifurcate or equalize the numbers for each party
i too believe that there should be restraint in judgment but i believe as well that america has her heroes and sheroes and who are we in 2005 to predict what might happen in 2010 or 2015 or 2020 where there may be a multitude of heroes who americans believe are deserving of this worthy award
i would ask my colleagues to reconsider this legislation and most specifically because it violated if you will the precise rules that we adhere to oversight by committees the committee on rules involvement in an open rule and the bipartisan spirit in which we honor our heroes and sheroes whether dead or alive
despite my disappointment and dismay at not only the criteria of this rule but the nature of the underlying legislation i am pleased that two amendments offered by my colleague from new york mr crowley were made in order
let me make it perfectly clear despite all of the accolades that we have spoken today if this legislation were in place president reagan and mrs reagan would not receive the congressional gold medal neither would dr
king and mrs coretta scott king neither would the indian code talkers who helped save thousands of lives in world war ii
i think that is the crux of this debate not whether or not we have restrictions or nonrestrictions because i believe it is a given that the committee on financial services has done a commendable job in its oversight
as i look back on the numbers in the last four congresses how interesting it is and the good sense of the crowley amendment because those that have been passed by this body only equal to five or six credible rational and reasonable reasoning for awarding for example those who were intimately involved in brown v board of education that changed the lives of millions of americans and today even is a standard for equal education in america
i do not take this as any kind of personal act by my republican friends but i do think it is a misstep in judgment and that we would have benefited from a more bipartisan overview review of this legislation
so this narrow or narrowing or this interpretation of one hero when there may be an adequate partnering that may be important that would symbolize the greatness and goodness of america puzzles me and in fact disturbs me
but once we debated and found out the facts we knew that they were in fact heroes and sheroes
all of us come in our course of life to meet people in our districts and around the country where we claim that we want to bring them to the attention of the american people not frivolously but after we have looked at the history we know they are truly worthy of a congressional gold medal
mr chairman in support of the gentleman s two amendments i am querying as to the amendment offered which would really balance this legislation which would speak to protect president reagan and dr
that would have been reflective of members having an opportunity in their wisdom to present their case before the united states congress and the committee on financial services
that would have been in respect to president and mrs reagan dr
i ask my colleagues to vote against this legislation allow us to work in a bipartisan manner and do not take away from those as yet unrecognized the honor of a congressional gold medal
mr chairman i rise in opposition to the bill before the committee of the whole because it is unreasonably restrictive
its passage will result in the preclusion of our ability to pay tribute to americans in the most respectful manner
section 2 paragraph e 2 a of hr 54 would limit the striking of a congressional gold medal to only an individual such unreasonably restrictive legislation would preclude the bestowal of this award collectively to the 9 students who voluntarily subjected themselves to racial bigotry during the integration of central high school in little rock arkansas otherwise known as the little rock nine similarly under this restrictive provision the secretary of the treasury can not lawfully strike a congressional gold medal to honor former president ronald reagan and his wife nancy reagan in recognition of their services to america or to honor former president jimmy carter and his wife rosalynn carter
today i rise in support of hr 54 the congressional gold medal enhancement act of 2005 authored by the gentleman from delaware mr castle xz4000700 and urge its immediate passage
recipients have included civil rights leaders cultural icons and leaders in science
those reforms have been successful but denied the opportunity to enact numerous commemorative coin programs congress increasingly has turned to the gold medal program and we now find ourselves in a situation of having fewer honorees for commemorative coins than we do from gold medals
by comparison in the first 123 years of the gold medal only 45 people were so honored
mr chairman let me close by first indicating to the gentleman from new york mr crowley xz4000870 that the gentleman from delaware mr castle xz4000700 as well as myself acknowledge that the folks who received the medal in the past were most deserving
i would point out in fact that the medal that was awarded for example to ronald and nancy reagan was one medal and the same thing with dr
i guess perhaps what i found in studying this perhaps the most egregious example of going beyond what the initial scope of the medal was was in the 106th congress where we awarded five medal bills one of them was for the navajo code talkers which did not go in regular order
mr chairman let me point out in the case of the navajo code talkers there were other tribes also that had code talkers not just the navajo
again the issue is where do we start and where do we finish in this area
the gentleman from delaware mr castle xz4000700 pointed out correctly historically the gold medal was given out quite rarely 45 in 123 years to individuals
the change ironically was brought about with the change in the commemorative coin program that did in fact move the congress to adopting more gold medals
it is somewhat ironic that after the reforms that were made by the gentleman from delaware where we tightened the restrictions on commemorative coins and for good reason that we then had this increase in the gold medal
i think that the reforms in the past and the ones that the gentleman from delaware is now propounding in this bill makes excellent sense
that is precisely what the gentleman from delaware proposes in this legislation
let me in closing mr chairman indicate first of all my respect for the members who have undertaken the responsibility of going out and getting 290 signatures
every time you walk over or ride over for a vote every time you see a member in the dining room wherever it may be you are getting their support
i think the gentleman from delaware was right in raising that bar to where it is now because it really does focus one s attention on how difficult that process is
the legislation before us i think does restore the medal to what it was envisioned to be way back in 1776
the change will be made so that uniform guidelines governing the medal program will be in effect for the whole 109th congress and beyond and not change in the middle of the congress
if we were to pass the bill but leave the effective date until the end of the session there would be a land rush to enact bills on gold medals that would place members in an awkward position
the amendment offered by the gentleman from new york is really in many ways contrary to the reforms that are already enacted led by the gentleman from delaware and the one that is now before us
the institution of twothirds of the members was very important and the reforms in the commemorative coin reform act which was adopted almost 10 years ago instituted a twocoinperyear maximum
the reforms in that program have worked perfectly
congress has not passed more than two programs for issue in any year since the law passed in 1996
one year in 2003 only one coin was issued
so it seems to me a natural progression in the reform process
clearly if there is a bipartisan element to this whole idea of getting twothirds of the people supporting it it is the congressional gold medal and i think the gentleman somewhat undercuts his own argument by giving us the figures that he did because in fact i do not think most members when they are approached by a member carrying that bill really are concerned about whether it is a republican sponsor or a democrat sponsor
mr chairman to close and again in opposition i think it is unfortunate and really not necessary to put republicandemocrat in the statute
but at the same time that is how it works and to encase republican and democrat in the statute i think at this time would certainly not be in the best interests of the process and that is why i continue to oppose my friend s amendment
mr speaker i rise in opposition to the motion to recommit
in the first 123 years of the existence of our country only 45 medals were given out all of them to individuals
since that time we have had a tenfold increase in the next subsequent 100 years
there is bipartisanship in the existing system because it involves 290 cosponsors so everybody gets an opportunity to weigh in on the importance of the medal
so the gentleman from delaware needs to be congratulated on forwardlooking reforms just as he did in the commemorative coin program
let us go back to what the original intent of the founding fathers was in this gold medal
it provides that the bill shall be considered as read for the purpose of amendment and makes in order only those amendments printed in the committee on rules report accompanying this resolution
it provides that the amendments made in order may be offered only in the order printed in the report may be offered only by a member designated in the report shall be considered as read shall be debatable for the time specified in the report equally divided and controlled by the proponent and an opponent
mr speaker hr 54 will improve the congressional gold medal program by limiting the number of medals awarded by congress to no more than two in any calendar year
the proud tradition of this unique honor began when the first congressional gold medal was authorized in 1776 and presented to george washington in 1790
frederick rose an assistant surgeon in the british navy with a medal for the kindness that he showed to sick american naval personnel
in the last 100 years congress has awarded almost twice as many 86 medals including 20 in the past decade alone
in the 1990s congress faced this same problem of proliferation within the commemorative coins program which has grown out of control and was costing taxpayers far more than ever envisioned when that program began
in order to maintain sound fiscal discipline and the prestige of the congressional gold medal program we are here today to approve the commonsense reforms by the gentleman from delaware mr castle xz4000700 our chairman and supported by the committee on financial services chairman the gentleman from ohio mr oxley xz4003070
many of these reforms simply codify what is already an existing practice in the house committee on financial services and the senate banking committee
mr speaker i rise in support of h con
we have required here in congress at universities that receive federal dollars to extend access to military recruiters equal to other outside groups
but in the name of free speech and association some schools seek to deny their students access to recruiters and rotc obviously afraid that their students would maybe even make a wrong choice
it is further ironic that those who are often noted for concern that lowincome americans are serving in disproportionate numbers in the armed forces would block many of their students born with a silver spoon access to rotc
my own son currently serves in iraq
he graduated near the top of his class from the us naval academy and last sunday he had the satisfaction of witnessing the birth of freedom in a land where for 50 years freedom has been an exotic concept
mr speaker i rise today in opposition to this resolution
in wisconsin our state laws provide protections from discrimination to people that go beyond what many other states and what the federal government have put into law
such protections as nondiscrimination based on age gender marital status membership in the national guard and sexual orientation are a part of wisconsin s nondiscrimination laws
wisconsin has chosen to provide its citizens with these greater protections because we have decided that these are in the best interests of our citizens and are good public policy
the university of wisconsin in madison has a history as a leader in social justice
yet federal law has intervened to block enforcement of campus policy and state law in regard to military recruiters
the solomon amendment was passed by a previous congress because students like those at the university of wisconsin were having success in blocking recruiters from campus if they discriminate against lesbians or gays or bisexuals in violation of state law and campus policy
i believe that the court made the correct decision in invalidating the solomon amendment
in fact i believe that today s debate is the wrong debate
mr speaker when will we have the debate about the harm caused by excluding so many qualified skilled americans from serving in our military simply because they are gay or lesbian
the resolution before us today makes vague reference to the costs to the military in having to arrange alternative recruitment strategies to meet its goals but it does not mention the significant cost of do nt ask do nt tell to our defense budget and to our national security
since do nt ask do nt tell took effect in 1993 approximately 10 000 military personnel have been discharged
in a study of discharges between 1998 and 2003 university of santa barbara researchers found that of 6 273 discharges many were in critical specialties such as 88 linguists including many arabic speakers 49 wmd experts 90 nuclear power engineers and 150 rocket and missile specialists
urging the administration to try to reinstate the solomon amendment will in no way make our country safer
i strongly support our men and women in uniform
i want to take this opportunity to honor the men and women in our armed forces who have served and continue to serve in iraq and to the many serving our country here and around the world
their efforts allowed the iraqi people to vote in a free election this week
mr speaker there would be no clamor for a solomon amendment if we simply allowed all qualified americans to serve their country in uniform
mr speaker today i rise in strong support of this resolution which shows our nation s unwavering commitment to both higher education and providing a strong national defense
at no time in recent memory has our country placed more responsibility on the shoulders of our men and women in uniform
we are fighting a war on terrorism on multiple fronts in afghanistan and iraq
and it is essential that if we are to be victorious in defending our freedom and protecting our homeland that we promote military service as an option to college students across the united states
now in this resolution we are reiterating the choices given to institutions of higher education
the solomon act originally passed in 1995 grants the secretary of defense power to deny federal funding to institutions of higher learning if they prohibit military recruitment on campus
if we deny armed forces recruiters the opportunity to actively recruit in schools we not only disrespect the sacrifices of military men and women who have made our freedom possible we also rob our students of the valuable opportunities that military service can be to our nation and what they can help provide
there is no reason not to allow the nation s armed services to make their best case to college students and to do so in the same manner as private sector employers that colleges and universities seem to relish having on campus
denial of access and equality to military recruiters by colleges that receive federal funds is an insult to the taxpayers who help subsidize higher education in this country
successful recruitment of the best officers in our military relies heavily on our military recruiters access to the best and the brightest
and it seems a bit disingenuous for the elite institutions of higher education such as harvard yale stanford georgetown and new york university to condemn the lack of the wealthy and privileged in the ranks of our military while these schools deny their students the option of even hearing about a career in our united states military
mr speaker i rise in full support of this resolution and urge my colleagues to support its passage
what is happening on some college campuses is deja vu for those of us who attended colleges in the 1960s and the 1970s
in denying military recruiters equal access to campuses such as harvard law school college administrators violate the most basic principles of the right to associate and free speech they so profess is precious
the following quote is from a student typical of the attitude of many of these ivory bastions the day my political science department hires a republican and i am allowed to sit in a class without a number of snickers jeers andor dirty looks when president bush s name is even mentioned is the day i will admit there is progress on today s campus mr speaker congress did not ask for special access for military recruiters
mr speaker once again activist judges have clearly overstepped their authority and it is time for the administration to stand and say that the us court of appeals for the third circuit was wrong in their ruling and please seek an appeal
mr speaker this concurrent resolution is an important first step in addressing a misguided ruling by the third circuit court of appeals regarding access of military recruiters to institutions of higher education
during this time of conflict and the global war on terror it is more important than ever to maintain the ability to recruit quality men and women for service in our military
military recruiters need the same access to college campuses provided to other potential employers and students deserve the right to discuss the option of a career in the united states military with the representatives of the armed forces
this decision couched in the language of civil rights fails to recognize the underlying inequity behind these university policies
this decision asserts the congress has compelled speech by these universities to the effect that they agree with the military s do nt ask do nt tell policy with respect to homosexuals in the service
this is an issue that the house and senate have revisited and affirmed in bipartisan votes in 1995 1996 1999 and 2002 after the enactment of the original solomon amendment
some educators now believe that they should be allowed to discriminate against students who wish to enter the military in order to please another group of students who object to the policies and procedures of the armed services all the while soliciting and accepting federal funds for their institutions
while i certainly respect his concerns i would like to point out that the measure in question had been on our web site for 4 days and was not suddenly introduced yesterday
let me make one other point if i may mr speaker in reference to the access of the military to college campuses
the appropriate place to protest the policy frankly is in the political arena
this is not a policy in the department of defense per se
we should not put that burden on recruiters in the military and subject them to difficult circumstances when they are carrying out important work for our country
mr speaker i yield myself such time as i may consume and in closing i would like to say i think we have had a good and substantive debate today but let us be clear the concurrent resolution is really about ensuring those who defend our freedom and liberty the ability to have the same access to colleges and universities that is available for everyone else
mr speaker often today others have placed this debate in the context of the do nt ask do nt tell policy
this was president clinton s policy and one enshrined in law that can only be changed by congress
to put it in the context of the solomon amendment i believe is disingenuous and dangerous to our recruiting efforts
mr speaker issues like this one first brought to our attention with a passion and eloquence only possible in a man like jerry solomon provide our democracy a valuable service they cut through the fog of spin and force us to tell the american people exactly where we stand
such policies are obnoxious in times of peace but they are simply intolerable in times of war and the equal access of our military recruiters to federally funded colleges and universities must be protected
it s about them not liking the military or the values our men and women in uniform represent
the least they could offer in return is a booth in the field house on career day
of course men and women who have dodged bullets and held dying comrades in their arms do nt take seriously people who live by the glib professional code publish or perish but those elite campuses who claim to educate our nation s best and brightest who claim to train our leaders of the future how can we possibly not allow military recruiters to have the right to talk to such students
what profession if any in our entire society needs the opportunity to recruit the sharpest and broadest minds of every generation more than our armed forces
america in the future no doubt will need its brilliant businessmen and lawyers and poets but what good can such genius do without brilliant admirals and generals to protect them
mr speaker i rise in opposition to this resolution
what this resolution does is sort of breaks this feeling in america that democracy allows divergence of opinion and that the people that own the real estate should have a voice in who can visit that real estate
we and the faculty and the trustees of a university ought to be able to decide who can visit our campus as they do in all other things
for example here in washington dc catholic university does not allow proabortionist recruiters to come and talk on the campus and here you are going to require regardless of what the issue should be that military recruiters have to be allowed on campus
i think the military has historically stood on its own feet to do very well in recruiting without getting congress involved mandating that they have to be on campuses
i would urge congress very carefully to think about this and to vote no until we get a better thought on how we want to mandate democracy in this country
mr speaker i come to the floor today in strong opposition to h con
these nondiscrimination policies were created so that all people in our country have the opportunity to be an equal and respected member of higher education communities
for example numerous military linguists who are critically needed in the global war on terrorism have been discharged under do nt ask do nt tell
mr speaker i am wondering based on that argument in the interest of efficiency whether we might not substitute chat rooms for the floor of the house and if being on the web site is a satisfactory way to bring a bill out
but to say that that causes a problem in getting people in the military it is the supporters of a policy that say to ablebodied men and women we disapprove of your sexuality and therefore no matter how talented you are no matter how patriotic you are no matter what skills you bring you are not allowed here
colin powell when he was chairman of the joint chiefs of staff testified before this congress that there was no argument that gay and lesbian men and women in the military were in any way deficient as members of the military
the argument was if you let these people in and he said they had been good soldiers and good airmen and good sailors it would be disruptive
i know there have been people critical of the israeli defense forces in some respects
in the israeli defense forces people serve who are openly gay and lesbian
so the argument that somehow allowing people who are honest about their sexuality if they are gay or lesbian to serve in the military makes you an ineffectual military how do they explain the israeli defense forces
in fact what we are again being told is that good people able people and we heard reference to the linguists
you are the ones who have driven thousands literally thousands of perfectly capable men and women out of the military because you disapprove of what they do in their spare time
disdain because people in these positions feel that their students should not be unduly stigmatized and denied this opportunity
if it is so important to have the opportunity mr speaker should not people on the other side say you can not deny these young people the opportunity to serve in the military
should you not say you should not deny these young people the opportunity to serve in the military unless they are gay or lesbian
because if they are gay or lesbian you want to deny them the opportunity to serve in the military regardless of any fault
and then we will complain because we do not have enough people to serve in the military
i would say to members one rule in parliamentary debate try to avoid saying something that no one will believe
but what they are saying is we are not going to allow our facilities to be used in this discriminatory way
the key issue here is this have we not in this country come to the point where patriotic young gay men and lesbians who are prepared to serve their country will at least be given a chance
mr speaker i thank the gentleman for yielding me this time and today i rise in strong support of the solomon amendment and as a proud cosponsor of the resolution that is before us
in conclusion mr speaker i strongly support this resolution
mr speaker i thank the gentleman for yielding me this time and for the distinguished way in which he has conducted the debate and also the gentleman from alabama mr rogers xz4003411 for sponsoring this resolution
and we could substitute another protest issue for them in this thing and it would not make a bit of difference
these are the same people who in many cases had protests in favor of the viet cong during the vietnam war
many of them protested our involvement in el salvador protested our bringing democracy to nicaragua protested our participation in the first desert storm in the early 1990s and in this recent bringing of freedom to iraq
there certainly is no lack of understanding and appreciation for the united states military particularly in the backdrop of free elections in iraq this past sunday
so mr speaker this is not a debate if you will about the value of the military or in fact the necessity of giving them a far reach in their recruitment efforts in america
having just sent 3 000 national guard and reservists troops about a month ago from their families over to iraq and afghanistan we know full well the importance of the military but more importantly the sacrifice that our men and women make in the united states in serving in the military
i am disappointed that in 2005 it was reported that between 1998 and 2004 the military discharged 20 arabic and six farsi language speakers under the donotaskanddonottell policy
do my colleagues believe that americans would rise in support of discrimination
it seems in 2005 in the shadow of reauthorization of the voters rights act of 1965 that we might not now recognize that we can do better
in fact we know that there are more than 52 000 now enrolled in rotc programs up from 48 000 in 2000
in fact the defense department has reported meeting all of its recruitment and retention goals in the past several years and is in fact actively downsizing certain specialties
but in the backdrop of that we also know that we need more troops particularly if we are going to be part of a peacekeeping effort not a runningthegovernment effort in iraq
mr speaker i rise in support of our armed forces and in support of this nation s continued efforts to give it the additional strength and stability it needs to keep our men and women safe
the members of this house have joined their constituents in mourning the loss of life and injuries sustained in the course of america s war and subsequent occupation of iraq for two years
since the beginning of the iraq war in march 2003 1 423 members of the us military have died which includes 1 084 as a result of hostile action and 333 of nonhostile causes
furthermore my district of houston has experienced two deaths already since january six deaths in 2004 five in 2003 and numerous injuries over the course of the nation s engagement
in the spirit of achieving the goal of attracting the best and brightest candidates for service i join my colleague from california in advocating this legislation
however we must support our troops in accordance with the us constitution and with respect for civil rights and fundamental freedoms that are the rubric of this nation
the holding in forum for academic and institutional rights v rumsfeld tells us that we must be very careful in the way we regulate society so as not to violate fundamental rights
so mr speaker i do support the intent of this legislation because i honor the men and women who serve in our armed services and who sacrifice their lives for us
i want to speak certainly in favor of the solomon amendment and remind my colleagues that it does not apply to institutions of higher education that have had a longstanding practice of pacificism based on historic religious grounds and it exempts federal student financial assistance from termination
but what it does do is allow students to look at career opportunities in the army
and as the chairman of the committee on armed services said there are so many legal issues involved in the military today and to go beyond that to let people look at careers in i would say intelligence as much as anything homeland security there is a great opportunity for students to go into
indeed there are so many prejudices against everyday middleclass values on college campuses and serving in the military and being proamerican just seems to be one of them
students at wells college for example were ridiculed by their professors if they supported the war in iraq
at the university of richmond a professor called president bush a moron in his class
another statistic the foundation for individual rights in education found that over 90 percent of wellknown college campuses have speech codes intended to ban or punish politically incorrect almost always conservative speech and that campus funds are unequally distributed to leftwing groups as opposed to conservative groups by a ratio of 50 to one
and so i would submit for the record an article that was an opinion in the wall street journal recently and then something on the academic bill of rights that i think also touches into this same subject
the bill would express the continued support of congress for the socalled solomon law in title 10 us code which improves dod s ability to establish and maintain rotc detachments and to ensure military recruiters have access to college campuses and students that is at least equal in quality and scope to that provided to other employers
enacted first in 1994 and added to by congress in 1996 1999 and 2002 and 2004 the solomon law prohibits some defenserelated and other federal funding from going to colleges and universities that prevent rotc access or military recruiting on campus
res 36 in expressing continued support for equal access of military recruiters to institutions of higher education makes the following points regarding the solomon law under article i section 8 of the constitution congress exclusively has the power to raise and support armies provide and maintain a navy and make rules for the government and regulation of the armed forces
any reduction in the performance by the armed forces amidst the present national emergency declared by the president on september 14 2001 operates against the national interest
the constitution gives congress the power to regulate spending and in that role congress has chosen over time to appropriate funds for a variety of government programs to be provided to institutions of higher learning
the solomon law is a legislative safeguard that links federal funding of educational institutions to the willingness of those institutions to abide by a rule of access by military recruiters to campuses and students that is at least equal in quality and scope that is provided to any other employer
for the last several years a growing number of university law schools and colleges of law have treated military recruiters in ways significantly different from the recruiters of other employers
can still dominate in academic fields even while their views have been discredited numbers of liberal professors vs
not a single department at a single one of the 32 schools managed to achieve a reasonable parity between the two main political parties in the nation at large registered democrats and republicans are roughly equal in number
in the entire ivy league there were only 3 republican administrators identified
university of richmond professor called president bush a moron in the classroom
university of missouri in columbia professor offered extra credit to protest a speech by david horowitz
many students conceal what they actually think in order to protect their academic standing a reality clearly at odds with the educational mission of the university
campus guests speech police and commencement speakers campus funds are unequally distributed to leftwing student groups as opposed to groups with conservative agendas by a ratio close to 50 1 these student groups are many times in charge of hiring campus speakers
the foundation for individual rights in education found that over 90 percent of wellknown college campuses have speech codes intended to ban and punish politically incorrect almost always conservative speech
twentytwo of the thirtytwo schools surveyed did not have a single republican or conservative commencement speaker in the entire ten years surveyed six of the remaining schools invited only one republican or conservative each as compared to 38 liberals or democrats
designed to take politics out of the university curriculum does not call for more classics in curriculum reading lists should provide students with dissenting viewpoints so they may form their own opinions
unequal funding of student organizations which host guest speakers is unacceptable calls for pluralism in selection of guest speakers
it is not our intention to suggest that there should be quotas based on party affiliation in the hiring process at universities we support removing all politics and political affiliation from the hiring process it is our purpose to point out the gross imbalance of liberal vs
while nearly all university administrations devote extraordinary resources to defend the principle of diversity in regard to race and gender none can be said to have shown interest in the diversity of ideas
having no desire to crash our email server we ll save discussion of gays in the military for another day
rather today s subject is lawyers in the military
surely americans of all points of view can agree that in an age of guantanamo and abu ghraib the military can use the best attorneys it can get
needless to say such scholastic shenanigans do nt go down well with congress which in 1994 passed the solomon amendment named for the late new york republican gerald solomon
the impetus for mr rogers s move is a november ruling by the federal appeals court in philadelphia in favor of a group of law schools and legal scholars that had contested the solomon law
some of the participants new york university and georgetown for example have outed themselves since the suit was brought in 2003 but others steadfastly maintain their own dontaskdonttell policy
in any event there should be no legal question about congress s right to put conditions on grants of federal funds to universities
almost all universities public and private take millions of dollars in federal money that would be next to impossible to give up
in closing i would just say that we have heard some discussion today about policies of the united states armed forces for a long time
the discussion today is about keeping our military keeping our armed forces the best trained the best led the best equipped in the world and that means we need the ability to recruit the best and the brightest
the underlying bill house concurrent resolution 36 was introduced yesterday has not gone to committee let alone and be reported out of committee and was being taken up in the committee on rules yesterday just about the time that most members planes were touching down in washington
i know the majority does not like to be reminded that we still have the largest number of exhaustees in over 3 decades but the 109th congress begins still facing this bitter reality and obviously still doing nothing to ease the hardships facing these workers and their families
clearly the republican majority did not feel it necessary to press the president to get his supplemental request to assist the victims in nations affected by the asian tsunami quickly before the house so we are not taking that measure up this week
in fact we are not likely to act on this most urgent matter until march
but a bill exhorting the white house to ignore and overturn proceedings in the federal courts and to press higher education institutions to ignore their own policies prohibiting discrimination well that is a bill that gets top billing in the house of representatives today
mr speaker in the united states of america discrimination is wrong
in the mid90s congress passed legislation to deny defense department funding to colleges and universities that fail to give military recruiters access to their campuses and students
in november 2003 a us district court in new jersey upheld the constitutionality of the solomon law but it also determined that the solomon law does not give the pentagon any basis for asserting as it has in regulations on implementing the solomon law that universities and colleges must give military recruiters the same degree of access to campuses and students provided to other employers
in november 2004 just this past november the us court of appeals for the third circuit overruled part of the new jersey district court s ruling and found the solomon law to be in violation of the constitution
in an appeal brought by a number of schools mainly graduate schools of law the court ruled that colleges and universities had a first amendment right to exclude recruiters whose hiring practices discriminated against homosexuals
mr speaker let me point out another irony in this debate today
the solomon law is about giving the military a special right to discriminate in a way other employers may not
it further encourages the federal government in its pursuit to challenge court rulings that have upheld the first amendment rights of our colleges and universities in their efforts to end prejudice and discrimination
the pentagon has kicked out over 26 military linguists who were fluent in arabic or farsi simply because they were homosexual
that is unconscionable while our military men and women are facing a deadly insurgency in iraq and continued violence in afghanistan
in the past 5 years in the army alone over 3 000 uniformed servicemen and women have been discharged solely because of their sexual orientation
they were munitions experts linguists health care workers infantrymen tank mechanics radio operators and active in every field of military endeavor
make no mistake about it right now gay men and women are in battle in iraq and afghanistan and they have likely died in combat in iraq and afghanistan
according to the wall street journal more than 52 000 college students are enrolled in rotc programs up from 48 000 in 2000
we do not need the bill before us today and we certainly do not need to continue to insult and assault those very institutions of higher education that are leading the way to end hate and discrimination in america
mr speaker i insert in the record at this point two articles
one is an editorial from the new york times entitled the price of homophobia another is an associate press story entitled report number of gay linguists discharged higher than thought the price of homophobia do nt ask do nt tell just scream in frustration it turns out that 20 of the arabic speakers so vitally needed by the nation have been thrown out of the military since 1998 because they were found to be gay
the pentagon s snooping after potential gays trumps what every investigative agency in the war on terror has admitted is a crucial shortage of effective arabic translators
after the first world trade center attack in 1993 government agents revealed an alarming shortage of arabic speakers
key notes videotapes and a phone call pertaining to the attack were later found in a backlog of untranslated investigative data
at the state department a study showed that only one in five of the 279 arabic translators were fluent enough to handle the subtleties of the language with its many regional dialects
between 1998 and 2004 the military discharged 20 arabic and six farsi speakers according to department of defense data obtained by the center for the study of sexual minorities in the military under a freedom of information act request
the military previously confirmed that seven translators who specialized in arabic had been discharged because they were gay
the military s do nt ask do nt tell policy allows gays and lesbians to serve in the military as long as they keep their sexual orientation private and do not engage in homosexual acts
it s appalling that in the weeks leading up to 911 messages were coming in waiting to be translated
and at the same time they were firing people who could ve done that job but others like elaine donnelly of the center for military readiness a conservative advocacy group that opposes gays serving in the military said the discharged linguists never should have been accepted at the elite defense language institute in monterey in the first place
resources unfortunately were used to train young people who were not eligible to be in the military she said
we need to recruit people who are eligible to serve in the fiscal year ended oct
that was up from 377 and 139 respectively in the previous year reflecting the military s increased need for translators in iraq
the government lacked sufficient translators proficient in arabic and other key languages to adequately prepare itself against future strikes the report said
it used to be this was seen as a gay rights issue but now it s clearly a national security issue said nathaniel frank a senior research fellow at the center for study of sexual minorities in the military at the university of california santa barbara
ian finkenbinder a us army arabic linguist who graduated from the defense language institute in 2002 was discharged from the military last month after announcing to his superiors that he s gay
finkenbinder who said his close friends in the army already knew he was gay served eight months in iraq and was about to return for a second tour when he made the revelation official
i looked at myself and said are you willing to go to war with an institution that wo nt recognize that you have the right to live as you want to said finkenbinder 22 who now lives in baltimore md
mr speaker i yield myself such time as i may consume in closing
this congress should be leading the way to end discrimination of any form in this country
mr speaker i rise today in support of equal campus access for our military recruiters
it is in everyone s interest to ensure that young people receive information including military options so they can make informed choices about their future after they finish their education
just because a school disagrees with a career in the military does that give them the right to deny information about that particular career to someone who might want to sign up
how is that in keeping with the first amendment to the constitution
the constitution in article 1 section 8 states that congress shall have the power to raise and support armies provide and maintain a navy and make rules for the government and regulation of the land and naval forces
were the members of the fair not aware that we were at war and that a state of national emergency has existed in this country since september 11 of 2001
the threat to our national security is the policy of the military to refuse to use the talents and the abilities of gay people in defending our country
one of the biggest problems we have in iraq now is the shortage of people who know how to translate intelligence documents written in arabic and farsi and yet they are dismissing linguists who can translate these documents for our use to save the lives of our troops because they are gay
private universities private institutions have chosen to say as part of their free speech that they do not want on their campus recruiters from any organization the military any private company anybody else that discriminates against gay people and lesbian people that engages in an unacceptable to them form of discrimination
for congress to come in and say the court is wrong and the executive should not enforce the order of the court is to show a disdain for the rule of law and a disdain for the spirit of liberty for which we are fighting in iraq and for which our armed forces exists in the first place
mr speaker i rise today in strong support of h con
this resolution expresses the continued support of congress for the socalled solomon law a critical piece of legislation originally passed in 1994 which has helped ensure that military recruiters have equal access on our nation s campuses
in november of last year a closely divided us third circuit court of appeals ruled that the solomon law violates first amendment rights to free speech and association
in our post911 world our nation s military deserves at least the same access to institutions of higher education that any other major employer might enjoy
this resolution expresses the continued support of congress for the solomon law and would help ensure that military recruiters continue to have access to college campuses and students that is at least equal in quality and scope as that provided to any other employer
in adopting this resolution we would also be urging the executive branch to aggressively challenge any decision impeding or prohibiting the operation of the solomon law
in fact the law is very flexible and it fits the needs of nearly every publicfunded institution in the country
a bipartisan vote here today in support of this legislation will help send a clear message to our courts that our military recruiters deserve equal access on all of our campuses
mr speaker i am proud to stand here in support of this resolution a very important resolution introduced by the gentleman from alabama mr rogers xz4003411
i think we are at a critical period of time in this nation s history and it comes a couple of days after one of the more significant what you would call victories or symbols of what the american military presence is about and what its results are
that is that we pride ourselves in having the best educated the best trained the best quality of people serving in all sorts of branches in all sorts of jobs in the united states military and at a time when the world needs this the most from us it is very important that we maintain that quality
it is an argument that says that just because somebody s political philosophy is counter to the idea that we want to have a strong military presence in this nation those school administrators who i think are way off the board in terms of their leftwing views and their antimilitary approach ought not to be able to ban college military recruiters from doing their job because it is in the national interest that we do it
it is really in the world s interest
i strongly urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this resolution and recognizing that what we do for the private sector in allowing them to put recruiters in law schools or on any college campus ought to be the same that we do for something so important and so critical as the recruitment of the best and the brightest into our military forces
mr speaker first i thank the gentleman from north carolina mr butterfield xz4006160 for yielding me this time to speak time to speak in opposition to h con
today we are debating a resolution in support of the solomon amendment
but in reality it is about allowing the military to avoid the consequences of discrimination the same consequences that any other employer would have to face if it discriminated
many say and you heard it today that our national security requires the military to engage in this discrimination but the facts just do not support it
it was reported in last month that since 1998 the military has discharged 20 fluent arabic speakers and six fluent farsi speakers under its do nt ask do nt tell policy
mr speaker i do not accept the suggestion that the academic community is unamerican and not in support of our military
my friends in the academic community and i have many in north carolina who are part of the academic community they are good americans and they support our military completely
mr speaker i rise in support of the amendment today out of a bit of a sense of confusion as to why we really need to revisit this issue one more time
it is odd that in a nation at war that institutions of higher learning would take steps to limit the army and the navy the marine corps coast guard and other services access to their students
they pride themselves on having the brightest in america at their universities particularly the ones in question
as an aside i was at a university in january excuse me in november at freshman orientation and saw a couple of coeds walking across campus that obviously have impaired reading skills because they were both smoking
we can argue that the federal government should or should not be in a lot of different areas but clearly national defense and raising an army is a mission of our founding fathers that none of us would argue with
i guess the point i would like to make is that if these colleges and universities feel so strongly that their students should not participate in our military then let us do it with honor and voluntarily turn back the federal funding that supports many of the programs that they support through their universities
i would call on them and if they are really serious about limiting this they are afraid of what our recruiters might say that our recruiters might ask their young men and women to serve their country to place their lives on the line as many of the men and women who today serve our country in those armed forces are doing every day in iraq and afghanistan and other places around the world that we do not necessarily know about but nevertheless they are serving why they are afraid of this message
i rise in support of this resolution and would ask those universities that feel strongly about this to voluntarily send back all the federal funding that they are currently getting and allow us to use those dollars in universities that are a little more in line with the issues that we are talking about today
mr chairman i rise in strong opposition of this bill
all of the 911 hijackers were in this country legally
in fact allowing immigrants to have licenses actually improves homeland security by allowing our government to track who is in our borders
proponents of this provision claim that we need to tighten asylum laws yet they can not pinpoint a single terrorist given asylum in the united states
this bill will also require the completion of a fence on the mexican border waiving environmental laws in california
mr chairman i rise in strong support of the amendment offered by my colleague from new york
it is no secret in spite of what the last speaker said that the saudi regime is a leading exporter of terrorism worldwide it is a leading financier of terrorism worldwide
the thought that one cent of american money is being spent in saudi arabia is an insult to every american taxpayer
the saudis continue to declare to the world that they are a progressivethinking nation and they are our partners in the global war on terrorism
this is our partner in peace
our partners in peace
if they are doing anything in lebanon it is for themselves not for the people of the united states of america
mr speaker my opposition to hr 418 is for two reasons one that is broader in the context of the problems we face and one is specific to asylum
but we hear not one word or hint of any intention on the part of the majority in this house in contrast with both the president and the leadership in the senate of ever dealing with the fundamental issue
between 8 and 14 million people are in this country without legal status
they live in our shadows
they provide the overwhelming proportion of the workforce in critical industries
but where the proponents of this bill are so wrong so selfdefeating is in thinking that piecemeal fixes like this have anything to do with protecting americans against those who are plotting to harm us
he realizes that these gentlemen are wrong that this analysis is wrong that this piecemeal approach is not going to do the job and he has repeatedly called for a comprehensive reform of our immigration system because the current system results in diverting homeland security resources to chasing people who are here because they want to put food on their table
he said it pretty specifically i do nt believe we can deal with border security and homeland security without dealing with immigration reform aside from the asylum provisions i do not have any heartburn about these of course in a world where we have fixed the system so it does not have 8 to 14 million people here out of status illegally undocumented and people who should not get driver s licenses
for that reason more than any other although the fundamental change of the asylum system that is going to keep people fleeing persecution from finding their historic asylum in this country without dealing anything with terrorists who are already eligible for asylum is another reason to oppose this bill and i urge opposition on it
mr speaker what i would have asked the gentleman from georgia mr gingrey xz4001510 had he been willing to yield some time was to show me where in the 911 report it makes any reference to making any of the changes in the asylum law that are being proposed by the majority here in this bill
instead the majority because it does not agree with the commission on religious freedom because it does not accept fundamental traditions of people who have a wellfounded fear of persecution based on their political attitudes or their ethnicity or their religion or their gender they do not want to make sure they are able to get asylum they dump a whole bunch of things that have nothing to do with terrorism in here not recommended by the 911 commission report and then try to claim we are simply fulfilling the 911 commission recommendations
section 101 encourages asylum officers and immigration judges to deny an asylum claim simply because the applicant was able to recall or recount information later in the process that she did not mention when she was initially encountered by immigration officers
the amendment included in the rule would expand that to include consistency on matters that are entirely relevant to the basis of the claim for asylum
it would mean that a woman who has been subjected to gang rape by government armed forces in her country who is too afraid or ashamed to tell the fact to the armed male immigration officer she first encounters at the airport in the united states could if she tells the story later on in the process be denied asylum simply because she was too afraid or too ashamed to tell the story to the first person she encountered
in a system where we rely on translations and statements taken from people in crisis this is a very change in the law
the one thing i know is if section 101 becomes law people with a wellfounded fear of persecution as a result of these changes will be denied asylum there will be no effort whatsoever to enhance our efforts to protect this country against terrorism but we will have struck a fundamental blow against a tradition which i think is very important to maintain in this country and that is that we are a haven for refugees from persecution for political ethnic religious gender reasons
even more troubling is a fact discussed in a report released this week by the us commission on international religious freedom
the problem with that logic is that when an asylum applicant is interviewed in inspections the interview stops at the moment that the person establishes a fear of persecution
in other words the applicant is nt the reason the details are not included
this bill would codify this preposterous failure of the immigration judges logic in these cases
furthermore it is quite common for torture survivors suffering from posttraumatic stress to exhibit characteristics in their demeanor such as lack of eye contact the inability to recall simple details that to an untrained person may appear to be symptoms of lying
under current law the board of immigration appeals rightly reversed the immigration judge s credibility finding in her case and that decision has helped protect other women fleeing fgm
section 101 would encourage asylum officers and immigration judges to deny an asylum claim when the applicant can not provide corroborating evidence of their claims if the officer in his unreviewable discretion believes that the applicant should be able to provide such evidence
to meet the standard set forth in the convention it is sufficient to show persecution is motivated in part by one of the prohibited grounds
asking a refugee or asylum applicant to parse his persecutor s motivations so finely as to distill the central reason or central reason is asking asylum the proponents of section 101 assert that we must enact this section in order to prevent terrorists from gaining asylum
my friends who are the authors of this provision are in error however in this assertion
i have been informed by my staff that while several persons with terrorist connections have applied for asylum over the years the department of homeland security has not found a single terrorist has ever been granted asylum in the united states
a person who applies for asylum today is held in detention until an investigation is made on the credibility of their claim and on whether they pose a security risk to the united states
in conclusion mr speaker the consequences for asylum seekers to enactment of section 101 could be catastrophic
after all would an asylum officer in 1938 have found jews claims of being thrown into the death camps and ovens of nazi germany credible
if a bosnian woman who has faced rape at the hands of government agents as a systematic form of persecution is ashamed or afraid to relate her rapes in her initial interviews should that be an automatic ground to find her not credible
we should consider changes to our asylum laws in a sober and reflective manner after hearings subcommittee consideration and full committee consideration
i urge my colleagues to stand against this rule and if the rule is not defeated i implore you to support the amendment that will be offered later today to strike section 101 in its entirety
mr chairman i rise today in strong support of hr 418 the real id act
as a member of the congressional immigration reform caucus i join with my colleagues to raise attention to the serious flaws in our immigration system which leave our nation exposed to potential threats
in addition the commission recommended the department of homeland security s dhs completion of a biometric entryexit screening system and the improvement of us border security standards for travel and border crossing
this bill serves to protect the integrity of our immigration laws by requiring states in effect to confirm lawful immigration status or disclose the lack of confirming identification on the face of cards issued
mr chairman there are many flaws in our immigration system which need to be fixed
hr 418 does not address them all but it does represent a good step forward in discouraging lawbreaking by those who would choose to exploit our welcoming nature
mr chairman our committee chairman is exactly right we can go to page 384 in the 911 commission report
mr chairman i appreciate the gentlewoman s courtesy in permitting me to speak on this and i agree with her very strongly
in fact they are on the line every day providing for the safety and security of our constituents in a much more immediate sense than we are
but with all due respect to the gentlewoman from the district of columbia i have one other provision that deeply offends me as a former elected official as a member of this body and somebody who believes in checks and balances
i wish that it were buried in the legislation but it is not
it is right here in the beginning
if this provision the waiver of all laws necessary for quote improvements of barriers at the border was to become law the secretary of homeland security could give a contract to his political cronies that had no safety standards using 12yearold illegal immigrants to do the labor run it through the site of a native american burial ground kill bald eagles in the process and pollute the drinking water of neighboring communities
now bear in mind you are giving this authority to the head of homeland security hardly a paragon of sensitivity and efficiency
anybody who stands in those lines week after week or watches the bizarre colorcoded warning system knows that that is hardly the exemplar
my colleagues would be creating not a couple of miles of exception to finish a fence but you would be creating a zone 7 514 miles long under the terms of this bill 5 500 in canada almost 2 000 with the border of mexico where all laws are suspended in the vicinity of the barrier
mr chairman there are only 11 751 people who have been privileged to serve in this chamber
in addition in order to complete three miles of a border fence near san diego section 102 of this bill suspends all laws from public health and labor to the environment and property compensation
in fact all barriers and roads along 7 514 miles of us borders would be exempt from all laws
one person in the department of homeland security would be above the law without any judicial appeal or remedy
in addition to being bad public policy this exemption is unnecessary as most of these laws have security exemptions already written into them
in the end it is hard to imagine a more dangerous precedent
there is i think a wide range of opinion that is available for us to debate the merits of a wide range of things in this bill
and i appreciate that people are coming forward in good spirit
but i was struck by the impact of the generosity that was shown by americans in uniform civilian employees members of ngos who were there
but that never interfered in terms of the publicity with the work that was done by the united states and our agencies
for us to indicate that there is a sense here could only be interpreted as our being callous and unfeeling i think is the wrong message to send to these people in these traumatized countries
i will say mr chairman in the course of the visit i had people who were americans in business people from the ngo communities foreign parliamentarians all talking about the damaged relationship that the united states has the image that we have in this region and how amazing they felt the progress was being made by the work that was being done by our country
mr chairman i reluctantly voted against this supplemental not because there are nt many important items included in it but because a no vote is one of the few things in my power to signal my deep opposition to the administration s policy in iraq
as i made clear from the beginning of this war the administration continues to have no plan for success in iraq
they have no blueprint for winning the peace and have not even adequately protected our troops in harm s way
while we can not prevent natural events such as floods mudslides volcanic eruptions earthquakes or tsunamis we can reduce or mitigate their devastating impacts by helping communities to rebuild in safer locations construct sturdier dwellings and enhance natural ecosystems that mitigate the impact of these natural disasters
i am pleased to see that there is funding to provide additional armor for our troops and vehicles in iraq
the use of torture and rendition is morally reprehensible puts americans at risk is a poor way to obtain reliable information in our fight against terrorism and sets back the cause of democracy
regardless of the merits everyone should be troubled by the use of supplemental legislation to pay for regular military action in iraq and afghanistan
this is perhaps the most damaging single precedent since i ve been in congress
mr speaker this appropriations bill contains much crucial funding most importantly money to provide additional armor for our troops and vehicles in iraq and electronic jammers to protect them from roadside bombs
it is because of my desire to support our troops that i continue to insist that the administration develop a plan to win the peace in iraq and to the best of our capability protect the troops as they go about their mission
the use of torture and rendition is morally reprehensible puts americans at risk is a poor way to obtain reliable information in our fight against terrorism and sets back the cause of democracy
this is perhaps the single most damaging precedent since i ve been in congress
however in addition to environmental laws this provision would waive labor laws safety standards the national historic preservation act and the native
mr speaker i am here to support the rule and encourage this body to move forward with legislation that we have already debated many times in the last congress and legislation that really solves a problem
the bipartisan commission that looked into 911 dealt specifically with this issue something that has been overlooked in much of our debate now the almostsanctified 911 commission
in fact on september 11 driver s licenses became weapons of mass destruction
in the united states today a driver s license is all it takes to transfer money to a bank account to enter a federal building or other vulnerable facility to board a train or an airplane
lax standards and loopholes in the current issuance processes allow terrorists to obtain driver s licenses often multiple licenses from different states
in southwest missouri where i am from and right in the middle of the country of the 1 387 people who were detained by the office there who were illegally in the country in the year that ended september 30 50 percent of those people had a stateissued driver s license or stateissued id card not at all difficult to get
of the 19 terrorists on 911 they had five dozen driver s licenses between them and used those driver s licenses to get on the planes that crashed into the world trade center the pentagon and a field in pennsylvania
this act would require identity documents to expire at the same time a visa expires so that someone who is here on an appropriate 6month visa as in fact much to our amazement some of the 911 terrorists were are not given a 6years driver s license when the documents they do produce say they can legally be here for 6 months
this bill also tightens the process of applying for asylum in the united states to close loopholes in the system that have been taken advantage of by terrorists
the example i gave was the terrorist who was here from jordan who had bombed an international school in jordan full of american kids
well that terrorist had not committed a crime in this country and under the current law was allowed to stay here unsupervised in a country full of american kids
mr speaker i thank the gentleman for yielding me this time and i rise of course in support of this supplemental
i also want to rise to really express my appreciation to the gentleman from california chairman lewis and the tremendous job he has done in limiting the scope of this supplemental and getting this work done in a quick way and moving forward on the rest of our appropriations process at the same time
this bill does include as my friend from maryland mr hoyer xz4001890 mentioned the embassy compound in baghdad
he and i visited the current embassy together in december and i think we disagree on the need to go ahead and get this project started now
it is a difficult environment but bidding and starting these projects simply can not happen if we have a little piece of that money to start with you have to have the money available so that this embassy can be built and that our people representing us there in the embassy can be secure
we had two people killed in the current embassy compound in recent weeks from a missile that was fired there and we need to move forward
in addition to providing vital funding for our troops in fighting the war this bill also addresses some of the border vulnerabilities identified by the 911 commission
this legislation does not create a national id card or a national database but it does move forward in securing our borders and making our asylum process work better to protect americans both young and old
this bill works to protect our fighting forces abroad to help secure our borders at home to move us forward in the war against terror
mr chairman today i rise to express my concern over a provision in hr 418 the real id act of 2005
section 102 of this act states that the secretary of homeland security shall have the authority to waive and shall waive all laws necessary to ensure expeditious construction of barriers and roads in the vicinity of the us border in areas of high illegal entry
however i believe the provision currently contained in this bill is far too sweeping
it should not be necessary to waive all laws and judicial review relating to the construction of roads and barriers along the border in order to complete the fence near san diego
mr chairman i would like to thank chairman sensenbrenner for his tireless efforts and leadership in getting the real id act to the floor and for championing national security issues and the crisis we face today with our nation s border security
i would also like to thank my colleagues in the southern california delegation for their efforts and for helping to protect not only their districts but also the nation s borders as well
in particular the san diego sector covers an area of more than 7 000 square miles and 66 miles of international border with mexico
this area of the border has been a heavily traveled route for illegal immigrants and potential terrorists due to the major cities and transportation hubs such as lax airport in los angeles
a significant number of illegal immigrants that have been apprehended in this area can be directly attributed to the san diego fence that was constructed a few years ago
the portions of the san diego fence that have been built have proven to be successful and are credited with significant declines in attempted border crossings in that area
this legislation puts those priorities front and center by granting the secretary of homeland security the authority to waive all federal laws in order to complete the fence
in addition this bill will increase the funding to improve the existing fence with a 3tiered fence system and complete the original designed length
while environmental issues plays an appropriate role in our nations policies the environmental and national security impacts of having illegal immigrants trample this portion of the border is greater than the concerns regarding building and completing the fence
lastly recent press accounts have reported that al qaeda operatives have joined forces with alien smuggling rings in order to enter the united states particularly through the southern border with mexico
this bill will establish requirements that help prove lawful presence in the united states prior to issuing a license to individuals
in addition it is critical that all states must comply to eliminate weak links in the domestic identity security
lastly drivers licenses that are issued in compliance with the new regulations will expire when an alien s visa expires to alleviate any confusion or ability for terrorists asylum provisions finally the real id act will tighten the asylum system that has been abused and gamed by terrorists for years
this bill allows judges to determine a witnesses credibility in their asylum cases
without this change judges have no discretion in determining the credibility of witnesses testifying that they are being persecuted
judge s hands have been tied over the years and must just grant asylum in every case where persecution has been raised and have not been able to go beyond that point
this has allowed terrorists who have been persecuted in their home country for being terrorists to seek shelter in the united states
terrorists have long been abusing our system in order to gain entry
this bill provides a list of longaccepted commonsense factors that an immigration judge can consider in assessing credibility such as the demeanor candor responsiveness and consistency of an asylum applicant or other witness
again i would to thank chairman sensenbrenner for his efforts in getting this bill to the floor and i strongly urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this bill because these reforms are necessary to our national security
mr chairman i rise today in very strong support of the bill hr 418 and also the very fine amendment of the gentleman from texas mr sessions xz4003670
i spoke on the floor last december in opposition to the conference report on the intelligence bill because it lacked the provisions that we are actually debating here today
when i was in the florida senate i headed up the homeland security committee shortly after 911 and many of the provisions that are in this bill we actually included when we took on the driver s license issue making the driver s licenses only last as long as the person was legally in the country
i urge my colleagues to vote for the bill and certainly for the amendment of the gentleman from texas mr sessions xz4003670 which just quite honestly makes common sense in that members constituents back home will very easily understand and say why was this not done a long time ago
mr chairman i have some concerns about provisions in section 1113 of the bill relating to service members group life insurance which i will now referral to as sgli
neither the department of veterans affairs nor the house committee on veterans affairs the authorizing committee with jurisdiction over va insurance programs was consulted prior to the administration s submitting the insurance proposals in the war supplemental
i recognize that it placed the gentleman from california mr lewis xz4002391 and the gentleman from wisconsin mr obey xz4003000 in very difficult positions because they always come to the floor to talk about authorizing on appropriations bills but that is what you are doing exactly here
number one it would authorize retroactive insurance coverage in cases of servicemembers who die having declined insurance coverage and second it would require a spouse to concur with the servicemember s insurance coverage election
at the appropriations markup the gentleman from wisconsin mr obey xz4003000 offered an amendment which was accepted to limit retroactive payment to those who died in performance of duty
by restricting payments to deaths that the service secretary concerned determines in the performance of duty we would then expect that deaths which occurred during the performance of an assigned military duty would be compensated but that deaths not associated with assigned military duties would not qualify
another qualifier though that perhaps should have been considered during this markup would have been in addition to dying in performance of military duties the servicemember must have had maximum insurance coverage at the time of death
the committee on veterans affairs has established a record in this regard
when we increased the sgli coverage from 200 000 to 250 000 with a delayed effective date in public law 106419 then in reaction to the terrorist attack on the uss cole we did in fact make a retroactivity in public law 10714 for servicemembers who died in performance of duty that had maximum sgli at the time of their death
second i have great concern regarding the administration s proposal to include in hr 1268 that a spouse must concur with a servicemember s insurance election
requiring the spouse to concur with the servicemember s decision as included in hr 1268 would in fact make sgli a volunteer program for single servicemembers and an involuntary program for married servicemembers
number two sgli would in fact be a voluntary program for singles involuntary for married
three the concurrence policy would force the servicemember to pay premiums and keep the spouse as a beneficiary even in situations of pending divorce spousal abuse drug abuse child abuse
fourth the spousal concurrence as drafted in the bill would prevent a servicemember from naming children children from a previous marriage parents grandparents guardians of grandchildren let your mind go from participating in insurance
the supreme court has upheld the right of the insured to name whoever he or she wants as a beneficiary even if it is in violation of a state court divorce decree
there are administrative concerns as well the substantial administrative costs that would be added in the daytoday running of this program as well as has been added to its greater complexity
and if there is a delay in getting a spouse to agree to insurance coverage or the amount and the servicemember dies then who receives the benefits
chairman on behalf of the 370 000 members of the military officers association of america moaa i am writing to inform you that after discussing the issue extensively with the committee s majority and minority staff moaa has reconsidered its position on the servicemen s group life insurance sgli spousal consent requirement as included in the appropriations committee s markup of the fy2005 defense supplemental appropriations act
we believe there is merit to the staff s view that the appropriations committee s language is excessively stringent and could inappropriately preclude servicemembers ability to make reasonable insurance decisions especially in circumstances where it may be reasonable and appropriate for a member to designate children as beneficiaries instead of the current spouse
moaa believes congress is doing the right thing in expediting passage of improved death benefits coverage in the supplemental appropriations act and we have no wish to slow that process in any way
therefore moaa urges your support for a floor amendment that would either substitute a provision requiring spousal notification instead of spousal consent or strike the spousal consent requirement to allow the committee to develop more appropriate language that could be offered in conference or another appropriate legislative venue
but it does and i gave the example because you can have someone who has an accidental death or a duty nonperformance in the service
i believe that the performance of duty that is in the bill what it does it does identify with regard to who will receive payment and who do not receive payments
that was why i used the word limited or restricted because you could have an individual mr chairman of whom died in an auto accident was murdered or something happened to them and they do not qualify
mr speaker i rise today in support of the rule on hr 418
our nation s immigration policy has been of top concern in recent years and for good reason
with between eight and twelve million illegal aliens in the united states it is obviously a problem out of control
i have reservations about the gradual move toward what could become a national id card but this legislation begins to address issues necessary to focus efforts in enforcement
mr speaker i intend to vote in favor of hr 418 but while doing so i suggest that enforcement border security and immigration reform must be worked on together
in fact fixing the broken system requires a broader strategy that includes both enforcement and the creation of adequate legal channels for immigration that serve the nation s interests
our economy demands workers but our national security demands that we identify those lurking in the shadows
we are concerned about the lack of coherence in our immigration policy and enforcement
he has outlined the solution and now congress must act quickly in crafting legislation
this bill is our first step in a long journey to restore public confidence in an open welcoming immigration code
forbes sailed for america from scotland in 1904 he was following a course well worn by generations of scots
the evidence of the contributions these immigrants make to our society is all around us especially in the critical area of education
well our modern public school systems simply are not producing the talent the american economy needs to compete in the future
in a study on high school students released this past summer the national foundation for american policy found 60 percent of the top science students and 65 percent of the top math students are children of immigrants
this correlates with other findings that more than half of engineers and 45 percent of math and computer scientists with phds now working in the us are foreign born
the point is that by almost any measure of educational excellence you choose if you re in america you re going to find immigrants or their children at the top
in my book anyone who comes here and gives an honest day s work for an honest day s pay is not only putting himself closer to the american dream he s helping the rest of us get there too
ibrahim hopes to be deployed to iraq also as a marine to put his arabic language skills in the service of corps and country
jos gutierrez who was raised in guatemala and came to america as a boy illegally
gutierrez was one of the first marines killed in action in iraq
so here we have it asian marines arab marines latino marines all united in the mission of protecting the rest of us
my company news corporation is a multinational company based in america
frankly it does nt bother me in the least that millions of people are attracted to our shores
in an era when too many of our pundits declare that the american dream is a fraud it is america s immigrants who remind us by dint of their success that the dream is alive and well within reach of anyone willing to work for it
only a few days ago the white house indicated that it intended to revive an immigration reform which the president had first offered before 911 and tried to revive back in january
but he has nt and i for one am encouraged by his refusal to give in
we who have arrived more recently likewise will never forget our debt we owe to this land and the obligation to keep that same opportunity alive in the 21st
this is adapted from a speech he gave last thursday in acceptance of the 2004 bc
immigration reform a 3legged stool while not a major theme of last fall s campaign a debate on immigration reform will be front and center in the early days of the new bush administration
in the past 10 years more than 20 billion has been spent on adding border patrol agents building fencing and employing technology to prevent border crossings
more disturbing is that in the past five years more than 2 000 migrants have lost their lives perishing in remote portions of the american southwest
and yet those who survive the gauntlet of a dangerous border crossing find work in short order
truth be told our current system instead of discouraging undocumented migration makes it inevitable because adequate provisions in law do not exist to match up willing workers from other countries with unfilled jobs here
work visas for unskilled workers are absurdly small compared to the demand 5 000 in the permanent system and up to 66 000 in the temporary one
it can be conditioned on any number of criteria including for example sweat equity the undocumented have already accrued through their work in the united states
second it should reform the employmentbased legal immigration system in a way that increases legal avenues to work while protecting the rights of both foreignborn and us workers
too often our current system separates husbands from wives and parents from children a morally unacceptable outcome in a nation built upon the strength of the family
after our country s unhappy experience with jim crow laws that resulted in the creation of a large black underc1ass we should not repeat the same mistake in tolerating the creation of a large immigrant underc1ass by not affording legal remedies that would afford them the protection of law and the opportunity for upward mobility
we applaud the president for recognizing how the present immigration regime hurts both americans and undocumented immigrants in america
for doable policy resolving the dilemma posed by many millions of undocumented workers in america requires compromise that few will find completely satisfying
president bush told reporters recently that he wants us border patrol agents chasing crooks and thieves and drugrunners and terrorists not goodhearted people who are coming here to work the president is seeking levelheaded immigration legislation that could improve domestic security and put policy in line with the needs of the globalized american economy
the most sensible approach would offer legitimacy to those who have worked diligently in america while imposing and enforcing tough employer sanctions against companies that continue to employ undocumented workers
one would obligate illegal immigrants to come out of the shadows to prove their identities in return for some form of legitimate status
there are untold numbers of people around the world who are standing in line to legally enter the united states and many of these wouldbe immigrants possess skills that american employers need
congress and the white house can find suitable resolutions to the security social and labor quandaries posed by immigration if prejudices and stigmas are shoved aside in favor of rational proposals that bolster us security and global competitiveness
the attacks of september 11th called for new and updated thinking in all areas of federal law enforcement and immigration reform has been a glaring omission
america s immigration system must be reformed in a responsible welcoming adult manner along the lines laid out by president bush
in order to let the border guard do their job of defending america the president supports giving foreign laborers guest worker cards to match willing workers with willing employers president bush is opposed to amnesty for illegal immigrants
he also does not want to give foreigners in the guest worker program any advantage over those who are trying to become citizens through normal due process channels
congress should support president bush s commonsense plan to reform and strengthen america s broken immigration system even as border security is addressed today in the house of representatives
because as the chairman just said certainly all of us who board planes want to know that there is some integrity to our id system in this country and that terrorists are not boarding planes by the use of a stateissued identification card
as the chairman suggested i am proud to say that in 2003 virginia under the leadership of former attorney general jerry kilgore acted to close this dangerous loophole
the general assembly passed and the governor signed into law a provision which requires the minimum standard which says that anyone applying for a license in virginia must have legal status in this country that they must have a visa and that the license that would be issued would coterminate with the termination or expiration of that visa
it is time for congress to act to provide and mandate a minimum standard for states when they issue state ids including driver s licenses to require that individuals who have that privilege be here in this country legally
our troops serving in iraq will have the necessary tools to continue their rebuilding efforts in iraq and to continue the war on terror
with a license in hand terrorists were better able to blend in avoid detection and harm our nation s citizens
we in congress have been working on ways to prevent our nation from experiencing another terrorist attack by establishing stronger and more secure national programs
the real id provisions will close dangerous gaps that remain in our current licensing law and that allow terrorists to abuse our asylum and driver s license systems
in 2003 the former attorney general of virginia jerry kilgore and i worked together on the driver s license integrity act
today i am pleased to see virginia s driver s license integrity act provisions in this piece of legislation before us in the house of representatives
the provisions in this bill provide us with more weapons in our arsenal against terrorism
mr chairman i wish to discuss one critically important component of this bill the 200 million in aid to the palestinians
the president has requested 350 million for the palestinians and he asks that 200 million be included in today s supplemental bill
i saw democracy taking hold in palestine
the palestinian people support their new president s goals to end the armed intifadah and to create a viable state living in peace alongside israel
with the exception of one horrific bombing in tel aviv the ceasefire has held
they have arrested terrorists for the first time in many years
mr chairman the real question before us today is not whether to keep the 200 million for palestinian assistance in this bill
of course we must secure transparency and accountability but the requirements in this legislation go far beyond what we demanded in the arafat era
one especially troubling provision in the bill strikes the national security waiver under which the president could provide some of this aid directly to the palestinian authority
president bush has decided in the past that some us aid be directed to the authority
this bill would prevent him from doing that tying his hands at the very moment that he most needs flexibility to promote our interests in the middle east
mr chairman there is a broad consensus in the american proisrael community in support of the president s aid request for the palestinians
the jewish council for public affairs the umbrella group of 13 prominent national organizations and 122 local jewish communities has recently urged congress to fund the palestinian request in its entirety
in asking us to support a clean aid package mj rosenberg of the israel policy forum states the following israel wants a strong palestinian authority that can and will liquidate the suicide bombers and build a democracy that will live in peace with israel the arafat years are over
fragile as it may be a new flame of hope and optimism has been kindled in the middle east
mr chairman i urge my colleagues to support the 200 million in palestinian assistance i urge us to reject any amendments to strip this aid and i hope in the conference with the senate that we can give back to the president the flexibility he needs to promote us security interests in the region
mr speaker i rise in support of hr 1268 to authorize emergency supplemental appropriations for our military
the vast majority of this 82 billion bill will go directly to support our troops in iraq and afghanistan
when our soldiers are sent in to war it is the congress responsibility to make sure that all resources necessary are provided to carry out their missions
i stand behind our brave men and women who have performed admirably in iraq and afghanistan
the bill also provides additional foreign assistance for tsunami reconstruction humanitarian and peacekeeping programs in darfur democracy assistance in belarus and political and economic reforms in ukraine to strengthen their new democracy and legal system
i regret that the administration has consistently failed to properly budget for our ongoing military and reconstruction operations in iraq
congress should not repeatedly rely on emergency spending bills to provide the critical funding resources and equipment for our troops in battle by using emergency supplemental appropriations bills
the united states is only belatedly seeking international support for our reconstruction efforts in iraq and we have failed to broadly engage the international community
it is primarily american troops stationed in iraq that face continuing attacks and have lost life and limb
iraq is already facing a difficult transition in establishing a democracy that operates under the rule of law and protects minority rights
the us must show enough flexibility in working with our allies to effectively help iraq during this critical transition period so that other countries will pledge both troops and funds to alleviate the burden on our american soldiers and taxpayers
ultimately the best way that we can support our troops is to reach out more aggressively to the international community establish order and security in iraq and help the interim iraqi government assume more responsibility for its own affairs as they establish a democratic state
as the ranking member of the helsinki commission commission on security and cooperation in europe which promotes human rights and rule of law in europe i am also concerned about many of the asylum law changes contained in the real id act which again go beyond the scope of the 911 commission recommendations
over the past week i have heard from a number of groups in maryland that provide legal and social services to immigrants asylum seekers refugees and survivors of torture and slavery
these groups have reported to me that it is already extremely difficult for legitimate asylum seekers to prevail in their case as they have often left their home country on short notice and do not have documentation of their persecution
i hope that in the near future congress will have the opportunity in a more thoughtful manner to consider comprehensive immigration reform measures
the gentleman from wisconsin s chairman sensenbrenner dedication to fixing gaps in our security is commendable and i am proud to join him in strengthening federal identity requirements protecting those who need political asylum and improving our border security
my amendment is intended to enhance the information contained in homeland security s aviation security screening databases and to ensure that our security is not compromised through the use of falsified driver s licenses
specifically the amendment would require homeland security to enter into the appropriate database any person convicted of using a false driver s license in attempting to board an airplane
my amendment would go a step further in protecting our nation by also requiring the department to enter a violator into one of its national aviation screening databases
improving the quantity and quality of information contained in these passengerscreening databases is essential to enhancing our ability to identify potential threats and prevent terrorists from gaining access to our airliners
my amendment would ensure that those convicted of using a false driver s license in attempting to board an airplane would be redflagged for airport screeners
again i appreciate the opportunity to offer a small but important step in improving our security databases
my amendment would ensure that those convicted of using a false driver s license in attempting to board an airplane are redflagged for airport screeners
congress should do everything in our power to make their job easier
one thing that is important and what we have done here is to understand that there has to be a conviction in this situation by a court of law before it can be entered into a database of the transportation security administration
we are not sure at this point whether they include that information or not at tsa because simply they have databases and we do not know necessarily what is in their databases and i do not blame them at all
i would imagine and i am putting myself in their position and i am not an expert on this but if you are there and are in the security forces there you are obviously trained in document recognition to some great degree
i do not think this is going to change actually the way they look at licenses presently in the first instance or even in second instance
it is just a trigger mark as other things might be in terms of potential risks
mr chairman i rise in strong support of the real id act and i want to thank the distinguished chairman of the committee on the judiciary the gentleman from wisconsin mr sensenbrenner xz4003650 for his efforts in this matter
with the real id act in place we can better prevent future tragic events from occurring
i would like to join in the point that is being made by the gentlewoman from texas to remind all of our friends that when republicans took power in 1994 they made a solemn promise to the states that they would make sure that there would be no imposition of unfunded mandates on those states and today we have a chance to redeem that promise by voting no on consideration of this rule which waives the unfunded mandate requirement
the majority may if they have not already attempt to argue that it is a minor mandate and show new and improved cbo estimates showing that the cost of this bill is only 125 million over the next 5 years and therefore i think this warrants at minimum committee hearings in markups that has so far been denied this congress
so i commend the gentlewoman from texas ms jacksonlee xz4001990 for making such a very timely and important point of order and i support her in it
mr chairman i rise regrettably in opposition to this antiimmigrant legislation
mr chairman if we truly believe in all we have heard about the importance of freedom and liberty from our president and others then we have no other choice but to vote down this bill which denies so much freedom and liberty to the immigrants in our own country
unfortunately in our history there have been a number of examples of this overreaction in the past
in the wake of the 911 tragedy and even after the patriot act which did its share of violating the rights of those who were in this country this legislation would even further target immigrants for crimes they have not committed and for which they are not responsible
so i urge us in good conscience and serious concern over the direct and the subtle import of this legislation please we can not and should not close ourselves off to the most vulnerable members of our society
mr chairman this amendment was brought to our attention yesterday evening and at first blush this is a shocking correlative point to be made and a comparison to the fugitive slave act of 1850 in which agents were given the broad powers to return freed slaves in free states and return them back to slavery
what we are doing here with bail bondsmen is giving them the ability to enforce immigration laws by summarily rounding up and deporting people and also gaining access to incredible private and secret material in data files
mr chairman i need my friend to know that they are in the process of having the claim heard
what i was trying to figure out is what inspired the gentleman at this late point in the proceedings since we had hearings last year we had no hearings this year and we just found out about this yesterday
i rise in support of the nadlermeeksjacksonlee amendment to strike section 101 of hr 418 which imposes evidentiary requirements on asylumseekers fleeing persecution and all immigrants who seek withholding of removal from deportation
since we tightened some loopholes in asylum law in 1996 terrorists have not been abusing our asylum system as the proponents of this bill allege
terrorists are already barred from receiving the benefit of asylum protection in the united states
ramzi yousef and sheik omar abdel rahman who were both involved in the first world trade center bombing in 1993 were never granted asylum
mir aimal kansi who killed two cia employees in 1993 was never granted asylum
gazi ibrahim abu mezer known as the brooklyn bomber for his involvement in a planned attack on the new york city subway in 1997 was never granted asylum
ahmad ajaj who was involved in the first world trade center bombing was never granted asylum his initial application for asylum was abandoned when he left the country and his second application was denied
abdel hakim tizegha who was involved in the planned millennium attack in 1999 was never granted asylum
his application was denied in 1997 and his appeal was denied in 1999
hesham mohamed ali hedayet who killed two people at the el al counter at los angeles international airport in 2002 was never granted asylum
his application was denied in 1995
shahawar matin siraj who has been accused of plotting to bomb the harold square subway station in new york city in august 2004 was never granted asylum
immigrants can not apply for asylum unless they are already in the united states
in addition filing an application for asylum should not be equated with actually receiving asylum protection and the right to remain in the united states that it grants
for people applying for asylum in 2005 under current law extensive security checks are now done through the fbi cia homeland security and state department databases
people who are already in the united states who become terrorists while they are here must be identified by intelligence and law enforcement
first the bill requires that refugees prove that one of the five grounds for asylum protection race nationality membership in a social group political opinion or religion is the central reason why they were persecuted
with little access to the documents and witnesses they left behind when fleeing their country they must prove what was in the mind of their persecutor during the persecution
third the bill allows judges to deny applications if they find inconsistencies between the applicant s testimony and any statement they have made to a us official or inconsistencies in witness and documentary evidence that is provided
in addition it allows denials on the basis of subjective assessments of an applicant s demeanor a factor that is frequently misinterpreted by us judges due to cultural differences
thus a person could be denied asylum due to an immaterial inconsistency in the evidence they present
finally the bill strips courts from the power to review immigration judge s discretionary judgments in asylum and removal cases
unfortunately this bill takes a significant step in turning our country away from its proud history as a nation of refuge for those fleeing persecution
mr chairman what i would like to find out if the gentleman knows has this ever occurred in the history of federal legislation before that for a given instance all laws local state national will be waived all at one time for one specific purpose
mr speaker i rise in strong opposition to this supplemental appropriations bill and the antiimmigrant legislation it contains
if we truly believe all the rhetoric we hear about the importance of freedom and liberty from the president and others we will vote down this bill which denies so much freedom and liberty to immigrants in our own country
we have been down this road of overreaction in the past
in the wake of the 911 tragedy and even after the patriot act this legislation would further target immigrants for crimes they have not committed and sins they are not responsible for
mr chairman i rise in strong support of the tierney amendment
we support our men and women in uniform but we should not throw money at any problem
and i congratulate the gentleman from iowa mr leach xz4002360 for his strong work in this worthy effort
i had the good fortune of being in baghdad last christmas
a shipment came in that our military did not want us to see
what was in those boxes
answer 14 billion billion with a b as in boy 14 billion of us currency shipped in allegedly to replenish the iraqi central bank
but when our own paul bremer says he really can not account for 9 billion of money when eyewitnesses see 300 million in us cash being flown out of the country allegedly to buy arms for the good guys you have got to wonder
this needs to be in the bill because these supplementals they are becoming a habit guys
and if they are caught they even know how to rig our legal system to stay in the country nonetheless
both men were in the country because they were awaiting the outcome of their asylum applications
several of these hijackers had overstayed their visas and they were unlawfully in this country
the laws that we are operating under today allow terrorists to enter our country and to plan and carry out attacks in the united states
the most literal security gap that this bill addresses is the 3mile hole in the san diego border fence
recent press accounts have reported that al qaeda operatives have joined forces with human smuggling rings in order to enter the united states
the border security fence therefore which thus far has been mired in bureaucratic delays is part of our national security efforts and must be completed now
the important infrastructure assets in the area including in particular the largest naval base on the west coast of the united states and the busiest seaport in the united states makes securing this area even more important
in 2004 border patrol agents arrested almost 12 million illegal aliens with 116 percent of those apprehended in the san diego sector alone despite the fact that the san diego sector is roughly 1 percent of our border area
over the past 2 years the three border patrol stations responsible for patrol of the existing 14 miles of border fence in the san diego sector have apprehended approximately 200 special interest aliens annually from countries such as afghanistan iran iraq pakistan and turkey
completion of this fence will not only reduce the number of illegal crossings in the area but will also allow the border patrol to redeploy manpower and redirect precious resources to other important homeland security missions along the border
and like the other border fence areas the san diego sector can expect to see a reduction in crime including murder as well
but only in washington would people construct a fence with a big hole in it
in fact the us department of the interior s fish and wildlife service concluded in july 2003 that construction of the fence is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of any relevant endangered species in the area
furthermore not completing the fence will continue to cause other environmental damage in the area due to large numbers of persons crossing illegally through this area and subsequent pursuit by the border patrol as well as large amounts of trash and refuse left in the wake of smugglers and illegal crossers
for example in september of 2003 the san diego border patrol requested entry to a section of countyowned land located in the 3 12 mile section in dispute and located about 300 feet from the usmexican border in order to first improve the road for safety of the border patrol agents and two take soil samples in order to address environmental concerns pertaining to construction of the fence
mr chairman several provisions in this legislation are of particular interest to the committee on homeland security
likewise the time and effort of every law abiding citizen who waits in seemingly endless lines first to obtain and then to present identification is wasted
document fraud is a crime against all americans who must tolerate the indignity of life in a post911 world
five weeks ago the house approved the real id act just as we did in the 108th congress
in so doing we responded to the challenge put before us by mir aimal kansi who slaughtered five people at cia headquarters by ramzi yousef who masterminded the first world trade center attack and by several of the 911 hijackers who would have found it far more difficult if not impossible to carry out their terror attacks had we prevented them from using false identification
the megaports initiative is designed to interdict illicit traffic in nuclear and other radioactive materials
by surveilling container shipping at high volume high risk overseas ports and by deploying radiation detection devices at our own ports of entry america s counterterrorism strategy can succeed in a comprehensive defense of the global supply chain
and while it will never return these patriots such as christian engeldrum in my district to his family what we can do as americans is ensure that his wife and children have financial security for his personal sacrifice to his country
i led a delegation to sri lanka in january and i saw first hand the resources needed in that country multiplied by the effects on other countries and this money will go to good use
this funding along with the sheer generosity of the american people is a true testament of our country in comparison to the tepid actions by the white house in the immediate days after the crisis
population fund for children and maternal health care in the tsunami region
this bill provides 50 million in important aid to the state of israel as they embark on the critical disengagement plan and withdraw from the gaza strip
and finally this bill includes important language to create the 911 heroes medal of valor for which i am deeply indebted to the gentleman from virginia mr wolf xz4004350 the gentleman from new york mr serrano xz4003660 the gentleman from ohio mr oxley xz4003070 and the gentleman from massachusetts mr frank xz4001400 for including this provision in this bill
on behalf of my cousin john moran who was killed on 911 a battalion chief of the fire department of new york and the over 400 families in new york city that are affected by this legislation i want to say thank you for this honor that is going to be bestowed by the president in september of this year
hr 418 the real id act will fix these loopholes in current law and also take steps to close gaping holes in our land borders which are the first line of defense against terrorist infiltration not just for the border states but also for my home state of wyoming and the rest of the nation
we all know how the 911 terrorists manipulated our asylum laws to stay in our country and utilized lax drivers license standards to help them carry out their plans
we know that human traffickers continue to take advantage of the gaps in our borders helping terrorist and criminal aliens gain entry into our country
but to suggest that this is an antiimmigrant bill is in my opinion wrong
if you want to come in on a visa you want to come in to be a citizen support it
if they are in this country illegally they need to go out and come back legally with a visa or proper method
mr chairman i would say to my friend the gentleman from california mr farr xz4001290 during the last debate i invited him to come down and look at the 7mile area in that fence because it is a problem
the gentleman from california mr hunter xz4001910 first came to me in 1990 and asked where we could get landing mat and we put that up
mr chairman the gentleman from california mr hunter xz4001910 talked about in 1990 when he came to me while i was still in the military asking me about landing mats to put up for the border
we had truckloads of drugs coming across in a 100mile sector that we could not stop
in 1 year there were a number of rapes and a number of murders by the coyotes and people on the us side of people trying to get across
now there are all kinds of ways in which you can stop something here in this body
documents that we have captured from al qaeda show that they consider the border vulnerable with cells in mexico itself
in san diego in california we have about 800 000 illegals in kthrough12 education
i have been in those schools
but we need to secure our border to stop the flow coming in
i spent a lot of time in saudi
we talk about not putting foreign troops in foreign countries
the gentleman from california mr lewis xz4002391 and the gentleman from florida mr young xz4004391 and his wife are out at bethesda in the hospitals every single day taking care of our troops
i have another great friend in the gentleman from wisconsin mr obey xz4003000
and if we were back in the times of troy i would be achilles and he would be hector and we would cross swords but we would respect each other
i think we can work in a very bipartisan way to make sure that that happens
our men and women depend on having the necessary equipment and systems to be successful in mission accomplishment
as a member of the house armed services committee i am actively involved in efforts for example to better protect our troops while they are in harm s way
rather the question is about our responsibility to spend the american people s money wisely and in a manner consistent with the established process
i do not doubt that the nonwartime and nondefense related projects in this bill are worthwhile however the decision to fund these projects should be made during the established appropriations process
certainly it is inappropriate for this body to have to consider legislation under the guise of emergency wartime spending when in fact that description is not completely honest
again i support this funding legislation as it pertains to the support of our military and our efforts to protect american citizens and to promote peace and democracy in the middle east
mr chairman although i support the amendment i ask unanimous consent to claim the time in opposition
i speak to many companies in san diego
i know that they have a great interest in this
they have been a part of some of these solutions in the past
let us employ them let us be sure that we are doing this in a comprehensive fashion
we must move forward in this area
i will focus on the issue driving this extreme language completing the 3 12 miles of border fencing including the ocean section in my district
in 1993 the border patrol apprehended 165 000 people in this section
in 2003 the number had dropped 94 percent to 10 000
i rise today in support of hr 418
unfortunately not all of the recommendations were included in the first round of legislation which is why we are here today
the gentleman from wisconsin chairman sensenbrenner and i committed to working together to make sure that one of the first orders of business considered by the house in the 109th congress would be to address some of the recommendations in our jurisdictions that the congress failed to address last year
i want to use my time today to discuss the provisions contained in hr 418 that fall within the jurisdiction of the committee on government reform which i chair security measures for federal acceptance of stateissued driver s licenses and personal identification cards commonly referred to as identity security
last year s 911 commission report identified a number of gaps and weaknesses in our nation s intelligence and homeland security systems providing recommendations for congress to consider in fixing these problems
it is the following secure identification should begin in the united states
fraud in identity documents is no longer just a problem of theft
unfortunately the housepassed provisions critical to strengthening identity security were dropped from the bill in conference
instead language was included that would set up a general framework for a federal role in this area but the language was filled with so many loopholes and optout clauses for states that it really only made matters worse
as the 911 commission concluded fraud in identity documents is no longer just a problem of theft
as we continue to strengthen our intelligence function to better identify and track terrorists those individuals will be forced to find ways to conceal their identity in order to avoid detection
we know that the 911 hijackers used the united states as their staging area for training and preparation in the year prior to the attacks traveling into and out of and around the country with little fear of capture
in fact several of the hijackers lived less than 15 miles away from this building while making final preparations for their attack
we are dedicated to making sure we do not provide such a hospitable environment in the future
secondly the legislation authorizes grants to states to conform to the minimum standards set forth in the act
third i am confident that these minimum standards will not be a heavy lift for a majority of the states in our nation
it is crucial that we do everything we can to enhance the security of the american people and this important legislation takes a significant step in frustrating terrorists attempts to integrate into our society
mr chairman i yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gentlewoman from michigan mrs miller xz4002761 a former secretary of state of the state of michigan which issues driver s licenses in michigan and someone who has been very helpful in crafting this bill
i note on page 390 of the 911 commission report it recommends secure identification should begin in the united states
in fact this allows the states to issue two different sets one for illegal immigrants one for everyone else
finally the optout provisions in the current legislation that was passed just a few months ago are disastrous
mr speaker i rise today in strong support of the conference report on hr 1268 and urge all my colleagues to support it
in addition to necessary funding for our troops tsunami disaster relief and border security this conference report also includes important provisions to bring longoverdue common sense reform to drivers licenses and stateissued identification cards authored last year by the government reform committee in response to a recommendation of the 911 commission
mr speaker i want to especially thank the speaker and majority leader for making good on their promise to get this legislation to the floor signed into law quickly in the 109th congress
i also want to thank my colleague from california the chairman of the appropriations committee for his strong support and for agreeing to include these provisions in hr 1268
finally i would like to thank my colleague from wisconsin for his tireless work and support on this issue last year following passage of the 911 commission recommendations implementation act he and i made a commitment to work together to ensure that the most important provisions not addressed in the final bill would be addressed early in the 109th congress
the legislation provides three years for states to come into compliance with these standards in order for the federal government to recognize their documents as proof of an individual s identity
the bill and the report make clear that the secretary must determine the uses in addition to those set forth in the bill for which drivers licenses only from complying states will be accepted
states will also be required to confirm the applicant s proof of legal presence in the united states
currently only 11 states lack such a requirement meaning a majority of states have already recognized the need for tighter standards but unnecessary and dangerous gaps in the system still exist
importantly states are still permitted to issue drivers licenses to individuals who are not lawfully present in the united states or who can not provide satisfactory proof of identity
the ability of states to have such a system is currently under challenge in court and this legislation will provide them with express authority
in addition the legislation will require identity documents to expire at the same time as the expiration of lawful entry status this will prevent individuals who have illegally entered or are unlawfully present in the united states from having valid identification documents
the federal government has been delinquent in dealing with this issue but we are correcting that problem today
fraud in identity documents is no longer just a problem of theft
as we continue to strengthen our intelligence function to better identify and track terrorists those individuals will be forced to find ways to conceal their identity in order to avoid detection
we must be able to establish as close to certainty as we can that people are who they say they are and in order to do so the federal government must have documents that it can trust
in fact we would not be fulfilling our security role for the american people if we did not
mr speaker i want to comment briefly on the 82 billion spending bill that will be approved today for the ongoing us military campaigns in iraq and afghanistan
and i am hopeful that the additional funds that are in the bill to train and equip security forces in iraq all afghanistan will be expeditious and well spent
but for that to become a reality wellequipped and competent security forces in iraq and afghanistan must be prepared to take our place
i am also pleased that the final bill retained language inserted in the senate directing the president to include future requests to fund the us presence in iraq in his regular budget
we have been in iraq for more than two years and in afghanistan for more than three years
the fact that we still have troops in iraq should not come as a surprise to the budget writers at the white house and the pentagon
as columnist mark shields pointed out late last year in the three years immediately after pearl harbor the united states produced the following to win world war ii 296 429 aircraft 102 3351 tanks 87 620 warships and 2 455 694 trucks
yet approaching three years into the us occupation of iraq the united states with a population of almost 300 million and defense spending of 500 billion a year under the failed leadership of the pentagon only 6 000 of the nearly 20 000 humvees in iraq are factory armored versions and more than 8 000 of the 9 128 medium and heavy trucks used in iraq are without armor
despite repeated promises from the pentagon leadership that the situation is getting better a recent article in the new york times showed that the emperor has no clothes
as the article details one marine company has returned home to expose the reality of their tour in iraq one they say was punctuated not only by a lack of armor but also by a shortage of men and planning that further hampered their efforts in battle destroyed morale and ruined the careers of some of their most competent warriors i have heard similar stories from the oregon national guard members i have talked to
since the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks against our country congress has provided the pentagon with 16 trillion 167 billion in supplemental appropriations bills for fiscal years 20012005 and 145 trillion in regular defense appropriations for fiscal years 20022005
it is hard to understand until you remember that secretary rumsfeld and the other civilian leaders at the pentagon argued that our troops would be greeted in iraq as liberators with flowers and candy not the bullets and bombs that have led to more than 1 500 of our soldiers getting killed
the fact that 150 000 us troops remain in iraq more than a year and a half after the war began shows how badly the pentagon leadership miscalculated the postwar situation
those miscalculations also led the pentagon to vastly underestimate the equipment that our troops would need to survive and succeed in iraq
for example under the pentagon s original war plan the pentagon planned to have only 235 armored humvees in iraq for the 20 000 troops who would remain after overthrowing saddam hussein
as the new york times article i mentioned above noted the army s procurement system which also supplies the marines has come under fierce criticism for underperforming in the war and to this day it has only one small contractor in ohio armoring new humvees the performance of secretary rumsfeld and his senior leadership at the pentagon has been a disgrace
the comprehensive energy bill which we passed in the last congress and in the 107th congress is a very high priority for this year
i would just remind the gentleman that this bill this energy package has passed i can not recall every time but many times in the last congress and it even passed this house as a conference report
each time that the energy bill has gone through this house whether it be the house bill or in the conference report it has enjoyed a very large democrat vote
mr chairman i would just say to my good friend from texas mr reyes xz4003370 who is an expert and we all value his input we are going to do immigration reform in this congress
i want to thank the gentleman from wisconsin chairman sensenbrenner and the gentleman from virginia chairman tom davis and the gentleman from california chairman cox for their hard work in getting this bill to the floor so early in the new session
after all mr chairman the war on terror is not being fought in a vacuum
as long as america boasts the civilized world s most open laws concerning immigration and mobility while remaining its greatest terrorist target we must ensure that people coming in and out of our country are not here to do our people harm
the real id act requires that applicants for driver s licenses prove that they are in the united states legally very simple and that a foreign traveler s license expires with his visa
these processes are not just loopholes they are gaping yawning chasms in the law waiting to be exploited
they are risks threats even to the security of our homeland and to our success in the war on terror
the reforms in the real id act are overdue no less an authority than the 911 commission itself says so
mr chairman i rise in strong opposition to hr 418 the real id act
not only has the house failed to consider the sweeping changes in this bill through the thoughtful and deliberative committee process we have failed our duty to the american people to ensure that this bill will not have unintended consequences
in addition it would grant dhs unchecked authority to abrogate criminal law child labor laws laws that protect workers civil rights laws ethics laws for clean contracting and procurement policy
this section requires that in certain asylum claims applicants must prove that their race religion nationality membership in a particular social group or political opinion was or will be a central reason for their persecution
in effect this will bar many legitimate refugees who have fled brutal human rights abuses including torture rape and other horrific violence from receiving asylum
this section creates new burdens on those seeking asylum including a corroborating evidence test empowering an immigration officer or immigration judge to deny asylum to a refugee because he believes in his discretion that the refugee should have somehow been able to obtain a particular document when fleeing her country
given the great progress we have seen in the middle east in the past week and that the bush administration is in the process of setting up meetings with dr
abbas in washington it hardly seems wise to pass a bill barring the newly elected president of the palestinian authority from the country
section 203 calls for the linking of databases and creates a floor for the requirements of what can be included in the database
mr speaker i rise in support of the war supplemental appropriations act but must voice my incredible misgivings for what the republican majority has attached to legislation that should solely be about how we provide for our brave men and women in harm s way in iraq and afghanistan
there is much in this bill to be proud of
they have accomplished much more than we could have ever hoped for and if any fault needs to be assigned it is to the policy makers and not to those in uniform
however i am ashamed that this body has taken something as important as securing our troops and attached a hastily considered immigration provision that will result in massive unfunded mandates being passed on to our states
finally i am ashamed that this congress has turned its back on a promise made by our president to the palestinian authority to help improve the situation of the palestinian people and further the cause of peace for all in the middle east
i am also dismayed that rather than seeking to be responsible stewards of the public s trust the republican majority in charge of congress once again decided to ignore its oversight responsibilities
truman went against a democratic administration and saved our military and our tax payers billions of dollars in waste and fraud
reconstructing iraq and afghanistan is too important not to get it right but confronted yet again with evidence of massive fraud and egregious war profiteering my republican colleagues are again choosing to bury their heads in the sand plug their ears and turn out the lights on our duty
mr speaker the new president of the palestinian authority is in an almost untenable position
in order for palestinian democracy to succeed over radical terrorism president abbas must be provided with the resources to open hospitals create jobs arm a police force build jails and take the fight to the terrorists
i hope for the sake of peace we can correct this colossal error in judgment and that the president and the state department speak out against congress illadvised policy making on this most tragic conflict
it has little to do with homeland security and it represents just the latest in a string of antiimmigrant proposals so unfortunately popular with certain of our republican colleagues
as assistant police chief rudy landeros testified in allowing the community the opportunity to obtain driver s licenses they will have to pass a driver s test and that will make them not only informed drivers but safer drivers the texas legislature in a bill by former representative miguel wise wisely recognized that requiring all drivers to obtain licenses would make texas families safer
had it not been for the veto by texas s myopic governor this commonsense call for public safety would be the law in the president s home state
paula waddle an immigration attorney in the rio grande valley explained that her clients are having delays of as much as 15 months in getting their legal permanent residency papers because of confusion at the department of homeland security
if these legal immigrants do not have sufficient paperwork to prove their legal status they will be caught up in this same web of antiimmigrant fervor and denied the opportunity to obtain insurance and drive
but since current law already bars those who presnet a secruity risk from getting asylum the additional restrictions in this bill would not make us safer
we must not sacrifice our democracy in a misguided attempt to save it
mr speaker i rise in strong support of this rule which will simply allow us to consider general debate and in 7 minutes we are going to be up in the committee on rules considering a number of those issues that the gentleman from florida just raised deciding what it is that we will debate here on the house floor tomorrow
so the process is still ongoing and members are involved in that and it is one that we look forward to considering before too long
the five most important words in the middle of the preamble of the us constitution are provide for the common defense and securing our borders is a priority and it should be of any sovereign nation
unfortunately our friends in the other body decided not to include provisions that would provide guidelines to ensure that the likes of mohammed atta who flew a plane into the world trade center just days before he was to appear in court because of a traffic violation that he had had with a driver s license that was something that we felt strongly should have been incorporated to rectify that in the 911 commission recommendations
unfortunately our colleagues in the other body chose to ignore that
unfortunately our colleagues in the other body refused to accept that
i am supporting this effort on border security in part because i am convinced that we will be able to down the road and i hope soon address the immigration reform question
i happen to believe that it is important for us to identify the people who are here in this country illegally
and yes i am opposed to granting blanket amnesty as is president bush but i do believe that moving in the direction of some sort of worker program is something that we must look at and must address
but we are taking a proper step in finally doing what we wanted to have incorporated in the 911 commission package that we passed out of here and i congratulate all my colleagues who have been involved in this
mr speaker i rise in strong support of this rule
if we look at the amendments that were submitted to the committee on rules and those that we have made in order it is fascinating
we made half of the amendments in order that were proposed by the democrats those were the priorities established and 33 percent of the amendments made in order that were submitted by the republicans
we had a very lengthy hearing in the committee on rules which was available for all of the members we had that streamed online
i think in light of that we are going to have an opportunity to consider these measures and i want to say that i think we have some amendments that are very very important that do need to be addressed
we did make in order the amendment by the gentleman from california mr farr xz4001290 my colleague which calls for steps that would prevent the completion of the 35 mile gap in the 14mile fence that goes along the border from the pacific ocean to the otai mesa in san diego
it is a fence wherein actually the provision for it was signed into law by president clinton back in 1997 and that was done with strong bipartisan support
i worked with my colleagues the gentleman from california mr hunter xz4001910 and our colleague mr ose in the last congress who was very involved in this and i just 10 weeks ago flew with tj bonner the president of the national border patrol council over this gap in the fence
now the argument that is going to be used on the fence issue and we will be bringing that up in just a little while has to do with the environment
there are people who say that we need to keep all of these environmental constraints in place which have prevented completion of the fence
this bird has chosen to nest on part of the fence and for that reason they can not complete the fence and it has allowed people to come in
we have seen that border in what is known as the tijuana estuary devastated environmentally
there is all kinds of trash in there and the environmental vote mr speaker is to vote against the farr amendment in favor of completion of the fence
i introduced legislation hr 100 to deal with something known as the saint cyr decision that is included in the manager s amendment and what that does basically the provision that we have in the manager s amendment will finally get to the point where the appellate courts are the courts of jurisdiction and we will not see consistent appeals
in the manager s amendment we will be able to rectify that very very important issue that does need to be addressed
mr speaker let me say there was a lot of discussion as to whether or not we were going to make the nadler amendment in order as my friend knows
i will tell the gentleman there were 10 amendments submitted by members of the minority and six of those 10 amendments were in fact withdrawn
we made in order two of the four amendments that remained at the committee level
we had on our side 10 amendments that were submitted and we have only made three of our amendments in order of the original 10 that were submitted
that is why i am arguing that we have in fact really gone the extra mile to ensure that the rights of the minority are respected
we came this close when we had strong support 257 members of this body in the last congress who voted for the ose amendment that should have been included in the 911 committee s recommendation in the conference agreement that we had
the other body prevented us when we were working in the conference to bring it back here
smugglers gulch is an area which is i believe posing a very serious threat to our stability in this country and in california
mr chairman as someone who for the past 2 years has represented over 40 000 soldiers at fort hood texas who have fought for our country in iraq i am deeply appreciative of the expeditious manner in which the gentleman from california chairman lewis the gentleman from wisconsin mr obey xz4003000 the gentleman from florida chairman young and the gentleman from pennsylvania mr murtha xz4002860 have worked together to pass this important piece of legislation
this bill sends a very clear message to our troops in harm s way that while americans may have differences of opinion about the iraqi war the fact is that we are all unified when it comes to seeing that our troops in harm s way have all of the support that they need and deserve to do their mission and to come home safely to their families
in the area of responsibility for the subcommittee on which i serve under the committee on appropriations the military quality of life and veterans affairs and related agencies subcommittee i wholeheartedly support the language and funding in this bill
under our subcommittee is 31 billion in funding 175 million of which goes to the department of defense health care system to deal with the direct increased costs for health care for our wounded troops coming home 15 billion to pay for housing allowance for our guard and reserve soldiers and their families and 13 billion in military construction needed in iraq and afghanistan and throughout our country to support our war against terrorism
while we put 175 million in the dod part of this budget to take care of extra dod health care costs there is not a dime in this supplemental appropriation bill to help the veterans administration deal with the cost of dealing with 48 000 and still counting troops who have needed va health care
i do not think that money ought to come out of the hide of va health care services to other veterans and i do not think we should cut corners in terms of quality of care for iraqi and afghanistan war veterans once they have left the department of defense system and gone into the va system
in committee we heard some say the va is flush with money
i have looked into that statement and the fact is that the va is presently laying off hundreds of employees in the va medical system and taking money out of their equipment accounts to fund their personnel accounts
during time of war and in the spirit of this bill supporting our troops not only when they are in the combat zone but when they return home i think in that spirit we ought to as this bill goes to conference committee look specifically at what additional needs the va health care system needs provide the quality medical care that these troops need
mr speaker i rise in support of the bill although i am disgusted with the antiimmigration provisions in it particularly the things with the driver s licenses
mr speaker i rise in support of this supplemental appropriations bill but not without very serious misgivings
i will vote for this legislation because it contains support for our troops in the field and important tsunami relief
with american soldiers in harm s way i am very reluctant to vote against funding of military operations
and having personally seen the devastation in the wake of the tsunami in indonesia i feel that aid to the victims is critical
nevertheless i am disgusted by the process by which this legislation came to the floor and by the immigrationrelated provisions in the bill
the republicans are clamoring in the senate about the lack of up or down votes on judges and today they denied the house not only an up or down vote on the socalled real id act but even a real debate on this issue
they impose onerous restrictions on foreign nationals in the us not to mention upon american citizens and slap a massive unfunded mandate upon the states
america is a nation of immigrants and our strength is in our diversity
i therefore strongly oppose these id and immigrationrelated sections and pledge to fight hard in the future to remove the offensive provisions from the law
in the end as a legislator i must vote on the bill in front of me and in this instance i must vote for the vital funding contained in this bill
but mr speaker please know that i will work hard in the day ahead to strike the dangerously flawed sections from the code
mr chairman i rise today in opposition to hr 418
had the provisions of hr 418 been in place prior to september 11 2001 they would not have stopped a single one of the 19 terrorists
hr 418 would force virtually every adult in the united states to go to the dmv to get a new driver s license and with 14 000 local jurisdictions in this country currently issuing identification it would be impossible to impose a single standard within in the threeyear limit in the bill
the problem is this legislation never had a hearing in committee never had public review
we have never looked at the language i doubt that any members have read the bill in its entirety
i have heard statements here on the floor that the recommendations in this bill are in the 911 commission
this is a precedent that has never been done before in the united states congress
here is a country that celebrated the tearing down of the berlin wall a country that celebrated the elections in iraq so people will have the rule of law and then when we have the rule of law we just waive it
the border fence in san diego is under construction right now
in order to finish the fence the customs and border patrol has proposed to fill a canyon known as smugglers gulch with over 2 million cubic yards of dirt
in february 2004 the coastal commission of california determined that the customs and border patrol had not demonstrated among other things that the project was consistent to maximize to the extent practicable with the policies of the california coastal management program the state program approved under the federal coastal zone management act
the coastal zone management act requires federal agency activity within and outside the coastal zone that affects any land use water or other natural resources in the coastal zone to be carried out in a manner that is consistent to the maximum extent practicable with the policies of an approved state management program
however as stringent as these requirements are if a federal court finds a federal activity to be inconsistent with an improved state program the secretary determines that the compliance is unlikely to be achieved through mediation the president may exempt from compliance the activity if the president determines that the activity is in the paramount interest of the united states
all the authority needed to build the barrier fence already exists in law
in that meeting the customs and border patrol explained why they did not believe additional comments other than those that had already been agreed upon were necessary to bring the project into compliance with the applicable coastal policies
coastal commission informed customs that in order to complete the federal consistency review process they would have to write a letter outlining their position
i ask because the reach of this amendment is actually the border fence in san diego
the proposed section 102 gives an unprecedented waiver and power to the secretary of homeland security not only for the border fence in san diego but for any any area
as i mentioned there is no evidence that such an extraordinary rejection of the rule of law is necessary in the first instance
this provision has never to date been used in san diego nor am i aware at any other time the authority has been used on the barrier fence
so the remedies are there they are in the law
we forget in this debate that mexico is the number one trading partner of california
it is the busiest border in the world for the legitimate transfer of people and commerce and it is in the city and county of san diego and neither of those jurisdictions has asked for this draconian waiver
how can we celebrate elections in iraq and the honor of law when we in congress are now asking that we waive all laws
mr chairman i rise today in strong opposition to hr 418 and i urge my colleagues to do the same
if passed the secretary has the sole discretion to wave all laws in order to expedite the construction of barriers and roads
there is no evidence that such an extraordinary rejection of the rule of law is necessary in the first instance
i do not support illegal immigration but i do support the people who have come to our country and played by the rules in order to obtain their citizenship status
not only do we have a responsibility and a proud history of protecting those who seek asylum in our country which this bill is trying to thwart we have a responsibility to legal immigrants who are contributing to our society to reduce the lengthy backlog to citizenship
just earlier this week in meeting with some bureau of citizenship and immigration services employees i was not surprised to learn that workers who were hired to help eliminate the backlog four years ago have been asked to stay on for another year
i also the effects of the real id act are not only bad for domestic politics they are destructive for the peace process in the middle east
the act states an alien who is an officer official representative or spokesman of the palestine liberation organization is considered for purposes of this act to be engaged in a terrorist activity in the first place the united states already has a formal congressionally approved mechanism for designating foreign terrorist organizations and imposing sanctions on them
second we are now on the cusp of a historic moment in the middle east peace process
the administration has promised that they will be actively engaged in the middle east peace process
i find it hard to believe that they can be actively engaged in the peace process if the president will not be able to invite newly elected president mahmoud abbas to his texas ranch camp david or any other location within the united states
president abbas appears to be making considerable efforts in brokering peace and the united states should be supporting his efforts
the effects of this provision will be a diplomatic nightmare and damage the united states s ability to be a fair broker in the peace process
furthermore i have concerns with the national driver s license standards in this bill
national driver s license standards in this bill create an unfunded mandate for states
state control of the licensing and identification process is crucial to maintaining public safety bolstering security reducing fraud keeping costs of car insurance down and protecting privacy and federal standards for such documents should be limited to those enumerated in the intelligence reform act of 2004
leadership should be ashamed to have brought a bill like this that will affect our environment our citizens and people from all around the world to the floor in such a manner
the opposition on this side is not against the fence it is against emasculating all the laws of the land in order to get there
specifically this memorandum discusses the extent to which congress has passed laws that provide waivers comparable to 102 of hr 418 and outlines some of the legal issues that could potentially arise if 102 hr 418 102 section 102 of hr 418 would amend 102 c of iirira to read as follows c waiver 1 in general notwithstanding any other provision of law the secretary of homeland security shall have the authority to waive and shall waive all laws such secretary in such secretary s sole discretion determines necessary to ensure expeditious construction of the barriers and roads under this section
this provision could provide the secretary with broader waiver authority than what is currently in 102 c of iirira
this authority would apparently include laws other than the endangered species act and the national environmental policy act but may not include a waiver of protections established in the constitution
other courts however have held that such provisions are generally not dispositive in determining the preemptive effect of a statute
much more common it appears are waiver provisions that 1 exempt an action from other requirements contained in the act that authorizes the action 2 specifically delineate the laws to be waived or 3 waive a grouping of similar laws
2008 allows the president to waive provisions of federal law he deems necessary in the national interest to facilitate the construction or operation of crude oil transportation systems but such waivers must be submitted to congress and congress must pass a joint resolution before the president can act on the waivers
as mentioned above and as the examples we have set forth arguably demonstrate the breadth of waiver authority granted by 102 of hr 418 does not appear to be common in the federal law searched
the preclusion of judicial review in state court and of state claims appears buttressed by the fact that 102 c is explicitly intended to preclude judicial review of nonstatutory laws a term which would seem to imply the inclusion of state constitutional and common law claims
it is generally accepted that article iii of the united states constitution grants congress the authority to regulate the jurisdiction procedures and remedies available in federal courts
however what remains uncertain is whether congress s authority pursuant to article iii extends to with respect to congress s ability to control the jurisdiction of state courts the supreme court has ruled that subject to a congressional provision to the contrary state courts have concurrent jurisdiction over all the classes of cases and controversies enumerated in article iii except for suits between states suits in which either the united states or a foreign state is a party and those considered within the traditional jurisdiction of admiralty law
in other words if for example congress can make jurisdiction over an area of law exclusively federal thereby depriving state courts of any ability to hear the claim it appears that congress may also be able to remove a cause of action from state courts without concurrently granting jurisdiction to the federal courts
this independent status has led some scholars to argue that because the constitution appears to reserve to the states the authority to control the jurisdiction of their own courts congress s only means of allocating jurisdiction is through control of the federal court s jurisdiction the argument that state courts are autonomous can be derived in part from the supreme court s doctrine with respect to its ability to review decisions from turning to congress s ability to remove jurisdiction with respect to claims arising under the constitution it appears that supreme court precedent requires that at least some forum be provided for the redress of constitutional rights
at least one justice however has indicated that there have been particular cases such as political question cases where all constitutional review is in effect precluded
for example in cases involving particular rights such as the availability of effective remedies for fifth amendment takings the court has held that the compensation remedy is required by the constitution in addition lower federal courts appear to have held that in most cases some forum must be provided for the vindication of constitutional rights
cases such as these would seem to provide a basis for the court to find that parties seeking to vindicate other particular rights must have a judicial forum for such challenges therefore the court may construe the provisions of hr 418 in a manner that preserves this right
mr speaker i rise today in opposition to the emergency supplemental appropriations hr 1268 on substance and process
i am strongly supportive of our fighting men and women and mourn the loss of nearly 1 600 americans who have died in iraq four of whom resided in my congressional district
on substance this bill fails to provide an exit strategy for our troops in iraq
since iraq held democratic elections in january the us should have been implementing an aggressive exit strategy that includes a timetable for the training of iraqi security forces so us troops can return home
moreover with nearly 10 billion already appropriated but not spent for critical reconstruction projects in iraq like rebuilding electrical grids and establishing telecommunications networks us policy objectives for iraqi independence are jeopardized
on process many of the items in this bill should be funded under the regular order in the annual appropriations cycle
i and many others in congress would like to have a rational debate on immigration reform but we are denied the opportunity when the leadership attaches nongermane immigration measures to a funding bill
to better demonstrate how the process has been hijacked by a minority of the majority many of the same provisions that constitute the real id provisions in the supplemental being considered today were stripped from the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act pl 108458 in conference because of their extreme nature
one of the most egregious provisions in the real id section of the supplemental is the blanket authority given to the secretary of homeland security to expedite construction of the remaining three miles of the southern border fence in san diego
all americans should be concerned that the dhs secretary has carte blanche authority to waive any and all laws in the name of border security
blanket authority to complete the three mile border fence is especially in your face politics when under current law the dhs secretary already has a national security waiver for the national environmental policy act and the endangered species act
furthermore the driver s license provisions of this bill touted in the name of national security are equally concerning
even if the real id provisions had been in place before the 911 attacks the hijackers still would have been able to obtain a driver s license or stateissued id
this socalled fence that you want to put in my district is really a giant public works project that does enormous harm
but no you want to put a public works project in that waives all existing environmental laws necessary to ensure the construction of roads barriers cut and fills taking down mountains
this would result in an enormous waste of millions of federal and state dollars that have already been contributed to restore and protect this area in san diego its historical its cultural its environmental resources
this sensitive habitat plays a vital role in the sustainability of the binational ecosystem
in addition to amounts otherwise appropriated in this act there is hereby appropriated for fiscal year 2005 for department of veterans affairs veterans health administration medical services 3 100 000 000 provided that the amounts provided under this section are designated as an emergency requirement pursuant to section 402 of the conference report to accompany s con
it is an emergency amendment because the money is needed for the veterans of this nation especially those who are returning from the war in iraq and afghanistan who may not be able to get the services they need for a variety of wounds both physical and mental
what it says is that just to keep meeting the needs for our current veterans and those who we expect to see in the coming year we will need an additional 31 billion than was allocated by the president in his budget
this is a supplemental budget for those fighting in iraq and afghanistan
here is what our first president george washington said and it has never been done more eloquently the willingness with which our young people are likely to serve in any war no matter how justified shall be directly proportional as to how they perceive the veterans of earlier wars were treated and appreciated by their country mr chairman the morale of our troops overseas depends on how we are going to treat their comrades when they return and how we treat their comrades who served in earlier battles
whether you look at the amount of nurses whether you look at research funds whether you look at the resources for posttraumatic stress disorder for which virtually every returning soldier marine who is in iraq and afghanistan may have wherever you look there is a deficiency in this veterans budget
right now we have a proposal from the president which advocates a mere onehalf of 1 percent increase in the veterans health care budget over the previous year
so we are cutting in real terms 15 percent from the veterans health care budget
doubling the copayments for prescription drugs adding an enrollment fee of up to 250 for those in the socalled lower categories of veterans preference
these veterans are supposedly in lower categories either because of the nature of their illness or their income
we are spending several billion dollars a week in iraq
that is what is happening in the va today
by definition it goes beyond whatever we did in the previous year
so one can use all the rules but what we are doing here is immoral it is unconscionable it is outrageous that we would be treating the veterans in this way
i do not have confidence in that regular order
the president asked for them and yet he did not put the money in to pay for them
in addition every veterans group and the va itself say to complete the year giving the services they need they need another 13 billion
this whole bill is a violation of the rules of the house except for the fact that it says in the bill it does not violate the rules
would this bill be a violation of the rules if there was not a waiver involved in the rules
once again i rise in support of the veterans of our nation
we have a major major major operation in iraq and afghanistan
our active duty are fighting but those who volunteer to go and help in other ways should have the preference that their veterans service offers
i outlined yesterday the lack of respect that they will have and continue to have because of lack of adequate funding in the health care system
that 3 billion was not added in yesterday s supplemental
let us give them the preference that they have in law at home with the preference for the contracts that are being awarded with such abandon in the middle east today
one way to make sure that this does not happen to anyone else is to include veterans in the rebuilding of iraq and afghanistan
let us get them involved in the effort to build the future
mr chairman i hope that the rules are not invoked here once again to stop a commonsense approach to helping our veterans in this nation
mr chairman in last year s appropriation bill that hospital was awarded close to 100 million for seismic refitting retrofitting for earthquake safety
mr chairman yes in last year s appropriation bill la jolla medical center was one of a variety of hospitals i think about two dozen
mr chairman if the gentleman would continue to yield look everybody wants efficiencies in this system but i will say for a paralyzed veteran with a spinal cord injury there is no better place than the va to get care
to keep that quality of care for those veterans requires investment in our system
in addition the only way i could judge the sincerity of the majority party in these issues is to see what they had done to the chairman of the committee i have sat on for the last 12 years that is the va committee
those of us who live in arizona know that our borders are simply not secure
but in the interim we certainly need to do some things and this amendment goes a long way toward doing them
all of us have viewed over the past couple of years the new technologies in land surveillance surface surveillance and they are promising
we need to make sure that they are employed in the best way possible and this amendment will go a long way toward ensuring that
mr chairman i rise today in support of the real id act and i thank the chairman for his courage and hard work on this vital measure
over a decade ago the ability of ramzi yousef the mastermind behind the 1993 world trade center bombing to be granted asylum and to move freely in the country should have signaled that something was terribly wrong with our system
the need for these reforms has been reiterated over and over and in expert testimony in anecdotal evidence from security professionals in scholarly research and in evidence presented from our nation s justice and military personnel
i strongly urge my colleagues to vote in favor of the real id act
we are in the process now after the election in iraq of trying to persuade the shiia who will be in the overwhelming majority to practice democracy not to abuse their majority but in fact to encourage members of the minority to participate
it is essential for us to be able to salvage what is going on in iraq for there to be an agreement on the part of the sunni muslims to participate
in other words we are telling the people of iraq that to practice democracy means respect for minority rights
and here we have the majority in the house of representatives a fairly narrow majority apparently contemplating forcing an upordown vote on controversial legislation maybe allowing one amendment clearly repressing the strong desire of the minority to be able fully to debate it
in the end the majority will decide but they do nt even want the debate
do not in the iraqi assembly show disrespect for the rights of the minority
this congress created the united states commission on international religious freedom in 1998
asylum seekers treated poorly us panel says thousands of people who come to the united states saying they are seeking refuge from persecution are treated like criminals while their claims are evaluated stripsearched shackled and often thrown into solitary confinement in local jails and federal detention centers a bipartisan federal commission found in a report to be released today
the report by the united states commission on international religious freedom an agency created by congress in 1998 describes an ad hoc system run by the department of homeland security that has extreme disparities in who is released or granted asylum depending on whether someone seeks refuge in texas or new york comes from iraq or haiti or is represented by a lawyer
the new york metropolitan region ranks among the harshest in terms of the conditions of detention centers with constant surveillance stark quarters and degrading treatment
for example 38 percent of asylum seekers were freed from the detention center in elizabeth nj compared with 94 percent in san antonio
there were 84 percent released from the detention center in queens while in chicago 81 percent were let go
i was taken aback by the severity of conditions the severity of deprivations and frankly the expense he said in an interview
he said that one of 19 centers examined handled asylum seekers differently from criminals in broward county fla where many seeking refuge are from cuba and where former cuban refugees form a potent political force
high commission for refugees he said in an interview
even better the detention system protects the public the commission had been asked by congress to examine the effectiveness of the nation s asylum regulations created in part as a response to the 1993 world trade center bombings in an effort to balance the country s desire to shelter those suffering from persecution abroad with its need to keep out criminals and terrorists
detainees represented by lawyers were up to 30 times more likely to gain asylum but in some places fewer than half the detainees had lawyers
with the exception of the operation at george bush intercontinental airport in houston the report found that asylum seekers were not pressed to withdraw their asylum claims before the interview nor were claims summarily denied
before the change in the law only asylum seekers with criminal records were detained
in 2003 5 585 men and 1 015 women seeking asylum were jailed
severe psychological damage is among the effects of throwing people seeking refuge together with criminals in stark conditions the report said describing 24hour lights chained walks to go eat no privacy even to use the toilet and little chance to exercise outdoors
in most places the treatment for those considered suicidal was solitary confinement
the whole detention system is there to break you down further one former detainee told interviewers in the report
since the 1996 change in immigration law critics have complained that the system is subjecting those fleeing torture and repression to harsh conditions in detention that can drag on for years
preeta d bansal a democrat who chaired the commission said more research is needed especially on the reasons for the sharp drop in asylum seekers
we have been told that in foreign countries the department of homeland security is being employed to prevent people from even getting on board airplanes said ms bansal a former solicitor general of new york state
we think further followup needs to be done the report comes the same week that asylum legislation is to be introduced in the house by representative f james sensenbrenner jr a wisconsin republican and chairman of the judiciary committee
leviticus 19 chapters 33 and 34 when an alien lives with you in your land do not mistreat him
love him as yourself for you were aliens in egypt now that is in leviticus
here we have it in leviticus
what we have is an undemocratic procedure being mobilized to suppress even debate and an opportunity to consider the report of this commission in the service of a doctrine which would seem to me to violate some fundamental religious principles
mr speaker hearing the chairman of the committee on rules describe this restricted rule as fair and balanced reinforces the fact that when people on the right in america politically tell you something is fair and balanced you had better ask for another deck of cards
and then when you let in two out of 10 or two out of six somehow you have been generous
ought not the assumption be in favor of openness especially since the house has not been doing very much
then the chairman said well we do not have to have long debate on these things after all we had a hearing in the committee on rules and it was streamed on line
anyone who thinks that a hearing in the committee on rules that is streamed on line is a substitute for open and free debate in the united states house of representatives or anyone who says that ought to remember i would give just one piece of advice
no matter how pressed one feels in a debate try to avoid saying something that no one is going to believe
no one thinks that an online hearing in the committee on rules with a handful of members in a room that has 30 seats substitutes for free and open debate in the house of representatives and particularly when you only give 10 minutes on a particular amendment
we heard a lot of discussion last year in the election from people complaining that religion had been driven from the public square
the provisions on asylum have evoked overwhelming opposition from the various religious communities in america
i noted yesterday that the commission on interreligious freedom set up by this congress to protect religious freedom in the world put out earlier this week a report saying that our asylum procedures are too restrictive
i noted yesterday in leviticus it says and i have looked at various translations various renderings and in every one it sometimes says stranger it sometimes says alien it is clear it means people we would describe as immigrants
i do not purport to be an expert in religious interpretation but i am puzzled
the real id act it says threatens the ability of victims of persecution to find safe haven in the united states signed by a variety of jewish and catholic and protestant groups the jesuit religious service the episcopal migration ministries the church world service the jubilee campaign the lutheran immigration and refugee service
real id act threatens ability of victims of persecution to find safe haven in the united states as representatives of various faith traditions we are deeply concerned that the real id act legislation proposed by representative jim sensenbrenner rwi would make asylum a more remote possibility for hundreds of persons who need protection
each of our traditions has witnessed the suffering of persons whose beliefs often place them in jeopardy and possibly in mortal danger
as americanbased faith communities we have cherished the ability of asylum seekers to find safety in communities around our nation
the belief that we must receive persons who have been rejected and persecuted because of their ideas and religious practices is anchored in both our histories and sacred texts
we therefore reject legislation that subverts hospitality in the name of security
the changes proposed by the real id act raise a false issue in further victimizing legitimate asylum seekers
but in any case i do want to stress those of you who have said we have insufficiently paid attention to religious values mr speaker i urge them not to turn their back on the religious community now and not to give the religious communities a broad range of them 10 minutes in which we can make the case that this bill violates biblical injunctions about aliens and undercuts our mission to be a haven for the religiously persecuted
mr speaker i rise in strong support of hr 1268 making supplemental appropriations to ensure that our forces who are hard at work in iraq and afghanistan and elsewhere have the tools they need to do their job and are well protected
mr speaker this week we witnessed the establishment of iraq s first democratically elected government in over half a century and their swearing in
this event is yet another historic milestone in iraq s progress toward a representative and transparent government
however while it pales in comparison to the sacrifices of our brave men and women in the field there is another part of the equation
this sum will pay for the troop deployment repair and replace damaged vehicles being chewed up in an extreme harshly operating environment replenish stores of munitions and supplies and provide additional armor for vehicles improved communications gear and more nightvision equipment
but while our young men and women in uniform appreciate our vocal support they need this bill
shall we live within the boundaries that we have set for ourselves and set an example for our generation today and the future or should we ignore those boundaries that we have imposed upon ourselves and spend in excess
right now we are in the process as we know of doing the budget for next year the 2006 budget
and so i think it is fitting and appropriate that we look at the supplemental today and the amendment that i have presented to see whether or not we will fit within that budget confines whether or not we will fit within that area or instead will we exceed it and say that a budget really is nothing more than a charade and not explain exactly what we will be spending for any point in time
let me just say that i applaud the chairman and i applaud the members of the committee for doing what they said they would do as has been reported in the paper
what would a family do today if they faced emergency expenditures like we are looking at in the supplemental right now families who maybe have to see extra car payments or medical expenses
if we look in the supplemental there are a number of points in there that have already been raised by others
i would ask this as we stand here before the world as a body saying that we are going to do the charitable thing and give money to the tsunami victims are we really exercising any charity there when we in fact say we re not going to be paying for it we re asking our kids and our grandkids to pay for it in excessive spending and deficit spending in future generations
again i applaud the chairman for the good start that they have done in this committee by scrubbing the budget and trying to find some offsets
i would simply say can we not do a little bit better and find completely all offsets for all of the spending that we are doing aside from the military defense spending for all the excessive spending in the bill
i would ask can we not find twotenths of 1 percent of waste fraud and abuse in the entire fiscal budget that we are operating under right now
we ask families to do it for their budgets we ask businesses to do it for their budgets i think we can find that entire amount of approximately 4 billion of waste fraud and abuse in the entire budget offset it and then we can truly stand before the world and say that when we are making charitable contributions to the tsunami relief victims that it is truly coming from this generation and not being passed on to future generations
mr chairman i am sorry i should have stepped in before the gentleman stood up to say in light of knowing the rules of the house that i was about to withdraw the amendment
mr speaker i want to thank both the chairman and the ranking member for this bill especially for its iraqi dollars because this bill analyzes microscopically the kinds of equipment that is needed there now and then surgically targets those dollars in a vastly efficient manner for our troops
mr speaker i would like to address the 17 million included in the supplemental that we are considering today which will support the expansion of the us tsunami warning network
these funds will help noaa to procure and deploy tsunami detection buoys in a system designed to provide continuous tsunami warning capability for both the pacific and atlantic coasts of the united states
when south asia was struck by tsunami waves on december 26 the world s interest in tsunami detection and warning systems was heightened
it is critical that individuals in highrisk areas are educated about and prepared for tsunamis before they strike
in contrast developed nations use increasing technological sophistication to acquire from the sea its bounty with little thought for the longterm sustainability of this activity
in time without increased understanding of our ocean ecosystems and the impact of our harvest and extraction of its resources developed nations may also come to fear the sea
new technologies have already led to enormous advances in our understanding of the coastal and marine environment
since the us hosted the earth observation summit in july 2003 we have been working with our partner nations to adopt a comprehensive coordinated and sustained earth observation system to collect and disseminate data information and models for more effective and responsible use of our resources as well as to inform decisionmakers about impending disasters
most recently the us commission on ocean policy made an integrated ocean observing system a top recommendation in its report an ocean blueprint for the 21st century
i rise in full support of the rule and the underlying bill
i remind my colleagues on the other side of the aisle who keep saying we are not given enough time and we are rushing all of these complicated issues that we have not discussed but these provisions i remind my colleagues they were in the original bill that we passed on the house side the intel bill
we are asking to do the things that the 911 commission all 10 of them in their unanimous report asked us to do
listen to this if terrorist travel options are reduced they may be forced to rely on means of interaction which can be more easily monitored and to resort to travel documents which are more readily detectable the 911 commission report page 65 all but one of the 911 hijackers acquired some form of united states identification document some by fraud acquisition of these forms of identification would have assisted them in boarding commercial flights renting cars and other necessary activities
she rode on that subway every day going back and forth to work he was quoted as saying i want at least 1 000 to 2 000 to die in a single day and that alien had applied for asylum
mr speaker i wanted to come to the floor today to speak in favor of reforming our system for asylum and against the move to strike the necessary reforms incorporated in hr 418
it has been suggested throughout out this debate yesterday and today that because there is no specific recommendation made by the 911 commission to reform our asylum system that we in congress should do nothing to fix it
that in my opinion is insane
my colleagues and friends on the other side of the isle suggest we stick our heads in the sand and ignore one of the tools used by terrorists to gain access to and remain in our country
it quickly became clear that yousef had been a central player in the attack
he had fled to pakistan immediately after the bombing and would remain at large for nearly two years later in the report it talks about the outdated immigration benefits system when doris meissner became ins commissioner in 1993 she found
finally terrorists in the 1990s as well as the september 11 hijackers needed to find a way to stay in or embed themselves in the united states if their operational plans were to come to fruition this could be accomplished
in many cases the act of filing for an immigration benefit such as claiming asylum sufficed to permit the alien to remain in the country until the petition was adjudicated
terrorists were free to conduct surveillance coordinate operations obtain and receive funding go to school and learn english make contacts in the united states acquire necessary materials and execute an attack so if i am to understand my friends on the other side we are to ignore the problem of asylum abuse and do nothing
mr chairman i rise in opposition to hr 418
why would the national council of bishops here in the states come out against this
but more importantly and i really believe this this is an antiimmigrant bill in the guise of some sort of security consideration which it does not further
look in the mirror
mr chairman i rise today in support of hr 418 the real id act
that legislation helped to streamline the intelligence community and tightened some asylum rules that allowed potential terrorists to remain in our country
we know that mohamed atta and his gang of terrorists exploited weak identification rules and as stated in the 911 commission report all but one of the 911 hijackers acquired some form of identification document some by fraud hr 418 will require that federal agencies only accept licenses and stateissued id cards when states have determined that the holder is lawfully present in the country
mr chairman i come to the floor today to speak in support of the real id act
it is clear that in order to secure our country from terrorists we need to reform the requirements and standards for driver s licenses
in every state the driver s license and its counterpart the state id card is the primary document used to establish identity and proof of legal residence
in addition to establishing standards for the issuance of licenses hr 418 includes provisions to prevent terrorists from gaming our asylum system
court decisions in recent years have so distorted the asylum process that terrorists are now able to claim asylum specifically because they are terrorists
mr chairman i believe it is important that all groups and organizations that want to assist in the recovery are allowed to participate
the united states agency for international development issued a regulation on october 19 2004 that ensures religious organizations are allowed to compete on an equal footing with other nongovernmental organizations for usaid funding in the case of this bill funding to help tsunami victims
mr chairman i rise today in strong opposition to hr 418
section 102 of this bill would eliminate homeland security and border patrol s responsibility to inform and involve communities in proposed construction projects along the entire us border and the requirement to consider less harmful alternatives to proposed actions
this would allow homeland security to operate in secrecy in critically important areas such as cabeza prieta and buenos aires national wildlife refuge and organ pipe national monument that are all in my district
in addition this section would waive laws requiring consultations with native nations regarding activities on tribal lands grave sites or archaeological and sacred sites
finally in a rush to deport anyone hr 418 would deny due process for immigrants and asylum seekers
it is against what we stand for and it is against what we are asking the world to replicate in democracy across this earth
mr chairman i rise today in strong opposition to hr 418
hr 418 also ignores the reality that there are an estimated 10 million or more undocumented immigrants living in our country
if anything this bill will only further compound the flaws in our nation s immigrations laws
in short immigration enforcement will continue to expend their valuable but limited resources and energy in pursuing hardworking busboys and nannies instead of bad actors who mean us real harm
immigration officers represent our frontline forces in protecting our homeland
i agree that congress must examine how to improve enforcement of immigration law but we first must create laws that are enforceable and in step with reality
i am not alone in my strong opposition to this misguided and meanspirited legislation
we dealt with this issue responsibly in the intelligence reform legislation
just 2 weeks ago an astute crane operator at the port of los angeles discovered 32 chinese stowaways in a container that had just been unloaded from a panamanian freighter
i urge my colleagues to retain the real id provisions in the intelligence reform bill and reject this imposter
rather than reaching out to the governor of california a leader in the party on the other side of the aisle to reach compromise on this issue the author of this bill has crafted language that will usurp all of governor schwarzenneger s power regarding the border fence
according to the language in this legislation it is all areas along and in the vicinity of our international borders with both mexico and canada
driver s licenses have become the primary identification document in the united states enabling individuals to get other identity documents transfer funds to a us bank account obtain access to federal buildings and other vulnerable facilities purchase a firearm rent a car and board a plane
lax standards and loopholes in the current issuance processes allow terrorists to obtain driver s licenses often multiple licenses from different states and abuse the license for identification purposes
the real id act would require applicants to provide proof they are in the country legally
currently eleven states do not have such a requirement meaning a majority of states have already recognized the need for tighter standards but unnecessary and dangerous gaps in the system still exist
the real id act would require identity documents to expire at the same time as the expiration of lawful entry status preventing those who have illegally entered or are unlawfully present in the us from having valid identification documents
rahman used an asylum application to avoid deportation to egypt after all other means of remaining in the us failed
he was quoted as saying that i want at least 1 000 to 2 000 to die in one day the alien had applied for asylum
in 1996 congress approved building the 14 mile long san diego border fence on the mexicous border right next to a major us navy base
therefore if an alien seeking a visa has been found to participate in certain terroristrelated activity heshe is prohibited from entering the us but if an alien is found to have participated in the same terrorist activity in the us heshe may not be deportable
the antiimmigrant provisions contained in this bill are unconscionable
we find ourselves in the second week of the second month of this legislative session and we have yet to have a bill come to the floor with an open rule
the changes to asylum law contained in hr 418 will not improve our homeland security
terrorists do not have the right to seek asylum in our country and are already prohibited from doing so but those who would legitimately seek refuge at our shores ought not to be turned away from our golden door through this bill s misguided attempt at curbing immigration
the collection of unnecessary personal information by state agencies in an attempt to discern each and every person s immigration standard goes against the very freedom this nation was founded on by immigrants and must be rejected
our nation s security is of paramount importance but in an effort to achieve that goal let us a thriving nation of immigrants not turn our backs on our history and our future
so before we replace the statue of liberty s torch with a do not enter sign let us reconsider in the most open of debates what that says about our great nation
i would say to my colleague from texas mr gohmert xz4006510 i have not had an opportunity to talk to him and i simply want to point out to him that all of us that have feelings regarding states rights line up in many respects alike
mr speaker the gentleman from georgia and i are on the committee on rules and we know this measure did not come up until 2 hours just before we went in there
mr speaker i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from texas mr hinojosa xz4001790 who lives in south texas and is on the texasmexican border and may have some experiences in this regard
there are 43 new members in the house of representatives who have absolutely no opportunity to have voiced themselves regarding this matter
the gentleman from wisconsin s mr sensenbrenner xz4003650 manager s amendment came to the committee on rules 2 hours before we had an opportunity to see it and i would urge in the house how many have read it even at this point
more importantly mr speaker the immigration and naturalization service bice in the authorized budget that we presented to the president it required 800 new officials for that agency
only 143 are in the president s budget
i also include for the record the national conference of state legislatures letter in opposition and the national governors association and american association of motor vehicle administrators opposition to this measure
additionally there are others who are too numerous to mention without great prolixity but i will cite in the record some of the organizations that oppose this measure the aflcio the american jewish committee the antidefamation league the asian american legal defense and education fund catholic charities usa and catholic bishops hebrew immigrant aid society the irish american unity conference the korean american coalition the mexican american legal defense and educational fund and a footnote all of the colleagues in the house that are latino and african american have signed on to a letter opposing this measure the national conference of state legislatures that i just mentioned the national council of la raza the service employees international union the arabamerican antidiscrimination committee
and in addition thereto in case someone thinks that there are a whole bunch of left wing crazies that are out here trying to protect the personal rights of individuals the gunowners of america association opposes this measure and the american conservative union
any federal standards should be narrowly limited to those areas enumerated in the federal act and should in no way limit the ability of states to innovate to strengthen the integrity of document verification and issuance
ncsl will oppose any federal legislative or regulatory effort to require states to adopt specific model legislation or participate in an interstate compact
ncsl believes that the federal government does have a significant role in assisting states with matters regarding noncitizens and their qualification for and use of stateissued driver s licenses and identification cards
states need direct links to verifiable timely and accurate date regarding status duration of stay application for change in status and related information
without these changes states can not be expected to nor be held accountable for providing enhanced security in their driver s license application and issuance processes this discussion has rekindled debate and concern about the development of a national identification card or national driver s license
therefore ncsl supports a federal role in providing technical support highlighting successful models facilitating discussion and providing necessary funding for changes made at the discretion of the states
the driver s licenses and personal identification cards provision in the intelligence reform act of 2004 provides a workable framework for developing meaningful standards to increase reliability and security of driver s licenses and id cards
this framework calls for input from state elected officials and motor vehicle administrators in the regulatory process protects state eligibility criteria and retains the flexibility necessary to incorporate best practices from around the states
we have begun to work with the us department of transportation to develop the minimum standards which must be completed in 18 months pursuant to the intelligence reform act
the framework in the intelligence reform act of 2004 will allow us to work cooperatively with the federal government to develop and implement achievable standards to prevent document fraud and other illegal activity related to the issuance of driver s licenses and id cards
we urge you to allow the provisions in the intelligence reform act of 2004 to work
mr speaker my colleagues on the other side for the balance of these arguments today and during yesterday said very frequently and it was repeated again by the gentleman from texas that the horrible people that were on the airplanes that did the dastardly deed here in america on september 11 had collectively 63 driver s licenses
but one of the things that goes ignored is the fact that in the days before 911 including that day airport review of driver s licenses did not occur and therefore it is a total irrelevancy
they were in this country some on expired visas some with visas that had been approved and probably one or two with fraudulent visas
what in the world did driver s licenses have to do with it
in fact the number of proposed amendments has been sharply limited as well
only a fourth of the amendments submitted to the committee on rules will be allowed on the floor today and what possible reason can the majority give for limiting debate in this matter
surely given the drastic nature of the changes to our asylum laws contained in hr 418 it is in the best interests of the country to hold an open debate on this legislation
mr speaker last wednesday the chairman of the committee on rules sent out an announcement notifying members as is his responsibility that all their proposed amendments to this bill were due in the committee on rules by noon on tuesday february 8 all members who submitted their amendments republicans and democrats followed this rule all members that is except the gentleman from wisconsin chairman sensenbrenner
in the short time we have had to review this new language it appears to be more controversial than the bill s original provisions
it also allows a person to be denied asylum based on any inconsistencies or falsehoods in their testimony whether or not these inconsistencies are relevant to the person s claim
i continue to harp on the fact that it does not protect children who are here and in need of asylum consideration
it does not protect women who are in forced slavery and prostitution and are raped
and it places in the hands of one judge the judging of their credibility
the other thing ignored is the difficulty that the criteria set forth in hr 418 present to asylum seekers legitimate asylum seekers to collect information regarding their birth records
in the district that i represent more than a quarter of the work done in the district offices involves immigration and one of the things that we find it difficult to accomplish is to have the people in a timely manner who are seeking status and naturalization in this country collect their birth records and records of a variety of things in their communities that simply are not there and are unavailable and therefore their claims are delayed repeatedly
right this minute our troops are in harm s way to further democracy in a faroff country while democracy here in the halls of congress is being shoved out the door
none of us are of a mind to believe that the completion of the 3mile gap in that wall should not be undertaken
mr speaker how many more laws will we override in the name of homeland security
none of us would argue that we should not do everything to protect the homeland but rightly we should not argue to ignore the laws that also protect us in this homeland
in this age of diminished personal privacy this bill throws around terms such as mandatory facial image capture and electronic storage of identity source documents without fully explaining and it is not explained and i ask anybody to explain it on the majority side certainly for the american public explaining fully how all this captured data will be used and by whom
they came from places where notorious persecution and violation of human rights occurred like haiti and cuba and they have worked hard as many immigrants in this country who sought asylum to create a new life for themselves and their families
he did not falter in any of his principles with reference to this matter and he went forward in a dignified manner to answer the questions asked
he said the key to protecting our homeland is enforcing the immigration laws let me repeat the quote the key to protecting our homeland is enforcing the immigration laws now the gentleman from wisconsin chairman sensenbrenner knows that president bush has proposed a budget that rather than fulfilling what we said would protect our homeland by having 2 000 border patrol persons and an added number 800 ins or bice their new name to their rolls so that we could enforce the immigration laws what do we get in the proposed budget
what i am saying is let us put our emphasis where it ought to be and let us not divert ourselves in this manner and certainly let us not continue to shut all of those organizations from the governors association all the way back across the board that are opposed to this law let us not shut them out from having an opportunity to present themselves at a hearing
let us not shut out the people here in the house of representatives some 41 who are newly here who have no idea what we did with reference to this matter last year and have not had time in order to be able to review it sufficient to be able to make arguments on behalf of their constituencies in a satisfactory manner
but i was in that same process as the chairman was in the committee on rules
it eliminates federal court review in many conventions against torture cases and it eliminates the power of the federal appeals court judges to stay the removal of asylum seekers
mr speaker reclaiming my time before the chairman leaves just one further word in that regard
i take from the many times when the chairman was in the minority his statement to heart and that is that if a rule is not open it is closed
and i could go on and on and on in the clark working group and the 911 report and not one word not one word regarding any driver s licenses
people that are going to do harm in this nation are not going to do anything other than everything that is fraudulent
it is nothing but 81 billion of chaos blanketed in loftysounding phrases like tsunami relief and supporting our troops actually this bill represents a mockery of the democratic process
the only unforeseen cost contained in this 81 billion dollar boondoggle is the 656 million for tsunami relief
both congress and the administration have known for months that 75 billion in the bill for the wars in iraq and afghanistan would be needed but we did nt put it in the budget
the administration once claimed the war in iraq would cost 17 billion
tomorrow the house is going to consider a budget resolution that like the previous year fails to include adequate funding for the war in iraq
the bush administration is hiding behind the rhetoric of supporting our troops to escape accountability for the war in iraq and the american people should be outraged
we should be embarrassed that members in this body are so willing to write blank checks to a president who has yet to justify how the 175 billion in already appropriated money in iraq and afghanistan has been spent
mr chairman i am even more appalled by the manner in which funding for clandestine operations is being carried out in this bill
i guess that means they will sell this bill on the altruistic notions of patriotism and humanitarianism in a snide attempt to drum up support
what about the six hundred million dollars to build the world s biggest embassy in baghdad
i can not in good conscience support legislation that for all we know might pour billions in the pockets of halliburton while depriving our troops of necessary resources
mr speaker i rise in favor of the rule and i rise in favor of the sessions amendment
mr speaker i appreciate the different views that we hear in the well of this house
mr speaker one of the reasons we are here on the floor visiting this issue today is as the distinguished chairman of the committee on rules pointed out while our founders believed that all men were created equal now we have the arcanities and absurdities of certain judicial procedures that allow illegal aliens to enjoy more legal privacy in some cases than do american citizens
i listened with great interest to other friends who came to offer scriptural and spiritual entreaties in this debate and i welcome that as well
in the wake of 911 in the wake of clear and demonstrable evidence that there are those who come to this nation with the intent of harming and killing americans who are bent on the destruction of our nation and our system of government at long last this body should take the steps necessary to preserve our security and our liberty
indeed mr speaker i came to this well in a previous congress lamenting the fact that at the behest of the other body we remove these important provisions from a piece of legislation passed at the end of the last session of congress
incrementalism in wartime is unacceptable
i rise in strong support of this conference report as the people s house at long last takes care of some unfinished business
in the closing days of the 108th congress some in the other body objected to commonsense provisions that deal with our national security and our border security to wit the notion that when you apply for a driver s license or another legal document you should be who you say you are and you should enjoy legal status in this country
chairman sensenbrenner has presented for the consideration of the house a commonsense bill that will disrupt travel of wouldbe terrorists who would seek to do us harm right here in america
during the conference with the other body on what became the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act of 2004 the provisions contained in hr 418 were either dropped in their entirety or modified so substantially as to virtually defeat the fundamental purpose of the provision
a majority of the conferees on the part of the house very reluctantly agreed in order to get a conference agreement on the fundamental reform of the nation s intelligence community
the enacted provision requires a negotiated rulemaking process without any absolute certitude that the negotiations on the proposed consensus regulations will be concluded by the date specified in the act
as some assert hr 418 does not require the asylum applicant to produce documentary evidence in order to be granted asylum
this glaring gap in the law must be closed
authorized by congress in 1996 it has yet to be completed because of ongoing environmental litigation
it is time to complete this much needed barrier to help secure one of the most used corridors for illegal entry which is adjacent to the numerous facilities of the united states navy and marine corps in san diego
mr chairman i rise in opposition to hr 418 the real id act
instead this legislation seeks to change immigration laws broadly and in ways unrelated to essential intelligence reform
the onerous restrictions offered by hr 418 would keep highlyvulnerable victims of heinous crimes from escaping their persecutors and they do not address the real vulnerabilities in our immigration system
according to the commission the current expedited removal process in the us places victims of persecution at great risk for further trauma while the severity of conditions and deprivation imposed on asylum seekers was shocking rather than address this serious situation in the ways recommended by the commission today this congress would force even more innocent asylum seekers into expedited removal or send them back to their persecutors without an opportunity to appeal their case to an immigration judge
rather than permit local state and federal officials to work together to create minimum security standards for driver s licenses and identification cards as authorized by congress last year hr 418 would mandate statutory standards for states and require them to share personal information on all licensed drivers in a massive national database
hr 418 would dismantle the carefully crafted immigration and security reforms enacted by congress last year in the intelligence reform bill
our country was founded on the principle of immigration and we must not close our doors to those who lawfully seek to share in the freedom and democracy that americans have always held dear
the congress must do everything in its power to protect our citizens and our borders
i am mr speaker in its present form
mr speaker i rise today to offer a motion to recommit that would provide 100 million in health and 50 million in job training transitional assistance to help active duty forces make the transition to the veterans benefits system
while our amendment was ruled not in order we now have a chance to ensure that this supplemental includes at least some funding for vital health and employment services
yet even as america prepares to continue its large and prolonged military campaign in iraq it has done very little to provide for the veterans of this war
the fiscal year 2005 omnibus was 13 billion short in the amount that then secretary principi as well as the house committee on veterans affairs stated was needed to just maintain the current level of veterans health care
members of the national guard returning home face immense challenges in transitioning out of active duty deployment and back to civilian life
mr chairman i rise in support of hr 418 the real id act
the real id act incorporates four of the 911 commission recommendations that are necessary to effectively protect our constituents from terrorists seeking to exploit loopholes in our immigration system
in addition to providing important federal security guidelines for driver s licenses the real id act also includes other important homeland security measures including the deportability of terrorists preventing terrorists from gaming the asylum system and implementing border security measures in san diego
hr 418 makes aliens deportable for the same terroristrelated offenses as those that would prevent them from being admitted to the united states in the first place
another deficiency in current law is based on a flawed understanding of how terrorist organizations operate
mr chairman i rise in opposition to this amendment
the asylum provisions in hr 418 are vitally important to protect our constituents from child molesters rapists murderers and other criminals as well as terrorists seeking asylum in our country
ramzi yousef took advantage of the freedom he gained by applying for asylum to mastermind the first world trade center attack which killed six and injured 1 000 in the amendment author s district
the asylum provisions in hr 418 do not prevent aliens from seeking asylum
these provisions merely overturn ninth circuit court decisions saying that immigration judges can not use inconsistencies in an alien s statement to determine if he or she is being untruthful
if a judge or criminal jury can sentence a criminal defendant to life in prison or even execution because they did not believe the defendant s story certainly an immigration judge can deny an asylum claim to an alien for the same basis
the asylum protections in the real id act are vitally important to ensuring the honesty of the asylum system as well as the security of our nation and its citizens
with reference to the real id bill mr leader can you tell us at this point in time the type of rule that that will be considered under and in particular what amendments not necessarily specific amendments but whether amendments will be allowed motions to recommit and items of that nature
so the gentleman is talking about merging it at some time in the future after passage
i would suggest in that framework that i think personally that we can pass an energy bill
obviously there are some items that are in the energy bill or that are proposed for the energy bill that have significant opposition on one side of the aisle or the other
i would hope mr leader if we could in working with the various committee chairs and i suppose most primarily the gentleman from texas mr barton xz4000180 and the gentleman from michigan mr dingell xz4001100 in this respect to come to as bipartisan an agreement on the substance of that bill so that we could see it not just pass through the house of representatives which may be interesting in terms of the political claim that we passed it but which does nothing for our energy independence which is i think our objective
so i would hope that we could deal with this in as bipartisan a fashion as possible so that when we send it to the other body that we may have more success there more success out of conference and send a bill to the president that will facilitate both energy independence and the effective and efficient discovery development and delivery at retail to the consumer of energy options
mr speaker i thank the gentleman for referencing the committee on ways and means but i certainly agree with him that having the gentleman from california mr thomas xz4004010 and the gentleman from new york mr rangel xz4003330 work closely together and perhaps their respective chairs of the subcommittees that might deal with that work together would be very very useful to accomplishing an objective as opposed to simply passing a bill that then languishes in the congress and never gets to the president
if in fact we consider that and it sounds to me like we certainly do not have enough information to determine whether or not the week after next the energy bill might be on the floor but if and when it comes to the floor mr leader would you contemplate the possibility of having an open rule on that piece of legislation given its importance and scope
mr chairman i intend to vote for this supplemental appropriations bill because i believe it is imperative to support our men and women in harm s way in iraq and afghanistan and to continue our nation s important work there
we can not disregard the bravery of millions of iraqi citizens who turned out to vote in january
failure there in my opinion is not and should not be an option
as tom friedman pointed out in the new york times in february there is no single action we could undertake anywhere in the world to reduce the threat of terrorism that would have a bigger impact today than a decent outcome in iraq i share that view
mr chairman i believe it is more than mere coincidence that over the last several months the winds of democratic reform have begun to blow not only in iraq and afghanistan but also in lebanon egypt saudi arabia and the palestinian authority
but we must harbor no illusions about the prospects for democratic reform in lands that have never known it
however i believe that it is in our nation s interests to encourage and promote it
mr chairman i also want to note that this legislation includes funding for food and humanitarian assistance in sudan as well as tsunami relief
in many respects it is troubling
the gentleman from pennsylvania mr murtha xz4002860 mentioned that in our markup
the gentleman from california mr lewis xz4002391 mentioned that in our markup
the american public wants to support this effort but wants to do so in an effective honest and efficient manner
it is clear that the administration has included many measures in addition that are not emergencies
in talking to staff and maybe i stand to be corrected but i believe that there are only two appropriations bills defense and labor and health that are larger than this 82 billion bill
that means we are passing the third largest appropriations bill that we will pass in the congress
there was no hearing in subcommittee any of the subcommittees
there was no hearing in the full committee
we had 2 12 hours of consideration in the full committee
but i suggest to my colleagues that oversight is critical and i would urge the gentleman from california mr lewis xz4002391 and the ranking member the gentleman from wisconsin mr obey xz4003000 that as we proceed with further consideration of these items that we exercise oversight carefully in the coming months to assure ourselves that this money is being spent as we intend it to be
mr speaker i am of course going to vote for this emergency supplemental appropriation because i believe it is absolutely imperative to support our brave men and women in harm s way in afghanistan and iraq
i know that even today 2 years after the onset of operation iraqi freedom there continues to be strong disagreement across the nation on the decision to remove the brutal hussein regime as well as the planning and prosecution of our military effort in iraq
we the elected representatives of the american people have a legislative duty as well as a moral responsibility to do everything in our power to ensure that our troops have everything they need to defeat the vicious insurgency in iraq to assist the iraqi people in establishing democracy and continuing our efforts in afghanistan
in my view however we are not doing enough
just last week the new york times reported the experience of marine company e an experience that was punctuated not only by a lack of armor but also by a shortage of men and planning that further hampered their efforts in the battle i am pleased mr speaker that this bill includes 14 billion more than the administration requested for bolstering force protection needs such as addon armor and night vision goggles and in addition for outfitting troops rotating into iraq and afghanistan
over the last 4 years this administration however has refused to ask the american people particularly the wealthiest american people to make even minimal sacrifices while we ask our men and women in afghanistan and iraq for some to make the ultimate sacrifice
the very least in my opinion that we can do is give them the resources they need to achieve victory and to return home safely
i also support mr speaker the important funding in this bill for tsunami relief foreign assistance and domestic homeland security as well as the 200 million in assistance for the palestinian authority for infrastructure and economic development projects
the political reforms taking place in the territories must be accompanied by an end to the poverty and lack of opportunity facing the palestinian people
finally however let me raise mr speaker one objection among others to the funding bill the 592 million for a new embassy compound in baghdad
this funding mr speaker is not only inappropriate in this emergency supplemental appropriation but it also in my opinion is substantially excessive in its expenditures not to keep the people safe we can do that but to create an embassy in a relatively small country that hopefully in the years ahead will be more peaceful than we have found it
mr speaker i believe that we are at a critical juncture in iraq
we then built the second fence that is the second tier of the socalled triple fence after we passed a law signed by president bill clinton in 1996
and it was president clinton who signed the bill waiving the endangered species act and waiving nepa because he thought it was so important that we have security at this the most porous smugglers corridor in the united states of america
if the extremists had had their way they would have gone to a sympathetic federal court tied us up in lawsuits and we would not have had the fence
a few miles north of this gap in the fence is the biggest naval installation on the west coast
good biologists say it will take hundreds of years for these areas to be restored not by actions of the border patrol or by our security apparatus but by the smugglers who come across this particular gap in the fence
mr speaker i rise in support of the conference agreement
i wish to commend the conferees for their work in bringing this important legislation to the house floor
as my colleagues know i have believed for many years that the hivaids pandemic represents one of the greatest health and moral crises of our time particularly in africa
it is thus my strongly held view that usaid should continue to fund existing programs as well as invest in new programs that support the president s hivaids initiative
in this regard there are two programs both directed toward south africa that i believe deserve the agency s particular attention
with substantial additional support from usaid during fiscal years 2005 and 2006 this program could double in size and provide training for executives and senior managers from government the provinces municipalities and educational institutions as well as ngos corporations and trade unions in the management of an expanded capability to detect and treat hivaids in africa
the second program would be a new joint ussouth african program to provide telemedicineequipped mobile clinics to serve the south african military involved in peacekeeping efforts throughout africa
as this system develops so would it expand in both its capabilities and its services to the civilian population
i applaud the agency s past work in this area and encourage both the continuation of existing efforts and the expansion of the new efforts that i have outlined
mr chairman i rise today in strong support of this amendment that aims to commit 3 million to the united nations population fund unfpa
the money in this amendment is about 11 percent of what they are asking for
in january i visited areas devastated by the tsunami
the rush of water toppled a high cement fence knocked down utility polls like toothpicks and shattered all of the glass windows in the front facade
we met with one doctor who finished a csection in absolute darkness after the generators were underwater as the rest of the building was evacuated
the sheets were strewn about like wet rags and saturated packages of medicine were thrown in useless piles
the situation that women face in the areas is dire
the indonesian midwife association has also reported that 1 650 of their 5 500 members that is about 30 percent of their members died in the tsunami
there are 150 000 pregnant women in the tsunamiaffected areas 50 000 are scheduled to give birth in the next three months
they need personal hygiene kits in refugee camps and safebirthing kits in hospitals clinics and health centers
the unfpa has experience working with women in disaster areas they have participated in emergency projects in more than 50 countries and territories
they already have offices in tsunamiaffected countries and they understand the distinctive ways that disasters affect women and children
women who are pregnant nursing or caring for small children do not have the capacity to stand in line for long periods of time for supplies
the funds in this amendment are intended to be used by the unfpa to help women in these circumstances by providing tools and medicines needed for safe childbirth preventing and treating sexual assault promoting access to clean water food and healthcare providing sanitary supplies and providing psychosocial counseling
the tsunami devastated an entire region and i am glad that this congress is appropriating funds to help address the many issues that the people in region now face
there were 300 women and infants in that hospital when the first wave hit
the tsunami toppled a cement wall flattened utility polls and shattered all of the glass windows in the front of the building
i met a doctor who finished a csection in absolute darkness after the generators were underwater as the rest of the building was evacuated
the sheets were strewn about like wet rags and saturated packages of medicine were thrown in useless piles
the organization has experience working with women in disaster areas they have participated in emergency projects in more than 50 countries and territories
they already have offices in tsunamiaffected countries and they understand the distinctive ways that disasters affect women and children
when i visited in january there were an estimated 150 000 pregnant women in the tsunamiaffected areas
women who are in refugee camps need personal hygiene kits soap sterile cotton cloth antibiotics and drugs for treating sexually transmitted infections
they have become widows overnight and must deal with the emotional and economic issues involved with being the sole breadwinner in an area with no jobs
in early january unfpa asked for 28 million to support its tsunamirelated work
the united states has not given anything to this organization that is the most experienced and successful in addressing the distinctive needs of women during times of natural disaster
the unfpa also received no funds from the united states in 2002 2003 and 2004
mr chairman i rise today in strong support of hr 418 the real id act of 2005
this legislation addresses theses issues and further secures our nation in a post 911 world
most importantly hr 418 is critical to the continued construction of the southwest border fence in san diego
completion of the fence will reduce the number of illegal crossings and will allow the border patrol to redeploy manpower and resources to other problem areas in san diego
completion of the 3mile gap in the fence known as smugglers gulch would be a strong step toward securing our border
this legislation is essential to national security and i urge my colleagues to vote in support of hr 418
it adds 50 million for disaster assistance and 50 million for refugee assistance in sudan and other african countries
mr chairman my amendment could be the most decent moral and effective 100 million spent in this bill
this 100 million in disaster relief and refugee assistance would go very far in alleviating the multiple disasters and refugee crisis in africa
the number of deaths over 1 300 a day in sudan and the democratic republic of the congo that could be prevented would truly be ending evil and we know this is the right thing to do
line 10 on page 2 of h res 71 states all points of order against consideration of the bill are waived the rule makes in order hr 418 the real id act of 2005 which contains a large unfunded mandate on state governments in violation of section 425 of the budget act
specifically subparagraphs b c d and e of section 202 of hr 418 requires state governments to comply with new federal driver s license requirements and to verify and store additional personal identification records which the congressional budget office cbo in its latest estimate projects to cost 120 million over the next 5 years but last estimated costs states 240 million over 5 years
the above sections also require states to participate in an interstate database to share driver information which cbo estimates will cost an additional 80 million over 3 years
in addition by necessary implication the bill would require states to develop new standards for the issuance of birth and death certificates which cbo has estimated would cost states 460 million over the next 5 years
there is overwhelming evidence before us today that this bill which has bypassed the committee process denies members the opportunity to hear expert testimony on the impact of these sweeping changes or to determine alternatives to ensure that all of us are on the same page in the war against terrorism
the opportunity to determine changes to current law or to offer amendments to the proposed legislation was not given to us and it will impose overwhelming costs on state governments already struggling to meet the growing costs of local law enforcement s role in securing the homeland
we must be in partnership with our states if we are going to have a real war against terror in the united states
for these reasons the nationals governors association as i indicated the american association of motor vehicle administrators and the national conference of state legislatures all strongly oppose this legislation in its present form
in a letter issued yesterday the national governors association american association of motor vehicle administrators say that they are in opposition to the driver s license provision in both hr 418 and hr 368 stating the costs of implementing such standards and verification procedures for the 220 million driver s licenses by states represents a massive unfunded mandate
this does not say that in a bipartisan manner reasoned out through committee process done very quickly that some addressing of this question can not be properly answered
what we have here today is an assault on federalism in the legislative process
i think i can start out by saying that we come from a state that is very diligent and as well very astute on their members of congress supporting unfunded mandates to a burdened and already overworked state budget in a growing state that would have added responsibilities with this enormous burden that this real id bill would exercise against it
in 2004 on this very same bill the cbo told what the numbers would be
in fact it was mr speaker i reserve the balance of my time
in fact it is clear that in addition by necessary implication the bill would require states to develop new standards for the issuance of birth and death certificates which cbo has estimated would cost states 460 billion over the next 5 years
so this is not in any way casting aspersions on their good work
mr speaker this violates the rule and it violates the waiver where in essence the republicans indicated in their early beginnings in the majority that they would not allow unfunded mandates to go forward on this floor
i joined them in that
i ask my colleagues to support this point of order so we stand here united in a bipartisan way not to support an unfunded mandate
let us try to do this in a more effective way
specifically subparagraphs b c d and e of section 202 of hr 418 require state governments to comply with new federal driver s license requirements and to verify and store additional personal identification records which the congressional budget office cbo in its latest estimate projects to cost states 120 million over the next 5 years but last year estimated cost states 240 million over 5 years
the above sections also require states to participate in an interstate database to share driver information which cbo estimates will cost an additional 80 million over 3 years
in addition by necessary implication the bill would require states to develop new standards for the issuance of birth and death certificates which cbo has estimated would cost states 460 million over the next 5 years
there is overwhelming evidence before us today that this bill which has bypassed the committee process denying members the opportunity to hear expert testimony on the impact of these sweeping changes to current law or to offer amendments to the proposed legislation will impose overwhelming costs on state governments already struggling to meet the growing costs of local laws enforcement s role in securing the homeland
in a letter issued yesterday the national governors association and the american association of motor vehicle administrators stated their opposition to the drivers license provisions in both hr 418 and hr 368 stating the cost of implementing such standards and verification procedures for the 220 million driver s licenses by states represent a massive unfunded mandate the national conference of state legislatures also has voiced its strong opposition stating that ncsl is opposed to any further federal attempts including coersion or direct preemption to usurp state authority over the driver s license process or diminish the validity or usefulness of licenses awarded at the state level
mr chairman i believe that what we do today is a matter that could have been approached in a bipartisan manner
as i look at the members on the floor of the house each and every one is sincere in their commitment to the war on terrorism
that is why i believe that the real id act could have been addressed in regular order the regular order of committee hearings the regular order of taking testimony from governors and legislators and local government officials
supporters of hr 418 are afraid that terrorists are using our asylum laws as a means of entering and remaining in the united states
terrorists are statutorily barred from asylum eligibility and it is not apparent why they should choose such a complicated timeconsuming method for entering and remaining in the united states in any event
in addition large numbers of advocates religious organizations and others who understand asylum laws and realize that there are still religious and political persecution today realize that this bill is misdirected
as we stand here on the floor the committee on rules is determining whether the nadler amendment will be admitted that responds to the crisis we face in the asylum laws if this bill is to be passed in its present form
we know that the 911 hijackers entered and remained in the united states as nonimmigrant visitors
in fact they made it very clear
this legislation will force the united states in its national database and in its requirement standardizing id driver s licenses and birth certificates which puts us on that road without hearings without oversight and without question of america s civil liberties
i know that the polls and all the phone calls in members offices have said we do not want illegal aliens driving cars
i think there are valuable aspects of this bill not using certain id for certain federal purposes which may in fact include travel
but the overbroadness of this particular legislation barring any laws to be utilized in the building of a fence eliminating environmental laws work laws criminal laws is overbroad
this legislation bars that opportunity and i would ask my colleagues to oppose it and for us to go back to the drawing board and work for freedom and the war against terrorism in a bipartisan way
mr chairman i am delighted that the gentleman from new york mr nadler xz4002890 has indicated that the amendment has been made in order and i do want to acknowledge that he is the ranking minority member of the subcommittee on the constitution of the committee on the judiciary
mr chairman we are on the floor today because the representation has been made to the american people and to our colleagues that this legislation is legislation that relates and responds to the crisis in the war on terror
we all are united in that war but this is an immigration bill and i do believe we should do immigration in a bipartisan manner
in fact all 19 of the 911 hijackers had documents to enter the country legally
i think the real crux is as was quoted in the words of governor jeb bush what do you do with them
illegal aliens who are working in our hotels and factories who are working every day in our states and our cities and our counties
i join my colleagues in working together to secure the homeland but in this instance this does not follow the 911 recommendations
this commission did in fact say that they wanted secure documents and identification should begin in the united states
it did not document or indicate in which manner we should be able to do that
i would have hoped that hr 620 the security measures feasibility act which would ask the hard questions of how and what is the best vehicle in order to be able to establish these secure documents would have been the better approach
now we undermine the states ability for safety and security in their own states and we undermine the very principles of this nation which are to open the doors for those fleeing persecution both in terms of religious and political persecution
i hope my colleagues will oppose this bill so we might do this effort in a bipartisan manner
mr chairman i rise in opposition to hr 418 the real id act
the supporters of the hr 418 are afraid that terrorists are using our asylum laws as a means of entering and remaining in the united states
terrorists are statutorily barred from asylum eligibility and it is not apparent why they would choose such a complicated time consuming method for entering and remaining in the united states in any event
the 911 hijackers entered and remained in the united states as nonimmigrant visitors
this is much easier than the steps required for obtaining asylum which among other things require the applicant to establish a wellfounded fear of persecution on account of race religion nationality membership in a particular social group or political opinion
the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act established a study to find out the extent to which terrorists are attempting to use our asylum laws to enter and remain in the united states and what weaknesses they are exploiting
the approach in the real id act is to raise the bar on the burden of proof which would result in a denial of relief to bona fide asylum seekers without any assurance that the changes would discourage terrorists from seeking asylum
for instance in addition to showing that the alleged persecution would be on account of one of the enumerated grounds the applicant would have to establish that the persecution was or will be a central reason for persecuting the applicant in effect the asylum applicant would have to establish what was in the mind of the persecutor
she said the united states offers protection in the form of asylum to individuals fleeing persecution in other nations
in most cases however asylum seekers find themselves alone destitute and facing deportation
the real id act would codify the standards that adjudicators use in making credibility findings in asylum proceedings
people fleeing persecution often lack the opportunity and the ability to secure the legal evidence needed to corroborate their claims and demeanor is a function in some cases of cultural background rather than credibility
for instance it is considered rude in some cultures to stare into another person s eyes during a conversation but the failure to look someone in the eyes indicates deception in this country
the broad net this would create would ensnare innocent people who have made donations or been involved in some other way with organizations they did not know were terrorist organizations
the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act we just enacted requires the secretary of transportation in consultation with the secretary of homeland security to promulgate regulations establishing minimum standards for driver s licenses or personal identification cards issued by a state for use by federal agencies for identification purposes
the recommendations of this committee are required to include an assessment of the benefits and the costs of the measures in the proposed regulations
in contrast the real id act would impose specific requirements on the states now without giving the states and the other stakeholders an opportunity to provide input on what these requirements should be and without an assessment of the benefits and costs of the measures
w e strongly believe it would be in the public interest to make available to these communities the ability to obtain a driver s license
in allowing this community the opportunity to obtain driver s licenses they will have to study our laws and pass a driver s test that will make them not only informed drivers but safe drivers i would just add that it also requires them to have insurance
we can do the same thing in the house of representatives
in the meantime however passage of this piecemeal illadvised bill would be a step backwards
this in fact takes homeland security responsibilities and actually outsources them
this means if you are an immigrant undocumented in removal proceedings working with a lawyer working with family members you are then dispatching bondspersons with no direct immigration training to round you up and immediately bring you to a point of deportation where you are in the middle of a legal process
yes individuals who are in line to be deported is an issue
we need more detention beds and more security at our borders but we do not need to outsource to bondspersons however financially opportunistic it may be and as a former judge and someone who deals with these issues in my private practice before coming to congress i realize bondspersons have their role but not to contract out to deal with this issue
the fugitive slave act gave broad virtually unfettered power to agents or slave owners to seize slaves in the free states and return or send them to slavery in the slave states obviously with little regard for their legal status in free states with no due process and opportunity to defend themselves
if we randomly give the opportunity to bondsmen who have no understanding of immigration laws we can be assured that in a discriminatory fashion they will be rounding up people who look different and speak different languages and we will be impacted in a very negative way
i close by saying all of us in our congressional districts hear the hardship cases of immigrants who are seeking legal status who have been in line for long times who have had terrible things happen to them because of the complexity of the immigration system
i rise in opposition to the amendment that my colleague congressman sessions has offered
this would be a dramatic change in how we arrest and detain people in removal proceedings
many people rounded up in this manner would turn out not to be deportable after all
in fact the language of this amendment was only recently made available
without committee scrutiny we would be allowing bonding agents to have open access to all information held by the us government or any state or local government that may be helpful in locating or surrendering the person who is the subject of the bond
in the process of reviewing or revising that status they too become part of the large webbed fishnet of hauling people in by people who are inexperienced in this area
we need to strengthen the department of homeland security to be able to do its job but more importantly we need to be able to build those detention beds thousands if we will to be able to have those that might be dangerous placed in detention locations
i think it is a good idea to require the secretary of the department of homeland security to have information in his database about people who have been convicted of using a false driver s license
but as they all say the devil is in the details
i was just looking at a letter from commissioner hamilton who talked about controversial provisions that everyone suggests came out of the 911 commission and what he said very carefully was that these are in fact recommendations
as the intelligence bill did in the last session with enormous vetting hearings oversight conference committees at the later stage it almost became a hearing none of these amendments have been given the kind of vetting that one would know that these are valuable and that the details have been worked out as to how we utilize the database or who gets into the database if by chance the utilization was a mistake even though they violated the law
we hope however that this amendment will send notice to those who might try to use any false document in trying to get on an airplane for the potential damage it may do
mr chairman i rise in opposition to the amendment that my colleague congressman castle has offered
i support this objective and i think it is a good idea to require the secretary of homeland security to have information in his data bases about people who have been convicted of using a false driver s license
as they say however the devil is in the details i would like a hearing and a markup on this amendment before deciding whether it should be enacted
i would inquire of the author of the amendment one question in your research did we determine that dhs new as it is is not doing that
i do have to raise red flags on making sure it is not random making sure there is a conviction and in knowing what happens with dhs
this has good intentions but the answers of what dhs is doing the training of tsa what kind of standards are used in different airports
others might make it in essence a federal crime and that person is prosecuted
so some you get in the database others you do not
before i yield back my time i would simply say that i would suggest that this amendment be addressed again in our hearings to be able to detail out what would ultimately happen
mr chairman i rise in support of the kolbe amendment
clearly this legislation is needed with respect to improved and increased technology but i would also argue that the secure our border act that was offered by the select committee on homeland security democrats in the last congress really speaks to the broader question
so technology is certainly what we need and i hope as we move forward in the select committee on homeland security we will if you will author bills that will give those resources to the northern and southern border
i rise in support of the kolbe amendment
while the kolbe amendment falls short of asking for an interagency border security strategy as democrats did in the secure border act it does get at the key issues of assessing technology and staffing
a ground surveillance program in partnership with the remote aerial surveillance program which was mandated as part of the 911 bill will go a long way towards achieving real border security
one missing area element in this amendment seems to be a link between the air and ground surveillance programs
we can not afford to build systems in isolation
mr chairman let me say that the asylum laws as i was reminded by my good and dear colleague from florida started in world war ii when we were reminded of the ugly scene of turning away the st
let me just suggest that we do have an opportunity to review this issue and make it right but i can tell you that commissioner kean and commissioner hamilton indicated that in advocating that these are recommendations of the 911 commission these are not recommendations of the 911 commission
there is no proof or facts that terrorists have been able to pull one over on us in large numbers
it is very important to let the comptroller general s study go forward that evaluates the extent to which weaknesses in the united states asylum system have been or could be exploited by terrorists
it is extremely important that we realize that the 911 hijackers entered and remained in the united states as nonimmigrant visitors
there is not a crisis here but what is a crisis is when you turn people away from our shores who have come here downtrodden who are seeking asylum because of religious persecution because of mutilation of women because of enormous child abuse or potentially child soldiers and you turn them away because they do not look like you and because in fact they can not make their case
i rise in support of the amendment that i have offered with my colleagues representatives nadler and meek
it would strike section 101 of hr 418 the real id act which is entitled preventing terrorists from obtaining relief from removal notwithstanding that title the provisions in section 101 codify evidentiary standards for asylum proceedings
the supporters of section 101 believe that terrorists are gaming our asylum system to enter and remain in the united states
section 5403 of the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act requires the comptroller general to conduct a study to evaluate the extent to which weaknesses in the united states asylum system have been or could be exploited by terrorists
the 911 hijackers entered and remained in the united states as nonimmigrant visitors
in contrast it is difficult and time consuming to enter the united states as an asylum applicant
the terrorist choosing this method would have to present himself at a border and then prove in expedited removal proceedings that he has a credible fear of persecution on account of race the approach taken by the real id act is to raise the bar on the burden of proof for everyone who applies for asylum which would result in a denial of relief to bona fide asylum seekers without any assurance that the changes would discourage terrorists from seeking asylum
in fact terrorist organizations are in a much better position to fabricate evidence of persecution than the typical bona fide asylum applicant who has fled his country in fear for his life without any thought of meeting evidentiary standards at an asylum hearing
for instance in addition to showing that the alleged persecution would be on account of one of the enumerated grounds the applicant would have to establish that the persecution was or will be a central reason for persecuting the applicant in effect the asylum applicant would have to establish what was in the mind of the persecutor
near the end it mentions inconsistencies and inaccuracies or falsehoods in statements without regard to whether an inconsistency inaccuracy or falsehood goes to the heart of the applicant s claim in other words it permits an immigration judge to make an adverse credibility finding in asylum proceedings on the basis of an inconsistency inaccuracy or falsehood that has no relevance to the asylum applicant s persecution claim
but mr chairman i rise today as well as to support those peacekeeping dollars to say that many of the efforts in this legislation the work that has been done by the gentleman from wisconsin mr obey xz4003000 and the gentleman from california mr lewis xz4002391 i can appreciate in this emergency supplemental even though as i have spoken to my good friend and leader the gentleman from pennsylvania mr murtha xz4002860 on this issue it is important that we have an announced success strategy for leaving iraq
but i rise today to comment that the legislation fails to contain important provisions that would provide what is truly needed by our government and that would ensure that the 813 billion in this bill is really spent wisely
i am very disturbed as the ranking member of the committee on the judiciary subcommittee on immigration border security and claims that we have now forced into this bill as a selfoperating part of the rule that hr 418 would be included in the engrossment of the underlying bill hr 1268
last year congress passed new driver s license standards in the 911 intelligence reform bill with bipartisan support and i do support that
it was a good bill and the intelligence reform bill was supported in a bipartisan manner
the bill is being attached here in an effort to force the senate to pass these illconceived policies
we have had no hearings on this real id legislation and i oppose the inclusion of this bill if the underlying legislation is passed and engrossed as set forth in h res 151
hr 418 includes numerous provisions limiting the rights of refugees imposing onerous new driver s license requirements on the states making it easier to deport legal immigrants legal immigrants waiving all federal laws concerning the construction of fences and barriers where we have been told by homeland security experts they will not make us safer anywhere in the united states and denying immigrants longstanding habeas corpus rights
i believe those who are criminals need to be incarcerated but there are immigrants who are standing in line trying to achieve citizenship
in the wake of the 911 tragedy and even after the patriot act this legislation would further target immigrants for crimes they have not committed and sins for which they are not responsible
an emergency supplemental that purports to aid tsunami victims our troops in iraq and afghanistan is no place for the provisions of the real id act
i support spending the necessary dollars to keep our troops in iraq safe to provide relief to victims of the tsunami in southeast asia and africa and to provide security in afghanistan but this is a poison pill
mr chairman i rise in support of some of the efforts funded in this emergency supplemental hr 1268 although the legislation fails to contain important provisions that would both provide what is truly needed by our government and that would ensure that the 813 billion proposed in this bill is spent wisely
of particular concern to me as ranking member of the house judiciary subcommittee on immigration border security and claims is the forced inclusion of hr 418 in the engrossment of the underlying bill hr 1268
last year congress passed new driver s license standards in the 911 intelligence reform bill with bipartisan support
this bill is being attached here in an effort to force the senate to pass these illconceived policies
we have had no hearings on this bill and i oppose the inclusion of this bill if the underlying legislation is passed and engrossed as set forth in the rule h res 151
in the wake of the 911 tragedy and even after the patriot act this legislation would further target immigrants for crimes they have not committed and sins for which they are not responsible
an emergency supplemental that purports to aid tsumani victims our troops in iraq and afghanistan is no place for the provisions of real id
inclusion in this fashion amounts to a forced acceptance of its provisions much like a contract of adhesion
mr chairman i support spending the necessary dollars to keep our troops in iraq safe to provide relief to victims of the tsunamis in southeast asia and africa and to provide security for afghanistan
however the legislation before us today stands to use the public s fear of terrorism to radically change asylum law for all asylees not just those with some connection to terrorism or relating to the issues contained in the underlying legislation
for these reasons i oppose this legislation in its present form
i want to rise as well to support the gentlewoman from new york s amendment dealing with the efforts the unfpa is engaged in because we got a chance to see firsthand in visiting sri lanka the work that has been done
the women s maternity hospital was completely destroyed and so these dollars will be crucial in helping to ensure good health care good intervention and safe deliveries
but mr chairman i would hope that if a point of order is in order i would hope that that point of order could be waived
this amendment is a very narrow amendment very limited in its request
former outgoing dhs deputy secretary james loy indicated that in testimony to the house appropriations subcommittee on homeland security that ice the immigration customs and enforcement needed an additional 300 million in order to finish the fiscal year 2004
officer callahan came before the judiciary committee just a few days ago on march 10 and indicated that in 5 days we might see the closing of the operations of ice
there are hard working individuals who are undocumented in this country who clearly have come here for economic reasons
because we are shortened at the border and we are shortened in terms of immigration enforcement inside the country and there are no detention beds
but fixing the financial problems which i understand the agency is proceeding under the new secretary of homeland security does not in any way give reason to deny extra funds for an organization that is entrusted with the security of this nation
this happens to be one to provide the resources for this agency in order for it to avoid closing its doors
we do not have enough training and certainly we do not have enough staff in order to do their job
can we not include them in this emergency supplemental
tragically one of our officers lost his life in the atlanta courthouse killings a man who had served for a good number of years
in fact the uniforms being used nationwide right now still have immigration naturalization service patches on them despite the fact that the ins no longer exists
lack of funds appears to be causing detention facilities problems in san diego california and other places
but i hope that we will know that we have to secure the homeland by providing extra dollars to respond to the needs of our own staff here in the department of homeland security
mr chairman as the ranking member of the subcommittee on immigration border security and claims i have learned of a budget crisis in the homeland security department s bureau of immigration and customs enforcement ice
in fact the uniforms being used nationwide right now still have immigration and naturalization service ins patches on them despite the fact that ins no longer exists
lack of funds appears to be causing a detention facility in san diego ca to release detainees from custody
additional funding is needed nationwide to maintain the approximately 17 000 detention beds currently in use
ice s financial problems have resulted in a hiring freeze since last march and severe spending restrictions
in september ice ordered its offices to refrain from nonessential spending such as travel temporary duty assignments equipment and supply purchases and permanent changeofstation moves
ice is a bureau in financial crisis
they do not have enough money to hold people in custody buy new uniforms and equipment for employees or even issue badges and credentials with the correct department on them
my amendment therefore just seeks 40 million which can be offset in the coast guard allotment
it is a shame that this amendment could not get a waiver of the point of order for the crisis in our department of homeland security
mr chairman my understanding of an emergency supplemental is to deal with emergency funding situations in the government
frankly i believe if we are to do our work in iraq whether we agree or disagree with the war in iraq we do know that it is represented to us by the administration to be a war on terror
how can we fight the war on terror in afghanistan and iraq and not fight the war on terror in this country within our boundaries
take the word of admiral loy who indicated that they needed more dollars to finish out the fiscal year in question
i would ask my colleague and i would also ask at this moment that if he pursues his point of order whether or not we will have the opportunity whether in conference or as we continue the appropriations process to focus on the lack of funding for the immigration and enforcement officers immigration customs and enforcement officers the border patrol which i think you are aware of and the detention beds
i would like very much to yield to the chairman and on this issue i think we are all in common agreement about the need to secure our homeland
i heard my good friend from colorado mr tancredo xz4003940 say that this amendment likely will not pass but i hope maybe the debate will seek and help to convince him of the enormity of the crisis or at least the need in places like sri lanka indonesia and many other countries that are impacted by the tsunami
if i might draw the gentleman s memory to the video that showed a single train that had been the lifeline of sri lanka an opportunity that i took in visiting sri lanka with a number of my colleagues to see the enormous devastation in terms of the infrastructure of these countries then the gentleman would realize that in addition to the charitable heart that americans have and the private contributions that have been made and might i acknowledge the many donations given from the city of houston and the houston tsunami relief effort and the vietnamese relief effort and sri lankans and those from thailand and many many others in the city of houston and the effort waged by president clinton and president bush and in my community jim mackinvale and many others who worked hard to draw monies out of houston and i know many other cities and states did the same
mr speaker i rise sadly to oppose the emergency supplemental because of the horrific and illadvised immigration provisions and the lack of oversight that has been given to the provisions in this section
i hope we will have an opportunity to address this in a comprehensive manner
mr speaker i rise today very conflicted over a piece of vital legislation for which this entire body should really be in solidarity
the conference report on hr 1268 provides for emergency fy2005 funds for military operations in iraq and afghanistan tsunami relief efforts foreign assistance programs and domestic homeland security priorities
instead of being united on issues of national security and international relations we are put in a divisive situation with the provisions of the real id act
the issues of importance addressed by this emergency supplemental do not give rise to a need to include provisions from hr 418 the real id act legislation for which congress has not held a legislative hearing markup nor full debate in the house
just last year our colleagues on the other side of the aisle attempted to force these provisions in the context of the 911 intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act hr 10
the usa patriot act for which we in the subcommittee on crime terrorism and homeland security of the judiciary are only now holding hearings in piecemeal form already barred terrorists from receiving asylum protection in the united states
none of the people associated with recent attacks or plans for terrorist attacks in the us were here under grants of asylum
in the 911 act we passed language to develop and implement a comprehensive plan for the systematic surveillance of the southwest border by remotely piloted aircraft and other electronic means
the great majority of this emergency supplemental a sum of 759 billion goes towards us military operations in iraq and afghanistan
in this conference report s military spending total of 759 billion includes 371 billion for military operations and maintenance spending 174 billion for personnel and 174 billion for new weapons procurement
in addition this conference report provides 308 million more than requested for addon vehicle armor kits large increases for new trucks added funds for nightvision equipment and 60 million in unrequested funds for radio jammers to disrupt attempts by iraqi insurgents as i stated there are many provisions of this emergency supplemental in which this body can be united in agreement
one such issue is the tsunami relief provided in this emergency supplemental
the conference report before us today appropriates 907 million in direct assistance for tsunami disaster relief for countries affected by the dec
in addition this measure also provides 226 million to reimburse the us military for expenses incurred in providing emergency relief to the tsunami victims and 25 million to build and deploy 35 new tsunamidetection buoys in the pacific atlantic the caribbean and the gulf of mexico to provide warning to communities of approaching tsunamis
i had the opportunity to visit with usaid personnel who were there trying to aid the sri lankan people in rebuilding their nation
i am also similarly pleased that about 400 million in this conference report will go towards humanitarian assistance in darfur sudan
i recently had the opportunity to visit refugee camps in neighboring chad where thousands of sudanese in darfur have fled to escape the conflict
needless to say i was able to confirm from eyewitness accounts that the conflict in darfur is indeed even more shocking and deeply disturbing in its viciousness than has been reported to us
we as a nation must stand against such brutality and the funds in this emergency supplemental will help to ease the suffering of those involved in this conflict
in addition this conference report includes 920 million for all peacekeeping programs many of which are in sudan
however while i have always been a strong again i am in general support of the goals proposed by hr 1268 but i am troubled by the implications of the supplemental appropriations measure that this body is poised to pass that relate to immigration policy
the underlying legislation proposes to fund important needs that pertain to operation iraqi freedom operation enduring freedom in afghanistan army and marine corps restructuring recapitalization and replacement of equipment and replenishment of cash balances in certain working capital funds
in truth this emergency supplemental funds many needed priorities but it is the one issue of the real id act which is not a priority that poisons this legislation
i rise in strong support of the tierney amendment and frankly think it would be irresponsible not to vote for the tierney amendment
let me remind members the amount of money we have now spent in iraq is over 200 billion
according to a 2003 gao report iraq appears to be the first case where the united states government has used private contractors extensively for protecting persons and property in potentially hostile or hostile situations indeed it is estimated there are as many as 20 000 private military personnel in iraq
there does not appear to be any legal framework in place to handle and deal with the role of nonmilitary personnel in a war zone
indeed the liability of contractors who violate the law operating in iraq afghanistan and guantanamo bay is ambiguous so we have more responsibility to have strong oversight over these dollars that are being expended
federal procurement data suggests that money allocated to military contractors via federal procurement has jumped by more than 70 billion in the last 3 fiscal years
we should do what we would do within our own families and look at every single line in these accounts
in january the special inspector general for the iraqi reconstruction reported that the coalition provisional authority could not account for over 88 billion
but he is doing what is right for america in order to make sure that we are responsible to the taxpayer and accountable for every single dollar being expended
mr chairman my amendment is offered to force the government of nigeria to transfer the indicted war criminal charles taylor to the united nations special court in sierra leone
mr taylor xz4003992 is currently residing in calabar nigeria and maintaining his active role fomenting terror and crime throughout west africa from this base
charles taylor has been the leading force for evil in west africa since his overthrow of the doe government in 1990
in 2003 mr taylor xz4003992 was overthrown by the people of liberia and sought sanctuary in nigeria despite his indictment by the un
special court for sierra leone in the light of his terrorist activities in his own country
the government of nigeria has promised to keep mr taylor xz4003992 contained but reliable sources have confirmed political operations in liberia transfer assets in europe and receive funds from crime in west africa
recently mr taylor xz4003992 traveled to burkina faso to meet with islamist groups in that country
peace in west africa will not come until charles taylor is brought to justice for his crime and removed as a threat from the region
the nigerian government must be shown that harboring a war criminal and a terrorist is not in their best interest
i urge the house to join me in passing this amendment and standing for justice and the rule of law in west africa
mr chairman i rise in favor of the farr amendment
mr chairman i rise in reluctant support for the 811 billion emergency supplemental funding bill we are considering today
the only reason i am voting for the bill before us today is because it provides much needed equipment for our forces in theater increases death gratuity to 100 000 for families of soldiers who have died or were killed on active duty
and two by increasing investments in our war and defense efforts we further constrain budgetary resources for investments in education highways community development first responders health care public health and more
we in congress must call on the defense department to provide better accountability for the spending decisions it makes
mr speaker when hr 1268 was first considered on the floor in march i reluctantly supported its passage
now that the conference report has been returned to the house for this chamber s approval i still find myself torn because i do not see how additional funding for the iraq war effort will ultimately produce a positive outcome for the united states or for the people in iraq
i want a successful exit strategy not a permanent occupation in iraq
despite my misgivings for the direction of our iraq policy or lack thereof i do not believe our troops who are fighting so bravely should be penalized for the mistakes in judgment of our civilian military leadership at the white house and the pentagon
the funds provided in this bill will enable our soldiers and marines on the ground to uparmor their vehicles
i voted against the authority that allowed the president to take action in iraq
i am pleased that the bill does contain provisions that require the administration to develop a set of performance indicators and measures for determining the stability and security in iraq and report its findings to congress
this requirement falls well short of the exit strategy we need to determine how long our commitment in iraq will last
the agreement appropriates 656 million in direct assistance to tsunami disaster relief for countries affected by last december s tragedy
the bill provides 400 million for humanitarian assistance in the darfur region of sudan and elsewhere in africa including funds for the temporary resettlement of refugees
in a period when the president and this congress proposes reductions in programs that support the development of local communities and neighborhoods the bill provides 592 million for a goldplated embassy compound in iraq
i find it very difficult to defend such spending when the budget priorities of this administration propose disinvesting in our cities towns and our american workforce
i want a successful exit strategy not a permanent occupation in iraq
the money contained in this bill will go a long way to saving lives saving the lives of our land forces in iraq and afghanistan and reconstructing the lives of those who experienced the devastation of last year s tsunami
with all due respect to the previous speaker this is not about debating the merits of the necessity or the needs for a new embassy in baghdad
the last time i was in iraq which was last fall i noticed one thing we are dropping a lot of concrete in iraq today which is an indication that we are going to be there for a very very long time
they have been doing a terrific job under very dangerous circumstances including our state department personnel who are working in the current embassy within the green zone in baghdad which is also at times a freefire zone
in fact earlier this morning i got up and ran over to walter reed hospital to visit with some of our troops including specialist andrew carter from the 128th who almost had his foot blown off due to an rpg that was fired at him during one of his passing patrols
just last week we lost another member from western wisconsin who was shot down in the line of duty staff sergeant andrew bossert
he will be buried in wisconsin this thursday
i am sure members will join me in sending our thoughts and prayers to his family his parents but especially to his wife olya who lives in wisconsin
what we need to start considering at some point is whether or not the ongoing operations in iraq and afghanistan should be paid for as part of the normal budgeting process
mr chairman i rise today in support of the emergency supplemental appropriations act for defense the global war on terror and tsunami relief 2005
i have had the opportunity to visit iraq twice over the last 2 years and visit with our military women and men and survey the operations of the us reconstruction mission in iraq
never have i been more proud to be an american than when i visited our troops and observed them in the line of duty
the 128th is on their first tour of duty in iraq and is performing well despite several equipment shortages and setbacks the unit has dealt with
he was recently injured in iraq riding in a humvee that was hit by an rpg
his resolve is a good reminder of the dedication of our men and women in uniform and why we need to renew our commitment to soldiers like andrew
while i do not endorse all of the supplemental s provisions in the absence of a funding alternative i support the need to provide for our troops
but we do need to start budgeting and paying for their obligations such as the need for a new embassy in iraq instead of passing socalled emergency supplementals and leaving a legacy of debt for our children to inherit
since that day we have made great strides in improving our nation s security but several gaps leave our nation vulnerable to attacks just like those we suffered that day
the situation in california where a state environmental commission is blocking a national security barrier from being finished must be remedied
a 3mile gap remains in a fence which would prevent people from crossing over our southern border in an area that is home to a military base
the real id bill would allow our immigration judges to use common sense to protect americans while still providing a safe harbor for those who truly need refuge in our country
it is outrageous that we can keep people out of this country based upon terrorist links but the minute they are in this country we can not deport them
perhaps most importantly our nation s security will remain at risk so long as we give validity to those who are in our nation illegally in the form of state driver s licenses and other id s
driver s licenses in our country are de facto id cards
they allow people to blend in move freely rent apartments go to work board airplanes
if states do not require some valid form of us governmentissued id to get a driver s license any person could walk in off the street and claim to be a legal alien in search of a license and be granted one
the real id bill would ensure those to whom we issue government ids and driver s licenses are in the us legally and make it more likely that those to whom we issue id s do not intend to harm americans
nineteen of them with 63 another number 63 valid driver s licenses in their possession
any one of those driver s licenses got them anything they needed to do in america full rights of citizenship for that matter and get on board any airplane
we think something is in your heart
we spent millions of dollars on metal detectors and millions of dollars expanding tsa and putting federal employees in place and we put millions of people in long lines waiting to get through
so it is a little harder for them they have to stand in line with the rest of us
stand in line with the rest of us where i stand where i see a 75yearold lady going through a spreadeagle search while the young middle eastern male waltzes through with a smirk on his face and we can not close that door
mr chairman i rise in strong support of the supplemental appropriations bill and i thank the gentleman from california mr lewis xz4002391 for yielding me time
i want to commend the gentleman for putting together what i believe is an excellent bill and for his leadership in reviewing each single element of the administration s request
the subcommittee on transportation treasury and hud that i chair has mostly technical items in this supplemental that are not controversial so i would like to focus my comments on the overall bill
in the past few months we have seen an extraordinary progress in iraq and in the middle east at large
from the historic iraqi elections the new palestinian leadership voting in saudi arabia and massive demonstrations in lebanon against their syrian occupiers i believe that these events show major positive changes that can come to this part of the world
by passing this legislation we will keep our soldiers in iraq fully equipped as they continue their daunting task in maintaining security and training iraqis to take over those functions
the funding included in this bill to secure a new united states embassy will help get us out of the palaces that we currently occupy
we will provide muchneeded assistance to afghanistan in its efforts to become more secure restrict the drug trade and develop its economy
the palestinians have an opportunity to get their house in order and we should help them
the committee should be commended for handling this issue in a balanced and effective way and i urge everyone obviously to support it
mr chairman i rise in support of the passage of hr 418
many of these protections that are contained in this legislation are long overdue
in particular i am supportive of the provisions that deal with enhancing our driver s licenses by providing for some uniformity in the standards used to issue those driver s licenses and for finishing the border fence in southern california
but that is one step in the process of border security
i represent a district that has more apprehensions of illegal immigrants than any other district on the southern border in fact more apprehensions than all the other districts combined
it is now incorporated here in this bill or parts of it at least are incorporated in this bill
in fact there are more apprehensions of illegal immigrants in arizona than the entire rest of the border combined
in these areas and all along the border it is essential to advance ground technologies in order to officially understand and stop those who come through this back door to our nation
improvements to ground technologies are absolutely essential in the large expanses of desert and unpopulated lands along the southern border
this is particularly a problem in arizona because more than half of the entire border is covered by tribal organizations tribal units sovereign tribal nations who are not generally covered by most of the federal legislation we have on telecommunication sharing
the first includes programs that are true emergencies such as replenishment of funds that were reprogrammed previously for tsunami disaster assistance and poppy eradication in afghanistan funds for the humanitarian crisis in darfur and in asia and funds to train afghan police funds that are necessary to improve conditions that would enable us to bring our troops home as soon as possible
additionally this category includes reconstruction resources to stabilize and improve conditions in afghanistan and the middle east which support our efforts to bring our troops home funds to support the democratic movement and government in ukraine and funds for programs in the west bank and gaza
we have provided 995 million in this second category of nonemergency spending and have offset these funds with the rescission of prior foreign assistance appropriations specifically funds that were appropriated for turkey in the fiscal year 2003 supplemental bill
i think my colleagues recognize that we are faced with unique opportunities in the middle east and afghanistan
our leadership can have positive influence in both the west bank and gaza in ukraine in indonesia and sri lanka and of course in afghanistan
i saw a press report recently from indonesia the world s most populous muslim country that showed that the backing for osama bin laden had dropped from 58 percent in 2003 to 23 percent today
finally the last category includes programs requested by the administration that we determined were less urgent and could be considered in the 2006 budget process
this category totals 12 billion in funding and includes fiscal year 2006 operating costs of our programs overseas and large construction projects that can either wait for consideration or would have a possible revenue stream making them ideal projects for world bank and asian development bank funding
these programs total 616 million for afghanistan 200 million for the new global war on terror partners fund the new 200 million solidarity fund and 45 million in debt relief for countries affected by the december tsunami
let me say that the funds we are providing in the foreign assistance chapter must be considered an investment in security both in the region and on american soil
we must not be faced 20 years in the future with the knowledge that we looked at the opportunities of a talibanfree afghan government a democracyoriented government in the ukraine a middle east craving freedom and representative government only to turn away and leave them to their own meager means with no us influence
it was very difficult at the very best to know how to handle those in the very best way
as the gentleman from illinois mr jackson xz4001980 knows i spoke in committee against this amendment which was then part of a larger amendment and these two were combined at that point
i made the point that i was not at all sure that this additional money was needed in darfur sudan in light of the amount of money that is already in the 2005 bill and the amount of money that is in the supplemental for this region
we are in complete agreement on our need to take every step that we can to provide not only for a peaceful solution in the area but also to provide for humanitarian relief for the people who live in that region and therefore i am prepared today with concurrence of the chairman of the committee to accept this en bloc amendment and we will take a very good look at this in the conference with the senate and see where we are at that point
i again want to commend the gentleman for his commitment his dedication his passion in offering this amendment today
mr chairman i have looked at the amendment and i understand what the gentlewoman is talking about what her intentions or how it would be used in the tsunami recovery fund
mr chairman i rise in opposition to the amendment
i think most of my colleagues know that there were at least 225 000 maybe many more than that people who were killed in the countries affected by the december 2004 tsunami most particularly indonesia sri lanka india and other countries as well
it is not i do not think extraordinary given the size of the catastrophe that we have experienced 340 million to rebuild infrastructure roads ports bridges water treatment plants and a signature project which would be the construction of a 250 kilometer stretch of road from the capital banda aceh at the north end of sumatra down the west coast to meulaboh in indonesia
the us has had a history of responding in a very compassionate way to disasters wherever they occur here in the united states and also abroad and i believe that this compassion is something that marks americans and makes us who we are
and i would certainly hope that my colleagues would agree that these funds are a relatively small amount of money given the total level of devastation of the disaster there a relatively small amount of money to help this area recover and to replenish the money that was already spent in relief
it proposes to change existing law and constitutes legislation in an appropriation bill and therefore violates clause 2 of rule xxi
the rule states in pertinent part that an amendment to a general appropriation bill shall not be in order if in changing existing law it gives affirmative direction in effect
surely as he knows there are not any funds in this bill for saudi arabia in the foreign operations chapter
there was some money in last year s bill that went to saudi arabia
it i would also point out as i just mentioned that we included the prohibition in the 2005 regular appropriation bill
section 575 of public law 108447 states none of the funds appropriated or otherwise made available pursuant to that act shall be obligated or expended to finance any assistance to saudi arabia the prohibition that is in that legislation extends to the fiscal year 2005 supplemental bills
there are no funds in this bill that could be used for saudi arabia
the administration can reprogram funds but they can not reprogram them to spend them in saudi arabia
i am sure the gentleman is aware of these facts and i am sure he is aware as he has pointed out of how helpful saudi arabia has been very recently in helping to defuse the situation in lebanon the very direct statements that were made to president assad about how his troops should depart from lebanon
if the gentleman wants to make his statement fine i would encourage him to do so but the appropriation bills include the substance of what is in his amendment and since there is no money in this bill for saudi arabia this amendment is not only redundant it is unnecessary it is a slap in the face it is just simply absolutely wrong for us to do this
there are no funds in this bill that go to saudi arabia
there is a prohibition in the fiscal year 2005 foreign operations bill that prohibits any funds from going to saudi arabia and that prohibition applies to this bill
it is simply repeating what is already in the existing law that applies to this bill
it has absolutely no reason to be in this bill and i would urge my colleagues to defeat this amendment
mr chairman i appreciate the gentleman raising this point and i want to make it very clear that religious organizations may compete on an equal footing for usaid funding in this bill as they may for usaid funding in other bills
mr chairman i rise in opposition to the amendment
the gentlewoman has raised some very important points and i know she has done a great deal of work in this area as it relates to charles taylor and west africa
there is no question it is a very troubled area and charles taylor has certainly contributed to the instability in the region
there are no funds in the legislation that deal with nigeria and there are a lot of circumstances around this issue that i think are difficult in the sense that the united states has played a role in all of this as to where he is at the moment
i would hope however that the gentlewoman would withdraw this amendment because i believe that would be in the best interest of united states foreign policy
mr speaker first of all i want to congratulate the chairman of the full committee on this his maiden effort to bring a major supplemental appropriation to the floor as chairman and i congratulate him for the leadership that he has shown in bringing this so swiftly to this floor
i do rise in support of the conference report to hr 1268
the people i represent living on the border are frustrated with the illegal immigration system and we must address gaps in border security now
by adding the funding that we do in this bill we are taking a step in the right direction to ensure our northern and southern borders are protected
regarding the foreign operations export financing and related programs subcommittee chapter of this legislation the conference report includes 253 billion in funding for programs under the jurisdiction of the foreign operations export financing and related programs subcommittee which i chair
the senate provide a total of 2255 million 200 million in the solidarity fund and 255 million in the global war on terror partners fund
i think my colleagues recognize that we are faced with unique opportunities in the middle east and afghanistan
let me say that the funds we are providing in the foreign assistance chapter must be considered an investment in security both in the region and on american soil
i firmly believe the bill before us today will help build stability and freedom in afghanistan the middle east and parts of asia
i rise in support of the conference report to hr 1268 a bill making emergency supplemental appropriations for fiscal year 2005
before i address the funding in my subcommittee i wanted to briefly acknowledge a critically important part of this bill border security funding
the people i represent living on the border are frustrated with the illegal immigration system and we must address gaps in border security now
by adding this funding we are taking a step in the right direction to ensure our northern and southern borders are protected
regarding the foreign operations subcommittee chapter the conference agreement includes 2532 billion in funding for programs under the jurisdiction of the foreign operations subcommittee of which i am chairman
the senate provided a total of 2255 million 200 million in the solidarity fund and 255 million in the global war on terror partners fund
i think my colleagues recognize that we are faced with unique opportunities in the middle east and afghanistan
us leadership can have positive democratic influence in the west bank gaza lebanon belarus and ukraine
let me say that the funds we are providing in the foreign assistance chapter must be considered an investment in security both in the region and on american soil
we have included financial reporting requirements for all funds in the foreign operations chapter
already men and women from probably every district represented today have made the ultimate sacrifice in iraq and afghanistan
i firmly believe the bill before us today will help to build stability and freedom in afghanistan the middle east and parts of asia
vote against the upton amendment and say to our friends over there we care about your safety we care about what you are doing and we thank you for the tough tough job you are doing in an area that is probably as dangerous as anywhere in the world
mr chairman i rise in support of hr 1268
i would like to thank the committee leadership for their efforts to provide our men and women in uniform with the equipment that they need to succeed
having visited our wounded soldiers at walter reed army medical center i know that we can prevent further injuries by funding this important equipment and i appreciate the committee s efforts in this area
this legislation also demonstrates our nation s commitment to aiding those in dire need throughout the world
however i was deeply disappointed that the house leadership used a procedural move to attach the language of the real id act which i opposed when the house considered it in february
the real id act would significantly alter our nation s asylum and immigration laws in the name of homeland security though its provisions went far beyond the recommendations of the 911 commission
the senate has already registered some opposition to the real id provisions and i fear that their inclusion in the house s supplemental bill will slow down the process and prevent us from sending assistance to those who need it most
our primary responsibility should be to assist our men and women in uniform and to fulfill our promises to the nations that were devastated in the december tsunami
mr chairman i rise in strong support of the gentlewoman s amendment
out of deference to the chairman i will be very brief but i want to thank the gentleman from massachusetts mr tierney xz4004070 for raising this at this time and he has done a wonderful job in leading this effort
one its legislative approach was introduced in the last congress and with the gentleman from massachusetts mr tierney xz4004070 i reintroduced it in this congress
secondly as we think back to the truman commission which the gentleman from massachusetts mr tierney xz4004070 referenced it is very impressive that that commission was established by the party in power at the time and so it was the party in power that wanted to look at itself
thirdly the truman commission was established at a time that senator truman was very concerned that a very small number of contracts were let to a very small number of companies in a very narrow part of the country
at the time he was concerned about american manufacturing being held by too few in a contract sense
it is more complicated today because in addition some contracts are going to foreign firms
i personally believe that the only way you can maintain a support for national policy however controversial is to have complete confidence that things are being pursued in the most honest way possible
mr chairman as the daughter of a veteran 25 years in the army i want to express my profound respect and appreciation for our brave men and women serving on the ground in iraq
congress requires the administration to give a thorough accounting of how our tax dollars have been spent pursuing these policies in iraq and what the administration s expectations are for future expenses
no oversight no accountability and they have failed to provide a concrete plan for how our troops will stabilize the situation in iraq and to bring our troops home
six of the committee s 10 subcommittees participated in the development of this measure which provides 8127 billion in urgent and emergency spending
this funding represents an increase for defense needs of 18 billion above the president s request which i hasten to note is entirely for enhanced support for deployed soontobe deployed or returning troops in order to assist in force protection and to increase the survivability of the troops in the field
to provide these important resources for our troops we reduced other nonessential dod requests by some 600 million as well as nearly 1 billion in foreign assistancerelated programs that were either not well justified or did not meet the strict definition we applied for emergency spending
in addition another 1 billion of extremely important and timesensitive nonemergency foreign assistance approved by the committee was completely offset by a rescission of funds originally appropriated in fiscal year 2003
with my colleagues indulgence i would like to take a few moments to give the house a flavor of the urgent procurement needs that the committee has included in the measure for our troops
in addition to our providing these necessary resources for our troops the committee was compelled to fully fund the army s modularity program at this time because of the urgency to address the significant challenges the army now faces in mitigating stress on the current active duty combat force
in addition the bill includes 592 million for the construction of the us embassy compound in baghdad
while that money for the embassy is a reduction of some 66 million or 10 percent from the president s request construction of the embassy compound has been deemed urgent because of the imminent security threats to some 4 000 us personnel in iraq
thus far 45 personnel with the us mission in iraq have been killed including two american citizens who were killed by a rocket attack on our diplomatic compound the day of the iraqi elections
providing the funds now will greatly reduce the amount of time our personnel remain in harm s way
this reduction comes largely as a result of reductions in proposed foreign assistance spending
mr chairman i believe this measure is responsible both in how we have responded to the needs to provide for adequate resources in making this fight against terrorism and also in how we have carefully scrubbed each and every program so that we can say with utmost assurance that this is a fiscally sound piece of legislation
mr chairman i would take a moment to suggest to the gentleman that he may not be aware of it because he does not serve on those subcommittees but there were at least six hearings in a variety of subcommittees and other meetings regarding this matter before we got organized
the fundamental thrust of this supplemental is to support the troops in iraq and in the middle east
the rule states in pertinent part an amendment to a general appropriation bill shall not be in order if it changes existing law
the amendment gives affirmative direction in effect
mr chairman i rise in opposition to the amendment in no small part because essentially the tierney amendment would be changing the rules of the house
i think it is the amendment that takes out 1 million and puts 1 million back in
mr chairman i ask unanimous consent that the remainder of title i be considered as read printed in the record and open to amendment at any point
i do so in order to have a very brief discussion with the gentleman who is chairman of the authorizing committee
i think many of you in the house know that i spent a lot of years in my life making an honest living in the life and health insurance business so i know a little bit about this subject
reclaiming my time the gentleman can then in this complex field understand when he used the term restrict that the gentleman from wisconsin mr obey xz4003000 might be a bit disconcerted
in the meantime i believe we will have some work to do in the weeks ahead and i look forward to working with the gentleman and with the gentleman from wisconsin mr obey xz4003000 and others to solve this problem
mr chairman reluctantly i make a point of order against the amendment because it is in violation of section 302 f of the congressional budget act of 1974
the amendment would provide new budget authority in excess of the committee allocations and is not permitted under section 302 f of the act
it may very well be in conference on the supplemental that it is appropriate but frankly in some ways we take from peter to pay paul
we can pursue this is regular order and i prefer to use the supplemental process for those emergencies that we can not deal with in regular order
mr chairman while i am very empathetic to the gentleman s concern for i have many a grandchild myself i make a point of order against the amendment because it proposes to change existing law and constitutes legislation in an appropriation bill and therefore violates clause 2 of rule xxi
the rule states in pertinent part an amendment to a general appropriation bill shall not be in order if changing existing law in this case the amendment addresses funds in other acts and so i have to reluctantly ask the chair to rule
mr chairman in that event i withdraw my point of order
we expect fully to address those concerns in regular order
therefore i make a point of order against the amendment because it proposes to change existing law and constitutes legislation in an appropriation bill and therefore violates clause 2 of rule xxi
the rule states in pertinent part an amendment to a general appropriation bill shall not be in order if changing existing law the amendment includes an emergency designation and as such constitutes legislation in violation of clause 2 of rule xxi
there is not any doubt that the new military quality of life and veterans affairs and related agencies subcommittee is designed in the fashion to be very responsive to the needs of veterans
i urge the gentleman to recognize that we have begun hearings in connection with that already
it is our intention in regular order to move these bills very quickly and there is absolutely no doubt that the needs of these veterans beyond money that is already in the pipeline will be met as a result of regular order
mr chairman i am sure all members are very concerned about the proposed embassy compound in iraq and the number of dollars that are involved
she feels it is absolutely critical that we move forward very quickly with this money first and foremost because we have almost 4 000 american personnel whose lives are in jeopardy under current conditions
the secretary has been given great assurance that the compound can be completed in 24 months
there is only one small hook and that is in order to get a contractor to bid on such a job in this territory the money has to be there in the pot
this embassy and the compound are designed to solidify our mission allowing us to be successful in iraq as well as the middle east
i would suggest that in voting for this amendment members would be voting against the view of our commander in chief the president of the united states
there is little doubt that we have the appropriate place we have the plans in place we can get it done quickly
mr chairman i want to say upfront to the house that it is not my intention to speak on the time i have reserved in opposition to this proposition so i am asking for a chance for an exchange here with the gentleman from wisconsin mr obey xz4003000
the gentleman from wisconsin mr obey xz4003000 and i have spent a good deal of time behind closed doors in appropriate security to discuss matters like this but especially to express our concern that the department of defense communicate regularly with the congress relative to activities that might involve areas that are indeed secure
i have never told the gentleman from wisconsin mr obey xz4003000 this before but i will never forget as a mere member of the subcommittee on defense and a member of the intelligence committee discussing a program that was in the black that i knew about because i happened to be in the back room but a program that the department of defense was not very excited about
the gentleman is interested in having opportunity for veterans to gain employment
i presume they are veterans whether veterans of world war ii or circumstances in iraq or otherwise
i would like to engage in a colloquy with the gentleman
there was some resistance to that suggestion because some of us thought there was money in the pipeline that adequately serviced the hospitals and in regular order we would make sure whatever was necessary would be available at future hearings and markups of bills that affect funding
so i want to ask a question there is a veterans hospital in san diego county is there not
san diego veterans medical center in la jolla
and does it happen to be in the gentleman s district
i assume the gentleman suggests that veterans ought to be first in line if we do some refurbishing
and was the gentleman involved in that
thereby patients can actually be in the hospital while the work is being done
mr chairman has the gentleman visited that hospital in the last years
in the last year
i would ask the gentleman to join me in a special mission
mr chairman the mission is the veterans service organizations are a great voice for veterans here in washington
i insist that they help us go back to where the hospitals are and see that veterans are treated like real human beings in those hospitals
mr chairman i ask would the gentleman from california mr filner xz4001330 join me in that effort or does the gentleman believe the money is being spent very well at veterans hospitals
let me say that we made a major effort to see that veterans in our hospital did not have to walk around with folders under their arm
the rule states that an amendment to a general appropriation bill shall not be in order if it changes existing law or imposes additional duties
i am happy to accept it and i am happy to be her partner on behalf of small business in america
mr speaker i rise to claim the time in opposition to the motion to recommit
mr speaker i rise in opposition to the motion to recommit largely because i believe on both sides of the aisle the body recognizes that the reason for this supplemental is to provide as quickly as possible money flows in support of our troops
this is a supplemental dealing with our challenges in the middle east especially
but in the meantime the gentlewoman is suggesting that we should recommit this bill to add 150 million
there is absolutely no question that to have a recommittal motion be successful that would add 150 million to an 82 billion package the vast percentage of which is in support of our troops at best is a technical exercise
so i rise in opposition to the motion to recommit and i urge members on both sides of the aisle to recognize that we must move forward with this supplemental
the vast majority of these funds are to support our troops in iraq and afghanistan
during our conference with the senate chairman cochran and i agreed that the final agreement should come in at or below the president s request and relatively free of extraneous items
the additions over the request are for force protection and increasing the survivability of troops in the field
in addition to the defenserelated spending the conference report provides a reduction of 15 billion in foreign assistance from the president s request
finally the bill includes much of the real id act of 2005 which was included in the housepassed version of the bill
i especially want to thank chairman sensenbrenner chairman davis and their staffs for getting this measure before the congress in a timely fashion
mr speaker i yield 2 12 minutes to the gentleman from florida mr young xz4004391 chairman of the greatest subcommittee in the appropriations process
mr speaker i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from wisconsin mr sensenbrenner xz4003650 as i express my deep appreciation for his cooperation in this project
mr chairman yesterday the us commission on international religious freedom a federally mandated bipartisan commission released a comprehensive report documenting the mistreatment of asylees in america
for those seeking asylum we stripsearch them and then we thrown them in jail with criminals
as we debate this bill thousands of people seeking safety from persecution are in jail with criminals in the united states
they are here fleeing from torture from rape some are here seeking freedom because they have been denied the opportunity to practice their religion say christianity in a place where religion is not permitted
and today we are considering a bill that will make it harder for those fleeing oppression trying to find safe haven in our nation
in fact we have heard references to those who came prior to the first world trade center bombing
we made changes in the law subsequent to that
this bill despite the protestations is in fact creating a de facto national id card
all our information will be held in databases linked together and readymade for use by the federal government
as the gentleman from arizona chairman kolbe said the bill does cut 12 billion in nonemergency initiatives from the administration s international assistance request as well as rescinds an additional 1 billion in previously appropriated funds that are no longer needed and i certainly concur with most of the chairman s recommended cuts
we are now into year three of the reconstruction programs in afghanistan yet the administration continues to rely on offbudget emergency supplementals to fund ongoing reconstruction
there are clearly many nonemergency items in the 2 billion requested for afghanistan in this bill
the establishment of a stable democracy in afghanistan with their own security forces is the key to bringing our troops home
the administration i am concerned has set back that effort by overuse of the emergency supplemental mechanism instead of providing appropriate assistance within the normal appropriations process and i do hope in working closely with the gentleman from arizona chairman kolbe we will be able to provide sufficient funds that are so important for the future of afghanistan
i am very pleased that the committee was able to protect funds for continued urgent needs in afghanistan especially for initiatives that support women and girls
the supplemental contains approximately 63 million in support of education health economic democracy programs that target women and girls
and i am pleased with the generous amounts in the bill for the tsunami relief and reconstruction as well as other items that advance our foreign policy interests
i will be supporting the jackson amendment to add 100 million for unmet needs in africa because in my judgment the ongoing complex crisis in the democratic republic of the congo liberia northern uganda ethiopia and somalia may be out of the media spotlight but the human suffering continues and additional funds are urgently needed to provide food and medical assistance to refugees to facilitate refugee returns and to provide droughtrelated aid
the congress does have a responsibility to real disasters and to ensure that the united states is generous in our response to crises throughout the world
we have been extraordinarily generous with our tsunami relief and i think we need to follow suit to meet the real needs in africa
the unfpa with its proven track record and longstanding presence in the tsunamiaffected areas is uniquely placed to immediately respond to the needs of women and children populations among the most vulnerable after disasters such as the tsunami
in closing i just want to say for me i want to applaud the important efforts of the gentleman from california chairman lewis the gentleman from wisconsin mr obey xz4003000 ranking member the gentleman from pennsylvania mr murtha xz4002860 and the gentleman from arizona chairman kolbe
i feel strongly about the urgency of this issue and i look forward to working with the gentleman in the committee as we approach conference to ensure that this emergency that the gentleman has addressed in his amendment is certainly placed in the conference and we can provide the needed assistance
mr chairman i thank the chairman for accepting this amendment and i rise in support of the maloney amendment
with experience and success in saving lives and helping to ensure the safe delivery of tens of thousands of babies in more than 50 countries and territories unfpa is uniquely qualified to assist victims of the tsunami devastation
a small transfer of 3 million to the unfpa would go a long way in making an immediate and tangible impact on the lives of women and children in indonesia sri lanka and the maldives
our contribution would represent approximately 11 percent bringing them much closer to meeting five pressing needs in the region
in communities ravaged by natural disaster the lack of such important and simple supplies as these can result in serious life threatening health crises
approximately 150 000 women in the tsunami affected region are pregnant
fifty thousand women alone will give birth in the next 3 months
it is a sad fact that women are more likely to be victims of sexual assault and violence in times of crisis
we have already heard disturbing cases of widespread sexual violence in sri lanka
in countless cases mothers are dealing with the nearly unfathomable pain of losing their husbands and children or conversely children are trying to make sense of a world without their families
unfpa is especially well placed to do this lifesaving work as it already has offices in all the tsunamiaffected countries and longstanding relationships with local governments and nongovernmental organizations
supporting organizations with a proven track record and programs in place is one of the most successful and costeffective ways to make our generous contributions go farther
please join me in voting to support unfpa s important work in saving lives
mr speaker i rise in support of the conference report
and i would like to take a few minutes to express my support with some provisions included in the foreign operations chapter of this supplemental bill
the images of destruction parents separated from their children whole villages flattened and emptied livelihoods washed away touched the american people deeply and brought out the most generous and humanitarian impulses in us all
i want to thank chairman kolbe senators mcconnell and leahy for responding to my request to ensure that the needs of women and children around the world are addressed in this supplemental
of the 656 million included in the bill for tsunamirelated assistance over 200 million will be dedicated to directly meet the needs of women and children and much of the remainder of those funds will be of indirect benefit through the restoration of infrastructure needed such as new schools and roads
i also want to thank chairman kolbe and my colleagues in the senate for agreeing to provide most of the 100 million added by the house for emergency needs in africa outside of sudan
unfortunately the horrible tragedy in sudan has meant the diversion of funds needed to address ongoing problems in the democratic republic of the congo liberia ethiopia and uganda
while i have deep concerns about other provisions included in other sections of this supplemental i am pleased with the shape of the foreign operations section
mr chairman i thank the gentlewoman for yielding me this time and i rise in opposition to the socalled real id act of 2005
i just want to point out that regardless of the number of licenses that the terrorists held on september 11 they were all obtained because those individuals were in the country legally on student visas
and student visa holders in the future even after this act is passed will still have the opportunity to get licenses
and putting aside the schizophrenic immigration policy we have heard from the republican party you have a president that wants to have open borders and basically amnesty to allow open borders for lowwage workers to come in and then you have a republican house that is saying that all those coming in must not have licenses
we have millions of dollars in overcharges to the united states taxpayer we have bribery charges and we are doing all kinds of investigation on that nobid
there will be no review of the secretary s action in setting aside all of those laws no recourse
it is ironic mr chairman that while we have our soldiers in uniform protecting democracy we are giving it away under this bill
population fund to assess tsunami victims in indonesia sri lanka and the maldives for very specific pressing needs that i am very sure we can all agree are absolutely necessary at this time
mr chairman more than a 150 000 women are currently pregnant in the tsunamiaffected areas including 50 000 anticipated to give birth during the next 3 months
unfpa is determined to enhance the likelihood of deliveries occurring in safe and clean conditions by providing emergency care basic supplies and helping to rebuild health care facilities
in fact they are and have been on the ground since that tragic day helping save the lives of women children and families
fully 30 percent of them died in the tsunami and many of those who survived are still dealing with personal trauma
population fund unfpa to assist tsunami victims in indonesia sri lanka and the maldives for very specific pressing needs that i am sure we can all agree are absolutely necessary at this time
more than 150 000 women are currently pregnant in the tsunamiaffected areas including 50 000 anticipated to give birth during the next three months
unfpa is determined to enhance the likelihood of deliveries occurring in safe and clean conditions by providing emergency care basic supplies and helping to rebuild health care facilities
in fact they are and have been on the ground since that tragic day helping save the lives of women and children
disasters put pregnant women at greater than normal risk because of the sudden loss of medical support compounded in many cases by trauma malnutrition disease or exposure to violence
in times of high stress pregnant women are more prone to miscarriage or to premature labor both of which require medical care
the infrastructure for helping pregnant women in the tsunami region is severely damaged
1 650 of the indonesian midwife association s 5 500 members fully 30 percent died in the tsunami
the last time the united states contributed resources to unfpa was 600 000 for similar kinds of emergency assistance in afghanistan in 2001
section 6022 of hr 1268 as adopted in the conference report h rep
because the substitute language was not adopted by congress through regular legislative proceedings in the senate committee on small business and entrepreneurship and the house committee on small business but was adopted anew during the housesenate conference the in subsections 6022 a and b the language chosen to replace section 6023 in the conference report directs the department of energy and the small business administration to enter into a memorandum of understanding for reporting small business prime contracts and subcontracts at the department of energy
in subsection 6022 c the replacement language mandates a study of changes to management prime contracts at the department of energy to encourage small business prime contracting opportunities
the object of the study is to examine the feasibility of establishing a procurement agency relationship between the management prime contractors and the department of energy in accordance with the requirements of federal procurement laws federal procurement regulations the federal norm of government contracting as recognized by the comptroller general and applicable judicial precedent such as us west communications inc
finally in subsection 6022 d the replacement language imposes certain requirements upon the department of energy concerning breakouts of services from large prime contracts for awards to small businesses
mr speaker when the house debated this legislation in march it voted 4202 to approve an amendment which i authored which reaffirms the us commitment under the convention against torture to not engage in torture and to not render or transfer people to countries where they are likely to face torture
the us signed this treaty under president reagan and the senate ratified it in 1994
despite our commitments under this treaty and the recent statements made by the bush administration emphasizing that the us is emphatically and unambiguously against the use of torture there have been repeated reports in the press indicating that the us has been sending detainees to countries where they are likely to face torture including to countries who have become notorious for their human rights violations
the practice of extraordinary rendition is shrouded in secrecy
an unmarked plane arrives in the middle of the night carrying men wearing plain clothes and black hoods to take custody of the prisoners cut off their clothes drug them on the spot shackle them and fly off into the night
the administration maintains that it is in full compliance with the convention against torture
cia director porter goss basically acknowledged as much when he stated but of course once they re out of our control there s only so much we can do attorney general alberto gonzales confirmed this when he said once someone is rendered we ca nt fully control what that country might do section 1031 of the conference report would prohibit the use of any funds included in this supplemental appropriations bill to subject any person in custody or under the control of the united states to torture or cruel inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment that is prohibited by the constitution laws or treaties of the united states
i support it because i read section 1031 to clearly prohibit any appropriated funds from being spent to subject any person in us custody or control to torture or other cruel inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment by transferring extraditing or rendering such persons to countries where they are likely to face torture
article 3 of the convention clearly states that no state party shall expel return refouler or extradite a person to another state where there are substantial grounds for believing that he would be in danger of being subjected to torture article 3 of the convention further states that for the purpose of determining whether there are such grounds the competent authorities shall take into account all relevant considerations including where applicable the existence in the state concerned of a consistent pattern of gross flagrant or mass violations of human rights it would be my expectation that the funding limitation contained in section 1031 would therefore prohibit funds from being used to transfer persons to any nation where the person was likely to face torture and that under section 1031 funds could not be used for transfers or renditions in situations where the us government had found there to be a consistent pattern of gross flagrant or mass violations of human rights
i would also note that in a september 2004 report to the united nations general assembly the un special rapporteur on torture expressed concern that reliance on diplomatic assurances is a practice that is increasingly undermining the principle of nonrefoulement and observed that where torture is systematic the principal of nonrefoulement must be strictly observed and diplomatic assurances should not be resorted to we take pride that even as our nation fought for its survival against the nazis and the japanese empire during world war ii that we did not ask our greatest generation to engage in torture or other war crimes
the legacy of the us then and now as we prosecute the war on terror is that we uphold our commitment to justice even in the face of shadows of terror and war
the test of a nation is found as much in how it wages war as in how it promotes the values of peace and democracy
mr speaker passage of this legislation demonstrates our commitment to our brave men and women in uniform and acknowledges that they need resources in order to accomplish their mission and return home safely
it also offers support for the families when a loved one pays the ultimate sacrifice in the cause of fighting for freedom
this bill finally requires the pentagon to use real performance indicators to report to congress with our progress in terms of security economic and iraqi security force training goals
it increases the military death gratuity to 100 000 and increases life insurance benefits to 400 000 for families of soldiers killed while on active duty in iraq and afghanistan
congress has funded these critical protections in the past and we re doing so once again in this bill
resolving the current instability in the region is in the longterm best interests of all americans failure in iraq would lead to irreparable consequences
thousands of american troops have been in iraq for more than 2 years
in the 1940s the truman committee saved the government and the american people 15 billion dollars
there was truth in government
there was trust in government
already america has spent 200 billion for the wars in iraq and afghanistan
billions of dollars have been awarded in noncompetitive contracts
recently the military acknowledged that 8 billion in cold hard cash is missing in iraq
it s happened before in iraq and unless something changes there is no reason to believe it wo nt happen again
on a rare occasion the defense secretary admits there is an issue quoting secretary rumsfeld according to some estimates we dod can not track 23 trillion in transactions the pentagon s own auditors admit that the military can not account for as much as 14 of what it spends
defense makes up half of all the discretionary spending in the budget
it uncovered defective systems improved efficiencies in existing programs and freed up billions of dollars for more crucial procurement
mr speaker i rise to express my deep frustration with the process being used by the republican leadership in this house
there are serious and legitimate concerns with this bill but the chairman of the committee on the judiciary did not hold a single hearing or markup in the 109th congress
in fact the bill bypassed the committee on the judiciary completely
despite the chairman s rhetoric there are provisions included in this bill that were never considered in the last congress
yesterday among several other amendments our colleagues the gentleman from new york mr nadler xz4002890 and the gentleman from florida mr meek xz4002700 testified that they believed the asylum provisions in this bill will make it harder for a persecuted person to gain asylum in the united states
those who gain asylum are legitimately fleeing from persecution in their home countries
i can not believe that the united states government would be that cruel and we would turn our backs on people who need asylum in order to truly be free from torture and persecution
what we need is better enforcement of the laws we already have not a bill that restricts the flow of the persecuted just because a few in this body either do not like immigrants or feel the need to pander to political pressures from immigrant haters in their districts
as i said there are other amendments that were offered last night in the committee on rules by both democrats and republicans a total of 14
it upends the process of granting asylum to individuals and families who have suffered torture or persecution in other countries
the regulations are in the process of being developed with the input of the state agencies that issue driver s licenses
enacting a new bill that prescribes eligibility for driver s licenses would delay and disrupt the implementation of the 911 bill s standards even before they have been put in place
mr chairman it is very hard for me to respond to what the chairman just shared with us because basically if we do not pass this amendment of striking this 101 section we might as well just take all the language in 101 and say if you are being persecuted or if you are being raped as a woman or you are being abused as a child do not come to america because that is basically what this amendment is saying
where are the media reports of how lax our asylum laws are here in the united states
why are they not knocking down the doors in the halls of congress saying we really have to tighten up those asylum laws because they are too weak now
we are following the people who have focused on this the most the 911 commission and what they are asking for is for us to review and make sure we have good asylum laws in place
i commend my colleagues who are looking at this but moving in haste and having this manager s amendment before the congress and no one has seen it
mr chairman i rise in opposition to the emergency supplemental wartime appropriations act
it is unconscionable that the administration comes to congress for another emergency supplemental when it has failed to account for previous emergency funding and has failed to include the cost of the war in the fy 06 budget
how can this administration offer a budget that does not include funding for america s military operations overseas when we have more than 150 000 soldiers in iraq and afghanistan for an indefinite period of time
why does the administration continue to resort to supplemental funding to pay for this war instead of including the cost in the budget where it will sufficiently reflect the impact of operations iraqi freedom and enduring freedom on our deficit
mr chairman i did not support the iraq supplemental request last year because i had serious concerns about no bid contracts in the bill
enacting this request would mean that this congress will have provided this administration with almost 300 billion for military and reconstruction efforts in afghanistan and iraq
let me state outright that i opposed going to war in iraq but that is not my reason for opposing this supplemental request
we were deceived with exaggeration of hussein s weapons capabilities and now we are being deceived about the duration of the engagement and its exact cost on the american purse and the loss of our men and women in uniform
we have exacerbated the situation in the middle east and put our country in a more vulnerable position because of this war and now we are asked to surrender the responsibilities of this body to hold the administration accountable for its actions
our constitution was carefully crafted so as to allow a balance of power in our government
despite this legal obligation clearly delineated in last year s defense appropriations act we have to date received no report accounting for the spending and detailing cost estimates of previous supplemental funding
sadly we have no report directly from dod but the inspector general reported that almost 9 billion in reconstruction funding has been mishandled and poorly accounted for
in fact the inspector general suggests that thousands of ghost employees were on an unidentified ministry payroll
in addition dod has stated in the past that 220 000 iraq security forces had been trained and equipped that number was then scaled down to 136 000
with enactment of this bill congress will have appropriated 300 billion for the efforts in iraq without proper accounting of the spending of these funds
this bill is critically lacking in accountability
unfortunately the president s budget chose not to fund the 2 000 new border patrol agents or 8 000 additional detention beds that were called for in the intelligence reform bill
the bill would repeal a gao study to ascertain any vulnerability in the current asylum system and replace it with new burdens that would be impossible for many true asylum seekers to meet
no terrorist has ever been granted asylum in the united states
we further ensured that terrorists would not be granted asylum with the administrative changes of 1995 and the expedited removal system done legislatively in 1996
but asylum encourages citizens of other countries to fight for positive change in their own country without risking us military lives
if their life is endangered they should have a chance to seek asylum in the united states
the bill would repeal the tough minimum standards for driver s licenses called for by the 911 commission and included in the intelligence reform law with provisions that federalize all driver s licenses take away states rights place huge unfunded mandates on the states without advancing the paramount objective of making stateissued identity documents more secure and verifiable
mr chairman if you truly want to implement tough yet smart measures to ensure our nation s security vote down this legislation and let us fully fund and implement the tough and smart provisions that were included in the intelligence reform bill
mr chairman i thank the gentleman from virginia for yielding me this time and i rise today in very very strong support of the identification reforms that are in this legislation
these reforms in my opinion are extremely necessary to help us better protect our identity documents and to secure our borders
stateissued driver s licenses and state identification cards are the most widely used form of identification in the nation
driver s licenses are used in everyday instances such as boarding an airplane or enrolling in a flight school
our message on this issue is clear if you are not in this country legally then you will not be given legal sanctions on our roads
if you are in america on a visa you will be issued a driver s license but it will expire on the same day as your visa
in my former role as the secretary of state in michigan where i served as the chief motor vehicle administrator i was forced to issue drivers licenses to illegal aliens
mr chairman i rise in opposition to this bill
one of the solemn honors that i have had as a member of congress is to visit our soldiers who have been wounded in iraq
i have visited with them at walter reed army hospital here in washington and at the veterans hospital at palo alto california
each time that i have left these brave men and women i have had to confront my role as a policymaker and whether or not i have done all i can to serve and protect them in their mission
i voted not to go to war in iraq because i believed at the time of the vote and i believe now that the case had not been made that the intelligence we had did not support what the bush administration was telling the american people was the threat that we faced from iraq
the duty this government owed to its soldiers when they were sent into combat was not met not in the justification not in the preparation and not in the planning
all americans now understand that the reasons that the bush administration gave to go to war in iraq were not true
in spite of the advice of many in our military in our state department and among our allies the administration remained determined to wage a war in iraq
in short the administration failed to be truthful with the american people and with the congress
today we are being asked to vote for another 81 billion for the war in iraq
this is the third supplemental appropriations bill for iraq since the war started totaling nearly 200 billion and without a change in course the nonpartisan congressional budget office estimates the war in iraq and afghanistan will cost an additional 458 billion over the next 10 years
astoundingly this additional request has no change in strategy forthcoming from the president to address the absence of control and continued violence against our troops and the iraqi people
the president and his advisers cling to the idea that america is just one major battle away from victory or that with just one more capture of a significant insurgent leader we will break the back of the opposition to our occupation and to the formation of a democratic government in iraq
those who continue to attack our troops and the iraq people have been described in many different ways as the war has dragged on
in fact the violence rapidly spread to other major cities
while it has become clearer to those with both diplomatic and military experience that we must now develop a new strategy for success it is resisted by the very same top command in the white house and the pentagon who have made so many errors and so many miscalculations that have continued to place so many of our military in circumstances in which they are not able to prevail
their failure to anticipate plan and train for the mission that our soldiers were faced with was a failure of the first duty of care owed by the commander in chief and the defense secretary to our troops the duty to provide for the protection of our forces
this was not done and the results have been thousands of wounded and killed at the same time that the pentagon resists change and fails to transform its approach to fighting terrorism in iraq and elsewhere
it is labeled as an emergency as if somehow the administration did not know what money it was going to need for the war in this year s budget or in next year s budget
if they did they would be honest with the american people about the real cost of war and the lack of progress being made on the ground about the plan for drawing down our troops and about the real reason american soldiers were sent to iraq in the first place
i can not in good conscience vote to approve a supplemental appropriations bill that offers no strategy for success that has no plan to draw down our troops in a responsible manner and that fails to makes a compelling case to the american people about why the haunting sacrifices of lives limbs and money have been necessary
i know that some of my colleagues in very good conscience and with honorable intentions believe that supporting this bill is the equivalent of supporting our troops
rather in my view to vote for this supplemental is to expose our troops to the same leadership in the white house and the pentagon that refuses to tell the truth that refuses to take responsibility for its actions and that refuses to hold a single person accountable for the failed decisions that have been made for this war
and it exposes them to the same leadership that refuses to provide the kind of change that will start to remove the central organizing principal of the guerrilla war in iraq the presence of nearly 150 000 american troops viewed as occupiers by those who oppose us
to say that we must remain in the current configuration in iraq because the situation will get worse is to ignore the facts on the ground facts that have been acknowledged by many of our field commanders by members of congress who have visited iraq and by members of the news media covering the war
and this is not a vote about the heroism shown by the thousands of iraqis who risked their own lives by voting in the national elections in january
we support our troops by arguing in favor of a strategy for success
but we do not honor our troops simply by approving yet another allegedly emergency bill that offers no promise of success in an area of the world where success is not just critical it is literally a matter of life and death
we can provide for the needs of our troops in a bill that also provides for success in this war
mr speaker it has been 2 years since president bush stood aboard the uss lincoln aircraft carrier and declared mission accomplished in iraq
and in those two years it has become increasingly clear that the war in iraq is far from over and that the american people are paying the price
let s just take a look at the facts there are currently 150 000 american troops now serving in iraq including 8 000 reserve and national guard troops
tragically 1 582 american service members have been killed in the iraq war
at least 12 243 us troops have been wounded in action many with grievous injuries that will require a lifetime of medical assistance and other types of support
more than one in five iraqi war veterans have some type of mental disorder caused by their wartime service
in addition to the cost of life and quality of life for the brave american men and women who are fighting in iraq the dollar cost of the war is also taking its toll on the american people
to date 217 billion in american taxpayer dollars have gone to fund the war in iraq
in fact today s 82 billion supplemental is the fifth such supplemental congress has passed at the request of the bush administration to fund the war on terror
that means gas prices have risen 33 cents in just the last two months and are 42 cents a gallon higher than a year ago
the economy grew at just 31 percent in the first quarter the slowest pace in 2 years and down from a 38percent pace logged in the final quarter of 2004
the us trade deficit surged to an alltime high of 6104 billion in february
two years after president bush declared mission accomplished in iraq there is still no end in sight
mr speaker on february 17 2004 the national debt of the united states exceeded 7 trillion for the first time in our country s history
in the past year our country has added 700 billion to our national debt
the outofcontrol rise in our national debt over the last year and the rise in our debt envisioned in this conference report are further signs of the terrible fiscal position in which we now find ourselves
in 2001 we had tenyear projected surpluses of 56 trillion 20022011
that s a 95 trillion reversal in our tenyear fiscal outlook
both parties need to work together in a bipartisan fashion to bring our budget back into balance so we can avoid the higher longterm interest rates and weakened dollar that are the inevitable consequences of rising deficits and a high national debt
we are witnessing on a daily basis the reaction of the global financial markets to our fiscal irresponsibility and as we can see in this conference report congress has not yet gotten the message that deficits and debt matter
budget enforcement rules that apply to only certain parts of the budget will not have a significant impact on our rising deficits as federal reserve chairman alan greenspan mentioned in his recent testimony before the budget committee
to put that figure in perspective projected interest on our national debt next year will be 75 billion more than projected spending on education public health health research and veterans benefits combined 138 billion
in addition to assuming an everlarger share of our annual budgets the interest on our debt and the debt itself are increasing our reliance on foreign borrowers which will weaken our position in the world and increase the risk that another nation will be able to assert greater leverage over america
finally our deficits and debt threaten the social security and medicare programs that have raised so many of our seniors out of poverty and helped sustain the strongest middle class in history
with a projected 75 year unfunded liability of 37 trillion both parties in congress need to work together to address social security s solvency problem and this conference report does nothing to protect social security
in fact it continues the practice of raiding the social security trust funds to pay for other expenses of the federal government
now i support what the gentleman from virginia chairman tom davis is trying to do to improve the integrity of driver s licenses but i find it curious that the leadership of the house has chosen to largely ignore the multiple references in the 911 commission report to the value of oncard biometric technology in improving the integrity of identification cards
we are equally responsible for what military activity we engage in
the second fact is one that has been expressed time and again particularly by our senior military officers that we ought not engage in military activity that we ought not go to war without a plan to win the peace
it would give nominal resources to the secretary of defense to be able to give us the kind of information that we need to work with the executive branch to evaluate how we are doing in terms of succeeding in our mission in iraq
we have invested billions of dollars in reconstruction
in terms of political stability are we waiting for ratification of the constitution and then a subsequent election
and if that election goes well will that mean that we can gradually begin completing our mission at least in terms of the proportion of the troops that are currently committed
does it mean a 6week training course in human rights which some have suggested meant that they could be considered security forces or does it mean the kind of intensive training for many months that is comparable to what we give our troops so that they can engage in battle and can show leadership in the face of military confrontation
and when we pass a supplemental that contains 600 million for a new embassy that maintains our substantial force in iraq we want to make sure we do not give any credence to our enemies who in secretary rumsfeld s expression seem to be able to recruit insurgents greater in number than we could ever possibly kill
mr chairman reclaiming my time it would remain in the bill that the administration would have to detail and share with us what is their strategy for success
mr speaker i rise in support of this conference committee report
but mr speaker the american people whose sons and daughters are fighting this war and the senior military officers who are directing this war deserve to know what the white house will consider to be success in iraq
now this conference committee report includes language that would require the administration to fully evaluate the situation in iraq and provide the congress with measurable achievable criteria including the following an assessment of the number of troops it will take to secure the peace and how those troops would be rotated key measures of political stability such as ratification of a national constitution and permanent national elections now scheduled for next year the estimated strength of the iraqi insurgency and the extent to which it is composed of noniraqi fighters the operational readiness of iraqi military forces including the type number size and organizational structure of iraqi battalions that are capable of conducting counterinsurgency operations independently the fact is that our longterm presence in iraq will only give our enemies in the region a greater ability to recruit terrorists and build public support for violence
this language that is included in the report will require the secretary to report no later than 60 days after the enactment of the supplemental and every 90 days thereafter
mr chairman this is truly a bipartisan bill the defense part of it in particular
we tried to put in what the people in the field asked us and what needed to be done
i have had 12 people killed in my district and there is no question in my mind for the need for that to be changed
but the thing that is the most important in my estimation is accountability
chairman young and i sat in his office not long ago and talked about the bill and he got his copy of the constitution out and it talked about accountability
we believe that if you do not have the confidence of the people if you do not have confidence in the way the money is being spent you are going to lose confidence in the overall project the overall philosophy the overall direction we are trying to go
we put language in the bill last year and we said you have got to give us a report
of course that takes us to the next step and that is the thing with the intelligence which we have read in the newspaper and which i can neither confirm nor not confirm has happened
many of the things we put in this bill they did not ask for because they did not know about it
of course any problems we have in conference i am sure we will work them out
just because we say we are going to put 5 million in does not mean it is going to be a truman commission
so there is no doubt in my mind this is not something that is going to happen
mr chairman i rise in opposition to the amendment
i understand the technicalities of it that it should not be in a supplemental it should be in a regular bill but to put all the o amp m money in the national guard would do a disservice to the regular forces
all three bases were short in o amp m money
they were short in almost every category
we will take a look in the conference to see if the national guard needs more o amp m money and we will see what we can do
mr speaker in regards to what the gentleman from wisconsin mr obey xz4003000 just said i am surprised at the new chairman
we put money in for those kinds of things
we increased the amount of money somebody gets when they are killed in action
we expanded it so that when they are killed in action they are taken care of retroactively as well as prospectively
so we put money in to take care of people who were injured so severely as well as the ones that were killed
and i got so many letters from the people at home and i have had 12 killed in my district how pleased they were about what we are doing because it helped them get through a very difficult time
what we have tried to do over the years is make sure that the people that were in the armed forces had what they needed that the people in iraq have what they need
our subcommittee brought to the attention of the country that they were without a lot of equipment in iraq
new trucks we are trying to figure out how to put new trucks in that are encapsulated because we have taken care of the humvees but we need to take care of the trucks now
so we got some commercial trucks which were recommended which were 100 000 less but it was so late we could not get it in the bill
so this bill is taking care of equipment shortages not all of them but it is taking care of as many as we could possibly squeeze in
and i have said to many of the industrial leaders in this country the minute the war is over there will not be any supplementals there will be a lot less money to be spent and we have got to spend this money now in the supplementals to make sure that that gets done
many of the things that have happened have happened because we see it out in the field
we go out in the field talk to the people make sure that we are doing the right thing and then we try to send defense in the right direction
mr chairman we are all grateful to our troops and those serving in iraq
but every time when i go home no matter what the subject is that we are talking about in any meeting the thing that always comes up is the deficit
my concern with the embassy being in the supplemental is exactly that it is over and above the regular process
i have no problem with building an embassy in iraq
we need an embassy in iraq but we have also known we need an embassy in iraq and why did it not come through earlier if it is that much of an emergency
yes it is a huge amount of money and i understand it is not just a building it is a compound but it is three times what we have spent in afghanistan already
if we do not start getting some discipline in this body in what we are doing we are never going to get back to where we all want to be and that is what we did in 1997 was start to balance the budget and we were well on the way
we had the war the recession other problems which have interfered with that but we have to have some fiscal discipline and just putting things that are not actual emergencies in a supplemental spending bill in my opinion is not to be done
the other things in the supplemental are needed
our chairman has done a very very good job with this bill but i have a problem with funding the embassy in a supplemental
under the excuse of national security for example the asylum provisions in this bill completely gut the possibility of many legitimate victims of persecution to be granted asylum
but since 911 in fact since the 1996 act most asylumseekers are in jail while resolution of their cases are pending so they can not pose a threat
what this bill does is to change the standards by which the judgment is made as to whether they should get asylum but while it is being judged they are in jail
for example one provision would change current law to require that the applicant prove that his or her race religion et cetera is a central reason instead of merely a major reason for the legitimate fear of persecution in order to get asylum
now this was not and some of the points in the manager s amendment were not in the bill before us last year
this provision at least and i am gratified that the committee on rules made the amendment to be in order by me and the gentleman from florida mr meek xz4002700 and the gentlewoman from texas ms jacksonlee xz4001990 to strike this section of the bill and in order for it to be passed tomorrow so that the committee on the judiciary can properly vet this bill or the asylum provisions can be properly looked at and we can deal with it adequately
this section in my judgment would subject hundreds maybe thousands of people to being tortured or abused or shot because of their race color religion creed or opposition to a dictatorial regime back home because it would make it impossible for them to get asylum
so i hope that this bill will not be passed in its current form and that my amendment will be passed so that we can give proper consideration to some of these provisions that do not really aid the national security but do gut protection for people who need those protections
mr speaker the distinguished chairman talks about section 102 of the bill which gives the secretary of homeland security the ability to waive all laws that might get in the way of building the fence and he talks about environmental laws and he talks about endangered species
this says the secretary of homeland security shall have the authority to waive all laws in his sole discretion that he determines necessary
the secretary of homeland security can tell the contractors if anybody gets in your way shoot them
then to make sure that the secretary can be a total dictator in contravention of the constitution in contravention of all our laws it then says no court shall have jurisdiction to hear any clause or claim arising from any decision the secretary takes or to order any compensatory declarative injunctive equitable or any other relief for damages alleged to have been suffered
so someone can be shot because the secretary says shoot anybody that gets in the way by accident or deliberately and the courts can not review whether the secretary had the authority whether this is constitutional
one other thing i got up on this floor and i said this is going to become boiler plate language in bills and here it is
regardless of the merits of this bill regardless of the merits of this provision in general this is disgraceful
under the excuse of protecting national security the asylum provisions in this bill make it much more difficult for legitimate victims to be granted asylum
since that 1996 change asylum seekers are jailed put in custody until a finding of reasonable fear of persecution is made so they can not pose a threat while they are in custody
because current law already places the burden of proof on the asylum applicant and places the applicant in custody until he or she meets the initial burden of proof a terrorist who wishes to enter the united states would most likely attempt to do so by a tourist visa or on fraudulent papers
they are not going to claim political asylum and then be put in jail until they can show a credible fear of persecution
if we pass this bill in its current form mothers fathers children with legitimate asylum claims will be sent back to their persecutors with no benefit to national security
the new provision in this bill would require proof that one of these factors race color creed political opposition is the central reason for the legitimate fear
the judge would be forced to look into the minds of the persecutor and decide what weight to give to a particular motive in cases of mixed motives which they are in order to prove the burden of proof that this is the central reason
this section would deny a victim asylum based on an immaterial inconsistency or inaccuracy in a prior statement
so an applicant who at the airport perhaps without a decent understanding of english or a mistranslation forgets or misspeaks the date of her high school graduation or the date of her wedding or her grandchildren s births even though the dates might not be significant in her culture unlike in ours would later be denied safe haven from persecution even though they have nothing to do with the legitimacy or lack of legitimacy of her claim for asylum under the law
it is mr chairman in the larger sense unamerican
i urge my colleagues to stand with me in voting for the nadlermeekjacksonlee amendment to strike these provisions and keep our law humane and american
mr chairman no person in our country should be given unfettered authority unfettered discretion to waive any or all laws for whatever the purpose
in order to expedite construction of this fence the department of homeland security could select a contractor without competitive bidding use undocumented workers violate child labor laws pay the workers less than the minimum wage exempt contractors from federal and state withholding workers could be forced to put in 18hourdays without overtime pay in unsafe conditions and be transported in trucks used for hazardous cargo and allow the secretary discretion to have these workers construct fences and roads through private property
he would prefer to offer an amendment which directly establishes a trumanlike committee to investigate profiteering in iraq
given the fact that they have done that the gentleman s only choice is to proceed in the manner he has proceeded in the amendment he has just offered
the purpose is to see to it that a committee is formed which will have as its sole responsibility the reviewing of the use and misuse of taxpayer funds in iraq
i think the taxpayers many of whom have substantial doubt not just about the war but about the conduct of some of the contractors during and after the war i think the taxpayers would like to know that if we are going into their pockets for an additional 80 billion today at least we are doing the utmost possible to see to it that that 80 billion is spent in accordance with the law and is spent in accordance with good judgment
it seems to me if this congress is looking for ways to achieve the maximum support for the administration s policy they would certainly support efforts to see to it that that policy is being conducted in such a manner that embarrassment is not eventually brought to the president to this congress and to our effort in the country and in the region
mr chairman if the previous speaker is going to describe something i did in committee i wish he would get his facts straight
the fact is contrary to what the gentleman said when the majority brought its recommendations to the full committee with respect to the provision in the bill which raised life insurance benefits from 250 000 to 400 000 with respect to that provision the committee had applied it retroactively only to those persons who died in iraq and afghanistan
we added coverage for what was estimated to be 2 400 additional american service people who died but were not in iraq or afghanistan
we did that for instance on the theory that if you are a member of the reserve you are called up to go to iraq but you are killed in a training accident before you can get there that you are just as dead your family is just as much in need as would be the case with someone who went to iraq and then died in an accident
dick bolling who was my mentor when i came here and chaired the committee on rules used to talk disdainfully of people who looked at this house through the prism of what he called dung hill politics in other words focusing on jurisdiction of different committees forgetting that we have a larger responsibility to the body as a whole and to the country as a whole
now i make no apology for the fact that the committee on appropriations might have stepped on a few toes in expanding benefits for deserving servicemen and women
but the fact is if the gentleman has objections to what the administration has suggested then i would suggest the majority party needs to get its act together rather than risking these expanded benefits by doing what they almost did in the committee on rules today which is to make these two sections of the bill subject to a point of order which could have lost those benefits for deserving servicemen and women
reclaiming my time with all the due respect the gentleman misquoted and mischaracterized my amendment in committee
the gentleman described it as an amendment limiting benefits when in fact it expanded them and i do not appreciate that
reclaiming my time with all due respect the effect of my amendment as scored by cbo was to add 95 million in costs
what we did was to provide 95 million in additional benefits to persons who had died who were not living in iraq and afghanistan
when i first drafted my first proposal we were told that the committee on veterans affairs itself was concerned that we might have gone too far in providing benefits to people because for instance the example used to me was we do not want to pay someone who was killed in a drunken driving accident because he had five martinis at a bar
we want to make sure that this occurred in the line of duty
but the overall effect of the amendment was to add benefits for 2 400 people who had died who had not been killed in iraq and afghanistan and that was estimated to cost 95 million
i made clear yesterday that based on conversations with andy card the president s staff director i have agreed to withdraw this amendment pending the administration s getting together with the leadership of the committee on appropriations and working out a process by which activities of the department of defense that are classified will in fact be communicated to the congress
i simply want to read one sentence from an article that appeared in the new yorker about this matter
it reads as follows the intelligence system is now designed to put competing agencies in competition
what is missing will be the dynamic tension that ensures everyone s priorities in the cia the dod the fbi and even the department of homeland security
if the congress takes seriously its obligation to exercise the power of the purse which is one of only two real powers that we have outside of actual legislating and if the congress feels we have an obligation to this institution that transcends our obligation to the committees on which we serve then the congress will see to it that the executive branch understands that we are not trying to dictate what they do we are simply trying to see to it that what they do is consistent with american values and will not get the country in trouble in the first place
but if we do not i will be pursuing every possible avenue to see that an amendment such as this is adopted because this congress has an obligation to know what is happening in some of these covert and clandestine operations
in fact we need to go further
we have increased in this bill insurance benefits for servicemen and women who die up to 400 000 but servicemen and women who come back from combat who are brain damaged who have lost their sight who have lost their arms who have lost their legs they come back to really very little assistance from uncle sam
in addition to what the gentlewoman is talking about we also need to be looking at the huge hole that still exists in the earning power of those individuals and we need to do a whole lot more than we are doing today
mr speaker this bill before us today makes clear that we have now spent 284 billion in iraq and afghanistan since the war began
the money that has been spent in afghanistan is certainly legitimate and justified
we have spent some 240 billion on this entire endeavor since the president first landed in his jumpsuit on that carrier and addressed the country under the banner mission accomplished there has been quite a bit of that mission left since it supposedly was over
we have now been involved in iraq longer than we were involved in world war i and respectable and responsible experts have told me that they expect that we will be involved for at least another 5 years
i want to make quite clear i will support this bill because i feel that i have no choice but to participate in cleaning up the mess which somebody else left
i believe that the entire operation in iraq has been accompanied by incredibly naive romanticism on the part of the white house and on the part of the civilian leadership in the pentagon and that has left the people fighting the war to bear the brunt of the miscalculations that have been made by the civilian leadership of our government
and this bill understates in my view the amount of money that will be needed eventually to restore the readiness of the us armed forces and to minimize their casualties
the second thing this bill does is to demonstrate once again how we on both sides of the aisle have had to work doubly hard to overcome the resistance of the white house in adequately funding homeland security operations
and it has taken a bipartisan effort on the part of a wide variety of people in this congress in order to overcome that resistance
lastly i simply want to say that while i am certainly no expert on the subject i note that there is being attached to this bill a provision which many experts in the field feel has the potential to construct a nationwide database that could be very harmful in terms of people s efforts to engage in identity theft
i would simply make the point that certainly no one on our committee on either side of the aisle has the expertise that you would hope would be found in the authorization committees and i wish that that provision had been dealt with on a separate bill rather than solving an internal problem within the republican caucus by having it attached to an unrelated bill and i want to make one point about that
i want to serve notice that if the majority feels free to add unrelated authorization bills such as this to a mustpass bill that then i feel fully within my rights in offering whatever authorization legislation we feel appropriate on this side of the aisle and asking that it be attached to appropriation bills
so we will see in the coming months what the attitude of the majority is when we seek to add what we feel are legitimate efforts to strengthen appropriation bills by adding various pieces of socalled legislation to appropriation bills
mr speaker i yield 5 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from pennsylvania mr murtha xz4002860 the ranking member of the defense subcommittee the gentleman who has long been trying to extend debate in this chamber
this conference agreement falls short of the senate bill in 3 areas
it only contains funds for 500 border patrol agents not the 150 000 called for in the senate bill
it only contains funding for 50 immigration investigators not the 250 called for in the senate bill
it would take us to the levels contained in the senate bill for border patrol agents by adding funding for 550 additional border patrol agents and for 200 immigration investigators
it would also fund unmanned border aerial vehicles that have been used successfully in a test in arizona to assist in surveillance
since border patrol agents are trained at the federal law enforcement training center in artesia new mexico funding is included like the senate bill to purchase and operate modular classrooms for these additional agents
this motion in short would provide an additional 2844 million to immigration and customs enforcement to do this as was in the senate bill
i would note that on march 30 the administration announced it would add more than 500 agents in arizona but those are not new agents
mr speaker in this form i am
last year in the fiscal year almost 17 000 otms came across through that border patrol sector representing at least anywhere from 76 to 80 countries coming across into the united states
they go and process these individuals and they come in clusters from mexico
when this happens in the meantime the border is completely open because those border patrol people were removed to process these individuals
do my colleagues think he is going to come in
mr speaker i rise in support of the wartime supplemental that includes urgent funding for our soldiers and sailors now prosecuting the global war on terror in afghanistan and iraq
i have been relentless in talking to so many of you about my concerns related to spending on border security matters
i thank the gentleman from wisconsin mr obey for his work in getting negotiators to include this spending
the president came to the table with only 210 in his budget today we are adding another 500
given our border security is entirely budget driven this is a rare victory for those of us who have been talking about the need to put our money where our mouth is when it comes to protecting our nation from terrorists that may be trying to enter the country through the loopholes in our border security policy
we are sending our young soldiers to fight and die in iraq and afghanistan and we justify that by saying we are fighting the war there so we will not have to fight it here
we may very well be fighting a war over there and letting terrorists in our back door
law enforcement officers then take the released otms to the local bus station by the vanload where they head elsewhere in the us the number that never appear for deportation is over 90 percent of those released a number now probably over 75 000
until we send a signal that those who cross our borders illegally until we send a signal that when we catch you we will hold you until you are deported until we honestly face the amount of money it will take to deal with these things otms will continue to flock to the us quite possibly populating terror cells already operating in the united states
i do not agree with some of the socalled security provisions in this bill mainly the stricter asylum laws and national standards for drivers licenses
a country like ours that believes so greatly in freedom and the protection of the oppressed should be a safe haven for refugees that are being persecuted by their governments because of their race religion or political beliefs which is why we are fighting the war we fund in this bill
i am also disappointed congress has gone one step further in creating a national id
today s bill is a start in putting our money where our mouth is but it is still insufficient to the monumental border security task before us and i ask our appropriators to ensure the necessary funding is included in the fiscal year 2006 appropriations bill
given the status of that construction project this matter is timesensitive and while we have no reason to believe anyone involved with the construction may be seeking to install surreptitious listening devices within the building s walls and fittings we know there are people in this world who might like to do so
it is prudent to take reasonable steps against it and thus eliminate any chance of repeating what happened during construction of the us embassy in moscow some years ago
finally i wish to comment on something the conferees did not include in this bill namely any funding for up to 132 additional capitol police officers during fiscal 2005
obviously with less than five months remaining in fiscal 2005 the police could not hire and fully train 132 more officers by september 30 so there is little reason to include funds in this bill or even the funds for all 50 more officers included in the senate bill
however the overwhelming amount of this appropriation will be wasted in the continuing financing of the war in iraq
the war in iraq is an expensive blunder with costs now approaching the level of 300 billion
in the name of security we are throwing dollars at a problem which will yield the least amount of security here in the homeland
in general our federal expenditures for education including school construction and modernization could be increased greatly in order to guarantee that america has the most valuable ingredient to secure its future that is an educated population
they demonstrated that in the election in which they went out to participate
it works the same in any country that quote was from air marshall herman goering
i urge a no vote on this entire appropriation bill which is mostly for the continuation of the war in iraq
mr speaker i rise in support of the rule
i rise also in support of the sessions amendment
as a matter of fact i think it might be worse than just carrying our papers and showing our papers because in this bill there are no limitations as to the information that may be placed on this identification card
in many ways i understand how well intentioned this is but to me it is sort of like the gun issue
so i rise in strong objection to this bill
mr chairman i rise in strong opposition to hr 418 the real id act
in reality this bill is a trojan horse
it pretends to offer desperately needed border control in order to stampede americans into sacrificing what is uniquely american our constitutionally protected liberty
in essence in the eyes of the federal government they will cease to exist
what is even more disturbing is that by mandating that states participate in the drivers license agreement this bill creates a massive database of sensitive information on american citizens that will be shared with canada and mexico
it redefines terrorism in broad new terms that could well include members of firearms rights and antiabortion groups or other such groups as determined by whoever is in power at the time
there are no prohibitions against including such information in the database as information about a person s exercise of first amendment rights or about a person s appearance on a registry of firearms owners
when this new program is implemented every time we are required to show our driver s license we will in fact be showing a national identification card
hr 418 does nothing to solve the growing threat to national security posed by people who are already in the us illegally
mr chairman i rise in opposition to this 82 billion emergency supplemental bill
i also am opposed to the manner in which the real id act hr 418 was attached to the rule thereby stealthily making the establishment of a national id part of an emergency bill to which it is completely unrelated
this emergency supplemental is the second largest supplemental appropriations bill in united states history second only to the one last year
the funds will be considered emergency funds so congress can ignore spending caps that would require the billions in new spending to be offset by reducing spending elsewhere
if we pass this illconceived legislation we will spend 656 million for tsunami relief 94 million for darfur sudan 150 million for food aid most to liberia and sudan 580 million for peacekeeping overseas 582 million to build a new american embassy in iraq 76 million to build a new airport in kuwait one of the wealthiest countries on earth 257 million for counter drug efforts in afghanistan 372 million for health reconstruction and alternative development programs to help farmers stop raising poppy 200 million in economic aid for the palestinians 150 million for pakistan run by an unelected dictator 200 million for jordan 34 million for ukraine
mr chairman as the members know all of us in our country want to have our troops to have what they need when they go into harm s way
sadly that was not the case in the last 2 years
i hope that the 82 billion in this bill will redress some of those shortcomings shortfalls that our troops have had to suffer because they did not have the proper equipment
i rise mr chairman to commend the gentleman from massachusetts mr tierney xz4004070 and the gentleman from iowa mr leach xz4002360 for putting forth a very critical amendment to appropriate funds for a select committee to study the awarding and carrying out of government contracts in iraq and afghanistan
in their bipartisan work the gentleman from massachusetts mr tierney xz4004070 and the gentleman from iowa mr leach xz4002360 have made clear that accountability in government is not a partisan issue
in 1941 mr chairman senator harry truman got in his car and drove all across the united states making unannounced visits to defense plants and corporate offices
this was at a time when senator truman was in a democraticmajority senate there was a democratic majority in the house there was a democrat in the white house and our country was in a world war
today we are considering whether to appropriate another 80 billion to the war effort in iraq and afghanistan
this is in addition to the more than 200 billion that has already been made available
there are honest differences about defense policy but we should all agree in a bipartisan way that taxpayer money should always be spent efficiently and effectively
sadly the stories of abuse on contracts in iraq are everywhere nearly 9 billion spent on iraq reconstruction is unaccounted for because of inefficiencies and bad management
it took 167 days for troops in iraq to start receiving the insert 167 days
in doing so he created a bipartisan consensus that gave the public confidence in the war effort
i urge my colleagues to support this amendment and in doing so to support accountability in government spending and to stop the profiteering on the war in iraq
mr chairman in a few days we will mark the second anniversary of the invasion of iraq and the start of a war that in my judgment did not need to be fought
the president now says that the war is really about the spread of democracy in the middle east
this effort at afterthefact justification was only made necessary because the primary rationale was so sadly lacking in fact
the one constant in 2 years of combat has been the courage dedication and skill of the men and women of our armed forces
for more than 1 500 of our troops service in iraq required the ultimate sacrifice
similar losses have been experienced by families in spain in italy and of course in iraq
the bill before us provides another 75 billion for military operations in afghanistan and iraq
in fact this will be the third largest appropriations measure this year
that strategy for success must include an aggressive plan for transferring responsibility for their country s security to the iraqis an improved plan for iraq s reconstruction and an intensification of diplomatic efforts in the region
we in congress understand our responsibility to provide for the common defense
over the years they have worked very hard and provided great leadership for our men and women in uniform and for the security of our country
with nearly 140 000 troops in dire need of equipment and supplies this legislation will be overwhelmingly approved and i will support it
a willingness to provide our troops the support they need however should not be mistaken for support for the repeated failures in judgment that first put our troops in harm s way and that keeps them there today
two years ago this week on may 1 2003 president bush stood on an aircraft carrier under a banner that proclaimed mission accomplished considering the events that followed and what has been disclosed since then if the president were to stand under a banner today it would have to read credibility demolished we are in the war s third year
i have had the privilege to pay my respects to troops in theater and in hospitals in europe and in the united states
whatever our disagreement about the policy which brought us into the war whatever our disagreement on the lack of planning to end it it never diminishes the regard that we have for our men and women in uniform
i talked about credibility in terms of the lack of planning
there is also a lack of credibility in budgeting
here we are today on thursday talking about a supplemental with a set amount in it of emergency funding for our troops and we passed the budget last thursday
and it is clear that the figure in the supplemental is really not enough to meet to meet the measure that the chairman mentioned
we must focus on quality rather than quantity when training iraqi security forces accelerate iraq s reconstruction in ways that give iraqis a major stake in rebuilding their country and step up regional diplomatic efforts to heal the strife on which the insurgency thrives
our experience in iraq strongly suggest that if we do not take these steps and soon about training the security forces accelerating iraq s reconstruction and stepping up regional diplomacy or as the gentleman from pennsylvania mr murtha xz4002860 would say iraqatize internationalize and energize if we do not do this and soon americans may wonder for years to come if the end will ever be in sight
the funds provided for our troops in iraq and afghanistan for the relief of those devastated by the tsunami to aid those suffering in darfur and elsewhere and to promote middle east peace are necessary and important
since this is a conference report we can not have a ruling from the chair that will allow us to discuss some specifics about the unfunded mandate the driver s license application that is in the bill
but if you are at the desk at the department of motor vehicles and you have now become an immigration officer because you have to prove the citizenship or at least the legality of somebody being in the country it is a big burden it is costly and it is unfunded
in addition we unwisely vest in the secretary of homeland security the power to weigh federal and state environmental and labor laws
this in the name of securing our borders
securing our borders should be a national priority which makes it all the more inexplicable that the president did not request in his budget the extra border patrol agents and detention beds authorized by congress last year in response to the recommendations of the 911 commission
bipartisan efforts in the senate do more for border security in this bill and were rebuffed by house republicans in favor of provisions that trample on the rights of individuals and states and may result in the diminishment of the safety of the american people
thank heavens senator byrd prevailed with part of the money in the senate
the gentleman from wisconsin mr obey xz4003000 has been a champion on this issue year in and year out as far as this discussion has been going
the legitimate emergency needs to which it responds particularly the needs of our men and women in uniform overseas are real and must be addressed
mr chairman i rise in strong support of the real id act and with a particular sense of gratitude toward the gentleman from wisconsin mr sensenbrenner xz4003650 who has doggedly brought this legislation to the hill for one reason and one reason only
i was on the capitol grounds and my family during the school year lives in the washington dc area and like millions of other families in new york and washington dc was imperiled
as the 911 commission report stated for terrorists travel documents are as important as weapons on page 390 of the report they point out that all but one of the 911 hijackers acquired some form of us identification by fraud and that acquisition of these forms of identification assisted them in boarding commercial flights by bringing this legislation today the gentleman from wisconsin mr sensenbrenner xz4003650 is making my family safer in this post911 america and also closing asylum loopholes strengthening our deportation laws
the nadler amendment would have stricken the provision in the real id act that tightens and improves our asylum system which has been abused by terrorists with deadly consequences
the real id act will protect the american people by allowing immigration judges to determine witness credibility in asylum cases and ensuring that all terrorismrelated grounds for inadmissibility are also grounds for deportation
in summary as a cosponsor of this bill i believe that all of the provisions in the real id act are essential in protecting our citizens from future terrorist plots and i would have voted no on the nadler amendment
i commend the relief efforts on the ground in the immediate aftermath of the hurricane as well as the willingness of congress to step forward and offer meaningful relief to hurricane victims
at this time madam chairman i would like to yield to the distinguished chairman the gentleman from kentucky mr mike rogers to ask how was florida hurricane disaster aid reflected in the designation of fema disaster relief funds
i would ask the chairman is it his understanding that the administration has the authority under the stafford act to remove debris from the private lands when it is in the public interest
mr speaker i thank chairman lewis for including in the supplemental the provision which is our wounded warrior bill
never mind that they try to transition back into society those great wage earners trying to find selfworth in the work
mr chairman as the only member of congress with a background in immigration and experience in actually defending our nation s borders and after being here for 8 years in the house i am profoundly disappointed at how much we talk about this issue and how little we do when it comes to immigration
prior to coming to congress i served for 26 12 years in the united states border patrol so i know firsthand about the effort to protect our borders and how to keep america secure
since coming to congress i have heard a lot about how we need to crack down on illegal immigration in this country but have seen very little action when it comes to providing adequate funding for the kinds of programs that i know work in dealing with the problem of illegal immigration
the administration in their budget wants to hire 210 border patrol agents
the administration also has proposed zeroing out very important programs to communities that deal with undocumented aliens programs like the state criminal alien assistance program the state prosecutors program all zeroed out in this budget
just last monday i was with some of my former colleagues at a port of entry in el paso and they were asking me what kind of immigration reform would come out of this effort
i am mr speaker in its present form
mr speaker this motion to recommit provides for restrictions on the information contained in the national database
this would create no limit as to what other information may eventually be incorporated in the database
this motion would simply protect the privacy rights of americans from a national id database in this bill
in particular this amendment guarantees that the database can not become a centralized storage place for sensitive personal information on nearly every american about whether they own guns what guns they own and whether they have purchased any guns
this motion to recommit would also bar information on the exercise of first amendment and fourteenth amendment rights from being included in the driver s license database
as bob barr our former colleague said in the washington times last year in opposition to nearly identical provisions you know something is askew when we second amendment conservatives keep finding common cause with the american civil liberties union groups strongly opposed include the gun owners of america the aclu the republican liberty caucus the league of united latin americans citizens the american conservative union and the privacy rights clearinghouse
our constituents have set aside partisan concerns in recognition of the dangerous consequences unintended consequences of passing this misguided legislation
by forcing state governments to maintain and share files on almost every adult in the nation this bill will truly usher in the era of big brother
mr chairman last night i testified before the rules committee in support of two amendments i had hoped to offer to the supplemental appropriations bill being considered by the house today
the first of these amendments would add 772 million in funding for border security to hire an additional 1 000 border patrol agents provide 8 000 beds for immigration and detention removal operations and install radiation portal monitors at all ports of entry
as a member representing a district on the united statesmexico border and as the only member of congress with a background in immigration and experience in actually defending our nation s borders i have firsthand knowledge of the kinds of resources that we need to keep america safe
since coming to congress i have heard a lot about how we need to crack down on illegal immigration in this country but have seen very little action when it comes to providing adequate funding for the programs that we know will work in dealing with this problem
meanwhile every day foreign nationals from over 150 different countries who are here in the united states illegally are being apprehended and turned back on to our streets because we lack the space to detain them
at the same time we hear of known terrorists who are training recruits to infiltrate our country in order to do us harm
this increase is required in order to maintain existing service levels within the va health care system and would bring spending in line with the recommendations of the bipartisan leadership of the committee on veterans affairs
the va is the largest health care network in the united states and it is increasingly overburdened by a large military retiree population principally of world war ii and korean veterans
madam chairman house report 108773 which accompanied the military construction emergency hurricane supplemental bill stated the conferees agree to provide an additional 65 billion for disaster relief activities associated with declared disasters such as hurricanes frances ivan and jeanne supplemental funds appropriated in the wake of the four hurricanes may be used by fema in administering relief to stricken communities and victims in areas such as florida where the president declared disaster areas that meet current statutory eligibility under the stafford act
madam chairman it is my understanding that the stafford act authorizes the removal of wreckage and debris resulting from a major disaster from both public and private lands when the president determines that it is in the public interest
we have 11 million estimated illegal aliens in the country and 800 000 or so of them are people who have been ordered deported and yet have absconded
this bill when combined with the homeland security appropriations bills for 2006 that we marked up yesterday in the subcommittee those two bills combined will give us a new massive effort to deal with the problem
mr chairman i rise in opposition to hr 418 the real id act because contrary to its sponsors claims this bill will not improve our country s security
in addition this bill eliminates critical provisions in the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act passed by congress in 2004
finally the real id act makes it much more difficult for immigrants who are fleeing persecution to gain refuge in the united states
the american automobile association aaa foundation for traffic safety report entitled unlicensed to kill found that unlicensed drivers are almost five times more likely to be in fatal car accidents than are validly licensed drivers
denying licenses to undocumented immigrants will also hurt our national security by depriving law enforcement officials of critical information on millions of adults who are in the united states
licensed individuals are registered photographed and in some states fingerprinted
in fact because many of the 911 hijackers did have a driver s license the records kept by state departments of motor vehicles were invaluable after 911 in tracking where the terrorist had been and with whom they had associated
this information was used mr chairman there is no doubt that we must be proactive in the defense of our nation by identifying weaknesses in our security systems and making appropriate changes that will protect us from a terrorist attack
currently effective and workable federal standards furthermore the asylum provisions in the real id act do nothing to enhance our nation s security
given the fact that an asylum seeker is immediately held in detention before his claim is processed a terrorist would not risk claiming asylum to enter our country
this bill will make our roads more dangerous inhibit the work of law enforcement and undermine the homeland security measures enacted in the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act of 2004
mr chairman i rise in support of hr 1268 the war supplemental appropriations bill for fy 2005 which will provide funding for military operations and reconstruction activities in iraq and afghanistan as well as important funds for tsunami relief and recovery
committed to the fact that the wellbeing of our troops is our highest priority the appropriations committee increased funding by 69 percent more than requested for addon vehicle armor kits 401 million more or twice the amount requested for new trucks and 50 million in unrequested funds for radio jammers to disrupt attempts by iraqi insurgents to explode remote controlled bombs and mines
no amount can compensate for the death of a loved one but an increase in these benefits that can help a family cope with the financial impact of a combat death is long overdue
when the appropriations committee met i strongly supported the jackson amendment to add 150 million in food aid for sudan and i am pleased we have acted again today to add 100 million in additional disaster assistance
the united states has an obligation and opportunity to assist this troubled country and i believe this additional funding sets an important example for the united nations and other countries that still need to respond to the crisis in sudan
while there has been some improvement i am troubled that the department of defense has not submitted the required biannual report on the military operations of the armed forces and on the reconstruction activities administered by dod in iraq and afghanistan
we have been engaged in afghanistan for over three years and nearly three years have gone by since we invaded iraq
i am also disappointed that the republican leadership failed to make in order an important amendment by representatives hooley and delauro to expand veterans health care and mental health care
however in spite of my concerns i believe it is our responsibility to provide our servicemen and women the resources necessary for them to fulfill their mission and come home safely
mr speaker i rise in reluctant support of hr 1268 the war supplemental appropriations bill for fiscal year 2005 which will provide funding for military operations and reconstruction activities in iraq and afghanistan as well as important funds for tsunami relief and recovery
i say reluctant support because the republican leadership has made a very poor and political decision to include controversial legislative provisions in this emergency spending bill that otherwise enjoys almost universal support because it provides needed assistance for our servicemen and women overseas
no amount can compensate for the tragic death of a loved one but an increase in these benefits can help a family cope with the financial impact of a combat death
i am also pleased that additional funds have been provided for humanitarian relief and disaster assistance including 400 million for sudan 907 million for indian ocean tsunami relief and 240 million in pl
in particular the bill includes an assault against the matricula consular cards issued by mexican and other latin american consulates and consequently makes it an assault on our immigrant families who rely upon this form of identification in their daily lives for transactions involving banking housing education and even proving when necessary that they are the parents of their own children
because the republican leadership knows that if these controversial provisions were openly debated in the house and senate they would not pass
only by attaching these provisions to a mustpass bill like the emergency supplemental appropriations bill for our troops in iraq could they hope to be successful
nevertheless in spite of my concerns given the choice before us i believe it is my responsibility to provide our servicemen and women the resources necessary for them to fulfill their mission and come home safely
mr speaker i rise in strong support of this rule to provide for consideration of this counterterrorism bill of which i am an original cosponsor
it closes among other things the 3mile hole in the fortified usmexico border fence near san diego
recent press accounts have reported that al qaeda operatives have joined forces with alien smuggling rings like ms13 in order to enter the united states particularly through our porous southern border
this bill establishes strong security standards for the issuance of driver s licenses that all states must comply with to eliminate weak links in identity security
in fact eight of them were even registered to vote
it is a fact that terrorists have continued to use and abuse asylum laws to stay in our country
as the 911 commission found abusing our asylum law is the primary method in their words used by terrorist aliens like the 1993 world trade center bombers ramzi yousef and ahmad ajaj to remain in the united states
both in the words of the 911 commission concocted bogus political asylum stories when they arrived in the united states so if we want to make it harder for terrorists like yousef and ajaj to abuse our asylum system support this counterterrorism bill
the bill returns the law to its original understanding and overturns this ninth circuit precedent by requiring that asylum applicants establish that race religion nationality membership in a particular social group or political opinion was or will be a central reason for their claimed persecution
mr chairman as chairman of the subcommittee on international terrorism and nonproliferation i have to ask who should be in charge of counterterrorism policy
now environmental groups have successfully fought the completion of this fence over the years claiming that it would have a serious impact on everything from the san diego fairy shrimp to the san diego button celery all that in this 35 mile strip of desert along the border
can we protect ourselves from al qaeda operatives who have joined forces with alien smuggling rings like ms 13 in order to enter the united states through our porous southern border by stopping them from squishing the fairy shrimp as they slip through the gap in the fence
in the interest of national security we need to defeat this amendment
and this legislation uses existing states driver s license systems to ensure we know who is in our country that people are who they say they are and that the name on a driver s license is the holder s real name not an alias
mohammed atta received a 6month visa to stay in the us he received a florida driver s license good for 6 years
mr chairman on september 11 we were attacked by terrorists who took advantage of weaknesses in our border security
this bill contains urgent border security reforms that were not addressed in the intelligence reform bill that president bush signed into law in december
foremost in this bill are provisions that would prevent terrorists from obtaining a united states driver s license
like millions of immigrants here today my family came to this country in search of the american dream a better life for their children so that their children could receive a quality education some day own a home and earn a fair wage
the administration s budget also breaks the promise of putting an additional 2 000 border patrol agents on the job in 2006 as promised in landmark intelligence reforms passed last year and endorsed by the 911 commission
there are 8 million undocumented immigrants in this country who are cleaning our offices caring for our children and elderly and picking the fruits and vegetables that we consume
i rise in support of the maloneysnchezcrowley amendment
will affirm your support for women and children in dire need of our help
helping those in need is the right thing to do
mr chairman i rise in opposition to hr 1268 the emergency supplemental wartime appropriations act for fy 2005
it is such a shame that republicans had to incorporate the real id act in the iraq supplemental and tsunami relief when it has nothing to do with these two pressing issues
what hr 418 will do is undermine several key security features that were dealt with responsibly in the intelligence reform legislation which was based on the 911 commission recommendations
if the republicans and this administration really want to strengthen national security they should start by providing full funding for the department of homeland security particularly the security improvements authorized in the intelligence reform bill
like millions of immigrants my parents came here in search of the american dream and to give their children the opportunity to secure a promising future
however there is an issue of public safety involved in this bill as well
yesterday a criminal complaint was unsealed in the federal court in chicago which showed that there was a huge scam in getting wisconsin driver s licenses for illegal aliens to drive trucks
and in at least one instance the case of nasko nazov who is an illegal alien from macedonia 3 days after he obtained this driver s license he killed four people a family of four in a truckcar accident in baileyton tennessee
now the criminal complaint says that the scam worked as follows foreign nationals paid sponsors in chicago up to 2 000 for help in getting a commercial driver s license
the clients were transported from chicago to milwaukee via van to banks in milwaukee where they used the wisconsin addresses to open checking accounts
in wisconsin the written tests were given in english spanish and russian
in some cases the sponsors accompanied the clients to a private facility that has a contract with the state to conduct road tests
now because wisconsin does not require proof of legal residency in the united states in order to get a driver s license whether it is a regular license or a commercial driver s license mr nazov got a license validly issued by the wisconsin department of motor vehicles and 3 days later killed a family of four on a highway in tennessee with a truck he did not know how to drive
now legislation like this would have been a key move in preventing an illegal alien from getting this driver s license a driver s license he could not have gotten in the state of illinois
and if you do not believe that ask the family of the people who were killed in tennessee
mr speaker i submit for the record the story from the milwaukee journal sentinel entitled tennessee deaths bring new charge tennessee deaths bring new charge trucker illegally obtained license here a man who got a commercial truck driver s license illegally in wisconsin killed a family of four on a tennessee freeway then lied about his actions according to a criminal compliant unsealed tuesday in federal court in chicago
the investigation also revealed that in wisconsin at least 600 people from other states cheated on written exams bribed officials administering road tests or lied about their residency to get truck driver s licenses according to court records
if convicted nazov 45 of downers grove ill faces a maximum penalty of five years in prison a fine of up to 500 000 and deportation
he also is wanted in tennessee on reckless homicide charges said randall sanborn spokesman for the us attorney s office in chicago
nazov who has never lived in wisconsin received a wisconsin commercial driver s license on march 4 2003 according to court records
the family was returning home to virginia after visiting family in knoxville tenn according to the reports
their 1998 saturn was stuck in traffic because of an earlier accident
we believe there are up to 1 000 suspect licenses and this shows the risk inherent in each of those us attorney steve biskupic said tuesday
a milwaukee investigation parallel to the one in chicago is continuing he said
according to court records in the chicago case the scheme worked like this the foreign nationals paid sponsors in the chicago area up to 2 000 for help getting a commercial driver s license
clients were transported from chicago via van to banks in milwaukee where they used the wisconsin addresses to open checking accounts
in wisconsin the written tests are given in english spanish or russian
in some cases the sponsors accompanied the clients to a private facility that has a contract with the state to conduct road tests
the wisconsin rules for licensing are less strict than those in illinois
there written tests are offered only in english and translators are not allowed
road tests in illinois must be conducted at state offices not private facilities
nazov listed an address in the 4200 block of w loomis road in greenfield on his driver s license application according to the charging documents
he testified before a grand jury in june 2004 that he had lived there for a few months with his girlfriend
mr chairman in december the president signed into law legislation intended to respond to the recommendations of the 911 commission
unfortunately the legislation that was enacted failed to include several key provisions critical to addressing vulnerabilities found in both the 911 commission report and of the 911 staff report on terrorist travel
american citizens have the right to know who is in their country that the people are who they say they are and that the name on the driver s license is the real holder s name not some alias
we will end judgeimposed presumptions that benefit suspected terrorists in order to stop providing a safe haven to some of the worst people on earth
liberal activist judges in the ninth circuit have been overturning clearly established precedent and are preventing immigration judges from denying bogus asylum applications by aliens who are clearly lying
third the real id act will waive federal laws to the extent necessary to complete gaps in the san diego border security fence which is still stymied 8 years after congressional authorization
dear chairman barton thank you for your letter dated february 8 2005 regarding hr 418 the real id act as you noted some of the provisions of the bill contained in section 102 fall within the rule x jurisdiction of the committee on energy and commerce
pursuant to your request i will include a copy of your letter and this response in the congressional record during consideration of hr 418 on the house floor
i recognize your desire to bring this legislation before the house in an expeditious manner
in addition the energy and commerce committee reserves its right to seek conferees on any provisions of the bill that are within its jurisdiction during any housesenate conference that may be convened on this or similar legislation
i request that you include this letter in the congressional record during consideration of hr 418
had this bill been in effect at the time that driver s license would have expired on july 9 and he would not have been able to use that driver s license to get on a plane because it was an expired id
the burden of proof is on anybody who is the plaintiff or an applicant in any type of proceeding
in general
to establish that the applicant is a refugee the applicant must establish that race religion nationality or membership in a particular social group or political opinion was or will be the central reason for persecuting the applicant
secondly it says that in sustaining the burden it allows the trier of fact the immigration judge in this case to determine the credibility of the witnesses
now the trier of the fact whether it is a judge or a jury in any other legal proceeding bases determinations on the credibility of the witnesses as to what verdict is reached
there is no one who is lying through their teeth that should be able to get relief from the courts and i would just point out that this bill would give immigration judges the tool to get at the blind sheik who wanted to blow up landmarks in new york the man who plotted and executed the bombing of the world trade center in new york the man who shot up the entrance to the cia headquarters in northern virginia and the man who shot up the el al counter at los angeles international airport
mr speaker i rise in support of this rule for consideration of amendments to hr 418 the real id act
the current cap of 10 000 has resulted in a multiyear backlog that has caused unnecessary hardship to aliens already found to have been fleeing persecution
the manager s amendment also extends the bill s provisions regarding the credibility determinations of immigration judges in asylum proceedings to apply to other requests for relief from removal before immigration judges
lastly it includes the text of hr 100 introduced by the gentleman from california mr dreier xz4001150 to limit criminal aliens to one bite of the apple in contesting their removal orders
the other provision provided the secretary of dhs with the ability to intervene but only in the interest of national security to reduce the incredible diversity in form and appearance of driver s licenses issued by the states
mr chairman i claim the time in opposition
mr chairman i rise in opposition to the amendment and i wish those that were arguing against the amendment read it and see what it says and then i think they will be convinced that this is a commonsense change
first of all let me say that the asylum law was designed to provide safe haven to those who are fleeing persecution in their homeland
the bill as it is before us states that the applicant for asylum has the burden of proof to prove that he or she is eligible to receive asylum in our country
but every petitioner whether it is a plaintiff in a lawsuit or someone who is applying for social security disability benefits has got the burden of proof to show that they are entitled to the relief that they are seeking
every trier of fact in court makes the determination based on the credibility of witnesses
mr abdi was granted asylum in 1999
later after traveling to a terrorist camp in ethiopia he was arrested when he reentered the united states and his asylum status was revoked
now giving a judge an opportunity to deny a claim based upon a determination that the applicant is lying is in my bill and the gentleman from new york mr nadler xz4002890 tries to strike that
again in 1999 an egyptian national who had been granted asylum despite the fact that the ins had provided classified evidence that the alien was a known member of a foreign terrorist organization designated by the secretary of state and according to the committeehearing witness the ins submitted a report from a new york city detective showing the alien s participation in a meeting with the infamous sheik omar abdel rahman dedicated to planning acts of terrorism in which the pros and cons of hijacking an airplane were discussed
and if any jury in the country can convict a defendant based on its determinations of credibility certainly an immigration judge should be able to do the same thing
page 2 of the managers amendment incorporated in the bill says the applicant has to establish that he is a refugee within the meaning of this section
the applicant must establish that race religion nationality membership in a particular cultural group or political opinion was or will be a central reason for persecuting the applicant
louis prior to the second world war would have qualified because they were being persecuted in nazi germany because of their religion
people who have been engaged in what was used to be called antisoviet activities in the former soviet union that was a political opinion they would have been eligible for asylum
mr chairman i rise in opposition to this amendment which continues to have endless litigation against plugging the hole in the fence south of san diego
in early january i sent two of my staff personally to inspect this area
the border patrol says he is typical of the one in three aliens they apprehend coming through the 3mile unfenced area along the beach
we can cut down that cost and incarcerate fewer criminal aliens by plugging the hole in this fence and keeping them south of the border
mr speaker i rise in opposition to the motion to recommit
what the motion to recommit does is force the states to do something or not do something and that goes directly against the notion of federalism that is contained in this bill and which was drafted by the committee on government reform
the vote on that was 228 aye to 191 no the author of this motion to recommit as well as the 190 who joined him in saying that we should not waive the unfunded mandate law is now asking the states to have another unfunded mandate
i would urge all of the 191 who voted no on the jacksonlee objection to consideration of the rule to bring this up to join me in voting no on this motion to recommit together with the 228 who voted the right way yesterday
as many in this chamber know this conference report contains the provisions of the real id act which i offered and the house overwhelmingly approved earlier this year
the sensible reforms contained in this legislation are long overdue and will make america safer
these provisions will hamper the ability of terrorists and criminal aliens to move freely through our society by requiring that all states prior proof of lawful presence in the us for their driver s licenses be accepted as identification for federal purposes such as boarding a commercial airplane entering a federal building or a nuclear power plant
i would also note that there are several immigrationrelated provisions included in the report by the other body that enjoy broad support from this house
one will provide that aliens who have received h2b visas issued to work in temporary or seasonal jobs in any of the last 3 years shall not be counted toward the 2005 or 2006 quotes when applying for an h2b visa during the next 2 years
i wish to thank the house leadership the white house and many members of both chambers who rightly recognized the importance of the real id act and supported its inclusion in this conference report
and i quote as a result the additional costs that would be imposed by hr 418 the real id act of 2005 would not exceed the annual threshold established in the unfunded mandates act 62 million in 2005 which is the annual adjustment rate for inflation
hr 418 contains several intergovernmental mandates as defined in the unfunded mandates reform act umra
as a result the additional costs that would be imposed by hr 418 would not exceed the annual threshold established in umra 62 million in 2005 adjusted annually for inflation
this bill contains no new privatesector mandates as defined in umra
estimated cost to the federal government the estimated budgetary impact of hr 418 is shown in the following table
in contrast the provisions of hr 418 are more specific and likely would go beyond what will be required under current law
cbo estimates that these additional requirements in hr 418 would impose costs above those incurred under current law
driver license agreement in addition hr 418 would require states to participate in the driver license agreement an interstate database to share driver information that was not included in public law 108458
the agency has less than 2 million in unspent funds which are currently being used to identify acceptable alternative plans to complete the barrier
in addition the czma already enables the president under certain circumstances to waive laws as necessary to complete projects deemed of paramount interest to the united states
estimated impact on state local and tribal governments procedures for processing and issuing driver s licenses and identification cards under current law are in the process of changing due to federal legislation enacted in december 2004
the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act of 2004 created federal standards for states to follow in issuing driver s licenses and identification cards
as a result the additional costs that would be imposed by hr 418 would not exceed the annual threshold established in umra 62 million in 2005 adjusted annually for inflation
in contrast the provisions of hr 418 are more specific and likely would go beyond what will be required under current law
cbo estimates that these additional requirements in hr 418 would impose costs above those that will be imposed by the mandates in current law
the incremental additional costs however are unlikely by themselves to exceed the annual threshold established in umra in any one year
in addition four other states montana new mexico oregon and wisconsin issue driver s licenses and identification cards that are valid for eight years
other impacts on state and local governments in addition to the other requirements of the bill states would be required to participate in the driver license agreement an interstate compact to share driver information
estimated impact on the private sector this bill contains no new privatesector mandates as defined in umra
mr speaker i do appreciate and respect the gentleman from michigan s joining with the gentlewoman from texas in bringing this issue before the house today
the congressional budget office is a professional organization that assists the united states congress in knowing in a nonpartisan way those impacts of the laws that we pass and i have respectfully made sure that the gentlewoman had a copy and had been advised that before she came to the floor evidently the minority was in possession of this new document of 2005
and the committee on rules in a meeting that we had yesterday where we considered this legislation had to understand the implications or some of the implications as it related to this act and we rely upon the current information that has come from the congressional budget office
so i respectfully disagree with the gentlewoman do not accept the characterization that she has given to this member or to the congressional budget office and would hope that the gentlewoman would find the time perhaps later in the day to bring this issue up upon full scrutiny of the documentation to recognize that in fact the professional conduct of the congressional budget office was correct in their assertion
i am glad we have debates over how much burden we are placing upon states or municipalities but in this case i would urge my colleagues to understand that we have the official document that is as of yesterday by the congressional budget office and i would ask that they would support our position knowing that we have fallen within the rules of the house
it waives all points of order against consideration of the bill and provides that after general debate the committee of the whole shall rise without motion and no further consideration shall be in order except by subsequent order of the house
mr speaker we are here today to begin the debate on fulfilling congress s promise to the american people made in the wake of the tragedy of september 11 2001 that our government will do everything it can to protect them from another deadly attack on our homeland
this promise was made in the days immediately following september 11 when president bush committed to the american people that the full force of american power would be used to bring terrorists and their sponsors to justice
this legislation continues the reform mission begun by congress in the 911 recommendations implementation act
implementing the driver s license reforms included in hr 418 will provide greater security for the american people because lax standards and loopholes in the various current state issuance processes allow terrorists to obtain a driver s license often multiple drivers licenses from different states and abuse these fake identities for illegal and harmful purposes
by establishing minimum document and issuance standards for the federal acceptance of driver s licenses requiring applicants to prove that they are in the country legally and requiring identification documents to expire simultaneously with the expiration of lawful entry status this legislation will ensure that individuals harboring malicious intent who have illegally entered or who are unlawfully present in the united states can not have access to these valuable and sensitive documents
abused the asylum system by strengthening judges ability to determine whether asylumseekers are truthful and credible we will be able to prevent future terrorists from gaming the system by applying for asylum as a means to avoid deportation after all other recourses for remaining in the united states have been denied to them
this will prevent abuses to the system like the case of the blind sheik abdul rahman who was able to stay in the united states and force an immigration judge to hold a hearing on the asylum claim only weeks before his followers bombed the world trade center
defending our physical borders as provided for in the real id bill will provide greater security for the american people
because increased vigilance has made entering the country through normal regular channels more difficult we must also be increasingly prepared for the certainty that terrorists will try to use illegal clandestine methods to enter our country and to do us harm and we must now take steps to close those gaps in our border security where we are most vulnerable
this means that terrorists and their closest advocates can be denied entry to the united states for their actions in support of terrorism but if they are able to make it to our shores we can not deport them for those same actions
it provides for further consideration of the rule under a structured rule and provides that no further general debate shall be in order
this rule provides that the amendment printed in part a of the committee on rules report accompanying the resolution shall be considered as adopted in the house and in the committee of the whole and that the bill as amended shall be considered as the original bill for the purpose of further amendment and shall be considered as read
it makes in order only those amendments printed in part b of the report and provides that these amendments may be offered only in the order printed in the report and only by a member designated in the report
these amendments shall be considered as read shall be debatable for the time specified in the report equally divided and controlled by the proponent and opponent shall not be subject to amendment and shall not be subject to a demand for division of the question in the house or in the committee of the whole
finally this rule waives all points of order against the amendments printed in part b of the report and provides for one motion to recommit with or without instructions
implementing the driver s license reforms included in hr 418 will provide for greater security for the american people
because of lax standards and loopholes in the various current state issuance processes terrorists have been allowed to obtain driver s licenses often multiple driver s licenses from different states and abuse these false identities for illegal and harmful purposes
by establishing minimum document and issuance standards for the federal acceptance of driver s licenses requiring applicants to prove that they are in the country legally and requiring identity documents to expire simultaneously with the expiration of lawful entry status this legislation will ensure that individuals harboring malicious intent or who have illegally entered or who are unlawfully present in the united states can not have access to these valuable and sensitive documents
abused the asylum system by strengthening judges abilities to determine whether asylum seekers are truthful and credible we will be able to prevent terrorists from gaming the system by applying for asylum as a means to avoid deportation after all other recourses for remaining in the united states have been denied to them
this will prevent abuses of the system like in the case of the blind sheik abdul rahman who was able to stay in the united states and force an immigration judge to hold a hearing on his asylum claim only weeks before his followers bombed the world trade center in 1993
defending our physical border as provided for in the real id bill will also provide greater security for the american people
because increased vigilance has made entering the country through normal regular channels more difficult we must also increasingly prepare for the certainty that terrorists will use illegal clandestine methods to enter our country and do us harm and we must take steps now to close the gaps in our border security where we feel we are most vulnerable
this means that terrorists and their closest advocates can be denied entry to the united states for their actions in support of terrorism but if they are able to make it to our shores we can not deport them legally under those same actions
this rule makes in order five amendments from members from both sides of the aisle including one that i have submitted to ensure that aliens and terrorists who are in the united states and ordered deported are actually deported so that they can no longer pose a threat to the security of american citizens
mr speaker i do understand that not everybody is in agreement about what we are doing today but for the members that are paying attention the 911 terrorist travel report of the national commission on terrorist attacks upon the united states known as the 911 commission said on page 43 and i would like to quote this september 11 as the hijackers boarded four flights american airlines flights 11 and 77 and united airlines flights 93 and 175 at least six hijackers used us identification documents obtained and acquired in the previous months three of which were fraudulently obtained in northern virginia mr speaker we would have to really not respect this 911 commission if we were not going to follow up on the work that they did
we are here for the best reason for the security of this great nation and the wonderful people who care and entrust upon the united states congress the ability to make sure we do all that we can to avoid attacks in the future
this rule makes in order five amendments for members of both sides of the aisle including one that i have submitted to ensure that aliens and terrorists are not in the united states illegally and if they are we are going to deport them
and i encourage all of my colleagues to support the underlying legislation in this rule
mr chairman in august 2004 the bipartisan chairman of the 911 commission testified at the select committee on homeland security that border security combined with the routine and effective enforcement of immigration laws must be a top priority for congress and the administration if our country can expect to secure the homeland and prevent another tragedy like what happened on 911 from happening again here in america
as a result people entering the country illegally with criminal or terrorist intent have quickly learned that if arrested they can be quickly released on their own word and that they can be confident in the knowledge that they do not have to show up for their hearing knowing they will likely never be deported
the authority to leverage delivery bonds to compel attendance at federal deportation proceedings already exists in federal law
i ask that all members of this house support my amendment and build upon the strong deportation reform initiatives already included in hr 418
this amendment that i have comes as a result of my paying attention to not only the 911 commission but also my service to the select committee on homeland security in the prior congress
it was very obvious to members of the committee as we heard testimony including from the immigration and naturalization service s inspector general report from the department of justice where they recognized the deficiencies that they had where a person who had gone through an entire process in front of a federal judge was ordered removed and yet only 13 percent of those were removed from the country
we have a problem that was enumerated in the 911 commission report
we are utilizing the techniques that are not only available in the law but also that many courts utilize today federal courts as well as city and state courts across the united states
they have had their day in court
mr speaker i thank the gentleman for yielding me this time and i rise in strong support both of this rule and the underlying bill the real id act
i also want to thank the gentleman from wisconsin mr sensenbrenner xz4003650 for his effort in bringing this legislation to the floor
all of the reforms contained in the real id act are crucial to our national security interests and all of them will help make america less vulnerable to terrorist attack
secure identification should begin in the united states wrote the bipartisan 911 commission
fraud in identification documents is no longer just a problem of theft
looking at nawaf alhazmi his visa expired in january of 2001 yet he got a florida s driver s license in june of 2001 he got a virginia id card in august of 2001 and he got a reissued virginia id card in september of 2001
a second hijacker hani hanjour was in the same situation
he was in violation of his visa when he obtained a virginia state id in august of 2001 and a maryland id in september of 2001
mr chairman welcome to the world of mohammed atta legal visa to come in 6 months driver s license from florida 6 years
like many in this chamber i was a strong supporter of the intelligence reform legislation passed last year but when i voted for it i believed we needed to go further in several areas including strengthening driver s license guidelines
in my home state of connecticut we take strong steps to ensure the integrity of our identification cards but we are not perfect
to receive a driver s license in connecticut you must prove you are a legal resident of the state and you are not a legal resident of the state if you are not legally present in the united states period
driver s licenses are verifiable forms of identification in the united states
providing such identification cards to people who are illegally present in our country presents serious concerns
that means that someone who is illegally present in the united states and takes advantage of a weak law in another state can obtain a driver s license and use the document to identify him or herself in the state of connecticut
many members have raised concerns about the impact of driver s license provisions in hr 418 in our home states
connecticut governor jodi rell stated in my view if a noncitizen is lawfully in this country he or she should be able to obtain a driver s license for the time frame in which he is lawfully allowed to be here
conversely if someone is in this country illegally he or she should not be able to obtain a driver s license in connecticut or any other state i could not agree more with her
a legally present visitor to the united states can obtain a driver s license in connecticut as he can in other states
however in connecticut we issue licenses for 6 years at a time
in that time visitors can leave and come back whether legally or illegally an untold number of times
requiring a temporary id for persons temporarily in our country is a nobrainer
improving the information contained in passenger screening databases will enhance our ability to identify potential terrorists from gaining access to airlines
mr chairman i will vote in favor of this bill
let me wish our new chairman the very best in his maiden voyage through this body on the floor
i am troubled that we continue to resort to supplementals to fund our efforts in iraq and in afghanistan
i think we can do a better job making sure our troops on the front line have everything they need if we put funding for these operations up front in the fiscal year rather than halfway through it like we are doing in a supplemental like this
most important my reservations have to do with the fact that we still do not have a coherent strategy for success in iraq
when i go back home i get questions from my constituents about the war in iraq and its costs
what is the meaning of winning in iraq
many in the administration have said we can not put a timetable on the withdrawal
we must be able to measure the progress of those iraqi forces in attaining those goals
i voted for the resolution authorizing the use of force in iraq
we must win in iraq
there is nothing in this bill that forces the administration to level with us and to level with the american people about either the real costs or about our strategy for success
in my opinion this is a missed opportunity
mr chairman i rise in support of this amendment which is offered by the gentleman from massachusetts mr tierney xz4004070 and the gentleman from iowa mr leach xz4002360
this is an idea that is rich in history
this was modeled after the committee created by thensenator harry truman back in 1941 known as the special committee to investigate the national defense program
this committee was bipartisan and i might point out it was created by a congress controlled by the same party with the same party in control at the white house
we have seen reports in the news media of contract abuse and i think a committee such as this would help tremendously
we could benefit from similar oversight as we had in harry truman s day today
outstanding committees like the committee on armed services on which i am privileged to serve have looked at some issues relating to contracting in iraq and afghanistan
at the same time there is a significant amount of money in contracting in both those countries
mr chairman i rise in strong support of the nadler amendment and ask members especially on my side of the aisle to join us in striking section 101
under the pretext that it mitigates terrorists access to the united states the provision actually does a grave injustice and disservice to the persecuted such as religious believers and all others who have a wellfounded fear of persecution and who seek asylum in our country
i would remind my colleagues that i have been in congress 25 years
911 hurt people in my district
it has not had in my view the kind of hearing needed in terms of the consequences that it will impose upon true asylum seekers
even though she explained it as a unfpa amendment i want to clarify that the language of the amendment could in no way be construed to support or give funding to unfpa
in fact the amendment does not even mention unfpa
the maloney amendment says in chapter 1 of title ii of the bill in the item relating to the economic support fund after the first dollar amount insert reduced by 3 000 000
in chapter 1 of title iv of the bill in the item relating to the tsunami recovery and reconstruction fund after the first dollar amount insert increased by 3 000 000
at one religious freedom meeting in china i asked what the participants knew about forced abortion policies
all three women in the group broke down in tears as they shared with me how they all had been forced to have abortions one woman talked about how she thought god was going to protect her baby but she was not able to escape the abortion
other women who have gained asylum in the united states because of china s coercive population control program have told me terrible stories of crippling fines imprisonment of family members and destruction of homes and property all to force abortion and sterilization upon millions of women
in the operation room i saw how the aborted child s lips were sucking how its limbs were stretching
i was a monster in the daytime injuring others by the chinese communist authorities barbaric plannedbirth policy but in the evening i was like all other women and mothers enjoying my life with my children
while mrs gao acknowledged her part in these human rights atrocities and courageously told her story unfpa continues to side with the chinese government
the former executive director of unfpa nafis sadik said china has every reason to feel proud of and pleased with its remarkable achievements made in its family planning policy
the country could offer its experiences and special expert to help other countries on cbs nightwatch she said the unfpa firmly believes and so does the government of the people s republic of china that their program is a totally voluntary program and sven burmester unfpa s man in beijing gushed over china s achievements in strictly quantitative terms it was the most successful familyplanning policy ever developed make no mistake that china covets unfpa financial and verbal support of their program as a goodhousekeeping seal of approval to whitewash their human rights violations
in our lengthy conversation madame peng peiyun told me over and over again that there was no coercion in china and then she cited unfpa s participation in the program and unfpa s public statements where unfpa leaders have defended it
in 2001 the department of state determined that unfpa s activities in china violated our human rights law thereby making them ineligible for us funding
on july 21 2001 secretary of state powell wrote regrettably the prc has in place a regime of severe penalties on women who have unapproved births
this regime plainly operates to coerce pregnant women to have abortions in order to avoid the penalties and therefore amounts to a program of coercive abortion
unfpa s support of and involvement in china s populationplanning activities allows the chinese government to implement more effectively its program of coercive abortion
in 2002 china explicitly stated its draconian population control program in law but unfpa still continues to support the chinese program
the bush administration has consistently found unfpa ineligible to receive funding most recently releasing a july 15 2004 letter where secretary powell said china continues to employ coercion in its birth planning program including through severe penalties for out of plan births
unfpa continues its support and involvement in china s coercive birth limitation program in counties where china s restrictive law and penalties are enforced by government officials unfpa remains guilty of shamelessly supporting and whitewashing terrible crimes against humanity and the united states must have no part in subsidizing them
in refusing to fund unfpa president bush and this congress have taken the side of the oppressed and have refused to cooperate with the oppressor
if unfpa lobbied the chinese government to stop forced abortion as aggressively as they lobby the united states to overturn human rights policy there would be less suffering in china today
first this bill prevents terrorists and others from getting driver s licenses by requiring applicants to prove that they are in the country legally
in addition this legislation makes it harder for terrorists to exploit our asylum system
it also requires the completion of the 14mile san diego border fence which congress approved in 1996
they give terrorists and illegal aliens another way to remain undetected in the united states
i hope the administration will fully support us in this effort
they require aliens to post a cash deposit and provide a written commitment they will appear in court
illegal aliens who comprise over 20 percent of all federal prisoners today are a serious problem in the united states and pose obviously a homeland security threat
we need to make sure that aliens who are deported by a court of law are in fact removed from the country
mr chairman i strongly oppose the nadler amendment which would strip the asylum reforms from the real id act the asylum provisions in the real id act are essential
abused the asylum system just last year a pakistani national who had applied for asylum was caught while planning to blow up a subway station during the republican convention in new york city
in this situation even if the judge believes that the applicant is lying and is a terrorist the judge may still be required to approve the application
it allows immigration judges like judges in most other courts to determine whether the asylum seeker is telling the truth
judges in ordinary criminal courts of law are routinely allowed to determine whether they believe a defendant is lying
the real id act is essential in stopping asylum abuse
mr chairman i would simply like to submit my statement for the record on this particular issue in opposition to the real id act
mr chairman i rise today in strong opposition of the real id act
hr 418 is meanspirited legislation that threatens our national security by depriving law enforcement officials of critical information on many adults who are physically present in the united states
i do not understand how supporters of this bill can turn their backs on victims of sex trafficking in the name of protecting homeland security
mr chairman today i voted in support of the fiscal year 2005 iraq and tsunami relief supplemental
in fact i voted against hr 418 when it was considered by the us house of representatives on february 10 2005
this legislation also provides an increase in the amount of life insurance for troops an increase in the death benefit for families of fallen military members and provides additional funding so our troops have the armored humvees and personal protection they need while serving in iraq
i remain very concerned about the bush administration s lack of a clear exit strategy in iraq and i will continue to fight for real immigration reform and for a clear plan so our troops can come home and democracy can thrive in an iraq run by iraqis
for our first substantive legislation of the year they would make it nearly impossible for victims of torture and religious persecution to seek refuge in the us and they would get us ever closer to establishing a national id
so without making the country safer we re going to deny refugees and victims of torture rape and other atrocities safe haven in this supposed beacon of freedom
i guess the asylum system which is the most rigorous immigration process in this country resulting in 30 000 denials last year is not good enough for the immigrantbashers
it ll look the same but if this bill became law all states would have to share all drivers license information in a national database including identifying information drivers histories and motor vehicle violations
mr chairman i can not support the president s request to spend billions more for this protracted war in iraq
how is it supporting our troops to keep them in harms way without a plan to win this war
how is it supporting our troops when we do nt provide for mental health services for those troops traumatized in combat
mr speaker i rise in opposition to this supplemental appropriations bill for iraq and afghanistan
over 1 500 young americans dead over 12 000 young americans maimed and wounded and countless iraqi civilians killed in the continuing bloodshed
they ve sought to establish american dominance in the region and to pursue regime change at any cost
these brave young americans face down deadly conflict in the streets each and every day
but for their sake everyone of us in this house must consider the burden they bear
terror networks continue to grow and recruit in response to the us arrogant preeminence in the middle east
terrorism has been brought to the front door of america waged mercilessly against our troops in places like baghdad and tikrit
that terror wo nt stop until we get serious about involving the world in solving this conflict
we must actively involve arab states the united nations and our major world partners in taking a stand against these insurgents and in taking our place
they can continue to look the other way as profiteering trumps genuine reconstruction in iraq
that s not reflected in this bill
mr speaker i rise today in favor of the rule and in support of the underlying bill the real id act
this is probably one of the most important bills that we will have to vote on in the 109th congress
now driver s licenses have become the primary id in the united states
so lax standards and loopholes in the current issue process allow terrorists to obtain driver s licenses often multiple licenses from different states and abuse the license for identification purposes
the real id act would require applicants to provide proof that they are in this country legally
currently 11 states do not have such a requirement meaning the majority of states have already recognized the need for tighter requirements and standards but unnecessary and dangerous gaps still exist in this system
mr speaker i rise today in strong support of the emergency wartime supplemental especially the provision that would postpone reducing the number of navy aircraft carriers from 12 to 11
since the end of the cold war carriers have been kept very busy and have proven their value in numerous operations
in this era of uncertain us access to overseas air bases the value of carriers as sovereign us bases that can operate in international waters free from political constraints is particularly significant
after experimenting with an 11 1 carrier force in fy1995fy2000 dod returned to a force of 12 fully active carriers suggesting that dod was dissatisfied with a force of less than 12 fully active carriers
this provision in the supplemental would effectively delay the decommissioning of the uss kennedy until 6 months after the quadrennial defense review is released
furthermore if the kennedy were retired all of the atlantic fleet s carriers would be for some time at least home ported in a single location
this of course would not be in the best interest of national security
in a time of war it is unwise to retire an aircraft carrier without knowing whether or not it will be needed
please join me in supporting the supplemental and the provision that keeps the number of carriers in the navy s fleet contained therein
mr speaker i rise in strong support of this rule and hr 418 the real id act of 2005
this would stop the abuse of our asylum system by terrorist aliens and finish construction of a border fence that will secure one of the most trafficked corridors for illegal aliens and safeguard the united states naval base in san diego california
in fact the 19 hijackers had 63 driver s licenses among them
these licenses assisted the terrorists in boarding commercial flights renting cars and other activities necessary to carry out their horrible plans
madam chairman my amendment would strike all of the taxpayer funded relief provided in the bill to the countries affected by the indian ocean tsunami
several private companies are also providing relief through their local offices in the region
according to the report some 800 million has already been provided by these organizations in cash
in addition another 101 million has been provided in kind donations
that brings the total to 1 billion already close to 1 billion and that total does not include all the persontoperson aid that is not accounted for in the study
since the disaster many americans have looked into their hearts and reached into their wallets in an effort to help alleviate the suffering in thailand indonesia sri lanka and other affected nations
they partnered with other countries to provide a clean drinking water purification system to people in indonesia
madam chairman i do not approach this in a light or frivolous way
i believe that in fact if more money is needed we need to do it as a result of a study and careful examination of exactly what needs are still out there
recent reports have indicated that in fact ngos are saying that there is more money than they can even deal with
if more money is needed i suggest it be provided in a later appropriation under a regular rule
and why does the president s budget not fully fund the mandates in the 911 intelligence bill which we passed and he signed a few short months ago
why sign a bill if you have no intention of actually funding the items in the bill
this bill wholly fails to address these and other critical gaps in our border security
the bill focuses on people already in the united states instead of keeping terrorists out
homeland security expert stephen flynn who is a retired commander of the us coast guard and jeane kirkpatrick senior fellow in national security studies at the council on foreign relations testified before the senate foreign relations committee that great powers have been building great walls throughout history
mr chairman it is clear that this is not a good bill and we are completely in opposition to it
instead it would endanger civil rights and create fear in the immigrant community
mr chairman my amendment mirrors in most respects a bipartisan bill that has been filed by the gentleman from iowa mr leach xz4002360 and me
it establishes a select committee of the house to investigate the awarding and carrying out of contracts to conduct activities in afghanistan and iraq and to fight terrorism
the select committee will make such recommendations to the house as it deems appropriate regarding the bidding contracting and auditing standards in the issuance of government contracts oversight procedures forms of payment and safeguards against money laundering accountability of contractors and government officials involved in procurement penalties for violations of law and abuses in the awarding and carrying out of government contracts subcontracting under large comprehensive contracts inclusion and utilization of small businesses through subcontracts or otherwise and such other matters as the select committee deems appropriate
mr chairman according to the congressional research service the 819 billion that is before us today in the supplemental appropriations bill is in addition to the approximately 200 billion that has been spent so far since the 9112001 attacks on combat operations on the occupation and on the support of military personnel deployed or supporting operations in iraq and afghanistan
just in january the special inspector general for the iraqi reconstruction reported that the coalition provisional authority cpa could not account for 88 billion
a center for strategic and international studies analysis which was cited in an october 6 washington post story indicated that as little as 27 cents of every dollar spent in the iraqi reconstruction is actually filtered down to projects that benefit iraqis
according to the testimony of steve ellis of the taxpayers for common sense who was citing a kpmg study the commander s emergency response program which is in effect a program designed to allow united states military officers to quickly fund small reconstruction projects maintained little documentation of how taxpayers dollars were spent
quoting former coalition provisional authority official frank willis a february 14 story in the washington post told us of how the united states officials in postwar iraq paid a contractor by stuffing 2 million worth of crisp bills into his gunny sack and routinely making cash payments around baghdad from a pickup truck
we all may have substantive differences about the merits of the military policy but there should be unanimous agreement about the congressional role in ensuring that our constituents tax dollars are being effectively and judiciously spent and that is what this amendment does mr chairman
as members know in february 1941 concerned about possible waste and favoritism thensenator harry truman introduced legislation creating a congressional committee to investigate how defense contracts were being awarded and managed
the special committee to investigate the national defense program as it became known exposed deficiencies in the bureaucratic procurement process advocating for more effective coordination among the involved agencies and raised important questions regarding production and cost of specific warrelated materials
the truman committee was unanimously respected for its focus on factfinding and its refusal to succumb to partisanship and in fact the gentleman from iowa mr leach xz4002360 and i share that view
it is our responsibility in this institution and we have to maintain this body s integrity by doing that job
the secretary of defense using existing transfer authority may transfer that money to the legislative branch for the purpose of establishing a select committee in essence along the outlines of the amendment that i just reviewed moments ago and i will not belabor that point by going over all of that information except to say that it would be a select committee for the purposes of investigating contracts and related materials with respect to things being spent in iraq and afghanistan and the issue of terrorism
i think the gentleman from iowa mr leach xz4002360 should be commended for his leadership on this and for pointing out the fact that in fact when harry truman did it years ago he was a democrat and the president was a democrat and he still found it the patriotic and judicious thing to do with respect to the responsibilities of the house of representatives and if we are to maintain the integrity of this congress and our responsibility of oversight of such huge sums of money it would be the appropriate thing for us to do now in a bipartisan way
regrettably those standing committees have not done that not exercised their institutional responsibilities to the extent they could in this particular congress
similarly the house committee on armed services has taken up this issue once in june of 2004 at a readiness subcommittee hearing but beyond that it has not delved into the issue
the gentleman from wisconsin mr obey xz4003000 spoke earlier about the 100 million found in contracts that were questioned just yesterday and the fact that report was kept from us at a time when our taxpayers our constituents and our citizens want to know about these enormous sums of money and want us to do our job
we in congress have a responsibility
i am a cosponsor of the real id act that calls for necessary reforms in our driver s license processes to make it harder for terrorists to obtain driver s license to use them for acts of violence in our country
the loopholes that currently exist in issuing driver s licenses have to be closed to stop those who would use driver s licenses as a tool in committing terrorist acts on our own soil
in fact as we have heard we know that many of the hijackers who attacked our nation on september 11 possessed valid driver s licenses and many other stateissued identity cards
the real id act would require applicants to prove that they are in this country legally
the debate here somewhat surprises me because i bet if you asked the american people if in order to get a driver s license if you have to prove that you are in this country legally overwhelmingly i believe the people in this country would believe that not only is it the right thing to do but they would be surprised to find out that it is not already a requirement
and their recommendation stated secure identification should begin in the united states
mr chairman i can not in good conscience vote for the real id act hr 418 because despite the intention of the bill s sponsors to strengthen our borders it has the opposite effect by making homeland security and an effective war against terrorism more difficult with unnecessary provisions aimed at legitimate asylum seekers
moreover i am guided in my judgment about this bill by the opposition of the national governors association and the national council of state legislatures
this bill tightens asylum laws in a way that inhibits rather than enhances our national security
currently individuals who participate in terrorist activity are not allowed to gain asylum status in this country
while national security must be our top priority immigration policy should not create unnecessary requirements for legitimate asylum seekers who are arguably our best allies in the fight against international terrorism
the asylum provisions of this bill will not enhance our security or our standing in the world
however the language of the bill is not limited to the construction of a fence in this location
however in light of their failure i am left no option but to vote against this bill
i find the driver s license standards established in this bill to be unnecessary as well as they already exist in current law
this provision allowed for states to participate with the department of transportation and the department of homeland security in a rulemaking process
even with the measures passed in the intelligence bill states will largely be organizing and conducting the implementation of these standards
their participation in establishing and implementing driver s license standards is essential for these provisions to be successful
this bill simply ignores state involvement altogether in these standards
there are portions in this bill which i believe are beneficial to our national security
for instance i am pleased the amendment offered by mr sessions passed by a voice vote as it will strengthen our ability to ensure the deportation of individuals who are illegally present in the united states
unfortunately the egregious measures in the bill far outweigh the beneficial provisions
thus i must vote against this bill and hope that the senate will remove the portions of this bill which are unnecessary and attack the balance of power in our country
i have been a critic of the bush administration s policy in iraq
if approved the president s emergency supplemental appropriations request will bring the total cost of our operations in iraq so far to over 200 billion
importantly the bill appropriates the president s request of 200 million for economic development in the west bank and gaza strip
but large as it is the bill still falls short in some respects
and most problematically the housepassed rule incorporated into the bill the real id act legislation that i opposed when the house passed it in february
what is our postelection strategy in iraq
can we account for the billions of dollars already spent in iraq and are the remaining billions of dollars in reconstruction funds being well spent
that lack of information is why i voted for an amendment proposed by representatives tierney and leach to create a select congressional committee based on the truman committee that existed during world war ii to investigate and study the awarding and carrying out of government contracts to conduct military and reconstruction activities in iraq and afghanistan
the failure of this amendment makes it even more important that we continue to ask questions not only to provide accountability to american taxpayers but also to keep faith with the real needs of our troops in the field
estimates of future us costs in iraq are mindboggling ranging from 400 billion to 600 billion over the next decade
with our troops stretched thin forced to perform longer tours of duty and short of equipment and supplies funding for our men and women in uniform must not be held hostage to disagreements about the wisdom or folly of bush administration policies
most of the money appropriated by this legislation is for our ongoing military activities especially in iraq
passage of this conference report will bring the total cost of operations in iraq to well over 200 billion and by now two years after president bush prematurely announced the end of major military activities in iraq i think even those who have been uncritical supporters of the administration should be deeply concerned about the escalating costs not just in money but in casualties
the time has come in fact it is long since past for the administration to be candid about the costs not just of the war in iraq but of the administration s overall foreign policy
the american people deserve to know in advance what they will be asked to pay to support the administration s policies
funds in this conference report will pay for more resources including body armor and military equipment needed to safeguard their lives
in short the choice before us today is to vote for this supplemental or by voting against it to in effect require an immediate halt to military operations not just in iraq but elsewhere
and while i remain convinced it was an error to rush into war in iraq i am equally convinced it would be just as much an error to rush to withdraw
as a critic of the bush administration s policy in iraq i did not go there to confirm my opposition to the war but rather to gain knowledge based on facetoface conversations with our military leaders the iraqi leadership an extraordinary group of iraqi women and most important for me with our troops on the ground
that will take time and money and in the meantime we must maintain our efforts
as the former head of american forces in northern iraq brig
carter ham said recently we do nt want a rush to failure so for me the need to support the military funding in this conference report however unpleasant is clear
the conference report also provides funding for tsunami disaster relief as well as for assistance in darfur food aid to sudan and liberia and for peacekeeping programs most of which are for sudan
importantly the bill appropriates the president s request of 200 million for economic development in the west bank and gaza strip
other parts of the conference report are problematical particularly the inclusion of provisions like those in the real id act legislation that i opposed when the house passed it in february
an editorial in today s rocky mountain news says this part of the conference report has much more to do with immigration than security and is just one piece of a policy poorly thought out and scarcely debated at all and likely to have unintended consequences i think that is an accurate description
several industries in colorado are heavily dependent on the h2b visa program to provide seasonal employees some in the summer and some in the winter
this is particularly true for companies whose busy season is in the winter such as the ski industry
they would actually be detrimentally affected by this provision because they do not rehire the same workers every year and thus do not benefit from the provisions in the conference report that will exempt previously hired workers from the overall limit on the number of visas
i hope that we will be able to build on this foundation in the future so as to protect the interests of both summer and winter industries
this part of the conference report is identical to the text of hr 731 which i introduced in the house and to s 339 introduced in the senate by senator reid of nevada
i applaud senator reid s leadership in having this included when the senate considered this supplemental appropriations bill and i am glad that it was accepted by the conferees
it will do two things 1 declare as congressional policy that it is in the public interest for each state to continue to regulate the taking of fish and wildlife within its boundaries including by means of laws or regulations that differentiate between residents and nonresidents and 2 provide that courts should not use congressional silence as a reason to impose any commerceclause barrier to a state s or tribe s regulation of hunting or fishing
its purpose is to reaffirm the authority of states and territories to regulate hunting and fishing by resolving questions that have arisen in the wake of a recent 9th circuit court of appeals decision that held that some arizona limits on nonresident hunting permits had constitutional defects
colorado draws that distinction in several ways and many other states do so as well
for example in 1987 the federal district court for colorado in the case of terk v ruch reported at 655 f supp
in that case conservation force v manning 301 f3rd 985 9th cir
the appeals court went on to find that the regulations did further arizona s legitimate interests in conserving its population of game and maintaining recreational opportunities for its citizens but it remanded the case so a lower court could determine whether the state could meet the burden of showing that reasonable nondiscriminatory alternatives would not be adequate
because of the decision s potential implications for their own laws and regulations it was a source of concern to many states in addition to arizona
in fact 22 other states joined in supporting arizona s request for the decision to be reviewed by the us supreme court
colorado was one of those states and senator ken salazar who was then colorado s attorney general joined in signing a brief in support of arizona s petition for supreme court review
its immediate effect is on states whose federal courts are within that circuit namely those in alaska arizona california hawaii idaho montana nevada oregon and washington as well those of guam and the commonwealth of the northern marianas
it is intended to speak directly to the dormant commerce clause basis for the 9th circuit s decision in conservation force v manning
i am not a lawyer but my understanding is that lawyers and judges use that term to refer to the judicially established doctrine that the commerce clause is not only a positive grant of power to congress but also a negative constraint upon the states in the absence of any congressional action in other words that it restricts the powers of the states to affect interstate commerce in a situation where congress has been silent
section 6036 b 1 would end the perceived silence of congress by affirmatively stating that state regulation of fishing and hunting including state regulation that treats residents and nonresidents differently is in the public interest
instead they are intended to reaffirm state authority and make clear that the dormant commerce clause that is congressional inaction is not to be construed as an obstacle to a state s regulating hunting or fishing even in ways that some might claim adversely affect interstate commerce by treating residents differently from nonresidents
section 6036 c 2 similarly provides that the bill is not to be read as limiting the authority of the federal government to temporarily or permanently prohibit hunting or fishing on any portion of the federal lands as has been done with various national park system units and in some other parts of the federal lands for various reasons including public safety as well as the protection of fish or wildlife
these provisions are narrow in scope but of national importance because it addresses a matter of great concern to hunters anglers and wildlife managers in many states
in conclusion while this conference report is far from perfect i think it deserves to pass and i will vote for it
mr chairman i offer this amendment with the gentlewoman from north carolina mrs myrick xz4002880 and the gentleman from wisconsin mr kind xz4002180 in a bipartisan amendment for two main reasons the first is cost
what this amendment does it says that none of the funds made available in this act may be used for embassy security construction and maintenance
in essence it is about a 592 million savings amendment
i would note in a crs document printed a couple of weeks ago it states that the state department has identified 990 million thus far for the new embassy in baghdad
the second reason that i support the amendment and oppose this provision in the bill is that we knew years ago that we were going to need a new embassy and yet last summer when plans were laid for construction of this particular site it was not included in the omnibus appropriation bill taken up in november
the 2006 budget request which came up in february no moneys were included in the president s budget request for that as well
i have been to the current embassy in baghdad twice as well
i asked that question in fact yesterday
i was not very pleased with the answer that i got but maybe in a few more months we will get it right and put it someplace that would be truly safe for all of our folks that are there
whether it be in an authorization bill that came through this congress the last year or in the omnibus bill or in the president s budget for fiscal year 2006 this bill no matter what train track it is on will not get to the president until may
this rapid increase in government buying is largely the result of the war in iraq and combating terrorism
since the spring of 2003 congress has appropriated close to 200 billion for operations in iraq and afghanistan
by requiring that contracts funded by this bill are calculated in the federal government s small business goals we start to instill credibility in the system while ensuring that small firms receive their fair share
these goals were enacted to ensure small business participation in the federal marketplace
however the federal government has failed to meet its small business goal in each of the last 5 years
in one year alone this failure cost us small businesses over 15 billion in lost contracting opportunities
mr chairman there are 23 million small businesses in the united states
i would say that it does not surprise me that the department of state would raise a concern because they are the worst offenders when it comes to fulfilling the statutory goals set by congress regarding contracting practices on behalf of small businesses in our nation
i would love to see that the gentleman work with me on behalf of small businesses and make sure that in this 81 billion there is small business participation
i rise today to raise serious concerns with some of the provisions in hr 418 that have not been thoroughly considered in large part because the bill was not considered by our committee
simply stated the bill imposes costly new requirements on states that simply can not be achieved in 3 years allotted by the bill and while states may attempt to comply the bill s unreasonable deadlines and inadequate funding will create confusion and frustrate the public
congress previously recognized that states should play an integral role in implementing new driver s license standards
currently birth certificates are not issued or maintained in a uniform manner
in fact experts estimate that up to 14 000 jurisdictions within the united states currently issue birth certificates
hr 418 also requires states to verify the issuance validity and completeness of various other documents with various federal agencies that do not yet have fully automated systems in place
ultimately the databases will be built that will allow states to conduct rapid verification of these birth certificates and other documents but in most states and localities they do not currently exist and the experts say it will take a whole lot longer than 3 years to create them
in the meantime what will happen
in addition to the unworkable nature of the driver s license provisions in this bill i want to raise my deep concern about section 102 of this legislation
this does not apply just in san diego
for republican members who want to rein in the unchecked authority of the federal government they might want to carefully examine this provision which expands it enormously
mr chairman time and time again the bush administration has not been straightforward with congress the american people or our soldiers about the costs of this war and what it will take to ensure stability and security in iraq so our troops can return home
i am deeply disappointed that the house voted down an amendment calling for the investigation of reconstruction efforts in iraq and afghanistan including contracting procedures possible money laundering and profiteering
the administration has not complied with congressional mandates to provide a comprehensive breakdown of the 200 billion already spent in iraq and afghanistan and a detailed assessment of the projected costs of military and reconstruction activities in iraq over the next 5 years
no matter how each of us feels about the administration s actions that led to war and its conduct since then and i have been one of its strongest critics we have an obligation to ensure that our troops have the support and equipment they need as long as they are in the field
in addition the funding in this legislation for training and equipment for iraqi and afghan security forces is essential for these nations to take control of their own security so us troops can come home
although it is critically important for the us to develop an exit strategy i am deeply concerned that a premature withdrawal of us troops just after iraq s democratic elections and as its leaders attempt the difficult task of forming a coalition government would only embolden the alqaeda cells fueling the insurgency in iraq
i also strongly support other provisions of the legislation to pay for food aid and peacekeeping in the sudan as well as the more than 650 million allocated for relief and reconstruction to the countries devastated by the tsunami
i fully support the 200 million included in this bill for economic revitalization and infrastructure development in the west bank and gaza
this aid package is a strategic and timely investment in the leadership of palestinian president mahmoud abbas
the accountability requirements in this bill will set an example for the international community for formulating assistance packages that protect against cronyism embezzlement and mismanagement which in the past siphoned millions of dollars to arafat loyalists and terrorist organizations
and so i will vote for this legislation to support our troops and to support these other worthwhile us humanitarian endeavors but we have an obligation to hold the bush administration accountable for its policies in iraq
let me just quote what the gentleman from wisconsin said in the last debate the government of saudi arabia has greatly increased its effort to root out terrorism
it has greatly increased its cooperation in intelligence matters and others with the united states the facts that i read just now were within the last months
i will close by saying just two things in points of clarification
this amendment will say that we believe that saudi arabia should be treated not as an ally but as an enemy in the war on terror because that is what they have been
mr chairman the bill we bring to the floor today includes 2 billion for funding requirements under the jurisdiction of the subcommittee on science state justice and commerce including state department and fbi needs related to program expenses in iraq
the embassy in iraq
the embassy in iraq 45 people have died in attacks on the embassy in iraq
we want security in this building we want security in many other buildings around the city
this embassy will cost less in many respects than many of the other buildings
but to send our men and women in harm s way to live in a building that is unsafe or to delay the construction would be quite frankly wrong
members should know that in the northsouth war 21 million people in sudan many christians some muslims and animists died in the northsouth issue
darfur is the scene of genocide today as we now speak and every member of this house voted to say there was genocide in sudan and every member of the senate voted the same way
to take away the peacekeeping money after the bush administration has done such a good job of bringing northsouth peace to take that away to allow the raping and the pillaging and everything that is going on in sudan would be morally unacceptable
now president bush working with secretary powell and senator danforth has negotiated after 20 years and keep in mind osama bin laden lived in sudan from 1991 to 1996 have negotiated for 20 years and now to strike the peacekeeping money that will send troops in that regard and we do not want to send american troops there troops that will stop the pillaging and put insulation into the peace agreement that has been signed and that will put pressure pressure on ending the genocide that is taking place in darfur
keep in mind there was slavery in sudan up until 2 years ago
without peacekeepers in sudan the northsouth agreement will break down 21 million christians will have died in vain and many muslims and many animists and darfur will not come to an end
so i beg this institution when this amendment comes up to strike peacekeeping for this area do not support it because if you support it and it carries the genocide i can guarantee you will continue in darfur and the northsouth peace agreement will break down and the war will begin
and keep in mind hamas has training camps in khartoum and so does hezbollah
the bill we bring to the floor today includes just over 2 billion for funding requirements under the jurisdiction of the subcommittee on science state justice and commerce including state department and fbi needs related to program expenses in iraq
the bill includes the necessary funds to maintain our diplomatic presence in iraq and afghanistan and to let our personnel carry out this duties in the safest and most secure manner possible
if we are going to conduct diplomacy anywhere it had better be done and done right in iraq and afghanistan
this bill pays the costs necessary for operations logistics and security in those dangerous but critically important parts of the world
this bill also includes 592 million to allow state to move out quickly to build a secure compound in baghdad
state has secured a 100 acre site and is ready to begin construction immediately upon receiving the funds in this bill
since the bombings in nairobi and dar es salaam state has delivered many of these secure compounds on time and on budget
we have also included requested funding for the fbi counterterrorism efforts and for dea counternarcotics efforts in afghanistan
the result before you provides funding for important security measures for our diplomatic personnel and provides for our ongoing commitments in iraq and elsewhere
mr chairman members should ask themselves how would they like if their children their son their daughter or their husband or their wife was in this embassy here
fortyfive people have been killed in the embassy in iraq
fire in a wooded area electrical fire in saddam hussein s palace again the structure was not built for it
fire in saddam s palace august 2004
we have had 1 500 military people die in the war in iraq
it is making a difference in the palestinian area
it is making a difference in egypt
it is making a difference in lebanon
it is inappropriate for us not to fund a safe workplace for american citizens who are going to work in harm s way
there is no threat to american citizens in beijing
in lebanon 1983 241 marines were killed in a barracks with no setback
that same year in the american embassy in lebanon a number of americans killed
there was the american bombing of the embassies in tanzania and kenya 1989
we have a moral obligation to the people that we are sending in this region to live in a situation and work where they will be protected
i rise in strong opposition to this amendment
as the gentleman from california mr cunningham xz4000910 said as i was walking down to the well how would members like it if your children your son or daughter or husband or wife had to work in this facility
charles taylor was the one responsible for cutting off arms and legs of young people in sierra leone and in liberia
mr speaker i rise in strong support of the conference report to fund urgent supplemental requirements for the military
the bill includes the necessary funds to maintain our diplomatic presence in iraq and afghanistan and for allowing our personnel to carry out their duties in the safest and most secure manner
this conference report provides the necessary resources for operations logistics and security in those dangerous but critically important parts of the world
there is also 592 million to allow state to move quickly to build a secure compound in baghdad and as the gentleman from missouri mr blunt xz4000340 said these facilities are not secure now and they are needed
this money will result in the completion of a secure living and working compound facility within 24 months
the conference report also includes 2416 million for domestic appropriations to support the war on terror including fbi counterterrorism efforts and for dea a counternarcotics program in afghanistan
president bush wants the united states to be a leader in promoting freedom around the world but we fail at home when we deny freedoms to those who desire the american dream
stay in your own country
out of 2 000 plus miles along our border with mexico you are saying that finishing 3 miles of that fenced area in southern california is so important that we should throw out the principles of our democracy and let one man have the power to waive any laws that he wants without any oversight
i urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this legislation
mr chairman i rise to offer an amendment to hr 1268 the 81 billion supplemental appropriations bill before the house today that will continue to fund the president s misadventure in iraq
my amendment would cut funds that should never have made it into the supplemental in the first place millions of dollars to finance the regular operations of the department of defense which should be paid for through normal defense budget negotiations not through a supplemental spending bill that does not even count towards the president s incredible budget deficit
my amendment would take 186 million from dod s operations and management money that is funded every year in the defense appropriations bill and split the 186 million evenly between the national guard and reserve personnel in the army navy air force and marine corps to augment the meager funds that have been allocated for each of these branches
the fact that the pentagon depends on an extra 200 billion for its regular operations and maintenance at the expense of our troops in the field is arrogant incompetent wasteful and downright immoral
let us not forget that secretary of defense donald rumsfeld himself has stated that there is 22 billion of waste in the pentagon s budget every year
the bush administration and in particular the leaders at the pentagon have demonstrated a potent lack of support for the troops through poor planning for the long military occupation of iraq by neglecting to provide every soldier with the equipment needed to survive military combat and by failing to adequately support our soldiers once they return home
if we are going to spend billions let us at least spend billions on the people who deserve it the brave troops in the field and especially members of the national guard and reserve who are receiving less for their sacrifices
mr chairman i rise in support of the maloney amendment because we must break the deadly political impasse that endangers the health of women around the world
disasters put pregnant women at greater than normal risk because of the sudden loss of medical support compounded in many cases by trauma malnutrition disease or exposure to violence
we all know that the tsunami took away valuable medical care for women across the affected areas in southeast asia
without unfpa we would nt have been able to calculate that 150 000 women are currently pregnant in this region
in such a polarized political environment we must not sacrifice this opportunity to move forward and renew our commitment to promote the health of women around the world
i urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the maloney amendment
mr speaker why is congress approving yet another multibillion dollar spending bill when the previous 3 multibillion dollar spending bills have been misused improperly managed and in some cases downright stolen
a report by the special inspector general for iraq s reconstruction has stated that nearly 100 million for reconstruction projects in southern iraq is missing and can not be accounted for
these funds must be accounted for before allotting one more dollar for the war in iraq
who is being held responsible for the misinformation that led us into the war in the first place
and as i have referred to so many times and i will continue when it is necessary it says no money shall be drawn from the treasury but in consequence of appropriations made by law that means nobody can spend money federal money unless we appropriate it
but part of that section that does not get referred to very often says in the same sentence and a regular statement and account of the receipts and expenditures of all public money shall be published from time to time so we think that is just as important and we the gentleman from pennsylvania mr murtha xz4002860 myself the gentleman from california mr lewis xz4002391 the gentleman from wisconsin mr obey xz4003000 have just recently met with representatives of the defense department
what we do in this supplemental is to provide as the gentleman from california chairman lewis has mentioned body armor the uparmored humvees ammunition and medical care
we provide the soldiers that are fighting in the war with what they need to accomplish their mission and what they need to protect themselves while they are accomplishing their mission
and the specific details of the bill have been made available to members if they want to see all of the items that are funded in this bill
part of the money in this bill goes to do just that to train the iraqis to protect themselves so that they can have a selfgovernment with some semblance of security
and in the meantime say a prayer for them the ones that are over there still
they are still in harm s way
the increases that we have added in this bill go to the urgently needed items such as ammunition weapons uparmored humvees transport vehicles jammers night vision equipment radios addon armor kits and the list goes on and on
it has been pretty generally known that we have in this bill increased the death benefit for those who make the total sacrifice and lose their lives in working and supporting the nation s security
we have also increased the service group life insurance programs substantially so that those who prefer to take part in that program can have additional benefits and many of these benefits are really needed
there are many soldiers and marines today who have been wounded so seriously that in previous wars would have died on the battlefield but who are living today in this war because of improved and increased medical benefits and better training and better medicines and the ability to transport from the battlefield to a medical facility
mr chairman i rise today in support of hr 418 the real id act of 2005
however the real id act implements crucial provisions that were dropped from hr 10 and fixes several glaring holes in our border security
one of the most important provisions in this legislation asks states to work with the department of homeland security to establish and use standards for drivers licenses
this bill provides common sense provisions to help prevent another 911type attack by protecting our borders and disrupting terrorist travel in the united states
i urge members to vote in favor of the real id act
mr chairman i rise in support of hr 1268 the emergency supplemental and wartime appropriations act of 2005
we are asking the brave men and women of our armed forces to put their lives on the line in defense of our freedom
in return we should not hesitate to give them the best protective gear that we can provide
however i have serious concerns about providing additional nondefense and nonemergency items such as money for facility construction and international peacekeeping efforts that are included in this supplemental
i commend the chairman of the appropriations committee the distinguished gentleman from california mr lewis for his efforts to limit the amount of nondefense and nonemergency funding in this bill
but far too often the federal government deems additional spending an emergency because it was not included in the original budget request
any nondefense and nonemergency funding should be considered in the regular budget process
as members of congress we owe it to the american taxpayer to ensure any new request for emergency spending is thoroughly reviewed and considered in a fair manner on the house floor especially when essential funding for our nation s armed forces is at stake
despite my displeasure in allowing some of these additional items to be included in the supplemental i support this legislation because congress has a moral obligation to provide our troops with the safest equipment and most up to date training available
mr chairman i rise in support of hr 418
the nature of this requirement is of particular importance in the post911 environment in which we must all live
in years past when those of us on the subcommittee on immigration confronted this challenge there were traffickers and human cargo and narcotics and the increasing problem of criminal gangs who profit from such enterprises
the real id act introduced by the gentleman from wisconsin chairman sensenbrenner is an important step in meeting this challenge
in conjunction with the additional border patrol positions authorized by this body at the close of the last congress hr 418 will remove the impediments to completing the fence along the san diego corridor of our southern border
i want to commend my predecessor in the third congressional district in california mr doug ose who worked hard to remove the regulatory obstacles to completion of the fence
in today s post911 environment it is one component in an integrated us border security system
in our system of governance the united states government and specifically the congress have given us what is tantamount to plenary jurisdiction over immigration law
as a former attorney general in my state i can make the observation that in most areas of the law enforcement the states and local governments have primary jurisdiction
as a former president of the other party put it in a different context the buck stops here although i am a committed believer in federalism the nature of the task and the language of article i section 8 are clear
while this bill in no way preempts state law with respect to the issuance of driver s licenses it does entail a modest notion that the immigration laws enacted by this body ought to mean something
mr chairman i rise today in support of our troops serving overseas and hr 1268
by passing this budget supplemental we send a message to our troops that we support you in your cause to bring freedom and democracy to the world i commend the committee for proposing to increase funding for vehicle armor kits new trucks and night vision equipment above and beyond the administration s request
this money will ensure our troops are safe in the line of fire
although i will be voting for this supplemental i hope in the future we will not have to vote for supplemental appropriations
i hope in the future we will vote on the funding of military operations during the budgeting process
we are dealing with known and fixed costs in this supplemental
it is time for the congress to send a message to the administration that we must include future funding for the war on terrorism in the federal budget
this legislation is extremely important to the lives of servicemembers in iraq and afghanistan and their families
i have spoken to the parents and families of our men and women who have fallen in the line of duty and i am acutely aware of family conflicts which are exacerbated by the death of a servicemember
therefore i have serious concerns regarding the application of the servicemember s group life insurance sgli spousal consent requirements in section 1113 b of the emergency supplemental bill
this one size fits all approach could result in the onetime payment of 400 000 to a spouse at the expense of a servicemember s wishes and the best interest of his orphaned children
this servicewoman may prefer to name their children as the beneficiaries of her life insurance policy so that in the event of her death the insurance is spent on he children s school clothes and health care
a man who wants to be responsible and take care of his children in the event of his death should not be prevented from doing so
but the spousal consent provision in the emergency supplemental may do just that
i would like to insert in the record a letter from moaa and a similar letter from the military coalition
it needs to be reconsidered in that light
i trust that the conferees will be able to address this issue in conference
chairman on behalf of the 370 000 members of the military officers association of america moaa i am writing to inform you that after discussing the issue extensively with the committee s majority and minority staff moaa has reconsidered its position on the servicemen s group life insurance sgli spousal consent requirement as included in the appropriations committee s markup of the fy2005 defense supplemental appropriations act
we believe there is merit to the staff s view that the appropriations committee s language is excessively stringent and could inappropriately preclude servicemembers ability to make reasonable insurance decisions especially in circumstances where it may be reasonable and appropriate for a member to designate children as beneficiaries instead of the current spouse
moaa believes congress is doing the right thing in expediting passage of improved death benefits coverage in the supplemental appropriations act and we have no wish to slow that process in any way
therefore moaa urges your support for a floor amendment that would either substitute a provision requiring spousal notification instead of spousal consent or strike the spousal consent requirement to allow the committee to develop more appropriate language that could be offered in conference or another appropriate legislative venue
dear representative evans the military coalition tmc a consortium of nationally prominent uniformed services and veterans organizations representing more than 55 million members plus their families and survivors is writing to inform you that after discussions with the veterans affairs committee s majority and minority staff tmc has reconsidered its position on the servicemen s group life insurance sgli spousal consent requirement as included in the appropriations committee s markup of the fy2005 defense supplemental appropriations act
tmc believes there is merit to the staff s view that the bill language is excessively stringent and could inappropriately preclude servicemembers ability to make reasonable insurance decisions especially in circumstances where it may be reasonable and appropriate for a member to designate children as beneficiaries instead of the current spouse
tmc believes congress is doing the right thing in expediting passage of improved death benefits coverage in the supplemental appropriations act and we have no wish to slow that process in any way
therefore tmc urges your support for a floor amendment that would either substitute a provision requiring spousal notification or strike the spousal consent requirement to allow the committee to develop more appropriate language that could be offered in conference or another legislative venue
louis away not even allowing it to dock in america
today in haiti cuba and other countries thousands face death religious persecution torture and property confiscation
this bill virtually closes the door to those who might seek asylum in america
let me remind my colleagues that this bill would not affect that situation at all as all of the terrorists were in this country legally and could have obtained driver s licenses regardless of this law
mr chairman i rise today in support of the bipartisan amendment offered by the gentleman from massachusetts mr tierney xz4004070 and the gentleman from iowa mr leach xz4002360
i support this amendment because it will address an issue that is of paramount importance to the people in my district and i think across the country supporting our troops while being fiscally responsible
its work resulted in the discovery and exposure of waste and mismanagement in the wartime production program
it is our responsibility to ensure that every man and woman in uniform has the necessary equipment to do the job with the best possible support
while the morale of our troops is high and their optimism apparent after the recent elections in iraq it is imperative that we do everything in our power to ensure that they are brought home as quickly as possible
ensuring that there is no waste or mismanagement in any of our funding i have no doubt that a modern day truman committee will help bring our troops home quickly safely and in a fiscally responsible way
let me be clear we are not preempting state authority in this area
driver s licenses have become the primary form of identification in the united states
however this legislation says if you are going to use that identification card to get on transportation that is in interstate commerce or otherwise then it is going to have to meet certain minimum standards
as regards another aspect asylum we have a situation in which a legislative body as it has come to be that is also known as the ninth circuit court of appeals has enacted legislation that overcomes and overwhelms a judge s right and ability to judge credibility as it should
i have heard friends across the aisle say that americans have journeyed freely in the past and that this goes against the very freedoms which this nation was founded on
and the more liberties that we forgo withdrawing at the border and restricting and making sure people who are coming in do not mean us harm then the more liberties we are going to lose in this country
so it is important that we make sure we have that water metaphorically flowing into this lake to give it life but it is even more important that we restrict those who would harm us from coming in as they would
mr chairman i rise in support of the amendment by my colleague from delaware
this amendment takes a common sense approach in saying that those who want to board our nation s airplanes must show documentation showing their full legal identity
and i think maybe in the future we should be careful about adding things that are not really important emergencies such as in this supplemental conferring eligibility for rural housing assistance grants in the village of new miami ohio allowing some farm service accounts for the alaska dairy farmers increasing the cost of the fort peck fish hatchery project in minnesota and adding to the national center for manufacturing services in michigan along with 500 000 for the oral history of negotiated settlement projects at the university of nevada
i think these belong in some other bill
mr chairman i rise in support today of the real id act
as the former chief of counterterrorism in the us department of justice for the western district of texas i had jurisdiction over the mexicantexas border
terrorists have taken advantage of other holes in our laws
this border security legislation provides the safety measure that to obtain a driver s license the person must simply prove they have a legal right to remain in our nation
mr chairman my opposition to the war in iraq and criticism of the administration s rationale for engaging our troops in this conflict have been well documented
but in the meantime despite these reservations the cold hard truth of the matter is that our soldiers are in iraq not because they choose but because they have been ordered there
also included is 50 million for the radio jammers that are installed in our vehicles to prevent attempts by insurgents to explode remote controlled bombs and mines as our troops drive by
this measure also provides critical increases in financial support to the families of our fallen soldiers
it would give 656 million in direct assistance for tsunami disaster relief for countries devastated by the december 26 2004 earthquake and tsunami
in addition 92 million in emergency funds are provided to respond to the humanitarian crisis in the darfur region of sudan where egregious ethnic cleansing has been occurring
tens of thousands of men women and children have been killed during the violence and thousands more die every month in camps housing the nearly 2 million people who have fled their homes
150 million in emergency food aid mostly for sudan and warravaged liberia was included in committee
with a recent glimmer of hope and improved chances for a resolution in the middle east the bill provides 200 million for the west bank and gaza to help the forces for peace seize this opportunity
mr chairman while i continue to have grave concerns about the president s war in iraq on balance this bill provides funds that will help protect our men and women under fire gives additional help to the families of those who will never return home helps consolidate the tentative gains in israel and the palestinian areas and aids the peoples of other nations who face dire crises abroad
for these reasons i will cast my vote in favor of the measure
mr speaker i rise in strong opposition of s 5 the socalled class action fairness act this bill will send the majority of class action suits from state to federal courts making it more difficult for people who have been unfairly hurt to collect compensation for their injuries
it takes rights away from consumers in order to protect drug manufacturers insurance companies hmos and negligent doctors
they want to come down here and talk about all sorts of other things that are not involved in class action
an entire industry has grown up over attorneys seeking cash in these classaction lawsuits
it will prevent attorneys from choosing which state to file in because we know sometimes they choose where they think they can get the biggest monetary award
we are putting the focus back on justice back on justice in this bill
in addition the reform provides greater consumer protection by allowing our courts to scrutinize those settlements that provide victims with coupons while those attorneys are getting millions and millions and millions of dollars
we have worked tirelessly on this in the house and i urge everyone to support it
unfortunately instead of narrowly focusing on such abuses senate bill 5 completely reconfigures the judicial system resulting in diminished corporate accountability and fundamental legal rights of individuals
mr speaker the vote in this house we will take within the hour will leave only one more step the president s signature in this first major attack on lawsuit abuse
i want to express my appreciation to the gentleman from wisconsin mr sensenbrenner xz4003650 and his committee and all the members in fact who have been willing to take on this tough fight but particularly to the chairman for working hard to find a way to get this bill on the floor and to the president this early in this congress
the past few years have witnessed an explosion of interstate class actions being filed in state courts particularly in certain magnet jurisdictions
they routinely approve settlements in which the lawyers receive large fees and the class members receive virtually nothing
the class action fairness act is a commonsense bipartisan plan that addresses this serious problem by allowing larger interstate class action cases cases that truly do involve multiple states to be filed in federal court
in addition to unclogging certain overused courts this bill ends the harassment of local businesses through forum shopping
they sometimes name a local pharmacy or a local convenience store in a nationwide product liability suit simply because they believe that court and that court often has created a reputation as the place to go to get unjust settlements
the stories go on and on and on to the point that by the time we passed legislation like this in the last congress for the third congress straight members were eager to just simply get a couple of minutes to talk about one of the classes where the people in the class get a dollaroff coupon the people in the class get the smallest possible box of cheerios the people in the class get a 31cent check or the people in the class even wind up having to pay the lawyers of the class additional money because there really was no money for the people in the class that was being determined
this bill requires that judges carefully review settlements and limits attorneys fees when the value of the settlement received by the class members is minor in comparison or when there is a net loss settlement where the class members actually end up losing money
this bill bans settlements that award some class members a large recovery simply because they live closer to the court that the lawyers shopped for to get that case in that judge s court
madam speaker i am pleased to rise this morning in support of the bill before us
in the two decades that i have been privileged to serve in the house the class action measure that is before us today is the most modest litigation reform that has been debated and it strikes in a narrow and appropriate way at an egregious abuse of justice
the bill simply permits the removal to federal courts of class actions that are truly national in scope with plaintiffs living across the nation and the large corporate defendant even if the current diversity of citizenship rules are not strictly met
cases that are truly national in scope are being filed as state class actions before certain favored judges who employ an almost anything goes approach that remedies virtually any controversy subject to certification as a class action
he asks for large fees in the millions of dollars for himself and coupons for the plaintiff class members that he represents
it permits the removal of these national cases to the federal court in the state in which the state class action has been filed
in the federal court the rights of plaintiffs will be more carefully observed
under the bill cases that are local in scope will remain in the state court where they are initially filed
i want to commend the gentleman from virginia mr goodlatte xz4001540 for the thoughtful leadership that he has provided in steering this measure to the point of passage today
i also want to commend the gentleman from wisconsin mr sensenbrenner xz4003650 for the wise course that he has followed as chairman of the house committee on the judiciary in permitting the senate to act in advance of our action today
i want to commend our former house colleague senator tom carper for the outstanding work he performed in negotiating changes to the measure which resulted in 72 members of the senate voting to approve this reform
since that value is usually less than 75 000 these courts have kept such cases in state court
in such a case it would make sense to leave the matter in federal court
after all the state laws that would apply in all of these cases would vary depending on where the drug was prescribed and purchased
now suppose in a second example a checking account fee disclosure class action were filed in a nevada state court against a nevada bank located in a border city and the class consisted of 65 percent nevada residents and 35 percent california residents who crossed the border in order to conduct transactions in the nevada bank
in this hypothetical it might make sense to allow that matter to proceed in state court
it is likely that nevada banking law would apply to all of these claims even those of the california residents since all of the transactions occurred in the state of nevada
under this provision defendants will be able to remove mass actions to federal court under the same circumstances in which they will be able to remove class actions
in addition a mass action can not be removed to federal court if it falls under one of the following four categories number one if all of the claims arise out of an event or occurrence that happened in the state where the action was filed and that resulted in injuries only in that state or in contiguous states number two if it is the defendants who seek to have the claims joined for trial number three if the claims are asserted on behalf of the general public pursuant to a state statute authorizing such an action and number four if the claims have been consolidated or coordinated for pretrial purposes only
i would appreciate the gentleman from wisconsin clarifying how the 75 000 amount in controversy minimum would apply to assessing whether federal jurisdiction exists over a mass action and most importantly explaining the intent of the sponsors with regard to the first and third exceptions
eric topol and other researchers at the cleveland clinic sounded the alarm in august of 2001
their article in the journal of the american medical association pointed to increased occurrence of heart problems in patients taking vioxx and similar coxii antiinflammatory drugs
so monty huggins may arrive in federal court only to find that is the end of the line
if they win everybody in the class probably gets a few bucks and the whole thing is done
there is a world of difference mr speaker between a faulty battery in this and the death of a 39yearold wife and mother
we should strip out the whole class action the mass action provision but that is not realistic in this political environment
topol at the cleveland clinic who i mentioned earlier wrote neither of the two major forces in this 5andahalf year affair neither merck nor the fda fulfilled its responsibilities to the public this motion to commit offers an opportunity for someone at last to act responsibly
it does not have to be someone who is actually injured in the process
that named plaintiff is a citizen of the same state as one of the defendants and that puts them in the state court which is where they want to be
next the lawyers level their allegations both in court and in the media
they just need a forum in which to make the allegations
they are in state court with the named plaintiffs and their allegations and it is time to get out of rule 23 free
rule 23 is the rule that would apply in federal courts that defines when a class action can be certified consistent with fundamental fairness and due process considerations
but in this game there is no fairness
so they easily convince their magnet state to certify that they have a class and at the same time they file copycat lawsuits in state courts all over the country
at this point in the game the lawyers start making the money
in the columbia house record case the lawyers took home 5 million and the plaintiffs got a coupon for discounts on future purchases of records
in the blockbuster case the lawyers walked away with 925 million and the plaintiffs again got a coupon for 1 off their next video rental coupons that the defendant probably would have issued anyway
in the bank of boston case the lawyers settled the case and took home 85 million
so in the end a state court approved these cases and all of the consumers in the lawsuit lost money
people may be wondering what happens to them in this game
we already know that if one is a consumer in the consumer class they will be lucky if they get a dollaroff coupon
if the business one works for gets sued in one of the class actions their employer is going to take a major hit and maybe even lay them off
it is that clear in some of these cases the basic result is that the lawyers will get lots of money but consumers will pay because health care and car insurance premiums will go through the roof
mr speaker i rise in support of the class action fairness act because we can not act fast enough
data and statistics indicate that since 1978 legal costs in west virginia have risen more than 10 times faster than the state economy as a whole
as a result our economy has not grown as fast as the rest of the nation and the jobs that west virginians seek to support their families are not as readily available as they are in other parts of our country
mr speaker i thank the gentleman from georgia for yielding me this time and frankly for making that important point that this matter is proceeding to this floor under a bipartisan unanimous vote by the committee on rules and the suggestion that the process was unfair or defective is not borne out by both the nature of the debate in the committee on rules and by the unanimous vote that sent this rule to the floor
i rise today in support of the rule for s 5 the class action fairness act of 2005
furthermore it makes in order a substantive amendment in the nature of a substitute that the gentleman from michigan mr conyers xz4000800 has worked hard to produce
i believe that this will allow a spirited debate and one that will fully explore the many complex issues surrounding classaction reform while still enabling the house to act in an expeditious fashion
mr speaker while i fully agree that classaction lawsuits are a legitimate tool in civil procedure these lawsuits are a tool that has been frequently abused over the past years
there exist a certain small subset of attorneys who do not represent the best traditions of their colleagues in the legal profession and primarily are concerned with lining their pockets by abusing the classaction process
often this is done through the popular socalled coupon settlement process where the class of plaintiffs only receive coupons to use from the very same companies they are suing while the attorneys walk away from the table with millions in cash
the ongoing flood of meritless labor and employment litigation has often destroyed reputable companies and has resulted in thousands of layoffs and business restructurings that hurt innocent workers and shareholders alike
this legislation would incentivize only those who have legitimate classaction claims to move forward in the legal process and at the same time it would disincentivize lawyers from filing meritless claims by increasing sanctions against those who do so
those who support another approach have the full opportunity to explore it in the minority s amendment in the nature of a substitute
next month we will take up a bankruptcy bill that massively tilts the playing field in favor of credit card companies and against ordinary consumers and workers alike
on deck and pending are equally onesided medical malpractice bills and asbestos bills that both cap damages and eliminate liability to protect some of the most egregious wrongdoers in america
the majority s assault on victims and consumers is unprecedented in its scope and stunning in its breadth
federal judges facing overburdened dockets and ambiguities about applying state laws in a federal court often refuse to grant standing to class action plaintiffs forbes magazine writes the legislation will
will be astounding and in our view disastrous
redirecting state law class actions to the federal courts will choke federal court dockets and delay or foreclose the timely and effective determination of federal civil rights cases since the november election we have heard a lot of talk about values and that is fine but will someone during this discourse today tell me where the value is in denying senior citizens who suffered heart attacks because they took vioxx for their arthritis
where is the morality in preventing poor workers from joining together to obtain compensation when unscrupulous employers pay them slavelabor wages
where is the righteousness in telling victims of discrimination that they will have to wait years for a federal court to consider violations of their own state laws
if we have learned anything from the enron tyco firestone and other legal debacles it is that our citizens need more protection against wrongdoers in our society not less
and yet the class action bill before us takes us in precisely the opposite direction
the gentleman from virginia mr boucher xz4000430 is a dear friend of mine and i merely want to take one observation that he made that this is just a procedural process and that there is no substantive changes but i say to him if the legal system is rigged and the rules are stacked against you you never have to get to the substance you do not even get your day in court
it is a procedural process that prevents people from bringing actions in state courts and we are sending it to the federal courts when both the federal judiciary has spoken against this measure and the state judges have spoken against this measure as well
this legislation is also opposed by many of the nation s editorial boards in the newspaper business
first of all i think the naacp and the civil rights groups will be eager to find out that his wisdom is superior to their experience in the civil rights movement
mr speaker we have listened carefully to the discussion here and it is very clear that one thing is for sure this is not a simple procedural fix to class actions in our courts
first the bill as the gentlewoman from texas has said harms working americans and victims of discrimination who are in no position to bring individual actions of wageandhour cases or civil rights discrimination claims
moving the cases to federal court will result in many never being ever heard at all
twentyone states extend federal definitions of national origin discrimination by including ancestry place of birth and citizenship status and 31 states prohibit genetic discrimination in the workplace not provided under federal law
although these cases are filed in state courts under state law the bill will treat them as class actions and throw them willynilly into the federal court
however under this proposal before us today those who suffered harm from the drug will be denied their day in court and their ability to seek justice
the bill will force many of these cases filed in state courts into the federal system
result harmed consumers will never have their cases adjudicated in the courts
so i am very pleased to put in the record the letter from the states attorneys general opposing this legislation those attorneys general from california illinois iowa kentucky maine maryland massachusetts minnesota new jersey new mexico new york oklahoma oregon vermont and west virginia
finally mr speaker i include in this debate from the leadership conference and the aflcio and the alliance for justice all writing on one letter and they plead with us in the house of representatives to protect working men and women and civil rights litigants by opposing the measure that is before us
because the amendment was not adopted we ask you to reject s 5 in order to ensure that the class action fairness act does not adversely impact the workplace and civil rights of ordinary americans by making it extremely difficult to enforce civil rights and labor rights
during congress extensive examination into the merits of class action lawsuits nowhere has a case been made that abuses exist in antidiscrimination and wage and hour classaction litigation
wage and hour class actions are most often brought in state courts under the law of the state in which the claims arise
at least six states and territories however including california and alaska require payment of overtime after a prescribed number of hours are worked in a single day
some of these state statutes provide a broader definition of disability and a greater range of protection in comparison to the federal americans with disabilities act including california minnesota new jersey new york rhode island washington and west virginia
in addition every state has enacted a law prohibiting age discrimination in employment and some of these state laws including those of california michigan ohio and the district of columbia contain provisions affording greater protection to older workers than comparable provisions of the federal age discrimination in employment act adea
in addition many state laws provide protections to classifications not covered by federal law
finally 31 states have enacted legislation prohibiting genetic discrimination in the workplace an important protection given the rapid increase in the ability to gather this type of information
in addition florida and illinois have enacted more limited protections against genetic discrimination
under s 5 citizens are denied the right to use their own state courts to bring class actions against corporations that violate these state wage and hour and state civil rights laws even where that corporation has hundreds of employees in that state
in light of the lack of any compelling need to sweep state wage and hour and civil rights claims into the scope of the bill which is done in the current bill we urge you to vote against s 5
in the event that amendments are offered we support any amendment that like the kennedy amendment and others offered in the senate preserves the right of individuals to bring class actions in an effective efficient manner

dear senator our organizations are opposed to the sweepinglydrawn and misleadingly named class action fairness act of 2005 this bill is patently unfair to citizens harmed by toxic spills contaminated drinking water polluted air and other environmental hazards involved in class action cases based on state environmental or public health laws
s 5 would allow corporate defendants in many pollution class actions and mass tort environmental cases to remove these kinds of state environmental matters from state court to federal court placing the cases in a forum that could be more costly more timeconsuming and disadvantageous to your constituents harmed by toxic pollution
state law environmental harm cases do not belong in this legislation and we urge you to exclude such pollution cases from the class action bill
in such cases a class action lawsuit in state court based on state common law doctrines of negligence nuisance or trespass or upon rights and duties created by state statutes in the state where the injuries occur is often the best way of fairly resolving these claims
according to a may 2002 gao report 35 states reported that they find mtbe in groundwater at least 20 percent of the time they sample for it and 24 states said that they find it at least 60 percent of the time
some communities and individuals have brought or soon will bring suits to recover damages for mtbe contamination and hold the polluters accountable but under this bill mtbe class actions or mass actions based on state law could be removed to federal court by the oil and gas companies in many of these cases
this could not only make these cases more expensive more timeconsuming and more difficult for injured parties but could also result in the dismissal of legitimate cases by federal judges who are unfamiliar with or less respectful of statelaw claims
for example in at least one mtbe class action a federal court dismissed the case based on oil companies claims that the action was barred by the federal clean air act even though that law contains no tort liability waiver for mtbe
in a letter to the senate last year the us judicial conference expressed their continued opposition to such broadly written class action removal legislation
notably their letter states that even if congress determines that some significant multistate class actions should be brought within the removal jurisdiction of the federal courts congress should include certain limitations and exceptions including for class actions in which plaintiff class members suffered personal injury or personal property damage within the state as in the case of a serious environmental disaster the judicial conference s letter explains that this environmental harm exception should apply to all individuals who suffered personal injuries or losses to physical property whether or not they were citizens of the state in question we agree with the judicial conference that cases involving environmental harm are not even close to the type of cases that proponents of s 5 cite when they call for reforms to the class action system
including such cases in the bill penalizes injured parties in those cases for no reason other than to benefit the polluters
no rationale has been offered by the bill s supporters for including environmental cases in s 5 s provisions
for example the bill would apply to cases similar to the recently concluded statecourt trial in anniston alabama where a jury awarded damages to be paid by monsanto and solutia for injuring more than 3 500 people that the jury found had been exposed over many years with the companies knowledge to cancercausing pcbs
there is little doubt in the anniston case that had s 5 been law the defendants would have tried to remove the case from the state court that serves the community that suffered this devastating harm
even in the bestcase scenario s 5 would put plaintiffs like those in anniston in the position of having to fight costly and timeconsuming court battles in order to preserve their chosen forum for litigating their claims
in any case it would reward the kind of reckless corporate misbehavior demonstrated by monsanto and solutia by giving defendants in such cases the right to remove statelaw cases to federal court over the objections of those they have injured
we take no position on the act as a general matter and indeed there are differing views among us on the policy judgments reflected in the act
we join together however in a bipartisan request for support of senator mark pryor s potential amendment to s 5 or any similar legislation clarifying that the act does not apply to and would have no effect on actions brought by any state attorney general on behalf of his or her respective state or its citizens
in some instances such actions have been brought with the attorney general acting as the class representative for the consumers of the state
the attorneys general have been very successful in litigation initiated to protect the rights of our consumers
for example in the pharmaceutical industry the states have recently brought enforcement actions on behalf of consumers against large often foreignowned drug companies for overcharges and market manipulations that illegally raised the costs of certain prescription drugs
such cases have resulted in recoveries of approximately 235 million dollars the majority of which is earmarked for consumer restitution
in several instances the states recoveries provided one hundred percent reimbursement directly to individual consumers of the overcharges they suffered as a result of the illegal activities of the defendants
the substitute would carve out state civil rights claims in order to make sure that civil rights plaintiffs especially those seeking immediate injunctive relief can have their grievances addressed in a timely manner
believe me this is an issue of great moment to those of us who are still prosecuting for a fair day in our nation and have civil rights laws to back us up but we now are pleading to keep the proper forums
for example every state in the union has passed a law prohibiting discrimination on the basis of disability
wageandhour class actions are often brought in state courts because state wageandhour remedies are often i am sorry to say more complete than the federal wageandhour statute and we have examples of that
it is just shameful that the victims of corporate misconduct do not have the same level of influence here in the halls of congress
i have spent decades in courtrooms and i can tell my colleagues from my own experience that justice delayed is justice denied
this bill is a disgrace to the historic victories in courts across the country to expand consumer rights protect our environment and strengthen workers rights
and there has been complete disregard for the legislative process in the house
while we have had hearings and markups on class action legislation in the past this bill is quite complex and very different than previous versions
the fact that the other chamber has already approved this matter in no way justifies a rush to judgment in the house when so many important rights are at stake
yet if this bill becomes law the victims of those practices will face new obstacles in their efforts to call those executives to task
and to prevent people from banding together as a class to challenge that power in the only way they can
we must also see this bill in its proper context
this bill is but the latest in a series of assaults by those on the other side attacking the ability of individuals to seek relief from the courts
and it is also but the latest in a series of assaults on states rights to provide legal remedies for harm suffered by their citizens
the rule waives all points of order against consideration of the bill makes in order one amendment in the nature of a substitute it waives all points of order against this amendment and it provides one motion to recommit with or without instructions
but this is fair in both senses of that term a fair rule that gives members on both sides of the aisle a chance to discuss their ideas on class action reform
in fact the other body passed this measure by a vote of 72 to 26 with strong bipartisan support
class action reform is a first step in litigation reform aimed at providing relief for these small businesses
the underlying bill will make several key reforms including expanding federal jurisdiction over large interstate class actions as originally intended by our founding fathers create exceptions that keep truly local disputes in state courts provide an end to the harassment of local businesses as part of this forum shopping game and create a consumer class action bill of rights
mr speaker i would like to again urge my colleagues to support this rule which passed out of the committee on rules without objection and to vote in favor of the underlying bill which will provide this much needed reform
mr speaker in response to some of the comments that were made by the gentleman from massachusetts i want to share with my colleagues some facts
for example the act number one requires that judges carefully review all coupon settlements and limit attorney s fees paid in such settlements to the value actually received by the class members
second it requires careful scrutiny of net loss settlements in which the class members end up losing money
in addition the bill would require that notice of proposed settlements be provided to appropriate state and federal officials such as state attorneys general
well a recent study examined class actions in the state courts of connecticut delaware maine massachusetts new york and rhode island to determine what effect the bill would have on the class actions filed in those respective states
here is what they found in regard to the state of massachusetts
sixtyone percent 30 out of 49 of the reported class actions would have presumedly remained in state court
at least 10 of the 19 massachusetts cases that would be affected by this bill the class action fairness act involved nationwide classes cases primarily involving citizens living in other states
mr speaker i am proud to yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from tennessee mrs blackburn xz4000320 a former member of the committee on the judiciary and an original cosponsor of this bill in the 108th congress
i want to remind her that the committee on rules voted unanimously in favor of this rule and granted an amendment in order in the form of a substitute that includes each and every one of the provisions that she just spoke of
i also would like to remind my colleagues that each and every one of those amendments were also proffered in the other body and each and every one of those amendments were voted down in a strong bipartisan vote
so to suggest mr speaker that this is something that had not been looked at and we have not talked about i would remind my colleague that it was addressed in the 105th congress in the 106th congress in the 107th congress in the 108th congress and finally we are here and we are going to get this rule passed and this bill passed and on to the president for his signature
in response to the gentlewoman from texas the committee on rules has jurisdiction and anybody that knows the history of this body knows and understands that the committee on rules certainly has jurisdiction
let me just give a little history for my colleagues and particularly for the gentlewoman from texas in regard to this bill
again in the 105th congress senate bill 2083 the class action fairness act senate held hearing reported by subcommittee
mr speaker in the 106th congress hr 1875 interstate class action jurisdiction act of 1999
in the 107th congress hr 2341 class action fairness act of 2001
in the 108th congress hr 1115 class action fairness act of 2003 committee hearing and markup held passed floor 253 to 170
mr speaker the gentleman from massachusetts mr mcgovern xz4002630 presented that case and i want to present the real crux of this problem and let me read a suit shields et al v bridgestonefirestone incorporated in texas a suit in texas
like hr 1115 which overwhelmingly passed the house last congress s 5 expands federal diversity jurisdiction over interstate class actions in a manner consistent with the framers constitutional intent that federal court preside over controversies between citizens of different states
s 5 also protects consumers from these bogus coupon settlements that reward trial lawyers with millions in windfall fees while clients who never hired them get coupons in the mail
the washington post is not exactly the most conservative newspaper in the country the clients get token payments while the lawyers get enormous fees
it is an extortion racket that only congress can fix the senate s overwhelming passage of s 5 by a vote of 72 to 26 just last week reflects a strong bipartisan consensus in favor of reforming a classaction system that is prone to systematic abuse
of those 26 18 were democrats and each one of those provisions in that amendment in the nature of a substitute were offered in the senate and each one of them were voted down in a bipartisan fashion
i think we all in both the senate and the house and both republicans and democrats we want to do the right thing here and we want to make sure that as the washington post says that we eliminate this extortion racket and bring some fairness to this classaction system
what happens in madison county illinois affects the whole country
madam speaker the general principles behind s 5 and many of the provisions in the legislation are similar to those in hr 1115 which the house passed in 2003 and s 274 which was voted out of committee in the senate in 2003 but did not ultimately pass
however there are several new provisions in s 5 regarding federal jurisdiction over class actions that were not included in prior versions of the legislation
i would like to ask my colleague the chairman of the committee on the judiciary to provide an overview of the jurisdictional provisions in the legislation and i would like to discuss the various exceptions included in the legislation and the intent of the sponsors with regard to these exceptions
madam speaker i would also like to discuss the home state exception in the legislation
new subsections 1332 d 3 and d 4 b address the jurisdictional principles that will apply to class actions filed against the defendant in its home state dividing such cases into three categories
first for cases in which twothirds or more of the members of the plaintiff class and the primary defendants are citizens of the state in which the suit was filed section 1332 d 4 b states that federal jurisdiction will not be extended by s 5
such cases will remain in state courts
second cases in which more than twothirds of the members of the plaintiff class are not citizens of the state in which the action was filed will be subject to federal jurisdiction
they affect people in many jurisdictions and the laws of many states will be at issue
finally there is a middle category of class actions in which more than onethird but fewer than twothirds of the members of the plaintiff class and the primary defendants are all citizens of the state in which the action was filed
in such cases the numbers alone may not always confirm that the litigation is more fairly characterized as predominantly interstate in character
new subsection 1332 d 3 therefore gives federal courts discretion in the interests of justice to decline to exercise jurisdiction over such cases based on the consideration of five factors
madam speaker the legislation also includes a local controversy exception which is intended to ensure that truly local class actions can remain in state court under the legislation
under this provision federal courts are instructed not to exercise jurisdiction over cases that meet all of the following four criteria first more than twothirds of the class members must be the citizens of the state where the suit is brought second there must be at least one instate defendant from whom significant relief is sought by members of the class and whose conduct forms a significant basis of plaintiffs claims third the principal injuries resulting from the alleged conduct or related conduct of each defendant must have occurred in the state where the action was originally filed and fourth no other class action has been filed during the preceding 3 years asserting the same or similar factual allegations against any of the defendants
madam speaker in this regard i think it is important to note that the exceptions in this legislation are just that exceptions and they should not be interpreted in ways that turn them into loopholes
obviously this does not mean that plaintiffs can simply name a state in every consumer class action and stay out of federal court
thus the term primary defendant should include any person who has substantial exposure to significant portions of the proposed class in the action particularly any defendant that is allegedly liable to the vast majority of the members of the proposed classes as opposed to simply a few individual class members
finally mr speaker some critics have complained that the legislation removal provisions will result in delay
mr speaker i thank the gentleman for his leadership in moving this legislation forward and in working with the senate to accomplish that as well
i hope this colloquy will provide guidance on the very important jurisdictional provisions in s 5 and the sponsor s intent
mr speaker i thank the chairman for yielding me time and for his leadership in bringing this legislation to the floor and for working with the senate to achieve the compromise that we need
apparently she has not spoken to her own fellow san franciscan and senior senator from her state dianne feinstein who negotiated the compromise that has brought this legislation to the floor of the house or to senator chuck schumer also a member of the committee on the judiciary on the democratic side in the senate or 16 other democratic senators who voted for this legislation
she also apparently has not spoken to members of her own democratic caucus many of whom have voted for this legislation in each of the last three congresses that have passed the house of representatives and many more of whom will vote for the legislation today
the gentleman from massachusetts mr markey xz4002530 would not yield to me but he said that the amerada hess case in new hampshire with gasoline leaking into groundwater would not be heard in the state court but if you live in new hampshire and you have gasoline leaking in your groundwater and virtually all of the plaintiffs are new hampshire residents the case under this bill would be heard in the state courts
here is why the majority of personal injury cases brought against merck are individual cases that would not be affected by the bill in any manner whatsoever
these include more than 400 personal injury cases that are part of a coordinated proceeding in new jersey state court
how about the kay bee toys case where the lawyers got 1 million in attorneys fees and the consumers got 30 percent off selected products of an advertised sale at kay bee toys for one week
or the poland spring water case where the lawyers got 135 million in the wheel of fortune and the consumers got coupons to buy more of the water that the lawyers were alleging was defective
or the computer monitor litigation 6 million in attorneys fees in a case alleging that the size of the computer screen was slightly off and therefore they were entitled to something
my favorite case the case against chase manhattan bank the lawyers got 4 million in attorneys fees but the plaintiffs that allegedly the opponents of this bill are protecting they got 33 cents
the catch was that at the time to accept this 33cent magnanimous check they had to use a 34cent postage stamp to send in the acceptance to get their 33cent fee
22 million in attorneys fees
in not one of those cases was there any wrongdoing found on the part of any of those defendants because all of those were settlements
they were extortionate settlements because they are in the jurisdiction of a court where they know they are facing a hanging judge and a hanging jury
the gentleman also raised another good point and we should not leave plaintiffs in the situation where they get a 33cent check or a coupon for a box of cheerios like in another case and that is what this bill does
it requires extraspecial scrutiny for coupon settlement cases so the courts will no longer let the manufacturers attorneys and the defendants attorneys come in with a settlement that simply gets out of the case that gives the plaintiffs attorney a huge sum of money and everyone else walks away and the plaintiffs get left holding the bag
in addition when the gentleman talks about abuse of plaintiffs in these cases take into consideration the nationwide class action lawsuit filed in alabama against the bank of boston headquartered in massachusetts over mortgage escrow accounts
mr speaker i rise in opposition to the motion to commit
mr speaker first let me thank chairman sensenbrenner for his leadership in bringing us to this historic point
critics have been arguing in the press that s 5 should be rejected because it will hurt consumers bringing vioxx cases against merck
the majority of personal injury cases brought against merck are individual cases that would not be affected by the bill in any manner whatsoever
these include more than 400 personal injury cases that are part of a coordinated proceeding in new jersey state court
merck has been named in more than 75 statewide and nationwide class actions involving vioxx but only a small percentage are personal injury class actions
to the extent these cases do involve personal injury most were already brought in or removed to federal court because each potential class member s claims exceeds 75 000
there are a few cases which plaintiffs have joined together in mass actiontype cases against merck
however not a single vioxx case has been brought against merck in state court by more than 100 plaintiffs one of the requirements for removal to federal court under the class action legislation
since the legislation is not retroactive it would absolutely have no effect on the 75 class actions already filed against merck in the wake of the vioxx withdrawal
mr speaker given the large number of suits already filed and the fact that every former vioxx taker in america is already a proposed class member in numerous class actions it is unlikely there will be many more class actions after the legislation is enacted
it is bad legislation to have something pass that covers all class actions in the country for all time and name one specific product or one specific company in the legislation
ameritech the attorneys for the plaintiffs got 16 million in attorneys fees
the computer monitor litigation case the lawyers 6 million in fees the consumers a 13 rebate against your next future purchase of the alleged defective product
kb toys 1 million for the lawyers 30 percent off your selected product in a unadvertised 1week sale at kb toys
my favorite case however is this one the chase manhattan bank case where the lawyers got 4 million in attorneys fees the plaintiffs a check we have got one right here for 33 cents
but there was a catch because if you wanted to accept the 33 cents you had to use a 34cent postage stamp to send in your acceptance notice
the lawyers got 22 million in attorneys fees the plaintiffs one of whom was there got a 25 to 50off coupon to buy more of what
the very television set that she was complaining was defective in the first place
the injured plaintiffs in many cases are recovering basically nothing
in the blockbuster case the lawyers 925 million
the plan will require the judges carefully review the settlement and limit the attorneys fees when the value of the settlement received by those class members is minor in comparison or when there is a net loss in the settlement such as this example where the class members could end up losing money
i encourage my colleagues to ensure that the plaintiffs actually receive their due in these cases
the answer venue shopping cagey trial lawyers have figured out there s a pretty good likelihood their case no matter what its merit will literally get its day in court because of favorable judges
in 2000 cable tv customers who filed suit over their cable operator s late fee policy won their case but received nothing
today s action takes a step in the right direction to end the socalled tort tax
the tort tax adds to the cost of everything we buy because businesses and manufacturers have to cover themselves and their employees just in case they get sued by a greedy personal injury lawyer
in closing as a matter of principle damage awards should go to the victim not the lawyers
try telling that to the 9yearold son of janet huggins a 39yearold healthy tennessee mother who took vioxx and died in september 2004
anyone in the state of washington who saw what enron did to us stealing 1 billion should not be voting for this bill because this bill in many ways is the just say no bill to people who are injured by rapacious wrongdoers
in three ways it says just say no to consumers who were hurt by enron because in the federal courts if you happen to be in a plaintiff s group of multiple states and the laws are a little different in the states do you know what the federal courts do
because they throw out class actions where there is any difference in states meaning you will not be able to have a class action anywhere anywhere federal or state
we recognized that in our system of federalism americans deserve the full protection not just half the protection
this cuts the available judicial resources in half
i wonder if we said the lawyers that represented the 911 families could be considered greedy lawyers thousands who lost loved ones and their engagement in seeking to have redress of their grievances done in a classaction manner is that evidence of greedy lawyers
or maybe the thalidomide families babies who were born deformed in the 1950s and class actions were utilized is that a signal of greedy lawyers
why do we not think about a situation where you are a college student enrolled in a world history class you enter the first day and the professor says welcome it is now time to take the final exam
if my friends would tell the truth they would know that plaintiffs prevail in such a small percentage of times all over america that this is ridiculous and ludicrous legislation
they would also refer you to the cato institute in 1983 when they talked about attacking liberal legal opportunities or liberal bills
this legislation has seen no light of day in any committee
i ask my republicans we know you have the overwhelming majority you have the twothirds in essence you have the bully pulpit and you use it
the american people are not interested in process
here in this house we are not respecting process
i argue that the one amendment that we have as the manager s amendment should be the amendment that should be accepted and that is the one that includes the idea of protecting civil rights and wageandhour carveouts and prohibits those companies that have formulated their companies in another country united states companies incorporated elsewhere in order to be able to participate in this abusive process
it is in this light that i rise to support h res 96 only insofar as it allows consideration of the democratic substitute that was ruled in order by the committee on rules and offered by the distinguished ranking member of the judiciary committee mr conyers
for real and honest debate to take place on such an important issue as defining diversity jurisdiction in the federal courts for class actions we must have available an alternate option to s 5 the legislation that is before the committee of the whole house
i congratulate the rules committee for their foresight in enabling this open debate
in addition it fails to render accountability to parties who are in the best financial position
i am a cosponsor of the amendment in nature of a substitute that will be offered by my colleagues
with the provisions that it contains requirements for federal diversity jurisdiction will not be watered down resulting in the removal of nearly all class actions to federal court
contained within the amendment in nature of a substitute is a section that i proposed in the context of the terrorist penalties enhancement act that was included in the bill passed into law
the benedict arnold corporation refers to a company that in bad faith takes advantage of loopholes in our tax code to establish bank accounts or to ship jobs abroad for the main purpose of tax avoidance
the percentage of increase in the number of tax havens held by these corporations since 1997 ranges between 857 percent and 9 650 percent
this significant increase in the number of corporate tax havens is no coincidence when we look at the benefits that can be found in doing sham business transactions
some of these corporations are benedict arnolds because they have given up their american citizenship however they still conduct a substantial amount of their business in the united states and enjoy tax deductions of domestic corporations
the provision in the substitute amendment will preclude these corporations from enjoying the benefit of removing state class actions to federal court
forcing these corporate entities to defend themselves in state courts will ensure that these class action claims will be fairly and fully litigated
i support the amendment in nature of a substitute
i might also say when we talk about coupons and the amount of dollars that lawyers may receive might i remind the body that we are talking about thousands upon thousands of plaintiffs in a class action who would never have their grievances addressed and the corporate culprit would have never been punished had it not been for this class action
i think we have seen this come across our desks for a number of sessions and we have tried to work in a bipartisan manner in order to find a way to respond to some of the larger class actions that are now proceeding before us in the courts
i know some two or three sessions ago we were in the midst of conversations about the asbestos lawsuits
even today as we are looking to reconstruct some of the older buildings in my community we are finding an asbestos problem
but because of the notice that was given through these class action lawsuits we now have companies who are protecting workers who are going in trying to clean out asbestos
although there has been some humor about do nt you know when to stop smoking we know that for years and years years and years there was no labeling of cigarettes to suggest that they in fact caused cancer
so the tobacco lawsuits are not in fact frivolous
they may be high in return but they are not frivolous
there is nothing in this legislation that increases the funding of our federal courts
this legislation wants to federalize mass torts that is thousands and thousands of people when they realize that the compromise for example that was offered in the senate the feinstein compromise does not do anything because what it says is you can go into state court if you can find one of the defendants of a large corporation in your state
why close the doors to those who are injured by the mass and unfortunate activities of a company like enron in my congressional district penalizing thousands of workers all over america unfairly and giving them no relief giving no relief to the pensioners who lost all of their dollars
to my good friend who mentioned that civil rights can take place wherever is necessary let me just share with you that civil rights is not a popular cause and therefore to then add it to get in line now with thousands of other cases you can be assured that there will be a crisis
it excludes nonaction cases involving physical injuries an attorney general carveout the antisecrecy language and in particular it does not allow companies to go offshore to avoid class action lawsuits
what he is not telling those of us who understand what class action settlements really mean is that in the settlement comes the punishment for not doing or the incentive to not violate the law again
in the settlement comes an injunction that argues or stops the culprit the violator from doing harm again
so it looks as if there is a great bounty or a gift being given to lawyers who are working to ensure that the punitive entity the entity that has caused thousands of employees to lose pensions from corporations the entity such as mci and others who have thrown away their corporate responsibility to their employees and caused them to lose all their money who violated corporate laws and had the violation of trust and made sure that they did the selfdealing these class actions were to say and do that no more and we will not allow you to do that anymore for example the particular amendment that is included in the conyersnadlerjacksonlee substitute which i rise enthusiastically to support the tax traitor corporation which leaves america and incorporates somewhere else and depletes all of its savings accounts or all of its accounts so therefore if there is an action if you are harmed if you are hurt and you sue here in the united states you look up in the court and you find out there is empty pockets
there is a wage and hour carveout so that you can file against a company in your local jurisdiction as a class action when you have been violated on the minimum wage
physical injuries so that when your child is injured in a park because of a defective product you have the right to go into your state courts and seek relief
tell me the difference in being able to go into a court that has 159 judges versus those who have 13
at the end of the 108th congress there were 35 judicial vacancies in the federal courts
it allows you to go into the state courts that have a bounty of judges allows you to be heard and it allows those corporate offenders or those products that have offended and harmed and maybe killed those defective automobiles to be in the courthouse and to have their concerns heard
mr speaker i rise in opposition to this bill s 5 the class action fairness act
unfortunately for the millions of aggrieved plaintiffs in america with legitimate claims this body has brought yet another piece of legislation to the floor that threatens to close the doors of the court
in addition it fails to render accountability to parties who are in the best financial position
i am a cosponsor of the amendment in nature of a substitute that will be offered by my colleagues
with the provisions that it contains requirements for federal diversity jurisdiction will not be watered down resulting in the removal of nearly all class actions to federal court
contained within the amendment in nature of a substitute is a section that i proposed in the context of the terrorist penalties enhancement act that was included in the bill passed into law
the tax traitor corporation refers to a company that in bad faith takes advantage of loopholes in our tax code to establish bank accounts or to ship jobs abroad for the main purpose of tax avoidance
the percentage of increase in the number of tax havens held by these corporations since 1997 ranges between 857 percent and 9 650 percent
this significant increase in the number of corporate tax havens is no coincidence when we look at the benefits that can be found in doing sham business transactions
some of these corporations are tax traitor corporations because they have given up their american citizenship however they still conduct a substantial amount of their business in the united states and enjoy tax deductions of domestic corporations
the provision in the substitute amendment will preclude these corporations from enjoying the benefit of removing state class actions to federal court
forcing these corporate entities to defend themselves in state courts will ensure that these class action claims will be fairly and fully litigated
the barriers to gaining federal jurisdiction to have a case heard is much higher than in state courts by virtue of their creation
as a result the federal courts will be quick to refuse class certification in complex litigation matters
mr speaker i rise today in strong support of both the rule and the underlying classaction reform legislation
currently certain crafty lawyers are able to game the system by filing large nationwide classaction suits in certain preferred state courts such as madison county illinois where judges are quick to certify classes and quick to approve settlements that give millions of dollars to attorneys and only worthless coupons to their clients
looking at this chart for example we can see the history of madison county illinois which has been called the number one judicial hellhole in the united states
there were 77 classaction filings in 2002 and 106 classaction lawsuits filed in 2003
for example in a suit against blockbuster over late fees the attorneys received 925 million their clients got a 1 off coupon for their next video rental
similarly in a lawsuit against the company that makes cheerios the attorneys received 2 million for themselves while their clients received a coupon for a free box of cheerios
in a nutshell these outofcontrol classaction lawsuits are killing jobs they are hurting small business people who can not afford to defend themselves and they are hurting consumers who have to pay a higher price for goods and services
fortunately this legislation provides muchneeded reform in 2 key areas
first it eliminates much of the forum shopping by requiring that most of the nationwide classaction suits be filed in federal court
last week this exact bill received 72 votes in the us senate and last year we passed a similar bill with 253 votes
currently crafty lawyers are able to game the system by filing large nationwide class action suits in certain preferred state courts such as madison county illinois where judges are quick to certify classes and quick to approve settlements that give the lawyers millions of dollars in fees and give the clients worthless coupons
madison county illinois has been called the number one judicial hellhole in the united states

for example in a suit against blockbuster over late fees the attorneys received for themselves 925 million while their clients got a 1off discount coupon
similarly in a lawsuit against the company who makes cheerios the lawyers received 2 million for themselves predictably their clients received a coupon for a box of cheerios
in a nutshell these outofcontrol class action lawsuits are killing jobs they are hurting small business people who can not afford to defend themselves they are hurting consumers who end up paying higher prices for goods and services
this legislation provides muchneeded reform in two key areas
first it eliminates much of the forum shopping by requiring most of these nationwide class action suits to be filed in federal court
i rise in opposition to this rule and i rise in opposition to the underlying legislation
in the 1960s president kennedy used to say ask not what your country can do for you but what you can do for your country today republican leaders in washington have issued a new challenge ask not what your country can do for you but what you can do for the country club that is what this bill is all about
the classaction bill is part of an overall strategy which the republican party has put in place in order to harm consumers all across our country to repeal the protections that have been placed upon the books for two generations that ensure that the individual in our society is given the protection which they need
that is all part of this idea that paul oneill mentioned the former secretary of treasury for george bush when he said that dick cheney said to him reagan proved that deficits do nt matter of course the reason they do not matter is that as grover norquist has pointed out quite clearly the architect of this republican strategy the key goal has to be to starve the beast the beast of course being the federal government s ability to help ordinary people to help ordinary citizens to help ordinary consumers in our country when they are being harmed
secondly there is the grim reaper of regulatory relief where the office of management and budget inside of the bush administration ensures that any regulation that is meant to protect the consumer is tied up in endless rounds of peer review and costbenefit analysis weighing the lives of ordinary consumers against the money that corporations might have to spend in order to make sure that their products are not defective that they do not harm ordinary citizens across our country
then there is stage three the fox in the hen house
it says that all of these cases are going to federal court unless a significant defendant is in fact a citizen of the state
new hampshire has a suit which it has brought against 22 oil and chemical companies because of the pollution in the state s waterways with mtbe a deadly dangerous material which has harmed people all across our country but new hampshire is the best example
under this new law because the principal defendant in the case is amerada hess and because it is headquartered in new york and it is the principal defendant not only amerada hess but the other 22 companies not only is amerada hess this big company and the other 22 companies who have arrived in new hampshire polluting the state given the relief of not having the case be held in the state of new hampshire with new hampshire judges and new hampshire citizens instead it is removed to the federal court so the republicans can name judges who they know are going to be sympathetic to the companies not the state of new hampshire not their judges not their people
it is making sure that ordinary citizens in new hampshire whose families have been harmed whose health is permanently ruined can not bring a case against large corporations
they come in from outofstate they pollute they harm they ruin the lives of people and then the defendant says i do nt want to be tried in new hampshire
i do nt want to be tried in texas
i do nt want to be tried in that state
this is the final nail that the republicans are putting in the coffin of the rights of ordinary citizens to be able to protect themselves
all of these cases should be brought in the state courts where the large corporation caused the harm not in a federal court away from the closest people who know what is right and wrong inside of that state
vote to protect the consumers the families the children the seniors in our country who the republicans are going to allow to be jeopardized by moving the cases from where they live to places where the defendants the largest corporations will be able to protect their own selfish selfinterests
do you want to hear what the bush administration is really interested in
this bill is designated to funnel class action suits with plaintiffs in different states out of state courts and into the federal court system which is typically much less sympathetic to such litigation
the practical effect of the change could be that many cases will never be heard given how overburdened federal judges are which might help limit the number of cases smith barney advised its clients that this bill will be positive in general for the tobacco industry and that tobacco stocks have rallied on this favorable news given that this bill could have a positive impact on tobacco litigation
so if you are out there one of your family members has just found that they have a spot on their lung they have smoked for the last 20 or 30 years what this bill will do is it will make it more difficult for you and the other people in your states who also have found that they have spots on their lungs to get together to sue the tobacco companies
if your children are beginning to smoke they are 13 14 15 this bill is intended to make it more difficult for the people in the state of new hampshire or kansas or oklahoma to bring a suit to stop it
it is brilliant in the bush administration and that is what this side of the aisle is all about
the fda is it going to move in to regulate tobacco
the epa are they going to move in to make sure that the oil industry does not pollute your groundwater so that the children in your neighborhood do not contract leukemia that breast cancers do not rise
are they going to have a department of labor which protects you against asbestos in the workplace
but if you are afraid for the health of your family if you know that the groundwater in new hampshire has been poisoned by amerada hess and 22 other oil companies that are not in new hampshire you know what the republicans say
the case should not be held in new hampshire
and these people are saying your state is not smart enough your jurors are not smart enough to understand how the mtbe ruined the groundwater in their state and poisoned thousands of people that it has to go to a state where amerada hess or some large oil company feels comfortable because they are not headquartered in new hampshire they do not have a large plant in new hampshire
industry note tobacco senate just passed class action bill positive for tobacco the senate just passed a bill 7226 which is designed to funnel classaction suits with plaintiffs in different states out of state courts and into the federal court system which is typically much less sympathetic to such litigation
although this news is positive in general for the tobacco industry we do not necessarily believe that class actions pose a big threat to the industry
the senate just passed a bill that is designed to funnel classaction lawsuits with plaintiffs in different states out of state courts and into the federal court system which is historically much less sympathetic to such litigation
federal judges facing overburdened dockets and ambiguities about applying state laws in a federal court often refuse to grant standing to classaction plaintiffs
now the bill should move to the house floor and apparently the house republican leadership announced last week that the gop majority in that chamber will pass the senate s version of classaction litigation provided it arrives without amendments and from what we hear this is in fact what has happened in the senate
obviously president bush has been a big proponent of this type of legislation so we would assume that he would sign it as part of a broader fight that he hopes will lead to limits on awards in asbestos cases and to caps on painandsuffering awards in medical malpractice cases
although positive in general terms for the tobacco companies clearly this type of legislation would have been much more useful if it were passed 10 years ago

time after time the house would pass legislation limiting class action plaintiffs only to see their attempts to dismantle the class action system die either with senate inaction or in conference
mr speaker it looks as though the republican leadership has finally gamed the system to the point where it appears that they will succeed in severely limiting the rights of many of the most vulnerable citizens in this country
last year for instance the chamber spent 50 million in lobbying
now they are getting what they paid for because this bill obliterating the class action system is one of the first bills to be considered in this congress
the senate succeeded in passing a bad bill and the house is now following suit
they will not talk about how they are limiting workers rights and with the passage of this bill are encouraging the bad apples in the big business community to continue cheating their employees out of their hardearned wages and rights
in most cases state laws provide greater civil rights protections than federal law
consider for example a class action lawsuit brought against a national corporation by employees of a store in massachusetts because that store discriminates on the basis of ancestry place of birth or citizenship status
under this bill except in very rare instances that case would be sent to a federal court instead of state court even though the case is based on a violation of state law
a class action lawsuit against walmart was recently filed in massachusetts
if the class action fairness act is signed into law future cases like this would not be tried in massachusetts court but instead would be transferred to federal court
in effect this bill is rigging the system on behalf of the corporations and against the interests of workers
and this bill robs the american people of their rights to fairness and justice in the judicial system
it closes the courthouse door in the face of people who need and deserve help
mr speaker i include for the record a letter signed by 14 attorneys general including darrell mcgraw the attorney general of the state of west virginia in opposition to this bill
minority leader on behalf of the attorneys general of california illinois iowa kentucky maine maryland massachusetts minnesota new jersey new mexico new york oklahoma oregon vermont and west virginia we are writing in opposition to s 5 the socalled class action fairness act which will be debated today and is scheduled to be voted on this week
despite improvements over similar legislation considered in prior years we believe s 5 still unduly limits the right of individuals to seek redress for corporate wrongdoing in their state courts
we therefore strongly recommend that this legislation not be enacted in its present form
as you know under s 5 almost all class actions brought by private individuals in state court based on state law claims would be removed to federal court and as explained below many of these cases may not be able to continue as class actions
we are concerned with such a limitation on the availability of the class action device because particularly in these times of tightening state budgets class actions provide an important private attorney general supplement to the efforts of state attorneys general to prosecute violations of state consumer protection civil rights labor public health and environmental laws
we recognize that some class action lawsuits in both state and federal courts have resulted in only minimal benefits to class members despite the award of substantial attorneys fees
by fundamentally altering the basic principles of federalism s 5 if enacted in its present form would result in far greater harm than good
it therefore is not surprising that organizations such as aarp aflcio consumer federation of america consumers union leadership conference on civil rights naacp and public citizen all oppose this legislation in its present form
class actions should not be federalized s 5 would vastly expand federal diversity jurisdiction and thereby would result in most class actions being filed in or removed to federal court
this transfer of jurisdiction in cases raising questions of state law will inappropriately usurp the primary role of state courts in developing their own state tort and contract laws and will impair their ability to establish consistent interpretations of those laws
there is no compelling need or empirical support for such a sweeping change in our longestablished system for adjudicating state law issues
in fact by transferring most state court class actions to an already overburdened federal court system this bill will delay if not deny justice to substantial numbers of injured citizens
in some instances such actions have been brought with the attorney general acting as the class representative for the consumers of the state
many multistate class actions cannot be brought in federal court another significant problem with s 5 is that many federal courts have refused to certify multistate class actions because the court would be required to apply the laws of different jurisdictions to different plaintiffs even if the laws of those jurisdictions are very similar
thus cases commenced as state class actions and then removed to federal court may not be able to be continued as class actions in federal court
in theory injured plaintiffs in each state could bring a separate class action lawsuit in federal court but that defeats one of the main purposes of class actions which is to conserve judicial resources
this problem should be addressed by allowing federal courts to certify nationwide class actions to the full extent of their constitutional power either by applying one state s law with sufficient ties to the underlying claims in the case or by ensuring that a federal judge does not deny certification on the sole ground that the laws of more than one state would apply to the action
civil rights and labor cases should be exempted proponents of s 5 point to allegedly collusive consumer class action settlements in which plaintiffs attorneys received substantial fee awards while the class members merely received coupons towards the purchase of other goods sold by defendants
the notification provisions are misguided s 5 requires that federal and state regulators and in many cases state attorneys general be notified of proposed class action settlements and be provided with copies of the complaint class notice proposed settlement and other materials
without clear authority in the legislation to more closely examine defendants on issues bearing on the fairness of the proposed settlement particularly outofstate defendants over whom subpoena authority may in some circumstances be limited the notification provision equal access to the american system of justice is a foundation of our democracy
although we ful1y support the goal of preventing abusive class action settlements and would be willing to provide assistance in your effort to implement necessary reforms we are likewise committed to maintaining our federal system of justice and safeguarding the interests of the public
for these reasons we oppose s 5 in its present form
mr speaker my colleague from georgia had kind of quoted from a study implying that most of these classaction cases would remain in states that the whole purpose of this bill is to try to move them to federal courts
let me quote from a cbo cost estimate which says that under this bill most classaction lawsuits would be heard in federal district court rather than in the state court
one of things they point out is that nowhere has a case been made that abuses exist in antidiscrimination and wage and hour class action litigation
wage and hour class actions are most often brought in states under the law of the state in which the claim arises
at least six states and territories however including california and alaska require payment of overtime after a prescribed number of hours of work in a single day
some of these state statutes provide a broader definition of disability and a greater range of protection in comparison to the federal americans with disabilities act including california minnesota new jersey new york rhode island washington and west virginia
in addition every state has enacted a law prohibiting age discrimination in employment
some of these state laws including those in california michigan ohio and the district of columbia contain provisions affording greater protection to older workers than comparable provisions of the federal age discrimination and employment act
in addition many state laws provide protections to classifications not covered by federal law
the point of the matter here is that this legislation is basically denying people the rights and the protections that many of them have fought so hard to earn in their states and it leads to more injustice and more unfairness
the amendment is necessary in order to ensure that s 5 does not adversely impact the workplace and civil rights of ordinary americans by making it extremely difficult to enforce civil rights and labor rights
during congress extensive examination of the merits of class action lawsuits nowhere has a case been made that abuses exist in antidiscrimination and wage and hour classaction litigation
wage and hour class actions are most often brought in state courts under the law of the state in which the claims arise
at least six states and territories however including california and alaska require payment of overtime after a prescribed number of hours are worked in a single day
some of these states statutes provide a broader definition of disability and a greater range of protection in comparison to the federal americans with disabilities act including california minnesota new jersey new york rhode island washington and west virginia
in addition every state has enacted a law prohibiting age discrimination in employment and some of these state laws including those of california michigan ohio and the district of columbia contain provisions affording greater protection to older workers than comparable provisions of the federal age discrimination in employment act adea
in addition many state laws provide protections to classifications not covered by federal law
finally 31 states have enacted legislation prohibiting genetic discrimination in the workplace an important protection given the rapid increase in the ability to gather this type of information
in addition florida and illinois have enacted more limited protections against genetic discrimination
under s 5 citizens are denied the right to use their own state courts to bring class actions against corporations that violate these state wage and hour and state civil rights laws even where that corporation has hundreds of employees in that state
in light of the lack of any compelling need to sweep state wage and hour and civil rights claims into the scope of the bill we urge you to support an amendment to exempt these claims from the provisions of s 5
national association for equal opportunity in higher education
according to her medical records mrs higgins xz4006410 was in otherwise excellent health but on september 25 2004 she died of a sudden heart attack less than a month after she started taking vioxx
she was buried on the very day in september that merck took vioxx off the market
on october 28 2004 her husband monty filed a claim against merck in the superior court of new jersey atlantic city division
in an interview on 60 minutes mr higgins xz4006410 said i believe my wife would be here if merck had decided to take vioxx off the market just 1 month earlier then there is richard dickie irvin of florida who was a 53yearold former football coach and president of the athletic booster association
he went on to play in canadian league football until suffering a careerending injury
in addition to coaching he worked at a familyowned seafood shop where he was constantly moving crates of seafood
in april of 2001 mr irvin was prescribed vioxx for his football knee injury from years ago
i could read more cases involving vioxx but most people in this house mr speaker probably agree with me that merck should be held accountable if they knew about the harmful effects of vioxx
it is about people and it is about state governments and attorney generals being able to pass laws in their own states to better protect their people
well we are concerned about making sure that the plaintiffs get their day in court
and under this bill it makes it more difficult especially for lowwage workers for people who are battling discrimination to be able to have their day in court
s 5 undermines our system of federalism disrespects our state court system and clearly preempts carefully crafted state judicial processes which have been in place for decades regarding the treatment of class action lawsuits
s 5 amends the federal rules of civil procedure to grant federal district courts original diversity jurisdiction over any class action lawsuit where the amount in controversy exceeds 5 000 000 or where any plaintiff is a citizen of a different state than any defendant or in other words any class action lawsuit
the effect of s 5 on state legislatures is that state laws in the areas of consumer protection and antitrust which were passed to protect the citizens of a particular state against fraudulent or illegal activities will almost never be heard in state courts
ironically state courts whose sole purpose is to interpret state laws will be bypassed and the federal judiciary will be asked to render judgment in these cases
congress should proceed cautiously before permitting the federal government to interfere with the authority of states to set their own laws and procedures in their own courts
dear senator our organizations are opposed to the sweepingly drawn and misleadingly named class action fairness act of 2005 this bill is patently unfair to citizens harmed by toxic spills contaminated drinking water polluted air and other environmental hazards involved in class action cases based on state environmental or public health laws
s 5 would allow corporate defendants in many pollution class actions and mass tort environmental cases to remove these kinds of state environmental matters from state court to federal court placing the cases in a forum that could be more costly more timeconsuming and disadvantageous to your constituents harmed by toxic pollution
state law environmental harm cases do not belong in this legislation and we urge you to exclude such pollution cases from the class action bill
in such cases a class action lawsuit in state court based on state common law doctrines of negligence nuisance or trespass or upon rights and duties created by state statutes in the state where the injuries occur is often the best way of fairly resolving these claims
according to a may 2002 gao report 35 states reported that they find mtbe in groundwater at least 20 percent of the time they sample for it and 24 states said that they find it at least 60 percent of the time
some communities and individuals have brought or soon will bring suits to recover damages for mtbe contamination and hold the polluters accountable but under this bill mtbe class actions or mass actions based on state law could be removed to federal court by the oil and gas companies in many of these cases
this could not only make these cases more expensive more timeconsuming and more difficult for injured parties but could also result in the dismissal of legitimate cases by federal judges who are unfamiliar with or less respectful of statelaw claims
for example in at least one mtbe class action a federal court dismissed the case based on oil companies claims that the action was barred by the federal clean air act even though that law contains no tort liability waiver for mtbe
other examples of statelaw in a letter to the senate last year the us judicial conference expressed their continued opposition to such broadly written class action removal legislation
notably their letter states that even if congress determines that some significant multistate class actions should be brought within the removal jurisdiction of the federal courts congress should include certain limitations and exceptions including for class actions in which plaintiff class members suffered personal injury or personal property damage within the state as in the case of a serious environmental disaster the judicial conference s letter explains that this environmental harm exception should apply to all individuals who suffered personal injuries or losses to physical property whether or not they were citizens of the state in question we agree with the judicial conference that cases involving environmental harm are not even close to the type of cases that proponents of s 5 cite when they call for reforms to the class action system
including such cases in the bill penalizes injured parties in those cases for no reason other than to benefit the polluters
no rationale has been offered by the bill s supporters for including environmental cases in s 5 s provisions
for example the bill would apply to cases similar to the recently concluded statecourt trial in anniston alabama where a jury awarded damages to be paid by monsanto and solutia for injuring more than 3 500 people that the jury found had been exposed over many years with the companies knowledge to cancercausing pcbs
there is little doubt in the anniston case that had s 5 been law the defendants would have tried to remove the case from the state court that serves the community that suffered this devastating harm
even in the bestcase scenario s 5 would put plaintiffs like those in anniston in the position of having to fight costly and timeconsuming court battles in order to preserve their chosen forum for litigating their claims
in any case it would reward the kind of reckless corporate misbehavior demonstrated by monsanto and solutia by giving defendants in such cases the right to remove statelaw cases to federal court over the objections of those they have injured
mr speaker i rise in opposition to s 5 the socalled class action fairness act
few of us would stand here and argue that there is too much accountability in corporate america today
in recent years millions of our constituents have been swindled out of their retirement savings by corporate crooks at enron worldcom and other companies
and no industry is in a better position to benefit than the tobacco industry
the senate just passed a bill 7226 which is designed to funnel classaction suits with plaintiffs in different states out of state courts and into the federal court system which is typically much less sympathetic to such litigation
mr speaker i thank the gentleman for yielding me time even though i am in opposition to his position and favor this bill
in fact it is a reasonable compromise designed to address what is an abuse of the judicial system
in fact democratic senators representing 19 states voted for this bill in the other body
because they believe on balance that consumers are going to be better represented in federal courts
even recently in the home depot case a genderdiscrimination case it was settled with a 65 million settlement filed in federal court
the cocacola racialdiscrimination settlement which guaranteed each class member recovery of at least 38 000 was achieved in federal court
contrast that to the bank of boston case where the depositors in boston were not even aware they were members of a plaintiff class where a lawyer filed suit down in alabama supposedly representing their interest and they found out when they had their bank account reduced by 90 90 was taken out of the mortgage escrow account from these depositors to pay the lawyers when they were not even aware they were a member of the plaintiff s suit and the lawyer walks off with 825 million
the fact is that in so many state and local courts they do not have the resources to go through the mountains of evidence that have to be presented in class action suits
in federal courts they are far more likely to have those resources
i rise in strong opposition to this egregious legislation and in support of the conyersnadlerjacksonlee substitute amendment
this substitute amendment amends this bill in several ways to ensure that consumers workers and victims in personal injury cases are not precluded from having a fair opportunity to present their cases in court
my good friend eliot spitzer the distinguished attorney general of new york state has joined 46 state attorneys general in expressing their concern that this legislation could limit their power to investigate and bring actions in their state courts against defendants who have caused harm to their citizen
the substitute provides that when such a gag order is requested and it is normally requested by both the plaintiff and the defendant because in the settlement the defendant insists on this as a condition of the settlement the court then rubber stamps it
this substitute provides that if such a gag order is requested the court must make a finding as to whether the defendant s interest in confidentiality outweighs the public interest in knowing of the threat to its health or safety
if the court finds the public interest in health and safety outweighs the privacy interest claimed in the specific case the court must prohibit the sealing of the information
i urge my colleagues not to allow this bill to completely deny victims their day in court either in state court or in federal court
mr speaker i rise in strong opposition to this legislation
the republican agenda is to ensure that some americans do not get their day in court
when americans are injured or even killed by vioxx or celebrex or discriminated against by walmart they may never get their day in court
we saw that in the prescription drug bill under medicare
in fact 46 state attorneys general on a bipartisan basis have requested an exemption so that they can continue to protect their citizens under the state consumer protection laws in state courts
democrats in our substitute support sensible approaches that weed out frivolous lawsuits but not meritorious claims
our democratic substitute says that certain kinds of cases must always have their day in court
mr speaker i rise in opposition to s 5
this bill erects a nearly insurmountable barrier for everyday americans who have been hurt or wronged to have their day in court
it does not matter if the laws of their home state provide better civil rights protections or that it may be more convenient for the victims of discrimination to seek justice in a court where they live
with s 5 they too must bring their claims to a federal court that may not even be in their state just so that they can get the back pay that they do
this bill makes about as much sense as locking the door of a hospital in order to lower health care costs
for example if a person at a checkout counter calibrates the machine to just cheat one out of a few cents what is one s recovery in that case
but they would suggest there is no point in bringing the class action as long as they did not rip them off for too much they ought to get away with it
furthermore a lot of these coupon settlements are in federal courts anyway so there is not going to be much change
but some of these coupon cases are the only way that we can rein in corporate abuse
but this bill just increases complications in a gratuitous way
in normal cases they file it in state court
they may never get their day in court
so the fact that they did not certify a class action will deny one the right to even have their day in court
it could be that an injury happens in one state they have corporations in that state involved they have state plaintiffs and here one has to go chasing around trying to figure out where they are going to be
the attorneys general across the states 47 attorneys general in states and territories have come out against the bill because it puts the attorneys general in the same crack
if they bring a state action in state court they may get removed
some of the states have better wage laws civil rights laws sometimes consumer protections and if the attorneys general want to come in to protect their own citizens in their own states they ought to have that right and not get jerked around to federal court
some in the same area the state courts are more clogged up than the federal courts
and in some cases where we have some terrorist cases or a backlog of federal cases one may never get to hear their case in federal court
mr speaker i rise in support of the substitute
the main thing it does is it carves out many of the different cases that belong in state court or at least ought to have the opportunity in the state court
it also fixes the yoyo effect where you start off in state court get removed to federal court federal court does not certify the class and then what happens
you may end up in a procedural trap where you have lost your case just in the time it takes to get over there and try to get back
mass torts where you have not class actions per se but a lot of different litigants all in the same state
it fixes the problem with attorneys general in bringing a case in state court on behalf of not only members of their state but if the injury has occurred to a lot of other people the attorney general might want to bring that case
it also denies benefits under the bill for tax traitors those who move their corporate headquarters off shore to avoid corporate taxes and it also provides a limitation on sealed settlements that the gentleman from new york mr nadler xz4002890 has been very active in making sure that cases that are settled can not be sealed beyond public view unless if such a sealing would violate public health or other important considerations
it eliminates many but not all of the problems in the underlying bill and i would hope that the house would adopt the substitute
we take no position on the act as a general matter and indeed there are differing views among us on the policy judgments reflected in the act
we join together however in a bipartisan request for support of senator mark pryor s potential amendment to s 5 or any similar legislation clarifying that the act does not apply to and would have no effect on actions brought by any state attorney general on behalf of his or her respective state or its citizens
in some instances such actions have been brought with the attorney general acting as the class representative for the consumers of the state
the attorneys general have been very successful in litigation initiated to protect the rights of our consumers
for example in the pharmaceutical industry the states have recently brought enforcement actions on behalf of consumers against large often foreignowned drug companies for overcharges and market manipulations that illegally raised the costs of certain prescription drugs
such cases have resulted in recoveries of approximately 235 million dollars the majority of which is earmarked for consumer restitution
in several instances the states recoveries provided one hundred percent reimbursement directly to individual consumers of the overcharges they suffered as a result of the illegal activities of the defendants
madam speaker i rise in strong support of s 5 the class action fairness act of 2005
we stand on the cusp of sending landmark legislation on civiljustice reform to the president that has been approved by increasing majorities each time it has been considered by the house in each of the last three congresses and which passed the other body last week with an overwhelming majority of 72 votes
a major element of the worsening crisis is the exponential increase in state class action cases in a handful of magnet or magic jurisdictions many of which deal with national issues in classes
in the last 10 years state court class actions filings nationwide have increased over 1 315 percent
the infamous handful of magnet courts known for certifying even the most speculative class action suits the increase in filings now exceeds 5 000 percent
the only explanation for this phenomenon is aggressive forum shopping by trial lawyers to find courts and judges who will act as willing accomplices in a judicial power grab hearing nationwide cases and setting policy for the entire country
the present rules encourage a race to any available state courthouse in the hopes of a rubberstamped nationwide settlement that produces millions in attorney s fees for the winning plaintiff s attorney
the losers in this race are the victims who often gain little or nothing through the settlement yet are bound by it in perpetuity
the bill before the house today offers commonsense procedural changes that will end the most serious abuses by allowing more interstate class actions to be heard in federal courts while keeping truly local cases in state courts
its core provisions are similar to those passed by this body in the last three congresses
s 5 also implements a consumer bill of rights that will keep class members from being used by the lawyers they never hired to engage in litigation they do not know about or to extort money they will never see
madam speaker when the house considered this important reform in the last congress i remarked that the class action judicial system has become a joke and no one is laughing except the trial lawyers
all the way to the bank i imagine that laughter turned to nervous chuckles when s 5 emerged unscathed from the gauntlet in the other body with 72 votes last week
today as the house prepares to pass this bill i suspect you could hear a pin drop in the halls of infamous courthouses located in madison county illinois and jefferson county texas where for so long the good times have rolled for forumshopping plaintiffs attorneys and the judges who enable them
we do not have the time in general debate for me to give this statement on the floor so i will insert the statement relative to the intent of the managers of the bill in the record at this point
madam speaker i would like to provide a brief summary of the provisions in sections 4 and 5 of s 5 the class action fairness act of 2005
section 4 gives federal courts jurisdiction over class action lawsuits in which the aggregate amount in controversy exceeds 5 million and at least one plaintiff and one defendant are diverse
its provisions should be read broadly with a strong preference that interstate class actions should be heard in a federal court if removed by any defendant
and if a federal court is uncertain about whether the 5 million threshold is satisfied the court should err in favor of exercising jurisdiction over the case
the sponsors intend that in a case seeking injunctive relief a matter be subject to federal jurisdiction under this provision if the value of the matter in litigation exceeds 5 million either from the viewpoint of the plaintiff or the defendant and regardless of the type of relief sought eg damages injunctive relief or declaratory relief
similarly in assessing the jurisdictional amount in declaratory relief cases the federal court should include in its assessment the value of all relief and benefits that would logically flow from granting the declaratory relief sought by the claimants
for example a declaration that a defendant s conduct is unlawful or fraudulent will carry certain consequences such as the need to cease and desist from that conduct that will often cost the defendant in excess new subsections 1332 d 3 and d 4 b address the jurisdictional principles that will apply to class actions filed against a defendant in its home state dividing such cases into three categories
first for cases in which twothirds or more of the members of the plaintiff class and the primary defendants are citizens of the state in which the suit was filed subsection 1332 d 4 b states that such cases will remain in state court
second cases in which more than twothirds of the members of the plaintiff class or one or more of the primary defendants are not citizens of the forum state will be subject to federal jurisdiction since such cases are predominantly interstate in nature
finally there is a middle category of class actions in which more than onethird but fewer than twothirds of the members of the plaintiff class and the primary defendants are all citizens first the court should consider whether the claims asserted are of significant national or interstate interest under this factor if a case presents issues of national or interstate significance that argues in favor of the matter being handled in federal court
under this factor if the federal court determines that multiple state laws will apply to aspects of the class action that determination would favor having the matter heard in the federal court system which has a record of being more respectful of the laws of the various states in the class action context
the third factor is whether the class action has been pleaded in a manner that seeks to avoid federal jurisdiction
the purpose of this inquiry is to determine whether the plaintiffs have proposed a natural class that encompasses all of the people and claims that one would expect to include in a class action as opposed to proposing a class that appears to be gerrymandered solely to avoid federal jurisdiction by leaving out certain potential class members or claims
if the federal court concludes evasive pleading is involved that factor would favor the exercise of the fifth factor asks whether the number of citizens of the forum state in the proposed plaintiff class es is substantially larger than the number of citizens from any other state and the citizenship of the other members of the proposed class es is dispersed among a substantial number of states
if all of the class members who do not reside in the state where the action was filed are widely dispersed among many other states that point would suggest that the interests of the forum state in litigating the controversy are preeminent
finally the sixth factor is whether one or more class actions asserting the same or similar claims on behalf of the same or other persons have been filed in the last three years
if other class actions on new subsection 1332 d 4 a is the local controversy exception this subsection prohibits federal courts from exercising diversity jurisdiction over a class action under the foregoing provisions if the plaintiffs clearly demonstrate that each and every one of the following criteria are satisfied in the case at issue
third the principal injuries resulting from the alleged conduct or related conduct of each defendant were incurred in the state where the action was originally filed
this provision is intended to respond to concerns that class actions with a truly local focus should not be moved to federal court under this legislation because state courts have a strong interest in adjudicating such disputes
thus in assessing whether each of these criteria is satisfied by a particular case a federal court should bear in mind that the purpose of each of these criteria is to identify a truly local controversy a controversy that uniquely affects a particular locality to the exclusion of all others
similarly the third criterion is that the principal injuries resulting from the actions of all the defendants must have occurred in the state where the suit was filed
rather the inquiry is whether similar factual allegations have been made against the defendant in multiple class actions regardless of whether the same causes of actions were asserted or whether the purported plaintiff classes were the same or even overlapped in significant respects
new subsections 1332 d 5 a and b specify that s 5 does not extend federal diversity jurisdiction to class actions in which a the primary defendants are states state officials or other governmental entities against whom the district court may be foreclosed from ordering relief or b the number of members of all proposed plaintiff classes in the aggregate is fewer than 100 class members
in particular plaintiffs should not be permitted to name state entities as defendants as a mechanism to avoid federal jurisdiction over class actions that largely target nongovernmental defendants
the sponsors understand that in assessing the various criteria established in all of these new jurisdictional provisions a federal court may have to engage in some factfinding not unlike what is necessitated by the existing jurisdictional statutes
the sponsors further understand that in some instances limited discovery may be necessary to make these determinations
the purpose of this provision is to avoid disturbing in any way the federal vs
state court jurisdictional lines already drawn in the securities litigation class action context by the enactment of the securities litigation uniform standards act of 1998
under subsection 1332 d 11 any civil action in which 100 or more named parties seek to try their claims for monetary relief together will be treated as a class action for jurisdictional purposes
the sponsors wish to stress that a complaint in which 100 or more plaintiffs are named fits the criteria of seeking to try their claims together because there would be no other apparent reason to include all of those claimants in a single action unless the intent was to secure a joint trial of the claims asserted in the action
the sponsors also wish to stress that this provision is when all the claims asserted in the action arise out of an event or occurrence in the state where the suit is filed and the injuries were incurred in that state and contiguous states eg a toxic spill case and 2 when the claims are asserted on behalf of the general public and not on behalf of individual claimants or members of a purported class pursuant to a state statute specifically authorizing such an action
the purpose of this exception is to allow cases involving environmental torts such as a chemical spill to remain in state court if both the event and the injuries were truly local even though there are some outofstate defendants
subsection 1332 d 11 b i includes a statement indicating that jurisdiction exists only over those plaintiffs whose claims in a mass action satisfy the jurisdictional amount requirements under section 1332 a
the sponsors wish to make clear that this restriction on mdl transfers applies only to mass actions as defined in subsection 1332 d 11 the legislation does not more broadly restrict the authority of the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation to transfer class actions removed to federal court under this legislation
under subsection 1332 d 11 d the statute of limitations for any claims that are part of a mass action will be tolled while the mass action is pending in federal court
the removal provisions in section 5 of the legislation are selfexplanatory and attempt to put an end to the type of gaming engaged in by plaintiffs lawyers to keep cases in state court
they should thus be interpreted with this intent in mind
in addition new subsection 1453 c provides that an order remanding a class action to state court is reviewable by appeal at the discretion of the reviewing court
madam speaker for purposes of engaging in a colloquy with the two gentlemen from virginia mr goodlatte xz4001540 and mr boucher xz4000430 i yield to the gentleman from virginia mr goodlatte xz4001540
section 4 of the bill gives federal courts jurisdiction over class action lawsuits in which the matter in controversy exceeds the sum or value of 5 million excluding interests and costs and at least one proposed class member and one defendant are citizens of different states or countries
madam speaker reclaiming my time under new subsection 1332 d 6 the claims of the individual class members in any class action shall be aggregated to determine whether the amount in controversy exceeds the sum or value of 5 million
by the same token if a federal court is uncertain about whether a case puts 5 million or more in controversy the court should favor exercising jurisdiction over the case
the sponsors intend that a matter be subject to federal jurisdiction under this provision if the value of the matter in litigation exceeds the 5 million either from the viewpoint of the plaintiff or the viewpoint of the defendant regardless of the type of relief sought such as damages injunctive relief or declaratory relief
the sponsors are aware that some courts especially in the class action context have declined to exercise federal jurisdiction over cases on the grounds that the amount in controversy in those cases exceeded the jurisdictional threshold only when assessed from the viewpoint of the defendant
for example a class action seeking injunctive relief that would require a defendant to restructure its business in some fundamental way might cost a defendant well in excess of 75 000 under current law but might have substantially less value to each plaintiff or even to the class of plaintiffs as a whole
because s 5 explicitly allows aggregation for the purposes of determining the amount of controversy in class actions that concern is no longer relevant
to the extent plaintiffs seek to avoid this rule by framing their cases as individual actions for injunctive relief most federal courts have properly held that in an individual case the cost of injunctive relief is viewed from the defendant s perspective
the same approach would apply in a case involving declaratory relief
in determining how much money a declaratory relief case puts in controversy the federal court should include in its assessment the value of all relief and benefits that would logically flow from the granting of the declaratory relief sought by the plaintiffs
for example a declaration that a defendant s conduct is unlawful or fraudulent will carry certain consequences such as the need to cease and desist from that conduct that will often cost the defendant in excess of 5 million or a declaration that a standardized product sold throughout the nation is defective might well put a case over the 5 million threshold even if the class complaint did not affirmatively seek a determination that each class member was injured by the product
this provision should be read broadly with a strong preference that interstate class actions should be heard in a federal court if properly removed by a defendant
under this factor if a case presents issues of national or interstate significance that argues in favor of the matter being handled in federal court for example if a class action alleges a nationally distributed pharmaceutical product caused side effects those cases presumably should be heard in federal court because of the nationwide ramifications of the dispute and the potential interface with federal drug laws
the sponsors believe that one of the significant problems posed by multistate class actions in state court is the tendency of some state courts to be less than respectful of the laws of other jurisdictions applying the law of one state to an entire nationwide controversy and thereby ignoring the distinct and varying state laws that should apply to various claims included in the class depending upon where they arose
under this factor if the federal court determines that multiple state laws will apply to aspects of the class action the determination would favor having the matter handled in the federal court system which has a record of being more respectful of the laws of various states in the class action controversy
conversely if the court concludes that the laws of the state to which the action was filed will apply to the entire controversy that factor will favor keeping the case in state court
the third factor is whether the class action has been pleaded in a manner that seeks to avoid federal jurisdiction
the purpose of this inquiry is to determine whether the plaintiffs have proposed a natural class a class that encompasses all the people and claims that one would expect to include in a class action as opposed to proposing a class that appears to be gerrymandered solely to avoid federal jurisdiction by leaving out certain potential class members or claims
this factor is intended to take account of a major concern that led to this legislation the filing of lawsuits in the outoftheway magnet state courts that have no real relationship to the controversy at hand
thus if a majority of the proposed class action members and the defendants reside in the county where the suit is brought the court might find a distinct nexus exists
if the allegedly injured parties live in many other localities the nexus is not distinct and this factor would weigh heavily in favor of the exercise of federal jurisdiction over the matter
the fifth factor is whether the number of citizens in the forum state in the proposed plaintiff class is substantially larger than the number of citizens from any other state and the citizens of the other members of the proposed class is dispersed among a substantial number of states
this factor is intended to look at the geographic distribution of class members in an effort to determine the forum state s interest in handling the litigation
if all of the outofstate class members are widely dispersed among many other states that point would suggest that the interest of the forum state in litigating the controversy are preeminent
the sponsors intend that such a conclusion would favor allowing the state court in which the action was originally filed to handle the litigation
however if a court finds that the citizenship of the other class members is not widely dispersed then a federal forum would be more appropriate because several states other than the forum state would have a strong interest in the controversy
the final factor is whether one or more class actions asserting the same or similar claims on behalf of the same or other persons have been filed in the last 3 years
madam speaker i now yield to my colleague the gentleman from virginia mr boucher xz4000430 to provide some examples that illustrate how these six factors would work in litigation
madam speaker reclaiming my time yes this provision is intended to respond to concerns that class actions with a truly local focus should not be moved to federal court under this legislation because state courts have a strong interest in adjudicating such disputes
for example in a consumer fraud case alleging that an insurance company incorporated and based in another state misrepresented its policies the local agent of the company named as a defendant presumably would not fit this criteria
and from a relief standpoint the real demand of the full class in terms of seeking significant relief would be on the insurance company itself
third the principal injuries resulting from the actions of all the defendants must have occurred in the state where the suit was filed
this criterion means that all or almost all of the damage caused by the defendants conduct occurred in the state where the suit was brought
if defendants engaged in conduct that allegedly injured consumers throughout the country the case would not qualify for the local controversy exception even if it was only brought as a single state class action
in other words if we are talking about a situation that results in multiple class actions those are not the types of cases that this exception is intended to address
rather the inquiry is whether similar factual allegations have been made against the defendant in multiple class actions regardless of whether the same causes of action were asserted or whether the proposed plaintiff classes in the prior case was the same
the mass action provision was included in the bill because mass actions are really class actions in disguise
they involve an element of people who want their claims adjudicated together and they often result in the same abuses as class actions
in fact sometimes the abuses are even worse because the lawyers seek to join claims that have little to do with each other and confuse a jury into awarding millions of dollars to individuals who have suffered no real injury
here is how the mass action provision and the current amountincontroversy provision would work in tandem suppose 200 people file a mass action in mississippi against a new jersey drug manufacturer and also name a local drug store
the federal court would have jurisdiction over the mass action because there are more than 100 plaintiffs there is minimal diversity and the total amount of controversy exceeds 5 million and a product liability case does not qualify for the local occurrence exception in the provision
then the question becomes which claims would in the mass action the federal judge keep in federal court and which would be remanded
in this regard i would note that the plaintiffs often seek to minimize what they are seeking in the complaint so that they can stay in state court
if it is likely that a plaintiff is going to turn around in a month and add an additional claim for punitive damages the federal court should obviously assert jurisdiction over that individual s claims
finally i would like to stress that this provision in no way is intended to abrogate 8 united states code 3867 to narrow current jurisdictional rules
thus if a federal court believed it to be appropriate the court could apply supplemental jurisdiction in the mass action context as well
thus the first exception would apply only in a situation where we are talking about a truly local single event with no substantial interstate effects
the purpose of this exception is to allow cases involving environmental torts such as a chemical spill to remain in state court if both the event and the injuries were truly local even though there are some outofstate defendants
the sale of a product to different people does not qualify as an event and the alleged injuries in such a case would be spread out over more than one state or contiguous states even if all of the plaintiffs in a particular case came from one single state
however if the plaintiff files an amended complaint in state court that creates jurisdiction or if subsequent events create jurisdiction the defendant can then remove the case to federal court
thus for example changes in the amount of controversy after the complaint has been removed would not subject a lawsuit to be remanded to state court
mr speaker notwithstanding what we have heard from opponents of this legislation its passage would not extinguish the legal right of any injured party whether it be a class action a mass action or an individual lawsuit from proceeding in a court of competent jurisdiction in the united states
i was particularly perturbed listening to the gentleman from massachusetts mr markey xz4002530 who said that the kids who start smoking at 13 and 14 years old are going to be denied their day in court and that the tobacco companies are going to end up cashing in on a big bonanza
now if this was the bonanza to investors in altria the stock would not be going down
mr speaker pursuant to the rule i claim the time in opposition
mr speaker i rise in opposition to the democratic substitute amendment and urge my colleagues to reject it
the new math behind the substitute amendment rests on the following arithmetic if you add a number of amendments rejected by large bipartisan majorities in the other body last week and combine them with the amendment ideas overwhelmingly rejected on the house floor by a bipartisan vote last year the sum will somehow equal a credible solution
the american consumers and businesses will be left with change in their pockets if the amendment passes
the pages of findings discuss abusive class action windfall settlements for trial attorneys forum shopping and the need for more of these large interstate class action cases to be in federal court
one element of the substitute amendment is the state attorney general provision allowing any class action to be brought by or on behalf of the state attorney general to be in state court
this provision is unnecessary because when state attorneys general sue on behalf of their citizens those actions are almost always parens patriae actions and not class actions and the former will be in no way affected by this bill
for these reasons the pryor amendment in the other body that this provision copies verbatim failed to garner even 40 votes on the senate floor last week
this provision would not only eviscerate the bill but also would overturn 70 years of established supreme court precedent and would export to federal courts a primary expedient of class action abuse we seek to remedy the reckless application by local courts of the law of one state to the entire nation in large interstate cases
this provision seeks to keep all class actions involving alleged civil rights and labor law violations in state court despite the fact that the most generous racial discrimination and employment class action settlements in recent years have been in the federal courts
the language was also offered in the other body and rejected
other major elements of the substitute include one our colleagues might remember as the jacksonlee house floor amendment to the bill in the last congress
this is at least an admission that going into certain state courts as a defendant is indeed punishment and that amendment was defeated in this house by the last congress by a vote of 183 to 238
there is also a loophole creating a provision on mass actions and a completely unnecessary public disclosure provision both based on senate amendments in the other body that were offered and withdrawn
since there is not a single original idea among the provisions that has not already been debated and defeated either in this house or the other body it is hard to give credence to such complaints
finally mr speaker a vote on this substitute is clearly just a vote to further deny or delay meaningful class action reform and a vote on the substitute could not in any way be construed as reform of any kind but rather support for the triallawyerdominated status quo
mr speaker the amendment in the nature of a substitute completely guts this bill
every crippling amendment that was rejected either in this house or the other body in this congress or the previous congress is incorporated in this amendment
the issue in this bill is very clear and that is that we have to restore some sanity to the civil justice system by dealing with the abuses that a small group of lawyers have turned the class action system into
what has happened as a result of the abuse of the class action system is that judges in small outoftheway counties like madison county illinois and jefferson county texas end up being the ultimate arbiters of interstate commerce
mr speaker i rise in support of s 5 the class action fairness act
currently plaintiffs lawyers take advantage of the system by bringing large national lawsuits in specific jurisdictions with relaxed certification criteria
attorneys are increasingly filing interstate class actions in state courts mostly in what are known as magnet jurisdictions
courts in these jurisdictions are attractive to lawyers because they routinely approve settlements in which attorneys receive large fees and the class members receive virtually nothing and they also decide the claims of other state s citizens under the court s state law
this results in more and more class actions being losing propositions for everyone involved except for the lawyers who brought them
the class action fairness act works to improve our legal system by allowing larger interstate class action cases to be heard in federal courts closing the magnet jurisdiction loophole
currently plaintiffs lawyers can name a local business in a nationwide liability suit to stay out of federal court
allowing judges to limit attorney s fees when the value of the settlement received by the class member is small in comparison and banning settlements that award some class members more simply because they live closer to the court will make class action suits more fair and help compensate the people who were wronged not the attorney s handling their case
the class action fairness act is a bipartisan sensible bill that clarifies the rights of consumers and restores confidence in america s judicial system
we have all heard of the lawsuits in which plaintiffs walk away with pennies sometimes literally while the attorneys walk away with millions of dollars in fees
moving more class actions to federal courts also prevents one of the worst problems in class actions today forum shopping
it s not fixing inequities in our judicial system
it is truthful lawabiding citizens who will lose if this bill becomes law apparently in america today we have government for by and of corporate interests and not the people
mr speaker the house has considered similar legislation in 1999 2002 and 2003
on each of those occasions i voted no not because i was unalterably opposed to congress acting on this subject but because in my judgment the defects of those bills outweighed their potential benefits
it would have added important protections for the public s right to know about the proceedings in our courts
that conclusion is reluctant because in several ways this bill is better or more accurately less bad than its predecessors
and in several other ways it differs for the better from previous versions
however while the bill is less bad in my opinion it still is not good enough
i remain unconvinced that the problem the bill purports to address is so great as to require such a sweeping remedy and i am still concerned that in too many cases the sideeffects of this treatment will be more severe than the disease
and when a complaint arises under a state law it is both appropriate and desirable that it be heard in state court because those are the most convenient and with the best understanding of state laws and local conditions
mr speaker i rise in opposition to s 5 the class action fairness act
there appear to be improvements in this bill from the bill we considered last congress yet there could and should be more improvements
i can guarantee my colleagues having practiced law for over 20 years that the core provisions of this bill will invite prolonged satellite litigation into illdefined or undefined terms in this bill clogging the federal courts and denying prompt justice to worthy claimants
also and worse in my judgment no longer will a coherent description of the class be sufficient before the trial on the merit proceeds
there are other examples too complicated to address here in the time that we have available
but let me just say that juxtaposed against the smattering of cases paraded by the supporters of this bill as justification for this upheaval in our justice system are countless class action lawsuits by principled attorneys and courageous plaintiffs that have exposed deliberate wrongdoing obtained justice for american citizens and vindicated the values of fair play and equal justice that define our society
under this bill one bad judge we condemn all of the judges in the system
in some of our states the federal courts are far removed from the places where individual litigants live
and what is it with the notion all of a sudden that my states rights friends believe that the federal courts and the federal government can solve every problem in our society
sometimes during these debates i like to step in to take a perspective of someone on the committee who is not a lawyer but i have to tell my colleagues the previous speaker the gentleman from virginia went to great lengths to talk about the lawyers fees
there is nothing in this bill that limits lawyers fees and there is not anything in the bill actually that argues for his point which is apparently that there should be a minimum amount that wrongdoers pay to each individual aggrieved person which is a novel argument i have not heard it made by my colleague before saying that the plaintiffs are receiving too little now
in those cases those parties each and every one of them on the wheel of rhetoric actually was found by a judge or a jury to have done substantial bad things to the community
the system actually worked in those cases
i stand perfectly ready to vote in favor of an amendment by the gentleman from virginia to have minimum payments to people who have been harmed
i am sorry to say that there are some and i wish we would address some of them in this legislation which of course we do not but frankly to stand before the wheel of rhetoric which really is a wheel of bad doers who got caught by the justice system which we are trying to dismantle here today and say this is evidence that the system does not work is entirely the opposite of the truth unless my colleagues believe that a jury of people s peers can not make these informed decisions that we are the only people brilliant enough to make these decisions
i love these small government types who believe we have better judgment on these things than 12 men and women in a community then we have to believe that the system in those cases worked
mr speaker i thank the gentleman very much for yielding me this additional time and i am surprised that such an able lawyer would be unwilling to engage in a debate on his time but i will take 30 seconds simply to rebut what the gentleman said
in every one of those cases on the wheel of rhetoric that the gentleman put up those that were found guilty those who were found to be responsible those who were found to be culpable of doing harmful things to our community admitted it paid a fine paid a penalty that was approved by a judge and that is the fact that the gentleman took cases of people who admitted with their actions there was wrongdoing involved
mr speaker i rise today in strong opposition to the socalled class action fairness act i have strong objections to not only to the text of the bill itself but also to the very process by which it was strongarmed by the republican leadership past the judiciary committee
this process did not allow any opportunity for committee members to raise our objections or to work constructively to fix the major problems in this legislation
this circumvention of regular order is being sold to us with a myriad of excuses one of them is that the bill is a simple procedural fix for a judicial crisis with nothing controversial in it
this bill is a federal mandate to undermine and all but kill the ability to raise class actions cases in state courts
moving these cases to federal court will make litigation more costly more timeconsuming and less likely that victims can get their rightful day in court at all
mr speaker i urge my colleagues to join me in opposing one of the most destructive and far reaching civil justice measures ever considered by this body
today however the system has become a playground for personal injury trial lawyers as they file sham abusive cases in lawsuitfriendly counties
recently a large national video rental chain after being named in 23 classaction lawsuits agreed to provide consumers in the lawsuit with dollar coupons and attorneys in this case received over 9 million
even more outrageous is the case where consumers were awarded 33 cents each in a settlement with a wellknown national bank not even enough to buy a stamp while attorneys in the case walked away with 4 million
mr speaker we have all received the class action settlement notices in our mail boxes i know i have not even realizing we were part of a class action lawsuit nor ever asking to be part of the lawsuit
but due to the interpretations of the laws state courts have had to bear the brunt of class action lawsuits in this country
why are we seeing so many people saying that we have our priorities in the wrong place
to pay for these tax cuts that are going principally to the wealthiest americans in this country
even with that being done using all the social security surplus moneys we still have deficits never seen before in this country
that is more than 1 000 on the head of each and every man and woman in this country
mr speaker many of us believe that we should have a plan as the salazar legislation would propose that we save every single cent of the social security surplus which this year alone the surplus in social security contributions that will not be needed to spend for benefits to social security recipients will equal 169 billion
we can start by saying that 169 billion of social security moneys will not be spent because this budget spends every single cent of the 169 billion coming in this year for social security on something other than social security
do you mean in the future perhaps if we do nt do something to make it stronger it wo nt be guaranteed
we know it could end up costing some 46 percent in benefit cuts if we privatize
mr speaker it is time for us in our budget documents to speak to the people to give them the facts
mr speaker i rise in support of the rule and the budget resolution
i actually worked in one in helping low income students with their transition to college
vocational ed programs offer many high school students the motivation to work hard in all of their classes and provide job skills who do not go on to college
medicaid funds are very important also to all west virginians particularly low income west virginians and i urge my colleagues to avoid cuts to medicaid as the reconciliation instructions found in this resolution are implemented
mr speaker i rise in strong support of this rule
as members of the committee on rules they are also serving in the very important capacity on the committee on the budget where they have played a key role in fashioning this work product that we are going to see
i am happy this rule has been able to report out every single substitute that was submitted to the committee on rules calling for an opportunity to be considered here in the house
i am also happy we have been able to include an additional amendment which is unusual in that as members know from the perspective of both sides of the aisle when democrats were in the majority here republicans in the majority we have traditionally only made substitutes in order
but out of deference to the distinguished ranking minority member of the committee on appropriations we have chosen to make in order an amendment offered by the gentleman from wisconsin mr obey xz4003000
i know the gentlewoman from new york ms slaughter xz4003780 as we proceeded with questions in the committee on rules talked about the gentlewoman s concern over things like tax cuts
i know in the eyes of many people it is counterintuitive in a sense that if we reduce tax rates we can somehow increase the flow of revenues to the federal treasury and reduce the size of the federal deficit
one of the points that i think is important for us to make and i mentioned this yesterday in the committee on rules the director of the office of management and budget joshua bolton has on more than a few occasions reminded me and i am sure he has said this to other groups that if we did not have the tragic attack on september 11 against our nation september 11 2001 if we did not have the horrendous cost of the war in iraq with which we have had to contend we would still have a federal deficit
we often hear during this debate that we saw under president clinton a dramatic improvement in the budget and a surplus created
it was during the leadership provided by a republican congress that we got to that point but the issue that needs to be brought to the forefront was that it was the economic slowdown not the attack of september 11 not the war in iraq as painful as that has been that led to the deficit itself
the recession the slowdown that we saw in early 2001 of course exacerbated as is regularly said by the attacks of september 11 by the corporate scandals we have seen and the other challenges we have had to contend but that economic slowdown is what led to the deficit itself
that is not to say we should not be reining in federal spending
if we can couple focusing on economic growth with responsibly reining in federal spending it is very clear that is the most effective way to deal with the deficit
when we had the debates in 2001 and then in 2002 and 2003 and 2004 on the issue of tax cuts we constantly heard the argument from our very distinguished friends on the other side of the aisle that the bush tax cut would ruin the country
that reduction in the anticipated level of the federal deficit demonstrates that reducing rates is in fact the best way for us to deal with this
mr speaker i happen to believe a democrat john f kennedy was absolutely right when he argued this in the early part of the 1960s
we saw dramatic economic growth as president kennedy brought about a dramatic reduction on capital gains in the early 1960s
it is a responsible budget which will rein in the kind of profligate federal spending that we have seen in the past and which we know is very easy to engage in regardless of political party
under republican leadership we are reining in that growth in federal spending and at the same time we are focused on very important priorities
last night in a speech the president gave to an event we had he talked about the importance of an ownership society how homeownership is at an alltime high
one of the things we want to do we want to make sure that younger workers have an opportunity to have confidence in the social security system
we know in 13 very short years more will be going out of social security than is coming into social security through the fica taxes
i think the rule itself is one which is modeled after the rules that our friends when they were in the majority put together for consideration of the budget
secondly the president said i have not laid out a plan yet intentionally i have laid out principles but they have also had briefings and endorsed plans and called them a good blueprint and the impact would mean it would mean there would be a deduction from social security benefits of 70 to 100 percent what would be in private accounts
what it also means is that there would be a mammoth cut in benefits under social security worse and worse the younger you were 152 000 for a younger worker over their lifetime
because it would be under a government managed account and most workers would have to annuitize what was left in their private accounts and there would be nothing to pass on
it is a moral compass for what we stand for what we believe in
it shows if our priorities are in the right place
it shows whether we are going to provide for the less fortunate or if we will continue to reward the rich and the powerful at the expense of people in need
that agenda includes protecting tax breaks for the very wealthy in this country
they want to slash guaranteed benefits run up trillions of dollars in debt and decrease the solvency of the trust fund
so far we have not seen that courage because the budget resolution before us does not include the trillions of dollars in transition costs required to privatize social security
but they are not willing to put it in a budget
if you believe in privatizing social security then you will vote yes on the previous question
as democrats we stand willing to work in a bipartisan way to meet those challenges
but we will not stand idly by and let the republican majority destroy social security in the name of saving it
everybody on our side of the aisle is prepared to work in a bipartisan way to increase the solvency of social security
he brags about the increase in money for no child left behind but we never properly funded no child left behind
it would cut 270 million in spending from section 8 and other housing and homelessness programs
let me first say to the gentleman that only in washington would one call a cut a reduction in the rate of increase in spending
there are specific directions in this budget that not only cut to the bone but cut through the bone
in fact it is estimated that they would cost the system more than 5 trillion
mr speaker i ask unanimous consent that the text of the amendment be printed in the record immediately before the vote on the previous question
the minority has an issue we want to discuss in the course of this budget
one in six north dakotans that i represent 114 000 get a social security check every month
do nt raid those social security dollars now of course given the discussion on this radical overhaul of social security we have the other prospect that these dollars will be taken away from social security and placed into private accounts resulting in either massive additional borrowing to continue social security benefits or very draconian budget cuts
i would like to hear one reason why we ought not move to discussing this diversion of social security money away from the social security trust fund why we should not discuss today the prospects of massive additional federal borrowing if we divert the social security money why we should not discuss today the draconian budget cuts that would reduce benefits potentially to people who desperately need them if we divert money that is coming in to pay benefits into private accounts
there is a lot of explaining to do in my opinion for those who are advancing this privatization scheme on social security and i know the nation would feel an awful lot better certainly those i represent if we conduct this debate having first adopted the preservation of social security
let us move to the discussion on how we shore up and maintain and strengthen social security but not in ways that would cause massive additional borrowing massive benefit cuts
this democratic party which stood so strongly in preserving surplus dollars saved social security first walling them off the lockbox
mr speaker it is a great day in our great nation and it is an honor to be here to begin the debate about the fiscal blueprint for our nation the priorities of our nation
this rule makes in order four amendments which are printed in the committee on rules report accompanying the resolution
the rule waives all points of order against the amendments printed in the report except that the adoption of the amendment in the nature of a substitute shall constitute the conclusion of consideration of the concurrent resolution for amendment
it also permits the chairman of the committee on the budget to offer amendments in the house to achieve mathematical consistency
since before my time in this body the committee on rules has consistently afforded the minority the opportunity for its alternative to be heard with the only exception being the fiscal year 2003 budget when there was not a budget alternative offered
it allows us in a time of war to ensure that our nation s soldiers are sufficiently equipped
finally this tool allows us to make certain that our government acts in a fiscally responsible manner to ensure opportunities and safety for future generations of americans
this budget ensures that our nation remains strong in the face of terror
we continue the multiyear plan to enable the military to fight the war on terrorism now and to transform itself to counter unconventional threats in the future
today the general consensus of both private and public forecasters is that the us economy is in a sustained expansion with solid growth of real gdp and payroll jobs and with low unemployment and low inflation
the speed and strength of the economic recovery of the last several years has been due in large part to the tax relief packages given to the american people along with the extension of that tax relief passed last year
i am proud to be a member of the committee on the budget that this year reported out a historic budget that sets in motion a glidepath to cut the deficit in half both in dollars and as a percentage of gross domestic product in 5 years
this budget wisely targets both discretionary and mandatory spending in an effort to set priorities
the committee on the budget calls for a reduction in total nondefense nonhomeland security discretionary spending
mr speaker i appreciate the concern of the ranking member of the committee on ways and means in regard to the alternative minimum tax
the gentleman will be delighted to learn that this budget makes accommodation for a further amt extension of relief so that middleclass americans are not impacted by that amt provision that originated in the committee on ways and means
i thank the gentleman and the previous speakers for drawing attention to the looming crisis that impacts people my age in social security the people who frankly have come to the conclusion that unless congress acts sooner rather than later there will not be that program and that dramatic and important action is needed
this is a vigorous debate about the priorities that are embodied in our budget blueprint
but for the second day in a row now we have had this characterized as a government without a conscience
veterans health care 189 billion in fiscal year 2000 30 billion today
education numbers up in double digits
this budget turns that corner and begins the process of slowing the growth in mandatory and discretionary but continuing to provide for those priorities continuing to make those tough decisions in ways that have been avoided by prior congresses
idea funded only 8 percent of the per pupil expenditure in 1994 and 1995
was there not a conscience in the congress prior to 1995
the commitment to education the commitment to health care the commitment to the nih the commitment to defense and the commitment to policies that expand and grow our economy and give americans tremendous opportunities have been embodied in our budgets and are embodied in this budget
there will be that opportunity this being the rule on the budget but i will engage in a bit of discussion about the social security because i am one who will gain or lose a great deal being someone who will reach that retirement age at that year of insolvency
and it is shocking to me that the party who gave us social security and should be very proud of it and are are almost in complete denial about the looming crisis that it faces and refuse to accept the fact that regardless of which option we choose to solve the problem that it is something that should be kicked down the road to future generations to future congresses to future years
anyone who has been through their freshman orientation upon being elected has a bipartisan group give them the longterm unfunded liabilities of this government and we acknowledge that there are vast differences in the approach to saving social security
but unfortunately largely with one bold brave exception in the gentleman from florida mr boyd xz4000440 there has been total resistance to have any constructive effort to bring about a solution to this problem
but by golly we have got an obligation to those people who are under 35 or under 45 or whatever number we finally arrive at people who have time to plan and people who know and all of us know of all stripes that there will be a problem in either 2040 or 2041 or 2042
as the gentleman knows the budget document is a broad blueprint for spending that directs the authorizing committees those committees of members who have developed expertise in their areas to find savings through reconciliation instructions
it allows members like the gentleman from new york mr rangel xz4003330 on the committee on ways and means to best formulate those revenue measures that avoid amt taxing that allows members of the committee on energy and commerce to deal with the issues facing medicaid program which all of the governors acknowledge is swallowing up state budgets that allows the committee on agriculture to fund within their committee s jurisdiction those savings in a variety of programs
this budget blueprint is a sound document that sets the course for our congress and for our nation for the coming year and the cuts that the gentleman refers to are reductions in the rate of growth in those programs with the exception of the reconciliation instructions which are a remarkable and historic first step to this congress restraining spending and funding priorities and simultaneously getting our arms around the deficit that both parties are understandably concerned about
in fact it is the rule on the budget blueprint for this country for fiscal year 2006 a budget blueprint that does a number of things important to the american people
it puts our soldiers and sailors and airmen and marines and coast guard and reservists and guardsmen foremost fully funding the president s defense request budgeting for the continued global war on terror to the tune of 50 billion prioritizing even making tough divisions something that we are loathe to do often in this process but it is what we are here for making tough decisions about priorities priorities in government priorities in households priorities in our individual lives something every american is accustomed to
it continues to invest heavily in our nation s defense and homeland security
and so for the first time since the reagan administration it calls for an eighttenths of a percent reduction in nonsecurity discretionary spending
so a balanced approach to finding savings in our government such that we may begin to get our arms around the deficits and cut the deficit in half in 5 years so that we do not shoulder young people just entering the workforce schoolage children children not yet born with these massive debts
it has been said in the context of the social security debate that the other side does not believe the solution to solving social security s problems is to privatize it
we have led with our chin on this issue and i am very proud of that effort and i am proud of the manner in which we have conducted this debate because it will undoubtedly be an extensive debate occupying a good part of the 109th congress
it is an opportunity for this congress to lead to lead the american people to an understanding of an issue that is at a total insolvency point occurring in 2042 but its impacts on the federal budget beginning as soon as 2008
and as a young person who will be impacted by that it gives us an opportunity to look beyond the short term and be truly visionary in the great ways that this congress is capable of being
we have done a lot of great things over the past several years doubling nih continuing to invest in research and cures and trials to make the human condition better
this budget continues to fund our priorities continues to invest in people and continues to lay the groundwork for policies that allow people to pursue their own version of the american dream to find opportunity in a growing expanding economy that allows for job creation that does not punish entrepreneurial spirit that allows people to continue to invest in their businesses to have more money in their own pocket to make decisions about their own children s future about their own opportunities and about their own hopes and dreams
3 notwithstanding any other provision in this resolution immediately after disposition of the concurrent resolution h con
i rise in opposition to the rule because it appears to be inconsistent with all of the things that the president is talking about
i am glad that the gentleman from iowa chairman nussle saw fit to put the 50 billion in because it is an indication that they know that a war is going on and i only wish that they would put something in there to help those veterans that are fighting the war
it runs into trillions of dollars and yet there is not one scintilla of evidence that the president s legislative ideas are considered by the house in this budget
so in support of the president s position what we are saying here in defeating the rule give us the opportunity to bring legislation to my colleagues that would prohibit us from taking the contributions that are made to the social security fund out of that and putting it into a private fund which the president agrees with us has nothing to do with saving social security
as a matter of fact he says that personal accounts will make sure that individual workers get a better deal in whatever emerges as a social security system which means that if it is separate and just to make someone feel good because they have private investments then come mr president and my fellow colleagues of the other side of the aisle and let us talk about it by taking personal private accounts off of the table and in a bipartisan way help us to get something that emerges out of social security
then if we want to encourage incentives for savings since the third rail that the president has grabbed is changing the income tax system then let us work together and put incentives in the tax system that would encourage low and middle income workers to have a savings
it just seems to me to have a budget today that excludes the real cost of the war that punishes veterans that suffered in the war that makes no provisions for relieving the economic pain that is going to be caused by the alternative minimum tax and to act like the president going for 60 cities in 60 days will have no legislative impact then let us save a lot of money and say that we can not deal with social security reform today not because we do not have a problem but the president is committed in making certain that we do not find a bipartisan solution
it just seems to me that it is up to us to make certain that we still work for a bipartisan solution and if the president does not believe that his personal and our private accounts are going to help us in resolving this problem then for god s sake let us get on with social security and with the help of the gentleman from california mr dreier xz4001150 a personal friend of the president who listens to him tell him we agree with the president that if it does not solve the problem get out of the way and let us together republicans and democrats solve this problem
when we establish the financial priorities of the government each year we show the american people in black and white what and who we value most
the majority s budget resolution throws an additional 106 billion in tax cuts to the nation s wealthiest while cutting billions in crucial funding for health care education and housing programs programs that help the hardworking americans get by from daytoday programs that give hope to mothers and fathers that they too may one day share in the american dream
i believe this budget resolution sends the wrong message values the wrong priorities and shortchanges too many of our hardworking taxpayers that we should in fact be helping
how can we hurt all these people cut all this funding slash all these programs and still afford 106 billion in tax cuts for our wealthiest a tax cut that balloons the deficit and shifts the financial burden to pay those taxes to our grandchildren and our children
every penny we give away in this budget s massive tax cut to the wealthy shifts the burden of those taxes to the middle class and to the working poor who can not even get unemployment benefits extended or an increase in the minimum wage out of this congress
what will it take for this house to get its priorities in order
in 5 short years paying the interest and this is so important i want to repeat this by 2009 the interest that we pay on the nation s debt will cost by itself more than all the domestic nondefense discretionary spending combined
what is included in this budget is just as horrifying as what is excluded from it
in a disingenuous attempt to conceal their own economic shortsightedness this majority has purposely hidden the harmful effects of their social security privatization plan a plan that could cost the taxpayers trillions over the next 10 years from this budget resolution
they have lowballed the cost of the war in iraq spending only 50 billion over the next year which just today we voted for 80 billion
let me compliment the gentleman from iowa chairman nussle because if he had not put 50 billion in there would have been nothing because the president did not include it at all in his budget
social security privatization while not detailed in this budget would have disastrous longterm farreaching impacts on the budget
in order to make certain that we are able to meet future budget obligations for the health and wellbeing of our children our seniors our veterans and disabled we must protect social security from privatization
that is why it is so important to stop this potential hemorrhage of social security in its tracks
mr speaker i rise today in support of the effort to defeat the previous question
as she gave it to me she looked up into my eyes with tears as she said this is a photograph of franklin d roosevelt signing the social security act in 1935
please hang it in your office as a reminder she continued and said please do not let them dismantle my only source of income in rural america social security keeps tens of thousands of people from falling into poverty
the proposal to privatize social security would mean a 40 percent cut in benefits
mr speaker i rise in strong support of the resolution
mr speaker i first visited lebanon and syria in 1956 almost half a century ago
i remember going to the bekaa valley to the city of baalbak where among the ancient roman ruins shakespeare was performed on alternate nights in english and french
yesterday mr speaker the people of lebanon tore down gigantic billboards in lebanon that portrayed the former and current syrian dictators mr assad and his father
just imagine having in the united states huge billboards of joe stalin or the ayatollahs of tehran how we would feel about this
as we speak there is no syrian embassy in lebanon
in colonial times the colonial power did not have an embassy in its colony because it did not recognize it as an independent sovereign nation
by passing our resolution the congress will express its solidarity with the brave antisyrian occupation freedomloving demonstrators in martyrs square in beirut
if you can tell a man by his friends all you need to know about assad is that his only friend in lebanon is the terrorist gang hezbollah
that is why it is vital that the lebanese people succeed in throwing off syrian rule and that the lebanese be allowed to conduct free and fair parliamentary elections this spring unimpeded by the fist of syria s military or the brutal machinations of its intelligence agents
mr speaker we stand shoulder to shoulder with those who seek full restoration of sovereign democratic rule in lebanon
i strongly support this resolution and urge all of my colleagues to join me in sending a message of hope to the lebanese people
mr speaker i have taken the time in opposition to this resolution not so much to object to the wellintended notions of the gentlewoman and the promotion of freedom and liberty
i for one would admit i personally do not know what is best for the lebanese and the syrians the iraqis or anybody else in the region but i would argue the case that traditionally in this country up until probably the past 100 years we took a different position on foreign policy
we took a position of nonintervention one where we strived for neutrality and we argued the case that we did not have any business in the internal affairs of other nations
for instance we are in iraq right now with all these good intentions
we have spent over 200 billion and this week they came out with a survey and they talked about the most dangerous city in the world and where security is the worst and that city is not beirut
in the last 2 years every one of us would have rather have been in beirut than we would have been in iraq
the other thing that concerns me is that we lose credibility when we talk about what we want and what we will impose on other nations because when we are claiming that the lebanese can not possibly have elections with the presence of foreign troops at the same time we daily hear the bragging about the great election in iraq where we had these 140 000 troops and total martial law in order for an election to take place
we saw demonstrations first a little at a demonstration orchestrated in support of getting syria out of lebanon and then there was a response to that where 500 000 showed up supporting hezbollah claiming they supported syria and then of course following that there was a much bigger demonstration
but the one thing about all the demonstrations we never saw a sign that said america come save us come in here tell us what to do tell us what to do with our elections
they have had elections going on for you in lebanon without any violence directed against syrian troops as we see daily in iraq
they have an election coming up in may
we complain a lot about the syrians being there and if i have a personal preference since i believe in selfdetermination i would have the troops out just as i would have our troops out of most other places
why are we not excited about foreign troops in the golan heights and in the over 100 countries where that we have troops
the syrians went into lebanon in 1976 and if we go back and look at history it was at the urging of the government of the united states because there was about to be an election
so therefore it was in our interest at that time to interfere with the election just as we have interfered so many times since then over the world
just think of the elected leader in 1953 in iran the elected leader mossadeq
we sent in the cia
in a conversation with a veteran of the cia an expert in this region he explained at least he sincerely believed that we did a tremendous favor for osama bin laden and that is to go into iraq expose ourselves and then create the chaos of iraq
our problem very simply comes from the violation of the basic principle that we should follow and that is that we should be friends with nations and trade with nations and that we should be neutral in foreign affairs because it does not serve our interests
just think of what the interference in iraq has cost us over 1 500 men over 11 000 battle casualties with another 9 000 sent home because of illness and over 200 billion
and there is no end in sight
my argument is it comes not because we make a misjudgment not that this resolution is simply a misjudgment of the day it just is that is part of the misjudgments that we have made now for many many decades in overall foreign policy
the american people certainly have not been up in arms about it and have endorsed it along with the large majority in the congress
the 1960s came back to haunt us in the 1970s and the basic financial condition of this country is much worse than it was in the 1970s
i see resolutions like this as not restraint but encouragement without looking back and seeing how we participated in contributing to the problems that we have in the middle east
so i am making the suggestion why do we not think about overall policy with consistency and think almost what is in our best interests
i would like to read a quote from ronald reagan because he was involved in lebanon and our government was involved in the early 1980s
in his memoirs he admits it was a serious mistake and we ought to take advice from ronald reagan on what he said about his misadventure in lebanon
we were in there in 1983
this is what he writes in his memoirs several years later
perhaps the idea of a suicide car bomber committing mass murder to gain instant entry into paradise was so foreign to our own values and consciousness that it did not create in us the concern for the marines safety that it should have further quoting ronald reagan in the weeks immediately after the bombing i believed the last thing we should do was turn tail and leave
mr speaker i would like to make a few points regarding the unintended consequences of our foreign policy as well as what might happen in lebanon
once again i ask the question does that not raise the question of whether or not the elections in iraq are as reliable as is supposed
in other words this resolution takes the position that we should go in lebanon and repeal the lebanese second amendment rights so that nobody has any guns
we see civil strife precipitating a civil war in iraq and i think what our involvement here now is liable to lead to that type of situation rather than peace and prosperity and elections
but there is a theory that some of the radical muslims in syria that object to assad because he is too moderate because he endorsed the persian gulf war and because he takes some of our prisoners and he participates in the interrogations of our prisoners that he is seen as too liberal too friendly with the west and some suppose that that could have been the reason that the murder had occurred believing that it would bring down the government of assad
in iraq in january of this year there was some polling done an expression by the people on what they thought about foreign occupation
instead we are talking about occupation for years about building 14 bases in iraq
how long do we stay in these countries and why is it so necessary for us to be telling other people what to do and when to do it and how to do it and stirring up nothing but antiamerican sentiment while at the same time even though our goals may be wellintentioned they are never achieved
and to think that the election under the conditions that we are condemning in lebanon is the salvation is the evidence that we are having tremendous achievement i think is something that we are just pulling the wool over our eyes
it was a preliminary to our invasion of iraq starting specifically in 1988 but adams advised he made a suggestion and he made a statement he says america goes not abroad seeking monsters to destroy that statement is so appropriate
the statement toward the ends says the president should direct the united states representative to the united nations to present and secure reports for the united nations security council classifying lebanon as a captive country in calling for the immediate release of lebanese detainees in syria and lebanon
for too long lebanon has been denied its independence by the regime in damascus a regime that has imposed its will upon the lebanese people through electoral intimidation through political persecution through assassination of opposition leaders and brutal military force
the protests that have followed the valentine s day bombing in beirut that killed former prime minister hariri ushered in an immediate demand from a unifiable and diverse lebanese opposition for syria to withdraw from lebanon
the streets of beirut earlier this week boasted the largest antisyrian demonstration in lebanese history and possibly the largest prodemocracy rally in middle east history in response to the syrian and iraniansponsored hezbollah rally a week earlier
house concurrent resolution 32 clearly articulates the threat to us national security interests and to regional stability posed by syria s presence in lebanon
thus at a time when this body has clearly articulated our stand regarding hezbollah just a few days ago let us underscore that we will not tolerate an appeasement of hezbollah in lebanon
it calls for the president pursuant to existing law to freeze all assets in the us belonging to lebanese government officials who are found to support and aid in syria s occupation of lebanon
finally mr speaker it calls for the united states policy to include support for the independent human rights and prodemocracy advocates in lebanon and for the full restoration of sovereign democratic rule there
calling for syria to depart from lebanon once and for all is in keeping with the post911 approach of forcing terrorists out of their caves and placing them on the run
the us position on syrian withdrawal forces the terrorists to retreat to their own soil and in doing so it seeks to limit their impact so that freedom and democracy can flourish once again in lebanon and throughout the region
in so doing we become one with our brothers and sisters in lebanon as they seek to remove the shackles of syrian tyranny and occupation
i urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this resolution
mr speaker i rise to encourage us support of the people of lebanon in their struggle to free themselves from syrian occupation
lebanese citizens with views not in keeping with syrian authorities have been arrested kidnapped tortured and in some instances even killed
the lebanese press has been effectively stifled in order to repress antisyrian sentiment
my ancestors came to this country in search of greater freedom
now as i watch the lebanese freedom movement i am filled with the hope that the citizens of my country of origin will soon have the chance to claim the liberties for which my ancestors sought in coming to the united states
res 32 in support of the lebanese struggle for independence
syria must be made to know in no uncertain terms that we expect the complete withdrawal of its troops from lebanon the immediate dissolution of hezbollah and the immediate termination of interference within lebanon s government
mr chairman i want to speak in favor of this
this is a family issue in terms of bringing down prices and getting a safe supply of fuel for this country
if we do not get into this kind of alternative we are going to be struck forever in rhetoric and not being able to produce for our people not just fuel but produce it in a way that is truly alternative and within the bounds of people s budgets
congress should support a federal budget that will make us more competitive in the global economy spread prosperity to more americans and reestablish fiscal discipline to ensure a better future for our children
this budget resolution takes us in the wrong direction
in order to cover up the president s mismanagement of the economy and the resulting mountains of debt the republican budget sacrifices important domestic priorities like medicaid
slashing medicaid will have a devastating impact on the most vulnerable in our society
thirtynine million lowincome children and parents including one in every five american children 13 million elderly and disabled individuals who are receiving acute and longterm care coverage
with medicaid funding half of the nation s nursing home care cutting or block granting the program would set back efforts at improving the quality of care provided to seniors and people with disabilities in the nation s nursing homes
sick people cost more when they are uninsured and receiving care in emergency rooms than when they are covered by medicaid
if children have less health coverage they are more likely to compromise their ability to learn in school and to grow into healthy contributing members of society
cuts in block grants do not address the real challenges states are facing medicaid enrollment increases which have occurred as a result of more people losing their health care coverage
this administration has provided huge tax cuts to the highest earning households in the nation over the last few years
to reduce or eliminate health care coverage for poor elderly and disabled people in order to finance tax cuts for the wealthy is inequitable and not in line with our nation s values
mr chairman i rise in strong opposition of h con
it fails to include funding for many of the president s key programs such as social security privatization the war in iraq and the cost of the alternative minimum tax
it does not cut the deficit in half as the administration claims
we have soldiers fighting for us in iraq and this budget does nt even provide enough funding to pay for their health care when they return
the budget will also endanger the health of millions of americans by proposing a 11 billion cut to food stamps the nation s number one investment in nutrition and defense against hunger
it proposes large cuts in funding but without targeting specific programs it leaves a myriad of programs vulnerable to cuts
madam chairman i rise in strong support of the butterfieldscottbacareyes amendment
these grants are meant to provide outreach and technical assistance to encourage and assist socially disadvantaged farmers and ranchers to own and operate farms and ranches and participate in agricultural programs
this assistance includes information on application and bidding procedures farm managements and other essential information to participate in agricultural programs
these grants may also be awarded to hispanic serving institutions tribal colleges and historically black colleges and universities that engage in outreach to minority farmers
by investing in the 2501 program we can improve relationships between the usda and socially disadvantaged farmers and prevent future lawsuits
this is a small investment that could potentially save millions in the future
madam speaker i rise in strong support of this amendment which i have introduced with my colleague congressman hinojosa
this amendment provides an additional 855 000 in funding for grants to hispanic serving institutions which are colleges and universities with at least 25 percent hispanic enrollment
in my own district california state university san bernardino has benefited from these funds in the past
if this congress is going to be dedicated to providing a topquality education for all students in america then we need to ensure that we fully fund hsis and other institutions that reach out to our underserved communities
i think that as we move forward in the protection of our food supply it is important for us not to burden an industry with requirements and costs that go above and beyond what is necessary for us to protect the public health and safety
we have no indication that just labeling the country of origin makes a significant difference in the marketing of these products and i think it is an unnecessary extra layer of regulation that we are about to put on an industry that many times has a very difficult time staying in business anyway
i rise in opposition to this amendment and recognize that everyone on both sides of the issue has nothing but the best of intentions and certainly wishes the industry well and especially our grassroots producers
the pharmaceutical industry in this country is corrupt from top to bottom
you do not have to be all broke out in brilliance to know when this stuff is bad
i am the only registered pharmacist in the united states congress and it is astounding to me to see what has happened to this industry in the last 30 years and the willingness for them to take advantage of the american people over and over and over again
mr chairman i rise in support of the cbc budget a commonsense framework that embraces our values that focuses on fiscal discipline and that invests in our nation s future
to be frank the budget that president bush presented us with is a betrayal of the trust that is placed in us as legislators
i stand in support of the cbc budget because it is a fiscally responsible alternative that targets the disparities that plague our communities and puts our priorities where they belong
this adjustment would restore an estimated 363 billion in fy 2006 including nearly 4 billion for deficit reduction
we will fully fund no child left behind build and repair schools increase investment in job training and job creation programs
we will not slash community and regional development programs rather we will continue to invest in housing for those who need assistance
and we keep our commitments to our nation s farmers who are depending on us to keep the promises that we made in the 2002 farm bill
additionally the cbc budget allocates funding for veterans and defense above the president s requested level to support our troops in iraq and afghanistan bolster our homeland security needs and fully fund our veterans programs and benefits
mr chairman i believe in fiscal responsibility
i believe that in times of national and fiscal crisis sacrifices need to be made
it is unfair to scale back government programs that benefit hard working families in order to fund tax cuts that most benefit the wealthiest of americans
mr chairman i thank the gentleman from south carolina mr spratt xz4003860 for an opportunity to speak this evening and i appreciate the work the gentleman has done to provide a balanced approach to meet our requirements in a fiscally responsible manner
this budget is stunningly out of sync with where the typical american is in terms of protecting our environment and our natural resources
in areas of clean water every independent outside organization and most of them within government have identified that we have a serious problem with the nation s aging water systems required to ensure safe drinking water yet the president s budget and what we have here today reduces almost 700 million for water quality responsibilities
in the land and water conservation fund we are breaking the promise that was negotiated here in the year 2000 where the conservation trust fund was established that should by now by rights as a result of this bipartisan bicameral agreement be moving funds in the neighborhood of 2 billion for this fiscal year
and one of the most significant broken promises is in the area of conservation in the agriculture sector
one of the elements that was negotiated as part of the farm bill there were going to be investments in farm conservation and yet this budget takes something that is so critical to america s farmers particularly small and mediumsized operations and cuts more than a half billion dollars from these vital farm bill conservation programs that unite rural america conservation interests people who care about natural resources
there is currently over a 4 billion backlog of producers waiting to participate in these critical farm conservation programs
i have heard from constituents school teachers local government officials medical professionals housing advocates and many others throughout the communities in my district all with detailed stories about how this budget will have devastating impacts
first by exploding the federal deficit adding 376 billion to the national debt and spending every penny of the 185 billion social security trust fund surplus coming in during the year
this is unnecessary and frankly dangerous as we continue to create an abyss between the haves and havenots in society and are putting our financial markets on edge by borrowing trillions from foreign investors
madam chairman i appreciate the gentleman s courtesy in permitting me to speak on behalf of this bill
the congressional consideration of the interior appropriations bill should be one of the highlights of this congressional session as it touches on things that are near and dear to people s hearts clean water vast open spaces environmental protection even opportunities to invest in the arts
sadly what should be a positive expression of our values our hopes and our opportunities is instead in this bill a pattern of broken promises to our communities and to ourselves
i agree that the dramatic underfunding in terms of the budget allocation put the chairman and the ranking member and the staff in a hole to begin with and my heart goes out to them but there is no reason that we as a congress can not use the billions of dollars that are set aside in a trust fund for the land and water conservation fund that have not been tapped as these resources are set aside expressly for this purpose of land conservation
in the year 2000 as the gentleman from washington mr dicks xz4001090 my friend mentioned he was integral to fashioning an important compromise that gave flexibility to the committee on appropriations
we in congress made a commitment to the public and an agreement amongst ourselves to fund this responsibility
i will support and speak out strongly in support of working to stop the diluting of our commitment to clean water with an amendment to stop the administration s efforts to weaken water quality protections putting more sewage into our rivers and streams and drinking water
i recognize the need to do that in extreme weather events an important tool for communities but it is not something that we should be doing routinely
in periods of extreme wet weather blending will still often be necessary
i urge joining me in supporting the amendment and working with the members of this committee to try to craft this bill in a way that meets the needs of america s communities
oregonians have already been saddled with at least a 1 000 increase in college tuition over the last year
and while there are over 55 million children in public schools nationwide and state budgets are already stretched thin no child left behind funding is cut by 784 million
several health care programs are threatened or eliminated in the legislation
we may end up seeing more people in emergency rooms with severe conditions that could have been prevented with regular access to health care
mr speaker a month ago i voted against hr 3010 the labor health and human services education and related agencies first conference report which failed in the house with 22 republicans also voting against the bill
this bill contains 16 billion in cuts from fy 2005 to important labor health social services and education services
it is unfortunate that republicans in congress are choosing to strip away essential safeguards for families in order to implement tax cuts benefiting the wealthiest americans
the cuts we are hearing about in medicaid are really a reduction of the growth
the cut in medicaid as i read the base budget is a cut in the growth rate of 75 percent to a growth rate of 73 percent
passage of the committee s budget will provide for a real reduction of nearly 1 percent in nonsecurity discretionary spending
after holding the line on that category of spending at almost no growth in the last budget year we hope to do even better this year and actually have a reduction of 1 percent below last year s spending
furthermore the budget calls for a reduction in the rate of growth of mandatory spending
in addition to reducing spending this bill will ultimately save taxpayers almost 69 billion over the next 5 years
it sets the targets for the authorizing committees to do their work and find the places to make this process more efficient and cut the growth in spending in those mandatory categories that the chairman s budget the committee s budget sets out
that does put us on a path to cutting the deficit in half within 5 years
i urge we move this budget forward today we do the tough things in discretionary spending and mandatory spending it asks us to do that we defeat the substitute and get on with our work
i am very proud this year to have worked for the first time with the gentlewoman from connecticut ms delauro xz4001030 who was a great partner in putting this bill together as are all the members of the subcommittee
in addition i want to thank our detailee tom obrien and walt smith from my personal staff and of course my distinguished clerk martin delgado who does a fabulous job on this bill
mr chairman i would also like to point out just in very broad terms that this bill takes care of a lot of issues that are critical not just to agriculture producers but to consumers in terms of food safety research projects that are going on in every state in this nation
a lot of people go to the grocery store mr chairman and they see that big truck pulling up in the back of the store and unloading goods that are put on shelves and in the freezers at the local grocery store and their products that are sold at a high quality for a good price
i am also very proud to work hand in hand with the gentleman from virginia mr goodlatte xz4001540 our authorizing chairman who has been a partner in this process not just this year but every year
mr chairman i include at this point in the record the following tabular material related to the bill mr chairman i reserve the balance of my time
it is my understanding that there are benefits to the organic transition program being managed as part of the integrated organic program and my intention is that it should continue to be managed as it was in fiscal years 2004 and 2005
madam chairman in the interest of moving forward and moving to the amendment process i yield back the balance of my time
i understand that members may have some concern with these transactions that we are involved with here but the reason that we are doing this today is to accommodate some legitimate concerns raised by the authorizing committee about some of the mandatory limitations in this bill
i have worked closely with the gentleman from virginia chairman goodlatte over the years and i intend to work with him closely in the future especially as he prepares to write a new farm bill
although i certainly understand and share the concerns that many members have about plant pests and diseases that devastate crops and trees i must say that we have done our absolute best to fund eradication and control of plant pests in the bill that you see before you today
also across the country the glassywinged sharpshooter 24 million the emerald ash borer 14 million citrus canker 36 million very important to our members in florida
emerging plant pests alone are funded at over 100 million in this bill
in addition tens of millions of dollars go to fund programs to stop medfly the boll weevil brucellosis the gypsy moth and many others
madam chairman i rise in opposition the gentleman s amendment
i have had discussions with the gentleman about trying to work with him as we move to conference to attempt to increase this line item somewhat to address the problem that the gentleman is addressing in a very sincere way here today
mr chairman i ask unanimous consent that title vii be considered as read printed in the record and open to amendment at any point
let me point out that the gentleman from kansas is not only working hard on this particular issue but he is a key player on agricultural issues that we deal with on a daily basis here in washington
he comes to the table every day very serious about these issues and truly in his heart wants to solve issues that face agriculture across the country
mr chairman my unanimous consent request is to allow 15 minutes for the proponent of the amendment and 15 minutes in opposition to the amendment
mr chairman i ask unanimous consent for the gentleman from montana mr rehberg xz4003350 to control 15 minutes and to be split between myself and the minority 7 12 minutes each in opposition to the amendment
in reality there will probably be more speakers in favor of the rehberg amendment
mr chairman i rise in strong opposition to the gentleman s amendment
the countryoforigin labeling provisions that were part of the last farm bill would present a nightmare to many producers in this country
good saltoftheearth people in agriculture know that this would impose up to 1 billion in additional costs to their already overworked people and to their budgets which are already being taxed
this is also an issue for anybody who believes that grocery stores and retailers are part of americana in this country and they would rise in strong opposition to this amendment because there is a liability in the countryoforigin labeling that would in essence make your friendly corner grocery store liable for trial lawyers to come in and say you did not put the fact that this calf may have been born in one country processed in another country and now on the meat counter in your local grocery store
that is not something that would reflect favorably for anyone in this country whether you are a producer a retailer or a consumer
i am not sure what the origin of the countryoforigin labeling provision was in the last farm bill but there is no doubt it would create additional costs that consumers would have to bear
many of us have been working on that for a long time and we hope that this provision that i have put in this bill remains by voting no on the rehberg amendment
mr chairman i make a point of order against the amendment because it proposes to change existing law and constitutes legislation in an appropriation bill and therefore violates clause 2 of rule xxi
the rule states in pertinent part an amendment to a general appropriations bill shall not be in order if changing existing law this amendment directly amends existing law
mr chairman i do rise in opposition to this amendment and yield myself such time as i may consume
and if you look at this chart that i have here that talks about overall spending in the va mr chairman you will see a strong commitment to honoring the commitment of our nation s veterans
and in the last 5 years medical spending has increased by 68 percent
we have allowed guard and reserve units to enroll in medical benefits
let me touch on mr chairman what we have done under the gentleman s leadership this year in the veterans line items of the budget
under the gentleman s mark and allowing me to work together with him and propose an amendment we increase that by 877 million which means in these tough fiscal times that our nation is experiencing a 28 percent increase for veterans health care numbers
i believe that we can find that reconciliation number without enrollment fees without drug copays because we will have the flexibility to look for waste fraud and abuse in the veterans numbers and be able to reduce and meet a goal in that fashion
we can achieve this reconciliation in other ways
mr chairman in summary i congratulate the gentleman again for a fiscally prudent budget that meets our nation s needs and i look forward to continuing to work with him to honor the commitment to our nation s veterans
that is substantial progress in honoring the commitment of our nation s veterans
we have allowed guard and reservists to qualify for medical benefits we have increased the gi education benefit over those years we have opened up the va system for all veterans to participate in and have funded it enough so that at least priorities 1 through 7 are able to participate in that and we have gone from 25 million veterans served under the va to 48 million
so as a result of the hard work of the veterans and the committee on the budget we have increased from the president s baseline by 877 million which in these difficult fiscal times is a 28 percent increase
but the chairman s mark because it is so much lower going from 424 million to 155 million i believe working together in the committee on veterans affairs with the committee on the budget that we can in fact look for waste fraud and abuse and eliminate those types of things without having to have an enrollment fee without having to have drug copayments
the willingness with which our young people are likely to serve in any war no matter how justified should be directly proportional as to how they perceive the veterans of earlier wars are treated and appreciated the independent budget puts support by the veterans community as 300 billion short
on top of all of this this budget tells the veteran s affairs committee which i am on to find 800 million in cuts over the next 5 years for savings
i just want to paraphrase what they said we think cutting veterans benefits talking about the majority budget is and i paraphrase unacceptable especially at a time when american soldiers sons and daughters are being wounded and killed every day in iraq
in addition it appears that this pattern of shortchanging veterans medical care continues in the 109th congress
i will put all of it in the record but clearly in this house in closing only the big dogs eat in this house
it includes increases in programs that the american people believe in and that the republicans just give lip service to
in the republican s house the big dogs eat first and everyone else has to get in line
if we do not take care of our veterans now we will not have the boots on the ground in the future to respond to any attack against us or our allies
all of the funds reduced from ballistic missile defense are reallocated within various functions to provide for additional support for the troops in iraq and other defense items necessary to maintain our military strength and jobs 11 billion homeland security needs 205 billion and veterans programs and benefits 465 billion
all calculations are for changes abovebelow proposed fiscal year 2006 levels included in the republican budget
the american legion believes va s own admission that the cost of doing business increases annually about 1314 percent because of federal pay increases and inflation in the health care arena
it appears this pattern of shortchanging va medical care continues in the 109th congress
the american legion recognizes and appreciates the bradley amendment adopted by the committee but believes it falls well short of the total funding needed in va medical care
clearly both of these amendments are in the best interest of veterans and their families
because this amount would not begin to cover employee wage increases and other inflationary costs it amounts to a substantial cut in funding and thus would unavoidably result in a reduction of critical medical care services for our nation s sick and disabled veterans
in addition we understand that h con
we think cutting veterans benefit programs is unconscionable especially at a time when america s son and daughters are being wounded and killed every day in iraq
in establishing priorities of care for veterans health care this congress also believes that the same military values that guided servicemembers on active duty should define how services and assistance are provided to them as veterans
as chairman of the committee on veterans affairs i seek an increase in 126 million for the medical and prosthetic research projects above the president s budget request
to ensure that our national cemeteries are maintained as the shrines that they are my subcommittee chairman the gentleman from florida mr miller xz4002762 and i recommended an additional 456 million in construction to begin a 5year 300 million national shrine commitment project to repair and restore the existing national cemeteries
but while our greatest attention should be focused on those who have served us and can no longer fend for themselves there is another group of veterans that needs our help our soldiers sailors airmen and marines who need assistance in returning to the workforce or entering the workforce for the first time after serving their country
we need to make sure that the va is flexible and personal in its delivery of health care and benefits such as training and education
under this president spending for veterans has increased by 47 percent in 5 years versus 32 percent in the 8 years under the clinton administration
the spending on veterans continues to increase maintaining our commitment to veterans in america
what you had at the time were individuals on both sides of the aisle working together in a bipartisan fashion with regard to how we deal with veterans
he has given me a task and the task is that with regard to all of these programs in discretionary and mandatory are there savings out there
we will accept the challenge and we will go and work together in a bipartisan fashion and see if we can find those savings
i would also like to begin by thanking the people who have worked so hard on this bill especially the gentleman from north carolina mr taylor xz4003981 who has been very thoughtful about the payments in lieu of taxes issue and has worked well with us in the past
we are committed to getting full funding for pilt because the counties in rural america and areas where they are dominated by the federal government need that kind of support
i have a map beside me here which is similar to the map the gentleman from colorado mr udall xz4004121 had just a moment ago although we did it in red because we want to represent the statement so we can see the meaning of a statement that was made by president ronald reagan in 1988
and land owned by the government is in red and the rest of the map is white
twothirds of most of the other states in the west are owned by the federal government
that means we do not tax those lands and that means that in the western united states we pay less per child per education but we tax our people more per family because we are supporting the federal government in this environment
it is only fair that we pay a reasonable amount in lieu of taxes to cover that shortfall
so i urge my colleagues to support this amendment to add a modest sum to the pilt but a sum that is very very important to the american people those who live in these public land areas and those who enjoy them from the rest of the country
mr chairman i wish to speak very briefly about an aspect of fiscal responsibility the rule called payasyougo because there is a connection between our lack of fiscal responsibility and these draconian cuts we are seeing in vital services like the 20 billion that people who are poor and dependent on medicaid will be forced to endure
our colleagues in the majority have consistently opposed democratic efforts to reinstall payasyougo rules for both entitlement spending and new tax cuts
in fact they just denied the house the ability to vote on such a proposal offered by the gentleman from tennessee mr cooper xz4000810 and the blue dogs
these paygo reforms were put in place in the 1990s and were essential to the successful effort achieved then to balance the budget
paygo reforms have been endorsed in their entirety by alan greenspan but the republicans do not want them applied to tax cuts
mr chairman i rise in strong opposition to the peterson amendment
eightyone percent of the undiscovered uneconomically recoverable natural gas in the ocs is located in the central and western gulf of mexico where drilling is currently allowed and under way
this amendment means drilling in the coastal areas of the united states where there is not a whole lot of gas and oil where tens of millions of our citizens have made it clear they do not want any more gas drilling and it means gutting the presidentialcongressional moratoria that had been in for decades reaffirmed by presidents george hw
this house has voted three times in recent years to stop the oil drilling in waters off florida california and the entire ocs
mr chairman i rise in strong opposition to the peterson amendment
the latest comprehensive analysis assessment was finished in 2003
we already know for instance that 81 percent of the nation s undiscovered economically recoverable natural gas on the ocs is located in the central and western gulf of mexico where drilling is currently allowed and underway
the amendment would mean drilling in coastal areas of the united states where there is nt a whole lot of oil and gas and where tens of millions of our citizens have made it clear that they do nt want any more drilling
mr chairman a little history might be in order here
in 1990 president george hw
and of course congress has supported these actions for the last 20 years by restricting mms from spending funds to support any new drilling or predrilling activities in these areas
in addition president george w bush endorsed both moratoria in his fy 06 budget
and the house of representatives has voted three times in recent years to stop new drilling in the waters off florida california and the entire outer continental shelf
despoiling all of our coastal areas in the fruitless search for energy independence is nt going to work
coastal communities continue to speak in strong bipartisan voices to protect their state s sensitive coastal resources and productive coastal economies
in that vote the house demonstrated its commitment to protecting our vital coastal communities
assessment of undiscovered technically recoverable oil and gas resources of the nation s outer continental shelf 2003 update using a playbased assessment methodology the minerals management service estimated a mean of 760 billion barrels of undiscovered recoverable oil and a mean of 4061 trillion cubic feet of undiscovered recoverable natural gas in the federal outer continental shelf of the united states
assessments of the entire ocs were made by the minerals management service mms in 1995 and 2000 mms 1996 and mms 2001
the next mms assessment of the entire ocs is scheduled for completion in mid 2005
these results are presented by area in table 1 which lists mean values as wells as the 95th and 5th percentile values representing high and low probability cases respectively
greater range between the high and low values indicated higher uncertainty in the estimates
these values represent a 1 percent increase in oil resources and a 121 percent increase in gas resources when compared with mms s 2000 assessment
the increases are due to changes in the assessments of the atlantic and gulf of mexico ocs areas
in the atlantic ocs area significant new knowledge and information was gained as a result of recent drilling in the scotian basin offshore canada
applying this new information led to adjustments to risks applied to previous defined plays and to the definition of new plays resulting in increased estimates for oil and gas utrr of 52 percent and 19 percent respectively over mms s 2000 study
this increase is attributed primarily to plays in the deep shelf areas of the central and western gulf of mexico and to the eastern gulf of mexico
this money in the clean water state revolving fund pays for sewage system upgrades across the country
we in maryland know how incredibly important this money is to protect the health of our people
fifty million gallons of waste will spew from baltimore s crumbling sewers in may
the socalled dead zones in the chesapeake bay and its tributaries in which there is too little oxygen to support a healthy ecosystem are a direct result of nutrient pollution principally nitrogen
in july of 2003 data from the epa s chesapeake bay program shows one of the largest areas of oxygendepleted water seen since the program began monitoring 20 years ago
the clean water act requires the environmental protection agency to issue permits for all sewage treatment plants that will protect water quality in the chesapeake bay and its tributaries yet the epa routinely fails to include restrictions on nitrogen pollution in these permits
the epa has not updated the standards on nitrogen pollution in almost 20 years
madam chairman i rise today in support of the bacahinojosa amendment to the agriculture appropriation bill to increase funding for hispanic serving institutions
this increase would grant additional funding for 193 of our nation s hispanic serving colleges and universities who are committed to ensuring greater hispanic representation in higher education in the us there are 54 hispanic serving institutions in my home state of california and in my congressional district which ranks among the highest in agriculture producing districts in the country there are four hispanic serving institutions
one hispanic serving institution in particular that will benefit is uc merced an exceptional research institution committed to reducing underrepresentation of valley students in the fields of agricultural sciences and natural resources
madam chairman i support an increase in agrelated educational funding
mr chairman i thank the gentleman for yielding time and i thank the gentleman from texas for his leadership on this very important issue which i think is one of the most important issues that our nation faces in the long term
mr chairman i rise in support of the hensarling amendment
i do so because the amendment in this budget is about simplification
it does so in a way as has been pointed out it reduces nondefense discretionary spending by 2 percent it reduces the size of growth in government in mandatory spending by just a little bit and there will be those i think that government should be no exception because no family and no business is an exception to the challenges that we face
this budget gets us on the path of being able to meet those challenges in a very responsible way
thirdly this budget funds efforts to close gaps and eliminate disparities in america s communities and among its citizens
the republican budget resolution mandates almost 800 million in cuts to veterans mandatory programs
these are reductions in disability compensation pension benefits education benefits and death benefits
mr chairman there is no greater betrayal or broken promise to the american people than that which can be found in the president s budget for rural america
in addition the republican budget cuts funding for 17 different community and economic development programs that provide housing water and sewer improvements and small business loans
mr chairman in this budget we maintain tax cuts for wage earners making less than 200 000 a year and we roll back cuts on the top 2 percent of americans and by doing so we have saved almost 47 billion that we have used to invest in the human assets of this country the american people
in the justice department we need to put more money into three programs that were cut first the programs that investigate gangrelated crimes secondly the problems of juvenile delinquency and third prison reentry
the 81 billion for iraq was not even included in this budget as if it was a supplemental consideration
mr chairman i would like the record to reflect my views on the horrendous and deliberate deficits our nation faces these articles appeared today in roll call and last week in the new york times
rescission time in congress president bush regularly calls on congress to restrain spending
he called for lineitem veto power in his first press conference after his reelection and in his 2006 budget
under the congressional budget and impoundment control act of 1974 the president can select any appropriated federal program for reduction or elimination by sending a message to congress which then has 45 days to approve his decision with a simple majority in each house
with it he can pick his targets put fasttrack pressure on congress to respond and win by gaining a simple majority approval in other words rescission is filibusterproof
so why have nt presidents been vigorously using the impoundment act to manage the budget in the last 31 years
why has mr bush kept this knife in a dusty drawer especially given the staggering deficit his public stance on the need to curb spending and his close ties with the republican congressional leadership
if republicans really want to cut spending and reduce the deficit they have more weapons than any political party has had in decades
usually contentious this year s debate is relatively quiet as the richest nation in the world begs foreigners to finance our lifestyle
most americans can name the president s top four policy priorities tax cuts war in iraq social security reform and medicare drug legislation
what americans do nt know is that these were either omitted from or lowballed in the president s own budget and his 82 billion supplemental request
the president s budget pays for only six months of the war in iraq and completely overlooks the transition costs of social security reform
its deficits are still so large that by the last year of the bush administration we will be paying more money to our nation s creditors than to our own citizens in nondefense domestic discretionary spending
according to the gao by 2040 our current policies will result in creditors getting all of our defense social security medicare veterans benefits or any other program to help americans
bush is the first president since james garfield in 1881 not to veto a single bill
garfield only had six months in office bush has had over 4 years
bush did threaten to veto any effort to repeal the 2003 medicare drug law that added 81 trillion in unfunded liabilities to our nation
this one entitlement program will twice as hard for future generations to afford as the alleged crisis in social security
few people realize that bush could slash any program in federal government with the approval of a simple majority in the senate and the house
in other words republicans already have the nuclear option top cut spending
bush himself repeatedly calls for lineitem veto power in order to tame spending
delay costs us over a billion dollars a day in additional borrowing
bush may be a strong leader in the war on terrorism but on budget deficits he is missinginaction
conservative think tanks like the heritage foundation and cato institute have criticized bush for his big increases in spending which far exceed those of the clinton era
if so they have all the tools to stop it more tools than any political party in modern times
could it be that republicans have fallen in love with big government
mr chairman as the members know the payments in lieu of taxes program or pilt as it is called compensates units of general government for property taxes that they otherwise lose due to federal ownership of the land within that locality
unfortunately despite the local benefits to this program in all 50 states a large majority of the congressional districts full funding of pilt as is authorized by law is simply not a commitment that this congress has been willing to meet in the past years
my home state of wyoming has been denied over 75 million in pilt funding over the past 10 years that would have been used to make our communities safer healthier and cleaner
it is also important to emphasize that this amendment still allows the department of interior to spend 10 million more for administrative costs than they did in 2005
it is very important to every single state in the country
shortchanging local communities by underfunding pilt is simply bad policy and i hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this amendment
mr chairman today i rise in support of this amendment to strike the language which would once again delay full implementation and rightful implementation of countryoforigin labeling for meat and meat products
congress authorized mandatory cool in the 2002 farm bill and delaying it further is an injustice to american farmers ranchers and consumers
the usda is in place to protect us
as a housewife and a mother i would gladly pay a few extra cents on every pound of hamburger or on every pound of beef that i buy if i knew that that beef was produced in the united states because i would have a sense of safety that my family was eating meat that was inspected because all american beef is inspected
america s agriculture industry produces some of the safest highest quality products in the world
first the 5year republican budget will result in a deficit of 376 billion in 2006 44 million over the president s projection
i suppose the republican budget proposal deserves a little credit for hiking its deficit projection as it at least includes 50 million in 2006 for the wars in afghanistan and in iraq
the realistic figure over the next 10 years in addition to the 80 billion that we just passed in the supplemental is likely to be 384 billion
to pay for its misguided policies the house budget resolution cuts nondefense discretionary spending by 12 billion below the amount needed in fiscal 2006 just to maintain current spending levels and it cuts spending on mandatory domestic programs by 8 billion
to add insult to injury the republican budget provides 18 billion in additional tax cuts
these misguided tax cuts will actually cost much more when the tax cuts actually expire in 2010
in fact 97 percent of these tax cuts will benefit taxpayers with incomes above 200 000
the house resolution shrouds its cuts in darkness leaving the american people to wonder what vital programs will find their way to the chopping block next
in contrast the spratt alternative budget as well as the congressional black caucus alternative budget that we will consider tomorrow focus national spending on priorities that benefit all americans and get us on the road to economic recovery
let me speak particularly about the budget developed by the congressional black caucus which corrects the irresponsible fiscal and economic policies contained in the house budget resolution by supporting existing programs that are essential to closing disparities creating opportunities and helping our citizens build their future
importantly the congressional black caucus budget supports these priorities while also meeting our obligation to our troops in iraq and in afghanistan
in the end one can only conclude that the republican budget balances itself on the backs of americans who can least afford it
if you want to poke a hole in the ground in oklahoma or you want to do it in land or even in anwr where they have the technology not to cause the spills that is fine
they say well let us do it in the gulf of mexico so we are going to do to mexicans what we want to do for us
if you poke a hole in the earth you are going to get oil up
you go poking holes in that the economy of california is critical to tourism
we have the best weather and we invite you to come spend your money in california but you are not going to come if we start poking holes in the bottom of the pacific along the coast as the gentlewoman from california mrs capps xz4000620 says
we have got the most beautiful lagoons in the world and wetlands
mr chairman this is the third year that i have been in the congress
a lot of our friends on the other side of the aisle will talk about benevolence and their belief in families and families having strong values and yet they will vote tomorrow night to cut child care assistance
and the other side of the aisle will talk about their belief in social security and their faith in that program and their refusal to touch it and then they will cut ssi payments which are a major part of social security
a lot of our friends on the other side of the aisle will talk about their commitment to housing and then they will vote to eliminate one of the most effective housing programs in this country
this is a debate about exactly who we will ask to sacrifice in this country
there is no question we have asked our veterans to sacrifice an enormous amount and they belong in a category of their own but there is another class of americans who we also ask to sacrifice in this budget
we ask the most vulnerable people the people in our society who are working and living by the sweat of their brow every day
we ask them to give up so much in this budget and there is an irony because we have heard it said by the chairman and various other members on the other side of the aisle we have heard it said that people want these tax cuts and they will trade these programs off for the prevalence and the prevailing of these tax cuts
it recognizes the tremendous need that exists in our country to assist those 2 million people who are currently in jails and prisons and the 650 000 who return home every year
it rolls back the tax breaks that were given in 2001 and 2003 to those individuals with adjusted gross incomes of more than 200 000
people in my community say provide the services do nt give to the rich
madam chairman i rise in strong support of the slaughtershaysdicksleachprice amendment
madam chairman i rise in strong support of slaughtershaysdicksleach amendment to increase funding for the national endowment for the arts nea and the national endowment for the humanities neh
as our economy continues to grow it is important that the arts remain a priority in our communities
as former president kennedy stated i am certain that after the dust of centuries has passed over our cities we too will be remembered not for our victories or defeats in battles or in politics but for our contribution to the human spirit though some would consider our economy hard pressed for such funding as this i implore my colleagues to consider the profound influence of artscentric businesses
while some of the country s concerns only affect a minority of people the involvement in the arts spans all walks of life
in my district the arts create a sense of nationalism for the state and the rest of the country
for what would chicago be without the architecture of the sears tower the flourishing talent in second city or the abundant museums
in my district there are 2 989 art related businesses and 44 709 people that make their daily living working in the arts
artscentric businesses supply 578 000 businesses in the united states and employ 297 million people
these future creative workers come in the form of our children
the arts help in a child s brain development and their creative skills
a country without a full expression of the arts would truly create a void in a child s development
in my district there is a wealth of diversity
madam chairman if we minimize these possibilities in the arts we will be limiting the liberty of our imagination
i request my colleagues to join me in support of this amendment
mr chairman i rise in opposition to this amendment
the argument that has been made in support of the amendment is that the price of natural gas is increased to the consumer
but one of the points that has been overlooked here today is that this congress passed an energy bill that provided initial financial incentives to drill in the central and western gulf and that is a valid attempt by this congress to address this issue
the beaches in florida are a pristine treasure not to be experimented with
so we should not sacrifice or risk the florida beaches or the california beaches to get a small proportion of gas that can be more easily achieved and which this congress is promoting through deepwater drilling in the central and western coast
i am concerned that the united states is losing critical expertise in aeronautics research and development
mr chairman i rise in strong opposition to this budget
in that sense it should reflect the values and priorities of americans
by calling for 18 trillion in tax cuts primarily to the wealthiest americans the president s budget compromises both our ability to face our most pressing challenges and strengthen the social safety net that might rescue those living in poverty
experts estimate that over the next 75 years the cost of the tax cuts for the top 1 percent of households alone is nearly equivalent to the shortfall in social security this at a time when another 13 million americans fell into poverty last year
its growth in recent years is simply a reflection of its success in providing care for the thousands of americans who would otherwise have joined the ranks of the uninsured during the economic downturn
this year the governor in my state of connecticut proposed increased copayments and premiums for families receiving schip
if the president succeeds in cutting medicaid there will be no way for states to make up the shortfall
i am pleased to join him for the first time in my capacity as ranking member of the agriculture appropriations subcommittee
it has been a pleasure working with the gentleman from texas and his staff to put together the 2006 agriculture appropriations bill and with the gentleman from california mr lewis xz4002392 and the gentleman from wisconsin mr obey xz4003000 as we worked in full committee to get here today
let me also compliment the chairman on doing the very best with limited resources in this bill
although some might be surprised to learn i have nearly 400 farms in my district ranging from dairy farms to horticulture and aquaculture to orchards and vegetable cultivation
in fact the first experiment station in the united states still does cuttingedge research in new haven
another area that i have spent time on is determining how we can best secure our food supply something in which every american has a stake
in addition urban areas like new haven rely on feeding programs for women infants and children for schools for seniors and for some of the disabled living on the edge of poverty
yesterday was national hunger awareness day and our subcommittee is certainly aware that the president s budget predicted an increase in the use of food stamps in 2006
unfortunately this bill does not provide enough funding to maintain current participation in the commodity supplemental food program
ensuring that these programs are funded is in my opinion among the very serious moral obligations of government
it is statement of values of principles and priorities a moral document so that when we discuss the bill and how it allocates 168 billion for usda i believe we must think of it in those terms
unfortunately in some of these area this bill falls short
this bill makes headway in reversing cuts made by the president
i am afraid that this funding shortfall will lead to longterm deficiencies in rural infrastructure
of course this bill covers the funding of one of the most important agencies in our entire government the food and drug administration within the department of health and human services
this agency had many problems over the last year from the recalls of bextra and vioxx to hearings in which its drug safety scientists have been at odds with the senior management of fda
i thank the chairman for accepting the amendment that i offered in subcommittee to withhold 5 percent of the funds from the food and drug administration s central offices until the head of the agency testifies regarding their budget request
in 2001 the drug industry spent 27 billion on directtoconsumer advertising but the fda office charged with ensuring that those ads are accurate was funded at less than 1 million 884 000 to be precise
thirtyfive other countries that we trade with including canada mexico members of the european union already have a country of origin labeling system in place
this law not only benefits those in dire need around the world many of whom are starving to death it benefits our farmers and our maritime shippers by utilizing our farm products and sources of transportation and i hope that we can bring that funding level up before this bill becomes law
i am pleased that the president s proposals to change formula funding for agriculture research institutions and to alter the funding stream for the food and safety inspection service through user fees were not included in the bill
i also appreciate the chairman s working with the democratic members of the subcommittee to begin to fund last year s specialty crop competitiveness act to enhance specialty crops such as fruits vegetables tree nuts dried fruits and nursery crops in this bill and for the farmers market promotion program a function that can expand the farmerconsumer relationship in many areas of our country
failure to adequately invest in these programs will have serious longterm consequences for our nation
again i have enjoyed working with the chairman and his staff and i believe that we can take pride in the progress we have made in significantly improving the bill over the proposals that we did receive from the president
let me just say that i want to make it clear that what we tried to do with regard to the food and drug administration was to call attention to the series of crises that in fact have been rampant over the last several months whether it is vioxx or whether it is bextra or whether it is the postmarketing studies that were to occur that never did occur or the slighting i believe of our committee in not coming forward and having the director come before our committee
what we tried to do is to create a balance and that is to provide additional funding for the office of drug safety to look at directtoconsumer advertising in order to try to protect the public and to provide additional funding to create some more infrastructure
i too believe that we should have made in order the amendments offered by the gentleman from new york mr hinchey xz4001780
really what should be happening is fda should be coming to the congress for authority in order to be able to change the labeling that in fact ultimately protects the public interest and that we ought to have the opportunity and they ought to come and demand from us authority in order to do postmarketing surveys about the risks of some of the products that are on the market
i think that it was a mistake for us not to do that but i think we need to continue this effort about trying to provide the agency which has the regulatory power over the pharmaceutical industry to develop some spine in order to be able to protect the public interest
given limited resources i think we have tried to do a good job to meet the needs of rural america our nation s farmers and other accounts funded in the bill
as we begin to move through the amendment process i look forward to trying to address several areas in the bill that i believe could use some improvement
consumers in this country need the information to make informed decisions for their safety and the safety of their families and i hope that the house will reconsider the country of origin labeling provision in this bill
i am hoping that we can look at an amendment process where we can improve the bill even more in just a few critical areas
i would hope that with regard to the food and drug administration that in fact we will be able to provide them with the authorities that i think the nation would believe that they desperately need and that is to be able to do postmarketing studies on drug products on the market and also to change labels that would need changing in order to protect the citizenry of this country
madam chairman i rise in support of this amendment
i think that in connecticut for instance i will talk about sudden oak death which has been identified recently
this effort is about being able to trace back contaminated product in the event of a recall
in my opening comments i said that i believed that this bill is about what the house of representatives and members who are part of this effort have been asked to do and we have been asked to protect the public interest on a whole variety of measures and in this case we are talking about life and death
mr chairman it would seem to me that the regular order of the house would be to allow legislation that in fact meets the definition or the goal of the mission that we have been entrusted with
i wish that the committee on rules would have made this amendment in order because it is so critical to public safety
i concur with my colleague when he says if it is not made in order then we have to concede the point of order
i am mindful that there may be scientists whose expertise deserves to be presented to an advisory committee and nothing in this amendment as i understand it precludes these individuals from being asked to testify before a committee
surely in a country that is renowned for its scientific and medical expertise i think we have 125 medical schools in the united states that it is possible to find scientists without conflicts of interest to advise the fda and to protect the public health
i mean we are not talking about in perpetuity
am i right in my assessment of that
the problem with the funding in this conference report is that it fails to meet that threshold
the national institutes of health where this subcommittee made historic progress doubling our investment in medical research
health professions are cut in half
this bill fails to invest in any of the priorities important to the american people
and the american people are tired of the congress spending trillions in tax cuts for the wealthiest americans at the same time they are told we simply do not have the resources to invest in things that impact their daily lives
they will tell you they want something that makes a difference in their lives and their family s lives
i also might say that there has been bipartisan support in the past because together we could come together and increase the opportunity whether it was idea whether it was for lowincome assistance whether it was for education and it was a rallying point on a bipartisan basis to do something for the american people
mr speaker when we defeated this bill in november it cut health research college loans and lowincome energy assistance
if anything once you consider the additional 14 billion in cuts that the republican leadership intends to impose with a 1 percent governmentwide acrosstheboard cut this bill is worse
i do recognize that this bill includes many programs that the president had slated for elimination especially in the area of education and community services block grants
we are the richest country in the world
that is as i said in november ask any middle class family today what is important to them tax cuts for wealthy americans or things like lowering the cost of health care of heating their homes this winter or sending their kids to college
they will tell you every time that all they want is something that makes a difference in their lives and in their family s lives
despite some occasional overheated rhetoric the fiscal year 2006 budget resolution is in fact a modest attempt by a reasonable majority to hold down the growth of government spending
our security spending must therefore take priority and in turn we must make difficult but necessary choices about nonsecurity spending
it meets our needs at home and abroad without raising taxes which would stifle our economy or wasting money which undermines the hard work the american people did to earn those tax dollars in the first place
these critics assured us that our budget would bust a hole in the deficit
and yet last year the deficit came in 109 billion smaller than experts originally thought it would specifically because of the increased economic growth directly attributed to republican tax relief passed since 2001
so in short mr chairman the economic data coming in every month speaks to the wisdom of the fiscal policies of the republican majority
what one wonders do they think that the 671 billion in additional spending that they propose at the committee on the budget markup would do
but again so is the idea that raising 3924 billion in new taxes as committee on the budget democrats proposed just last week would somehow help the economy to create jobs
as always the chairman and his staff have included me in the process of putting together the bill and for that i am very appreciative
now this may sound like just a matter of fact but it makes all of the difference in the world in our national parks on whether they can operate properly
this year the budget did include the funding to meet these costs and i applaud the chairman for including them in the bill and i hope that the administration will continue to propose full coverage of uncontrollable costs in future budget submittals
the 30 million the gentleman from north carolina chairman taylor has added to the 22 million increase contained in the budget will mean a second consecutive year of very healthy increases in the park service operations budget and i want to pledge to continue to help my chairman to make sure that the park service partnership program stays on track towards better management
the biggest concern that i have in this bill is the reduction in spending for clean water activities
if you compare the proposed funding in 2006 to the level in 2004 there is a decrease of nearly 500 million in just 2 years
the federal government should not be retreating in this fashion from such an important responsibility
i must also register my disagreement with the decision to continue to retreat from the commitment made in 2000 to increase funding for the conservation trust fund
it is gratifying to note that we seem to have come to a consensus on funding on the nea and the neh in that this bill provides level funding compared to this year
i again will be joining with what i predict will be a majority of my colleagues in support of an amendment to increase both of these endowments
we provided 500 million for both fiscal year 2004 and 2005 in emergency funding to prevent the painful borrowing from other interior and forest service programs that has occurred in past years when more fires than were expected depleted the annual firefighting budget
although neither the president s budget nor this bill contains such contingency funding for 2006 there is an increase of 120 million over the nonemergency spending level in fiscal year 2005
i hope this is sufficient to meet the challenge of what could be a busy fire season with estimates of higher than average threats in several areas of the country including washington state and the northwest
i also agree with the decision to restore some of the cuts in the budget to the indian school and construction account
i also want to commend mike stephens on mr obey s staff and pete modaff of my staff for their part in helping to put together this bill
i hoped we could do better but this is a difficult situation that we are in and i appreciate the cooperation the bipartisan spirit in which this bill was created
madam chairman i yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from wisconsin mr obey xz4003000 the distinguished ranking democratic member of the full appropriations committee who has played a very constructive role along with the gentleman from california chairman lewis in trying to help us move this bill forward today
the increase would be offset by reductions in various accounts
i have sensed over the last few years that the battle over this amendment has cooled and we can move on knowing that a healthy majority in the house agrees that these two important programs deserve our strong financial support
each of the nea and neh grants is modest in size but it is vitally important to the communities they reach
the federal money serves as a catalyst to draw in private contributions
in fact we now know that higher levels of federal money will leverage even greater private support
in 1996 congress reduced the nea by 39 percent and neh by 36 percent
mr chairman i rise in reluctant opposition to this amendment and i yield myself such time as i may consume
but i believe that the 3 million increase that pilt receives in this bill compared to 2005 should be defended considering the many other programs facing cuts
in a healthier budget climate i would gladly support funding pilt at an amount higher than the 230 million contained in this bill
yes i am in opposition
mr chairman i yield myself such time as i may consume and i rise in opposition to this amendment
first of all we had no hearings in the committee about this
we have to bring in the parties and give people good information about what this is all about
this amendment came up for the first time in the full committee
the priorities in this budget are all wrong
can we honestly look them in the eye and tell them that we are more concerned with millionaires and billionaires than with struggling middleclass americans brave soldiers the sick the poor and the hungry
every child in america knows that you must save first before you splurge
soon they will ask for their fourth credit increase in four years to enable the continuation of this reckless abuse of hardearned taxpayer dollars
the payasyougo rule or paygo would solve the issue of unlimited spending by requiring new spending to be offset in other areas of the budget
the paygo rule would essentially require us to stop and think about how we are going to pay for things before we hastily enact them and end up in this illfated fiscal jam
not surprisingly however many of my collegues have insisted on exempting the billions of dollars in tax givebacks from the paygo rule
there is no good reason particularly when we are running record deficits to reject the very successful practice we used in the 1990 s to produce record surpluses
and we have been successful in our partnership with the states ensuring that millions of americans are able to go to school to the doctor and to work
however in their spending schemes my republican colleagues neglect our obligation to the states
these cuts would roll back health care coverage and protections for millions of americans including the elderly in nursing homes individuals with disabilities infants and working families
also hospitals physicians and other safety net providers will face payment reductions threatening their viability and these reductions will mean more lost jobs in our communities
the inspector general has identified and senior epa officials have acknowledged that in fy2003 there was a funding shortfall of 1749 million and it has been widely reported that the funding shortfall for fy2004 reached approximately 250 million
community development block grant is a mouthful but in a little town like freer texas it is concerned with holes the holes of abandoned septic systems where several children have drowned and they do not have a reliable sewer system there so they have used the community development block grant program for the health and safety of that community
in mcallen texas in austin texas it is the principal source of funding to help with affordable housing for seniors for those with disabilities for poor people to have a chance to share in rehabilitated housing some new housing
in many of these communities the dollars are going to food banks they are going to assist in a variety of social programs that are stretched and strained that municipalities could not do without community development block grant projects
the reason we are faced with this kind of challenge as with the other challenges in this budget it does not have anything to do with osama bin laden it has to do with the decisions that were made down the street on pennsylvania avenue and that were implemented by this republican congress
well this administration thinks that only the little people like the folks in freer texas only the little people ought to bear the burden of its fiscal irresponsibility
we have never had a more fiscally irresponsible administration than the one we have in office today that has driven the deficit to the highest level in american history and then turns to poor people in freer texas to kids that are trying to get a decent education to our veterans and says you bear the burden
it makes a mockery of the american value of shared sacrifice in time of war
this budget says to the person sitting here safely at home who makes 1 million in dividend income this year that you can keep every penny of your 220 000 tax break that the house republican leadership has given you recently every penny of that tax break
but on the other hand it says to millions of america s veterans that we are going to direct a 14 billion cut in veterans programs over the next 5 years
where is the american value the american family value in those priorities
to a millionaire making every dime on dividend income you can keep your 220 000 tax cut but to a veteran who may be coming back from iraq in fact a soldier today who may be tomorrow s veteran or next year s veteran we are going to make you wait longer for health care in our va hospitals you are not going to get the care you deserve and you earned by risking your life for your country
so in effect every member of this house who votes for this bill is voting for a real cut in health care services education services and monthly disability pension checks for america s veterans
mr chairman i urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to reject the values of this budget reject the slap in the face of millions of american veterans while coddling the wealthiest in our society who are going to enjoy that 220 000 tax break they are making by their riskless dividend income of 1 million this year
vote no on this unfair slap in the face to america s veterans
fact number three in this same budget someone making a million dollars a year in dividend income will get to keep every penny of his 220 000 tax break
this bill is inadequate and it is unconscionable in its treatment of veterans
because this amount would not begin to cover employee wage increases and other inflationary costs it amounts to a substantial cut in funding and thus would unavoidably result in a reduction of critical medical care services for our nation s sick and disabled veterans
in addition we understand that h con
we think cutting veterans benefit programs is unconscionable especially at a time when america s sons and daughters are being wounded and killed every day in iraq
the american legion believes va s own admission that the cost of doing business increases annually about 1314 percent because of federal pay increases and inflation in the health care arena
it appears this pattern of shortchanging va medical care continues in the 109th congress
the american legion recognizes and appreciates the bradley amendment adopted by the committee but believes it falls well short of the total funding needed in va medical care
clearly both of these amendments are in the best interest of veterans and their families
in fact the dav the vfw say it is a grossly inadequate budget it is an unconscionable budget especially at a time when america s sons and daughters are being killed and wounded every day in iraq
it locks in massive deficits for as far as the eye can see adding hundreds of billions of dollars to a huge national debt that will slow our nation s economic growth put social security benefits at risk and bury your children in a sea of red ink for the rest of their lives
large deficits and underinvestment in education research and health care are not prescriptions for a healthy economic future they are prescriptions for economic stagnation and decline
in my opinion this budget is immoral
that fails the values test of every major religious faith in our society
i would imagine that budget item wo nt be discussed by supporters of this bill in their veterans day speeches this november
in my book that s not a very respectful way of honoring thy father and mother
to the working woman i met yesterday who works hard to help troubled youth in my hometown in texas this budget says your housing program will be cut making it more difficult for her to find decent housing on a limited income
asking seniors students veterans and hardworking families to sacrifice so those in the top onetenth of one percent of income in america can keep all of their recent tax cuts does not pass the fairness test
by refusing once again to require tax cuts to be paid for my house republican colleagues are endorsing the largest deficits in american history for the third year in a row
it is ironic that those who are condemning the personal debt of citizens have been the architects of three consecutive years of the largest federal deficits in american history
burdening america s middle class with greater debt and under investing in education and health care for working families is neither fair nor fiscally responsible
mr chairman this can be done in a positive way
but most importantly we need to send a message to the opec nations that we are tired of a handful of opec oil ministers putting their hands around the necks of family budgets and businesses here in america
i want to relate a similar problem that we have in my area in michigan not directly in my district but it impinges on my district
the difficulty my area is a case of a tribe which does not live in the area in which it is seeking to have land placed in trust for it in a community that welcomes it because they think that there will be economic development
but in fact it is going to have serious impact on areas in my district and on surrounding communities
there will be no tax on the land and this results in a good deal of problems that the local communities and state will not have the funds to take care of
i believe it is very important to put a limitation on offreservation gambling and on cases where a tribe moves into an area which is nowhere near its home and claims that to be an area where they can have land placed in trust and they then build casinos and other facilities
it creates particular problems for example for merchants who may be running a supermarket or a gas station and suddenly there is somebody new in town who is offering the same services but does not have to pay taxes
in that sense i support the effort to put some regulation on this
i am not rising in support of the amendment
i have been involved in discussions with the previous speakers and they have much the same problems we do but i have also discussed it with the gentleman from california mr pombo xz4003220 who chairs the committee on resources and he has assured me and the rest of us that he has a bill that will deal with this problem and that will provide free and open debate on the house floor
rather than deal with it in an appropriations bill it is my preference that we not consider these amendments at this point but defer to the gentleman from california chairman pombo and await the chairman s bill which he has said that he will attempt to get out of committee and onto the floor before the august recess
mr chairman i rise in opposition to the budget resolution and in support of the democratic substitute
in the last 3 years the republican congress has enacted three tax cuts resulting in the three largest deficits in history all the while on top of the record 400plus billion deficits and 24 trillion of additional debt
if this is an example of what a conservative philosophy is we can not afford this fiscal mess any more and the one thing we can always say about the republican budget is we will be forever in your debt
the cbo the congressional budget office has attested to all of these figures but none of them are honestly reflected in this resolution
but while leaving a sea of red ink for future generations what does this budget do to the middle class who are facing rises costs in health care and college tuition
it is a fascinating approach to investing in america s future
to think that the policies or the stewardship of the republican congress over the last 4 years has led to 24 trillion in additional debt three consecutive years of the largest deficits in the history of the country and all under the rubric of being a conservative it is a fascinating approach and all the while we are cutting health care investments in america cutting college tuition assistance to middle class families opening doors to their future it is a fascinating approach nobody has ever really thought of as a way to build america s future as one that is brighter
once again after we pass it here and we are going to stand and give our speeches the conferees from both parties both chambers are going to go to the conference and in the dark of night this provision is going to be stripped from the bill that would help our senior citizens and our taxpayers get affordable drugs at affordable prices
the pharmaceutical companies will come in and do their bidding and this congress will turn around and heed their interests
here we have an attempt to make sure that the congress and the voice of the american people is clear on the issue of funding for reimportation and in the dark of night mark my words they will strip this out as they did last year as they did the year before and ground hog day will come to the united states congress
for the members who want it to be clear i would just hope the american people have an opportunity to watch what happens in the dark of night so we do not repeat ground hog day around here
the argument that we are going to make in the next hour has to do more with how this fits into the overall economic priorities of the united states
this in my view is perhaps one of the most important reasons for passing this budget because as we look at where america is today as we look at the economic challenges we are facing it is clear that we need to have a strong and responsible fiscal policy that encourages economic growth that controls spending and by controlling spending brings down our deficit over time reassures capital markets and sends the message that the american economy there is no question mr chairman that the challenges we are facing today are substantial the deficit is a serious problem and the proposed remedy contained in this budget resolution involves some very strong medicine and for many individual members of the house some very very difficult policy decisions
we need to pass this resolution because the broad parameters of spending that are the real budget resolution the blueprint that is the substance of this budget resolution is precisely the vehicle we need to move in the right direction to make sure that we control spending and create the opportunity to continue the economic expansion which is only now just beginning
nowhere is that more evident than in my district but at the same time there are very encouraging signs
we know we have been running a deficit because first of all understandably we have been in the throes of a recession and we have never run a surplus during a recession
second of all we have never run a surplus in wartime
and even as we have been undergoing a very difficult episode a combination of a slowdown which began during the last administration coupled with the substantial damage to our economy that occurred in the wake of 911 at the same time we have had to take on a war on terrorism that was not of our choosing
we also recognize that a lax fiscal policy could further weaken the us dollar in global markets and undermine its standing as the reserve currency of the world economic system
this budget vehicle provides fiscal discipline that will strengthen investor confidence in the renascent economy and act as a powerful tonic to continue on the path of economic growth
what it does in a nutshell is it cuts the deficit in half over a 5year period
if we can continue to grow the economy and grow the economy faster than the national debt then that will be a source of confidence and a source of growth in the economy
mr chairman that is precisely what this budget resolution does in a sound responsible way
mr chairman i will have further remarks in support of this resolution
any member of the house who is serious about controlling the deficit about maintaining the forward movement in the economy growing jobs and the social justice that could only come through economic growth should be prepared to strongly support this budget resolution
mr chairman a couple of points i think need to be made in response to the interesting presentations that were made on the other side
the truth is economic policies that have been adopted by this congress working with the administration have been successful in helping the us economy rebound from the recession into a sustained expansion with strong growth in the gross domestic product and payroll jobs
during 2004 real gdp grew 44 percent the strongest annual performance in 5 years one of the strongest growth performances of the past 20 years belying the glooming forecast we have heard on the other side
more americans mr chairman are working today than at anytime in our nation s history and employment is at a record level of more than 140 million
the unemployment rate in february was 54 percent lower than the averages for each of the last three decades
last month we saw employment gains of 262 000 jobs more than a quarter of a million new jobs in the month of february alone
this suggests that there is clearly forward motion in the economy
those who last year invoked the great depression in describing recent economic conditions have been after all often favoring policies that would increase government intervention in the economy
economic growth in europe is generally slower than that of the united states
the unemployment rate in europe is much higher than in the us in january of 2005 europe had an unemployment rate of 88 percent substantially higher than our us level of 54 percent
the fact is by following on a path of high growth and low taxes we are moving the economy in the right direction and ultimately if we are prepared to put in place fiscal policies that restrain the deficit that will allow us to grow the economy in the right direction
i suppose that is true if we look at this in a purely static green eyeshade perspective but what really matters with the national debt as i said before is its size relative to the economy
the fact remains the national debt today is significantly lower relative to the economy than it was in the early 1990s when their party controlled congress and controlled the reins of spending
we have heard about record deficits but here again we propose in our budget resolution to cut the deficits in half relative to the size of the economy
we have also heard from the other side that they are concerned that there is not enough room in this budget to deal with the problem of the amt
this budget put lays in place creates the groundwork for us to go forward later this year and take a look at fundamental tax reform
anyone who has studied this issue carefully has to concede that for the longterm health of the social security system we have a choice of either going forward with a laissezfaire approach that has long been advocated on the other side and ultimately have to see truly draconian cuts as a result or if we act now we can put in place reforms that will allow us to preserve existing benefits also provide a solid retirement for the next generation and do so by improving the rate of return within the social security system
nothing in this budget resolution is inconsistent with that initiative
i am very very pleased to address the concerns raised by the gentleman from new york about the supposed monolithic government in the congress that has worked with a republican administration to do some things that the gentleman finds distasteful
the fact is our economic policies and our economic challenges today are at least partially the result of the gridlock that existed before the last election in which the senate was at least not able to move forward on key issues like a stimulus bill like an energy bill like tort reform that directly speak to our economic health because of the gridlock implicit in the rules that gave the minority a veto over many of these provisions
at the same time it is obvious from the laundry list we have heard tonight if the other side were in the majority we would be contemplating a saturnalia of new spending
i can think of a lot of things that i would love to spend money on in the federal budget but the fact remains we need to set tough priorities if we are going to get back to a balanced budget
regardless of any concern about any particular program we need to move forward with the broad outline of spending that this resolution fairly lays out and put it in place so that we are able to get to a balanced budget over time as we reassure capital markets that we are truly committed to controlling spending without raising taxes
mr chairman the proposed reductions in medicaid under this budget resolution plan are unacceptable
the budget resolution will require 14 20 billion in cuts from the program over the next five years and it will almost certainly lead to changes to state funding rules administrative payment cuts and prescription drug payment changes
this comes at a time when poverty is up wages are down and the number of uninsured americans is at a record in our nation s history
in many states medicaid costs exceed education costs
in california our medicaid program medical matches every dollar of federal funding with a dollar in state funding
this shared commitment is critical since the state receives 20 billion in federal funding
reducing federal medicaid funding to states at a time of rising health care costs increased numbers of uninsured and states increasing difficulties in paying their share of medicaid costs is bound to force states to reduce coverage and increase the numbers of uninsured
uninsured patients without access to care will instead seek treatment in emergency rooms further burdening an already overtaxed system
this means there will be at least 119 billion in direct cuts to safetynet providers nationwide
this budget resolution advances this march to folly for so many americans and that s why 242 national groups and 785 state groups including the national governors association and the national association of counties oppose changes in medicaid
we have an obligation to care for the less fortunate and the congress should not be cutting critical health care and other services from those in need
rather we should maintain our partnership with the states to ensure that medicaid benefits remain available for the most vulnerable in our society
i urge all my colleagues in the house to oppose the budget resolution
mr speaker i rise in opposition to hr 3010 the fiscal year 2006 appropriations act for the departments of labor health and human services and education
as the only former state schools chief serving in congress i know firsthand the devastating effects that these education cuts will have
last november president bush made a campaign promise to increase funding for pell grants and invest in higher education
unfortunately this bill freezes pell grants and other student financial aid programs for the fourth year in a row even though college costs have increased by 34 percent since 2001
america needs a highly trained and educated workforce to compete in the global marketplace of the 21st century but hr 3010 slashes funding for education at all levels and strains school budgets
mr chairman i rise in opposition to h con
res 95 and in support of both the substitute amendment offered by the gentleman from south carolina mr spratt xz4003860 and the amendment of the gentleman from wisconsin mr obey xz4003000
if we thought it was ridiculous to grant tax cuts to millionaires while the deficit soars how about cutting veterans programs in the middle of the war
madam chairman i rise in strong opposition to both the peterson amendment and the istook amendment
if passed these amendments will trample on a longstanding bipartisan moratorium on offshore oil and gas development that was initiated by former president bush continued under president clinton and endorsed in president bush s fy 2006 budget
mr peterson s amendment strikes liquefied natural gas lng from the moratorium while mr istook s amendment calls for the entire moratorium in the eastern gulf of mexico on both oil and gas to vanish poof when the united states meets an arbitrary percentage of crude oil imports 667 percent
every year since 1982 congress has included language in the interior and environment appropriations bill to prevent the department of interior from using funds for leasing preleasing and related activities in sensitive coastal waters
the money spent by tourists pay the bills and put food on the table for the people living in these communities
in conclusion madam chairman the peterson and istook amendments should be defeated and i urge a no vote on both of them
madam chairman i come to the floor today in strong support of slaughter amendment to the fy06 interior appropriations act that will increase funding for the national endowment of the arts by 10 million and for the national endowment for the humanities by 5 million
this amendment is needed to continue the critical work of the nea and the neh in providing americans with access to the arts and an understanding of american culture legacy history and civics
by funding the arts and humanities in every congressional district and giving priority to rural and underserved communities the nea and the neh ensure that americans across the country can discover and share these treasures while instilling a sense of historical and cultural heritage in their children
in addition to providing important cultural experiences nationwide the nea and the neh also support economic growth and tourism nationwide
the nonprofit arts industry generates 134 billion in economic activity supporting 485 million full time equivalent positions
in my district there are 1 801 arts related businesses which employ 5 370 employees
many of these businesses receive grants from the nea and play crucial roles in increasing tourism in my district
i urge all of my colleagues to support increases in funding for the nea and the neh and to oppose any proposal to cut these valuable programs
mr chairman as the chairman is aware i have raised concerns about the plans to build a new usgs laboratory in santa cruz
actually i am thrilled to have usgs moving into my district but the usgs will benefit greatly from the synergy of other local marine science facilities in the area including the university of california s long marine lab and the united states government s national marine fisheries service lab
but in the development of the plans for the lab we run into contradictory budget numbers and laboratory configurations that have dogged final approval for getting this project off the ground and it has really been a problem
and i appreciate your consideration of being willing to work with me to facilitate the meeting of the principals involved in this project and resolve some of these questions once and for all
mr chairman i rise to engage in a colloquy with the distinguished gentleman from texas mr bonilla xz4000370 chairman of the subcommittee
they have done a tremendous job in putting together a balanced bill
as a point of clarification i would like to verify my understanding that the committee s intent is that the organic transition program although proposed to be funded through the national research initiative will continue to be managed as it was in fiscal year 2004 and fiscal year 2005 as part of the integrated organic program
madam chairman unfortunately i did not get a chance to offer an amendment with mr reyes xz4003370 to provide an additional 10 million for a critical program in the interiorepa appropriations bill
the funds would have been used for architectural engineering planning design construction and related activities in connection with the construction of high priority water and wastewater facilities in the area of the united statesmexico border after consultation with the appropriate border commission this is the section of the epa s state and tribal assistance grants program that funds the border environment infrastructure fund beif
the usgs appropriation in this bill is currently 39 million more than the fy2005 appropriation and 41 million more than the president s request
the record should reflect that we did not intend for the usgs s national waterquality assessment nawqa program to be impacted by the reduction in usgs s appropriation
nawqa carries out very important work collecting and analyzing data and information in more than 50 major river basins and aquifers across the nation in order to develop longterm information on streams ground water and aquatic ecosystems in support of sound management and policy decisions
this critical program would have been shielded from the 10 million cut in usgs appropriations
in imperial county california the new river carries raw sewage from mexico through the town of calexico and air pollution from mexicali contributes to the worst childhood asthma rates in the state
a modest increase in funding for the beif would begin to improve the situation
the beif which was established by the north american development bank to administer grant resources provided by the epa helps finance the construction of water and wastewater projects in the usmexico border region
it is designed to reduce project debt to a manageable level in cases where users would otherwise face undue financial hardship
beif grants have played an important role in the successful construction of water conservation projects in the cameron irrigation district in texas a wastewater project in heber california a wastewater collection and treatment project in patagonia arizona and a sewer system and wastewater treatment plant in the salem and ogaz communities in new mexico
all projects supported by the beif must have a health andor ecological benefit in communities on the us side of the border
all projects must also be certified in a rigorous vetting process undertaken by the border environment cooperation commission
the bipartisan border governors joint declaration last year called for a substantial increase in funding for the program
while many important programs in the interiorepa appropriations bill have been shortchanged the lack of funding for beif is particularly troubling
the border region is in desperate need of assistance
communities in the border region struggle with some of the highest poverty rates in the nation as well as air and water pollution often originating in northern mexico that contributes to severe public health problems
according to the usmexico border health commission the border region includes three of the ten poorest counties in the united states and twentyone counties that have been designated as economically distressed areas
the commission also reports that approximately 432 000 people live in 1 200 colonias in texas and new mexico which are unincorporated semirural communities that are characterized by substandard housing and unsafe public drinking water or wastewater systems
if the border region were made the 51st state in the union it would rank last in access to health care second in death rates due to hepatitis last in per capita income and first in the numbers of school children living in poverty according to the commission the good neighbor environmental board an independent us presidential advisory committee that operates under the federal advisory committee act recommends restoring beif to its mid1990s funding level of 100 million dollars
there are currently 105 certified clean water projects in the pipeline waiting for funding
examples of the many certified projects that could be carried out in disadvantaged communities if the beif had an appropriate funding level include waterwastewater systems improvements in brawley california a wastewater project in nogales arizona a solid waste project in don 6a ana county new mexico and a water conservation project in brownsville texas
i will continue fighting to increase appropriations for the border environment infrastructure fund and protect communities in the border region
it makes cuts of 7 percent in nondefense discretionary
finally we are actually doing what families would do when a large deficit looms in the future though we need to do far more than that
we are going to have to do much much more in the future
if we are inching toward bankruptcy in social security we are flat running toward it with medicare
and when you look at the liabilities there we added 7 trillion in unfunded liabilities with the medicare prescription drug bill for example that we are going to have to somehow deal with that our kids and grandkids are going to have to somehow deal with
we need more revenue coming in
there is a culture of spending in this institution that is just difficult to stop
this alternative budget makes some progress toward that end but i again want to stress this is kid stuff compared to what we are going to have to do in the coming years to get a handle on this culture of spending
madam chairman the problem we have in the west is in terms of federal land
you try to run a school system in a county where the federal government owns 80 sometimes 90 percent of the land in that county it is tough to have enough taxable land to do so
the federal government has tried to make up for that by what is called pilt or payment in lieu of taxes where they compensate counties with a high incidence of federal land but there is less of that than there is federal land certainly
i understand that the 431 million i believe in the bill now is for land sales that are already in the works
the red in this case indicates the percentage of federal land ownership or the incidence of federal land ownership
it seems the washington post has some sympathy for this the federal government is the largest landowner in washington
since the land can not be taxed the federal government is the principal contributor to the district s chronic fiscal imbalance now if the federal government owns a lot of land in the district of columbia believe me arizona utah nevada california colorado we ought to really be hurting because the incidence of federal land is so much higher there
in the bill we have 125 million for the center for excellence in native hawaiian law at the university of hawaii 12 million for the hawaiian department of education for school construction 2 million to the mississippi band of choctaw indians for cultural and education funding 5 million for america s promise
now these may well be good programs but they should not be funded in this bill that says that all the earmarks are gone
mr chairman before i begin let me just say that in addition to rising in support of this amendment budget i also rise to support the efforts of the gentleman from iowa chairman nussle that he has done to move us in the right direction with the budget that he has released
how shall we conduct ourselves in our private lives in our lives with our families and our lives in our community in our lives in our society and it is really a question that every member of congress should be asking ourselves every day as we come down to the floor
but at the end of the day a responsible family knows it has to spend no more than it takes in at the end of the year and must live within its means because if it does not what will the family be doing but simply passing that financial burden on to their children and their grandchildren
so congress really has to set an example and i guess you could say in a way we have been setting an example for years
and we all looked at the chart and there was nothing on the chart because no one ever asks for less money in washington because we know we always spend more
so i am rising in support of the bill sponsored by the gentleman from texas mr hensarling xz4001750 because it moves us in that right direction
it moves us in the direction of spending within our means
it is not a heavy lift to reduce our spending in that area
the second area is by reducing the growth in mandatory spending from 64 to 61 percent
we are still increasing spending there by almost twice the increase in the inflation rate but we are just lowering the curve a little bit
mr chairman i make a point of order against section 749 that begins on page 77 line 1 and ends on page 77 line 16 in that it violates house rule xxi clause 2 by changing existing law and inserting legislative language in an appropriation bill
mr chairman i thank the gentleman for yielding time and i join him in rising in strong opposition to this amendment
this amendment is foolhardy just like the underlying provision that was placed in the farm bill at the last minute
we debated this thoroughly in the house agriculture committee prior to the writing of that farm bill and the committee members 51 members all from agricultural districts overwhelmingly rejected this amendment as not in the best interest of america s farmers and ranchers
secondly it imposes unbelievably stringent liability on the retailers and every one of them is writing their own separate set of regulations so that if this law is allowed to take effect and i commend the gentleman from texas mr bonilla xz4000370 for postponing that because we need to have a voluntary system if it goes into effect we are going to have a separate set of regulations for each retailer that farmers and ranchers will have to comply with in order to get their products sold
finally last year i offered in the committee on agriculture legislation to do this the right way to make it voluntary
the way to do that is to keep the provision of the gentleman from texas in this bill and delay the implementation of this very bad legislation
mr chairman i rise in strong opposition to this amendment
this amendment is a piece of legislation that has been introduced by members of the house that would ban horse slaughter in the country
but this amendment would simply limit the inspection of the horses for the purpose of slaughter does not in any way stop what his other legislation at least attempts to do that is the transport of the horses to canada mexico or anywhere else for the purpose of slaughter
but i would suggest to the gentleman that he is way way way off on his numbers because there are not 65 000 times 100 or 6 12 million horses dying each year in this country
with the average life expectancy of a horse of more than 25 years that would mean that we have more than 150 million horses in the united states
at a cost of 2 000 per horse to take care of them that is a hundred million dollars times the average life expectancy that would remain in the lives of these horses if they were not sent to slaughter
if that average is 10 years you are talking about a billion dollars after you get 10 years out from now in terms of having to support and take care of these horses
i am not by any means alone in this concern
more than 60 reputable horse organizations animal health organizations and agricultural organizations have banded together to oppose this amendment and they are some of the most respected people who own horses and take care of horses in the united states
the american quarter horse association the largest association of horse owners in the world strongly opposes this amendment
now i do not believe anybody in this room eats horses
what this is about is what is the best approach for the humane treatment of horses and the american veterinarian medical association and the american association of equine practitioners recognize the method by which horses are slaughtered in the united states as a humane method of euthanasia of disposing of horses
organizations that represent literally millions of horse owners in this country and elsewhere around the world oppose this legislation because of their concern not about whether somebody is eating horses or not but whether or not these horses will be treated humanely if they are not allowed to go through the process they go through today
it is not in the best interest of america s horses it is not in the best interest of america s horse owners and it is not in the best interest of the fiscal concerns that we must have if we are confronted down the road with the possibility of having to take care of these many many horses
so when my colleagues talk about the humane treatment of horses this amendment is going to result in more inhumane treatment of horses if that is their guide because they are going to be shipped greater distances to canada and mexico because they can not be sent to slaughter facilities in the us second the gentleman from new york makes reference to the great racehorse ferdinand like this amendment would have stopped ferdinand from having gone to slaughter
i did not like seeing ferdinand go to slaughter but ferdinand was sold to a japanese owner and exported not for slaughter purposes but for breeding purposes and later on in japan he was slaughtered
this amendment will do absolutely nothing to stop that same situation from happening to any other racehorse in the world
for example there is a slaughterhouse in nebraska which solely slaughters horses for zoos and sanctuaries for big cats which would be essentially shut down by this amendment because horses provide the proper type of high protein diet for those animals when they are not out racing across the savannahs because beef simply is not good for cats these large cats
the gentleman from new york says it is budget neutral but the fact of the matter is all he is talking about there is budget neutral in terms of this particular amendment not costing any money but consequences of the amendment will cost a lot of money because this amendment does absolutely nothing to stop the many practices that occur in this country that create unwanted horses everything from nurse mares in the thoroughbred racing industry to premarin mares to produce the drug premarin to the foals of those mares to the fact that for every smarty jones that is created there are hundreds and hundreds of unwanted racehorses who do not make the grade and other horses that are unsuitable for riding and other pleasure purposes or showing
nor does the amendment do anything to take care of all those unwanted horses as they start to accumulate in our society
finally the gentleman from kentucky talks about the facilities that exist that would take care of horses and we have some of those facilities in the country today
current horserescue facilities are overwhelmed with the amount of horses they already care for without this amendment being in effect and are in desperate search of additional funding
the american association of equine practitioners estimated that in the first year alone of a slaughter ban 2 700 additional equine facilities would be needed to keep up with unwanted horses displaced by the ban compounding the problem by adding additional facilities that will also be searching for additional funding
it is not and it is not in the best interests of the horses of this country to pass this amendment
mr speaker i rise in support of the labor health human services and education bill and say i am very proud to serve on this committee
it is an important committee that serves the needs of so many americans in their daily lives
i want to say congratulations to and state my great admiration for chairman regula in these difficult times when he as the leader of this committee has had to make some very tough choices
i have a community health center in my district
it is 115 million over the last year serving the poorest citizens in our country helping with heating their homes and those are citizens that are going to have to get up every day and decide what bills they are going to pay
this funding for liheap really makes a difference in their lives every single day
i have watched our math and science scores how we worked so hard to bring those scores up so we can be competitive in the world
now we have 184 million for a math and science partnership to strengthen our math and science education in k12
mr chairman i wish i had enough time to respond to the majority leader s problems with this budget but in all honesty the war on terror we just passed the supplemental that was not part of this budget and most of us in fact i voted for that supplemental because it was the war on terror
but i rise to oppose the drastic cuts in medicaid in this budget resolution
medicaid s cost per capita growth is lower than medicare or even private insurance despite the fact that medicaid has absorbed an increased beneficiary population due to gaps in medicare coverage an economic downturn and the decline of employersponsored health insurance
medicaid is a success story in this country not a program that belongs on the federal chopping block
the robust medicaid program is critical for the health care delivery in my home state of texas
fortyfive percent of all infants born in texas are covered by medicaid 45 percent
nearly 50 percent of all children receiving care in our children s hospitals are medicaid beneficiaries
how can we cut the most vulnerable in our society our children and still consider ourselves looking out for the least of this society
that is not our job here in this congress
it makes no sense to slash medicaid spending which will virtually guarantee an increase in the number of uninsured in our country
as this bill moves forward i hope to work with the subcommittee to provide epa funding for a muchneeded study on air toxics in east harris county which lies in the district i represent
the houston chronicle recently completed a fivepart series titled in harm s way that investigated air toxics in these fenceline communities near industrial facilities
in particular the series noted that the texas commission on environmental quality found that folks residing in some of houston s east end neighborhoods experience higher levels of potentially carcinogenic compounds than other areas
for many years residents have had concerns and questions about the quality of the air in houston s east end the potential relationship to local industry and the potential health effects on families
while it came to few conclusions about health impacts of air toxics in houston the chronicle series raised an alarm and confirmed that there is a pressing need for a comprehensive air toxics risk assessment to properly identify any adverse health effects and their possible relationship to local industry
with support from the epa the city of houston plans to utilize methods from the epa s national urban toxics program which has proven successful in other cities with air quality issues
federal funding would broaden the scope of these efforts to ensure that we can include the full range of risk assessment activities in our efforts to improve the air in houston
the folks in fenceline communities are often the workers who produce many of the essential energy and petrochemical products we all use everyday and they deserve accurate information about their environment
mr chairman opening up the offshore continental shelf will save 300 billion in natural gas costs over 20 years for our consumers and manufacturers
mr chairman i like the beaches in texas i like them in florida and california but i also know we need to use our natural resources
the federal government tried to mandate demand reduction in the last energy crisis and it contributed to a nationwide recession we do not want to repeat
a recent gallup poll found that half of family budgets have been seriously affected by the recent rise in energy prices
opening the ocs could save 300 billion in natural gas costs over 20 years for consumers and manufacturers
i have been on oil and gas rigs and they have such few discharges into the ocean a medium sized fishing boat will leak more in a year
i feel justified in supporting this amendment because i am from a coastal district
they are acting like chicken little and can not point to one beach in texas that has been ruined by oil or natural gas production
there will be less need for lng facilities and lng tankers when we tap our own offshore resources so we can use the safest mode of transportation in the world pipelines
i urge my colleagues to support oil and gas production in the outer continental shelf
mr speaker i rise in support of this conference report funding the departments of labor health education and other agencies
it represents another step in this year s appropriation cycle for fiscal responsibility
it reined in spending on nonsecurity activities for the first time in a generation
to arrive at this number the conferees had to work hard to reduce the levels proposed by the other body that were 26 billion higher than the accounts in the housepassed bill
the bill proposes to terminate 29 programs including 20 of the 50 programs proposed for termination in the bill that originally passed in our chamber
while reducing the overall size of the bill from last year the house conferees were able to increase funding in critical area such as pell grants special education and low income heating assistance and bioterrorism preparedness
generally the increases in the conference report are nt big enough for our democratic friends but they reflect our effort to do the best we could with the limited resources we had available
their budget cuts more than 40 million from homeland security formula grants in the state of florida alone
but the addled decisionmaking in the republican budget does nt stop there
it cuts almost 200 million in funding for florida housing employment counseling transitional assistance and small business loans
the budget cuts trio funding by over 700 000 in my district and over 10 million just in the state of florida
these costs will result in a loss of over 11 000 students to the trio program in the state of florida
i meet with representatives from various organizations in my district every day
in other words taxes
i do nt know if citizens will be taxed here in washington or in ft
the republican budget will result in a spending deficit of 376 billion in 2006 alone
unbelievably this figure does not include the costs of several illconceived republican initiatives such as the costs of privatizing social security or the president s war in iraq
how can this cost not be included in any budget proposal
mr chairman i rise today in opposition to the amendment offered by mr rehberg and ms hooley i applaud chairman bonilla for including a provision in the agriculture appropriations bill that would limit usda s funding for implementing the mandatory countryoforigin labeling law for meat and meat products
i have personally heard the numerous concerns of producers processors suppliers and retailers in trying to implement this onerous program
saying labeling is needed because of recent cases of bse for example is bogus especially since this particular disease does not occur in the muscle cuts we consume
i have also heard concerns from many of my constituents in north carolina about this issue
they all express their deep concern that this law will instead cause significant burdens and headaches in order to be in compliance with the law
having participated in the hearings and listening to the worries of my constituents i firmly believe a voluntary approach is a better solution
this issue clearly needs further attention and delaying the implementation of the law for meat and meat products is a step in the right direction
i would like to reiterate that the provision included in the agriculture appropriations bill only affects meat and meat products
this amendment cuts 15 million from the account of the national endowment for the arts and applies 48 million to the payments in lieu of taxes account
people have often said to me you are so lucky to live in the west with all of the open space and all the public land and i do consider myself lucky because of that
but people who do not live in the public land states do not realize sometimes that these public lands and all that open space comes at a cost
in colorado this amounts to almost 30 percent of the state s acreage
of course we heard earlier this pales to the about 85 percent of the states acreage in nevada that is under federal control
we have one county in colorado hinsdale county that is close to 98 percent public land
i do appreciate the gentleman from north carolina mr taylor xz4003981 and the gentleman from washington mr dicks xz4001090 for what they have done for pilt in this bill
if my colleagues remember that map public lands are insignificant in connecticut by comparison with states in the west where we have up to 85 or 90 percent of the land owned by the government
when you have to make choices i think you need to ask yourself the question nea as good as it is in some areas is it better than having the funds to educate your children in many of those western states
mr chairman spending is out of control in the nation s capital and if we do not work to control this spending we will leave our children and grandchildren a legacy of debt a legacy of a lower standard of living a legacy of more government of less freedom of less opportunity
many people in this chamber have risen tonight to say that we are not spending enough money
for only the fourth time in the history of our nation and if we look back just 10 years almost every government agency has grown by a huge multiple overinflation
we have an explosion of government spending and yet many in this chamber want to spend even more at the expense of american families
according to the director of the office of management and budget referring to social security such chronic and growing obligations in the social security program are properly understood by the american public including investors as a sign that the program is out of balance and headed for bankruptcy
mr chairman that is why it is so critical that today not tomorrow not next week that we do something something to begin to control spending in the united states congress
i want to ensure that we have the mechanisms in place to ensure that we enforce the spending discipline
whereas in the chairman s budget we have a discretionary savings of a little less than 1 percent this budget would achieve savings of roughly 2 percent
it would further double the reconciliation savings in the nussle budget
and finally it includes a number of enforcement mechanisms to ensure that we can live with this budget that the budget is something more than a suggestion the budget is something more than a goal or an aspiration that it is actually a limit on spending that we draw a line in the sand and say we are going to take this much money away from american families and say this is it we are going to live within our budgets
government can grow at a slower rate than it has in the past
is there really a compelling reason as families have to get around their kitchen table and have to make tough decisions that we in congress can not do the same thing
we ought to decide subject to emergency spending that we understand that we ought to draw a line in the sand and say this is all we care to take away from the american people and when we tell the american people this is our budget then this is the budget that we will live with
mr chairman i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from indiana mr chocola xz4000720 a real leader on budget enforcement in this congress
but we are drowning in a sea of red ink already
we believe good things come from freedom from opportunity and freedom for families to choose the health care that is right for them to choose the education opportunities for their children that are right for them to find the best job in a competitive market economy
the republican study committee believes in unlimited opportunity
mr chairman we have now come down to two budgets one offered by the gentleman from iowa chairman nussle and the majority and the most fiscally responsible budget we have seen in quite some time here and another budget that wants to tax more and spend more and that is their answer to the nation s fiscal woes
but those on the other side of the aisle seem to act like spending has nothing to do with the equation in the deficit
i was in jacksonville texas a small town in my district not too long ago and visited with a small business there that does aluminum die casting
but instead five people who represent part of that over two million new jobs that have been created in america five people that are paying in taxes as opposed to taking out
so even if it was not bringing in new revenues to the government how could tax relief amount to all of this problem
in understanding that it is important for us to look back at previous budgets that they have constructed and the effect that those budgets have had on the economy of our country
we have here in washington today and have for the last 4 years a monolithic government
in other words the republican party controls both houses of the congress the house and the senate and the white house
so they are in complete control of the budget operation how we take in money and how we spend it allegedly on behalf of the american people
last year we had some increase in jobs
government payrolls in fact have expanded
and it is interesting because our colleagues in the republican party talk about shrinking government
that is a heroic accomplishment over the last 5 years by these republican budgets nearly 9 trillion in negative results
in january for example the last month for which we have figures it was 583 billion in trade deficit just for the month of january
american workers are becoming more productive but that productivity as a result of these budgets is not showing up in their wages
this year this past year alone typical households will make 1 500 less than they did 4 years ago as a result of the economic policies reflected in this and the previous budgets of the republican party
increasingly foreign central banks purchase us treasury securities and that means that we are increasingly deeper and deeper in debt to other foreign countries
the question is are we going to continue the policies that have put us in this very difficult position where we find ourselves today as a result of the previous four budgets passed by this monolithic government or are we finally going to wake up realize the consequences of these policies and begin to take a new course
madam chairman i rise to engage the chairman of the interior subcommittee in a colloquy dealing with some language in the committee report requiring the environmental protection agency to fund a national academy of sciences study concerning the hudson river
the language was added to the report unfortunately without the knowledge of those of us who represent the hudson river area in new york state
those of us who live in the region would like clarification as to what the impact of this new study would be
from what i understand the report language in no way is intended to delay stop or otherwise disrupt either phase i or phase ii of the pcb cleanup planned for the hudson river which is slated to begin in the summer of 2006
i very much thank the gentleman for his leadership in the committee and i thank him for his response
there is widespread support for the hudson river cleanup project and i know the people i represent will be relieved to hear the chairman clarify that this report will in no way delay phase i or phase ii of the hudson river pcb cleanup
but nevertheless in spite of that i think the chairman has done a good job
that is the way in which the food and drug administration is treated in this legislation and the fact that the congress has not provided to the fda the kinds of authority that it needs in order to protect the general public against the marketing of prescription drugs in ways that are causing serious harm to large numbers of the american people
the effect of these antidepressants on young folks youngsters teenagers people in their early 20s particularly has been to engender in them a deep sense of depression which in many cases has led to suicide and it has taken us a long time to get attention focused on that problem
now that comes about as a result of the failure of this congress to give the fda the kind of authority it needs to deal with the drug companies and i later in the debate on this legislation will offer two amendments to deal with this problem
this is a serious issue which affects the health and safety of the american people in material and very dramatic ways
it is an issue that is causing the unnecessary death of large numbers of americans and it is an issue that we have not dealt with and should deal with and if we do address it properly it will alleviate this condition and stop placing so many of american citizens in the kind of dangerous desperate circumstances that they have fallen into which have caused serious injury to their health and death in large numbers of people
so what we need to do is to give the food and drug administration the authority to deal with the pharmaceutical companies in the way that any regulatory agency would deal with the entity that it is regulating
for example in the case of vioxx once that drug got on the market and it became clear that people were being injured as a result of exposure to it and the offlabel marketing of that drug particularly once that became clear the food and drug administration was not in a position to tell the drug company that they had to engage in an educational program which would ensure that people to whom the drug would be dangerous would not be using it
so these are some of the major issues that we are facing one of the major deficiencies in this legislation that needs to be addressed and i will be offering two amendments later on in the debate and i hope that the members of this congress will embrace those amendments
the most recent case is the cholesterollowering drug crestor which a recent study found is significantly more likely than other drugs in its class to cause muscle deterioration that can lead to kidney disease and kidney failure
when the agency finally did have enough data back in 2003 it first sought to hide it but eventually told antidepressant makers that there needed to be a warning on suicide
graham stated the vioxx numbers are the equivalent of two to four airplane crashes every week week in and week out week after week for the past 5 years
fda knew about the dangers of vioxx more than 5 years ago and in 2002 the agency decided vioxx s label needed to have a warning about the increased risk of heart disease
delay is going to cost lives many lives tens of thousands of lives in all probability
the amendment should have been made in order by the committee on rules and i am asking the house now today to make this amendment in order
this amendment needs to be considered by the full house of representatives and it needs to be considered for no other reason than because by not considering it we are placing hundreds of thousands of people across this country in dire jeopardy
we need a food and drug administration that can deal with the drug companies and with the medical manufacturing establishments that it allegedly regulates deal with them in an effective way so that we can have true regulation on behalf of the safety and security of the american people which we do not have today and which this congress has refused to bring about
the food and drug administration was established by this congress in order to ensure that pharmaceuticals and subsequently various forms of medical devices and other materials which are used by people who are ill that those devices and materials can be used by people in a way that is safe and secure and sound
but the fact of the matter is that that is not happening and we have the ocular proof in front of us every single day
these antidepressants came on the market without proper careful review and in addition to that they began to be marketed for offlabel uses
as a result large numbers of teenagers young people people in their twenties began to use them when they should not have been using them and the usage of those antidepressants induced suicidal potential in those people and many of them carried it out
many many people took their lives in direct relationship to the use of those antidepressant drugs
the vioxx case is a very clear strong case in point
finally merck came to the table and properly removed vioxx from the market but only after hundreds of thousands of people in this country were seriously affected and we estimate at least 60 000 people lost their lives and the number may be higher than that and all of that began to get the attention of the press and people across the country began to understand it
and by simply saying in a technical way that no we can not do it today that does not meet the need not by any stretch of the imagination
if you think that scientists who rely on drug companies for their financial wherewithal are going to recommend that the fda take action that will harm the company that is paying them then you are living in a fantasy world
as the medical journal the lancet recently editorialized it is hard to believe that in a country with 125 medical schools not to mention the pool of international experts the fda can not find experts who do not have financial ties with companies whose products are under review of course the fda can find scientists without conflicts of interest
without this there is no way to assure the public that a panel s recommendations are fair and unbiased and in the interest of the public health
after one of the most tumultuous years in the fda s history this amendment is needed to restore the public s confidence and integrity that has been lost in the fda s advisory system
mr chairman i frankly find the arguments that have been presented against this amendment in a word incredible
they seem to me to be coming from the entities in our country in our economy that need regulation
we have 125 medical schools in this country
for anyone to stand on the floor of this house and say that you can not construct a panel an advisory panel to advise the food and drug administration with regard to the safety and security of a particular drug without putting on that panel onethird of the members who are conflicted in their interests who are being paid by the economic entities that are about to be regulated or should be regulated or who have done commercial advertisements for some of those entities that you can not construct a panel without having a third of the members with that kind of conflict of interest is the most absurd statement i think i have ever heard uttered on the floor of this house
we have scientific bodies throughout our government and throughout the private sector throughout the national institutes of health throughout any number of scientific organizations who put together panels and they are never obliged to include within those panels people who are conflicted in their interests with regard to the decisions that are going to be made by those panels
make sure that among the members of those panels there is no one who is conflicted in their interests
no one who is being monetarily compensated by the entity that is being regulated in the case of the drug companies no one who is getting money from the drug companies no one who is on the payroll of drug companies
to say that you can not put together a panel without including in it onethird of the members who are conflicted in their interests is absolutely ridiculous
and so mr chairman i ask the members of this body to do something that is in the best interests of the people of our nation
it is a trial in effect and we ought to put it in place
this program is making a difference in the latino community
coastal bend community college in beeville texas has used its usdahsi grant to improve retention expand and strengthen the agriculture curriculum engage high school students in agriculturerelated fields through dual enrollment programs and increase the number of articulation agreements with area universities like texas a amp m at kingsville and many universities throughout the country and the territories
only 27 percent of hsi college graduates earn a degree in agriculturerelated areas
the continued underrepresentation of hispanics in these important areas of agriculture demands a greater investment in such programs to expand funding to additional hsis to better meet usda goals
our amendment is a modest step in that direction
the land and water conservation fund has been instrumental in assisting local and state government s preserve such vital open spaces is the land and water conservation fund lwcf
this program was established in 1965 to address rapid overdevelopment by increasing the number of high quality recreation areas and facilities and by increasing the local involvement in land preservation
to achieve this goal the fund was separated into two components one portion of the fund serves an account from which the federal government draws from to acquire land and the other portion is distributed to states in a matching grant program
new jersey has been active in seeking grants from this program and has received funds from the lwcf that were used to preserve treasures such as the pinelands national reserve and the delaware national scenic river
in addition lcwf has provided more that 111 million in state and local grants to build softball fields rehabilitate playgrounds and to expand state parks
unfortunately in recent years funding for the state side part of this program has been insufficient
in fact this program was zeroed out in the mid1990s
in 1999 i joined representative mcgovern in restoring funding for this program
since then funding for the program has risen to 91 million in fiscal year 2005 i am dismayed that the interior appropriations bill for fiscal year 2006 has once again zeroed out funding for the state grant portion of the program
i am fully aware that we are working under a tight budget and that many programs in this bill receive a significant reduction in funding but i believe that it is unnecessary and unwise to strip this program of all funding
the lcwf matching grant program has proven to be a successful way to overcome the high cost of living that makes land acquisition and renewal projects costly in these regions
elimination of this program will leave local leaders without the financial capital necessary to enhance the quality of life in their communities
theodore roosevelt once said the nation behaves well if it treats the natural resources as assets which it must turn over to the next generation increased and not impaired in value although the citizens of new jersey and this nation have demonstrated their enthusiasm for this program this bill fails to meet their commitment to our future
madam chairman i rise in support of the slaughtershaysdicksleachprice amendment
madam chairman i rise today in strong support of the slaughtershaysdicksleachprice amendment to provide much needed funds for the national endowment for the arts and the national endowment for the humanities
this is a long overdue and a modest funding increase to build programs that use the strength of the arts and our nation s cultural life to enhance communities in every state and every county around america
in 2004 the challenge america program provided grants to towns and cities in 99 of congressional districts for jazz and blues festivals showcases for regional musicians and artists and publicprivate partnerships that bring the arts into local schools
the additional funding contained in this amendment would enable neh to improve the quality of humanities education to america s school children and college students offer lifelong learning opportunities through a range of public programs and support new projects that encourage americans to discover their storied and inspiring national heritage
they power economic development in regions that are down and out
will the projects that would be sponsored by this increase in funding help defend our country
not only does this immoral budget fail to provide for what the american people need now it also fails to address what it will take to be economically competitive in the future
title i which is the core of nclb s efforts to improve reading and math skills receives the smallest increase in eight years
under this program grants are first made to states which in turn make grants to partnerships that must include a state agency an engineering math or science department of a college or university and a highneed school district
without significant investment in math and science education we will not be competitive with countries like china who are graduating nine times the number of engineering students that we are producing in america
this bill cuts the federal share of special education costs from 186 percent in fy 2005 to 180 percent by providing the smallest increase for the individuals with disabilities education act in a decade
college students are not the only ones left out in the cold by this bill
for some reason republicans have refused to increase funding for the lowincome home energy assistance program liheap which helps keep the heat on for people who can not otherwise heat their homes in winter
the bill does little to prepare for longterm healthcare concerns or invest in medical research
the national institutes of health nih receives a 07 percent increase its smallest increase in 36 years and not enough to keep the number of research grants from declining for the second year in a row
how are we supposed to remain the world leader in health research with funding numbers like this
i believe american leadership is fueled by national investments in an educated and skilled workforce groundbreaking federal research and a steadfast commitment to being the most competitive and innovative nation in the world
we must make the decision now to ensure that america remains the world leader in innovation and competitiveness
this bill takes us in the opposite direction
america s global leadership in technological advancement and innovation is being seriously challenged by other countries
americans again must innovate in order to create new thriving industries that will produce millions of good jobs here at home and a better future for our children
res 95 is not aligned with these priorities and i therefore rise in opposition to its passage
like president bush s budget proposal the republican budget calls for sweeping cuts in mandatory and nondefense discretionary spending that could harm the effectiveness of vital federal programs
perhaps in an effort to obfuscate the truth house republicans fail to provide the specificity the president does in his budget so we are left to wonder which programs may get slashed or eliminated
but we do know this the republican budget resolution instructs various house committees to make almost 69 billion in cuts to mandatory spending programs
the energy and commerce committee for example would be forced to find 20 billion in savings over five years
the republican budget in fact neither adequately funds our national priorities nor does it offer a strategy for achieving fiscal discipline
the resolution calls for a 376 billion deficit in fy 2006 but the deficit is worse than it appears
in calculating the deficit house republicans use surpluses in the social security trust funds to offset spending on other programs
mr chairman it is clear that the republicans have chosen to neglect the needs of the many in order to maintain and extend tax cuts for the elite few it is clear where their priorities lie
it would allow countryoforigin labeling better known as cool which was approved by a majority of this house in the last farm bill to go forward this next year
that is why countryoforigin labeling enjoys such broad support in the agriculture community
our farms grow the best produce and raise the best livestock in the world and american consumers know this
our nation s farmers and ranchers produce the best and safest commodities in the world and consumers deserve the chance to know where their food is born raised and processed
this provision in the agriculture appropriations bill continues that trend
what an extraordinary lewis carroll alice in wonderland representation
on the republican party s watch the federal government recorded the worst budget deficit in american history 412 billion in fiscal year 2004
for years they have preened as fiscal conservatives but in less than 48 months they have turned the projected 10year budget surplus a 56 trillion surplus that they were handed that president bush from this rostrum said we had as a result of the 8 years of the clinton administration 56 trillion into a deficit today in 48 months
we have added more than 22 trillion to the national debt in 48 months
last year we raised the debt 984 billion in one year
that is the height of fiscal irresponsibility and i suggest it is also a fiscally immoral act and is the abuse of our children and grandchildren and generations yet to come who in their time will face a challenge perhaps like the democratic budget that the gentleman from south carolina mr spratt xz4003860 offers has balance by 2012
and you buy because all the spending that we have incurred is in your budgets
all of the spending is in budgets
the majority party neither funds the appropriate priorities in this bill nor meets its responsibilities for fiscal sound management of the federal government
it has taken this nation 3 trillion into additional debt in the last 56 58 months
our colleagues on the other side of the aisle including my republican friends on the labor health committee claim that there is little they can do to improve the funding levels in this key domestic program
they say that they have no options no alternative that they are only complying with the funding levels dictated by the republican budget resolution a resolution which results in an additional almost trillion dollars in additional debt
you can not vote for draconian cuts in april and disclaim responsibility when those cuts are enacted in november
at a time when we should be striving to make american schools and american students the best and the most competitive in the world this bill insures that our nation falls further and further behind
unconscionably this conference report cuts the federal investment in education below current levels by 59 million for the first time in a decade
we do nothing in this bill to make higher education more accessible
in my state and i am sure in the chairman s state and the chairman i do not criticize
but in my state costs have gone up for college kids and their families
for the fourth year in a row that promise has been broken while tuition and fees have increased 46 percent since 2001
however the inappropriate funding levels in this conference report should not surprise anyone
they are the inevitable consequence and i am glad my friend from indiana has returned because the budget deficits confronting this nation and the underfunding of priorities in this nation are the inevitable consequence of the fiscal policies of the republican majority and this administration policies that starve the government resources
so let everyone here and everyone watching at home understand the funding levels contained in this conference report are the direct consequence of the republican party s failed economic policies that have spawned record budget deficits
in fact this budget accomplishes the largest reduction of the debt held by the public in our history
the bill does not change in one way shape or form
and by the end of 10 years this budget will have eliminated the debt held by the public in fact it has taken contrary to mr nussle s representations 3 trillion with a t additional debt has been accumulated under these budgets
the socalled new and improved laborhhs bill is virtually identical to the conference report that the house rejected on november 17 in a bipartisan way
there is no reason for any member to vote for it today in my opinion
this conference report betrays our nation s values and i think investment in our future
last week this house majority passed more than 94 billion in additional tax cuts the benefits of which go mostly to the wealthiest in america
if the republican leadership gets its way it will impose an acrosstheboard cut that nearly doubles the cuts in this bill to some 3 billion
now our colleagues on the other side of the aisle can claim there is little they can do to improve the funding levels in this bill because the fiscal policies they have pursued have put them in a position where we have insufficient funds to fund the priorities of this nation
they voted for that budget resolution which put them in the straits they now find themselves
they want to vote for draconian cuts in april and proclaim that they are getting tough on spending and then 8 months later they want to disclaim responsibility when those cuts are enacted
the inappropriate funding levels in this conference report are the inevitable consequence of the most irresponsible fiscal policies in the history of our nation that we are pursuing of policies that have spawned record deficits
while the wealthy have money to burn the poor get to shiver in silence
i regrettably say that but i think the failures contained in it compel that conclusion
this bill has language in it that perpetuates more than 30 years of misguided policy
it has provisions that continue a ban on drilling in most of the outercontinental shelf offshore drilling that could be occurring in the united states of america
and 60 percent of america s oil reserves are in that outercontinental shelf
forty percent of our natural gas reserves are in that outercontinental shelf
yet for more than 30 years this congress each year has perpetuated a ban on drilling in most of those areas
rounded off it is 180 billion that we could be using to produce energy safely in an environmentally friendly and clean fashion here in the united states
right now almost 60 percent of the oil and gas that we consume in the united states is imported
the offshore drilling that does occur right now in the united states produces a fourth of the oil and gas that we have in the us what is their environmental record
that is all because we have made so many advances in environmentally friendly methods to handle this drilling
since i started serving on this subcommittee almost 7 years ago i have fought to end disparities disparities in employment disparities in education disparities in health
if one is black in this country their life expectancy is 66 years
if one is white in this country it is 74 years
mr speaker in the centers of excellence program this cut will eliminate 30 programs at minority serving institutions negatively impacting approximately 1 000 underrepresented minority students and almost 180 underrepresented faculty at these schools
in the faculty loan repayment program approximately 40 underrepresented staff persons will lose their jobs
in the health careers opportunity program 7 000 minority disadvantaged students will be negatively impacted and 3 000 k through 12 students will be negatively impacted
i believe that we live in a united states and like a chain we are only as strong as our weakest link
mr speaker when congress approved this budget resolution we did not plant any seeds and nothing will grow this year not because of a natural disaster like a drought but because of our own making in this congress
i thank the chairman for yielding the additional time and i do rise as well to thank the ranking member for a very creative a very important statement on the alternative budget offered by the democrats and i look forward to supporting that vision that really helps to balance the budget and bring us back on line and also keep us in line with social security which i will discuss does more for education and of course we do not forget the veterans
just as an anecdotal story we were in the committee on the judiciary earlier today looking at the bankruptcy bill and there were several amendments that had to do with veterans catastrophic health conditions and unfortunately in the bankruptcy bill markup we did not succeed in supporting veterans those of us who supported that particularly democrats
i want to spend some time on the congressional black caucus budget and really focus on why this is so very important what it means for us to rise on the floor of the house and to argue a certain focus and i thank the gentleman from north carolina mr watt xz4004240 for leading us in this direction and of course the gentleman from virginia mr scott xz4003632 who will offer this amendment tomorrow
there is some plussing up 15 billion and so someone said there is a net of 44 billion in cuts because we have got a little increase but let me just say the intent of the administration was to cut 60 billion out of medicaid
that goes to the very heart of health care for the uninsured the disabled those in nursing homes and we are to pass a budget with that kind of insult if you will to the needs of americans around this nation
in addition the budget that was offered cut the community block grants 15 billion and here is where the congressional black caucus budget comes into play
in fact mr chairman we have provided some 67 billion or 75 million for body armor 10 million for ammunition for the marine corps and small arms for army 1 billion for building maintenance and 5 million for studying instances of waste but at the same time we provide 112 billion back into the community block grant program which helped to reinvest in our local communities and helped to provide for affordable housing
we believe in investing in america
we ensure that in restoring those community block grant funds we answer the question
in the president s budget child care funding losses in purchasing power billions of constant dollars we will see in that budget the inability up to 2010 to be able to provide real child care for those who need it and if there is anything that i get asked about when i go home it is the parents single parents and young parents with low income who can not afford to provide child care and as we can see the purchasing power will go down down down up to 2010 and we will not have the ability to purchase child care in america for those who actually need it
in addition we also if you will take care of social security
in the president s mark there is a mention of a social security transition cost but there is no accounting for it
so the congressional black caucus budget takes into account affordable housing medicaid the needs of our troops investment in security and as well a provision for the border patrol agents and the customs agents
the interests of a wealthy few outweigh the needs of an entire nation in this budget
i want to highlight a few areas in this budget that are particularly egregious
this president and the majority party in this body have spent so much time talking about their record on education and as hard as i try i can not see what they have to be proud of
i hear so much in this body from the majority party about the greatness of our armed forces and their right but again its just empty rhetoric on their part
those brave men and women fighting on the front lines in our war against terror will come back home and find that the republican party looks at them differently once they become veterans
almost all veterans need some form of health care some will need drastic care for the rest of their lives because of the sacrifice they made in war but the republican budget continues to turn a blind eye to their needs
i have heard from veterans groups throughout my district in houston and i am sure each member of this body has heard from groups in their own district because veterans are one group that come from all parts of this nation
that is not what our returning soldiers from iraq and afghanistan should have to look forward to a future where their needs are not only unprovided for but are in fact ignored
the answer is simple yet disturbing the majority is cutting important programs in order to finance all their irresponsible tax cuts
in fact the congressional budget office itself said tax legislation will probably have a net negative effect on saving investment and capital accumulation over the next 10 years while the republican leadership continues its offensive for irresponsible tax policies they allow our national deficit to grow increasingly larger
when president bush came into office he inherited a budget surplus of 236 billion in 2000
much like the president s budget the resolution before us omits the longerterm costs of either the war in iraq or fixing the amt yet still tries to make claims of reducing the deficit
it is interesting that if there was a serious intent about a budget that really was fair and did not burden the children of the future we would not be adopting both the gentleman from iowa s budget and the gentleman from texas budget 15 trillion in new tax cuts over the next 10 years as proposed by the president and taking every single penny from social security
the budget that is on the floor right now does nothing to close the disparities between african americans hispanics and others less fortunate than others in the united states of america
the budget that is on the floor today now supports a trillion dollars plus in tax cuts and does nothing for catastrophic possibilities that may happen such as a terrorist attack
the congressional black caucus closes the disparities and supports the investment in the american people
let me resoundingly support the congressional black caucus budget and let me ask my colleagues what better budget to have than the one that saves 275 billion more in interest than the republican budget
we can go to any city any rural community and not see people standing in line to access affordable housing
section 8 vouchers which allows affordable housing for families of four and five and six hardworking americans there are 25 000 people on the list in houston texas alone
finally i congratulate the gentleman from virginia mr scott xz4003641 and the gentleman from north carolina mr watt xz4004240 on this budget because it also invests in homeland security
the cbc budget puts 150 million in for border and customs needs
save 275 billion in interest
i think you will like that in your pocket and in your savings account
truly it is the budget of hope and compromise it is the budget that closes the disparities in america s communities
surely this administration and the republican leadership in congress will pay lip service to the needs of these americans but this budget does more
it demonstrates in writing that under our current budgetary situation it is possible to maintain necessary social programs while practicing true fiscal responsibility
the cbc alternative budget is particularly strong in its support of educational programs the greatest key we possess to close disparities in our society
this administration and the majority in this congress promised to leave no child behind but clearly they have reneged on their promise
in fact the president s budget cuts 2006 funding the cbc alternative budget in stark contrast provides a much needed boost of 239 billion to education and training including 25 billion for school construction
in addition the cbc alternative doubles federal funding for historically black colleges and universities and hispanic serving institutions again closing the disparities often witnessed in higher education
in that regard the cbc alternative increases the pell grant allotment for college students
while the president and this republican congress take steps to make it harder for average americans to reach homeownership the cbc alternative invests heavily in this vital sector
in the city of houston alone we have 25 000 people waiting on a list to obtain affordable housing
the cbc alternative also restores 1122 billion for vital community block grants which were gutted in the republican budget resolution
instead it takes 77 billion out of the ballistic missile defense program which has so far proven to be a failure and redirects the money to additional support for the troops in iraq homeland security needs and veterans programs and benefits
among the items of support for the troops in iraq is 75 million of body armor personal support equipment and other protective gear for troops and vehicle armor all of which we know the troops are in urgent need of
as the ranking member of the subcommittee on immigration border security and claims i worked with the cbc to get funding for 150 million for immigration and customs enforcement ice agents and border patrol agents truly we are undermanned in this vital sector
in addition as a member of the house science committee i worked with the cbc to fund an additional 500 million for general science space and development and support the research and development efforts of nasa the national science foundation nsf the national institute of standards and technologies nist and the department of energy
in addition to research and development the cbc alternative also supports additional this cbc alternative budget is proof positive that we can properly fund social programs while still paying down more of the national debt than the republican budget
it is in short a budget in need of a thorough congressional overhaul
the level of funding proposed in the president s budget for research and development especially basic research is far from adequate
i believe that federal investments in science and technology make sense
americans have funded groundbreaking research into disease prevention and amazing new medical breakthroughs cuttingedge business technology energy efficiency and educational tools that help our children learn in new ways
but in this budget funding for the national science foundation would struggle to keep up with inflation and programs at most other major agencies are cut
there is a direct connection between investments in research and development today and economic prosperity and world leadership tomorrow
that is why the cbc budget plan would continue to invest in the national science foundation in nasa research at schools and universities and new energy technologies to give business consumers more affordable cleaner energy
just this week epa issued a statement that really rolls us back in protecting our air
we have no clean air in texas
i also would like to thank all of the members of the cbc and their staff for their help in completing this very worthwhile project
it is in short a budget in need of a thorough congressional overhaul
mr chairman the level of funding proposed in the president s budget for research and development especially basic research is far from adequate
i believe that federal investments in science and technology make sense
americans have funded groundbreaking research into disease prevention and amazing new medical breakthroughs cuttingedge business technology energy efficiency and educational tools that help our children learn in new ways
but in this budget package funding for the national science foundation nsf would struggle to keep up with inflation and programmes at most other major agencies are cut
bush s science and technology budget would drop from an estimated 617 billion in fiscal year 2005 to 608 billion in 2006
there is a direct connection between investments in research and development today and economic prosperity and world leadership tomorrow
that s why cbc budget plan would continue to invest in the national science foundation nasa research at schools and universities and new energy technologies to give business and consumers more affordable cleaner energy
as a member of the save our cities caucus which is chaired by the gentleman from ohio mr turner xz4004110 i rise in strong support of full funding of the community development block grant and community services block grant
it is extremely important that we fully fund these critical programs because they preserve the local power of local governments to fix holes in the safety net to assure the services that people need
in new britain my hometown in meridien or danbury connecticut or in waterbury the largest city in my district community development block grant funds and community service block grant funds leverage several times their value to provide child care elder care literacy programs substance abuse treatment programs afterschool programs
so between the community development block grant and the community services block grant the federal government has traditionally contributed and under republican leadership generously to assure the safety net in the cities and the economic strength of our urban communities
madam chairman i rise in strong support of this amendment
certainly if we do not do a better job of educating our children in the arts we will be a nation of poor spirit and little understanding
mr chairman i rise in opposition to this amendment recognizing the very serious problems that its proponent seeks to address
but it would be very unwise to cut the budget of the nea especially after we succeeded in adding a little money back to it because the nea is simply doing a fantastic job now of strengthening public arts education of strengthening arts institutions and of helping arts institutions to market themselves and strengthen the economies of not only our inner cities but small rural communities
so in connecticut the nea in conjunction with the connecticut commission on the arts has really helped us develop the itineraries that we needed to attract tourism to the small towns with arts institutions or performing groups where the agricultural economy is failing
in our schools the hot schools the higher order of thinking schools have been supported by the nea and have helped children understand that not only thinking is a powerful process but original thinking is an extraordinary process children can possess and use to grow in mind and spirit as well as technical capability
in 139 of connecticut s schools they are using the nea s shakespeare in american communities a free educational kit that really helps kids grasp the power of shakespeare
so the arts are extremely important to the spiritual strength of this nation the strength of its economy and the health and wellbeing of our children for the arts provide the power to aspire to new heights of greatness in each of us
in that program there are 14 rivers one of which is the hudson river in new york state and the susquehanna in pennsylvania
either inadvertently or otherwise even though we have had bipartisan support for the support of these two navigator positions for the hudson river and the susquehanna the susquehanna was inadvertently not included in report language on page 51 of the report where only the hudson river is indicated
just as a justification for that i want to point out that the susquehanna river has been designated by american rivers as one of the most polluted and endangered rivers in the country
toward that end the navigator presently in place has been involved in two areas improving water quality and use and increased economic development in the region
to give my colleagues an example we are now in the throes of more than 100 million in projects as a result of the effort of the navigator position remodeling an old hotel in downtown wilkesbarre on the waterfront that exceeds 24 million in costs riverfront revitalization that is between 25 million and 30 million a program of 10 million of the gis project to include the entire susquehanna watershed so that we can work on water quality problems in that area of the susquehanna river and a project an ongoing project presently of over 30 million to service the combined sewage overflows into the susquehanna river
without the key leadership of the navigator we will lose that 100 or 150 million in projects and return to really zero
i may assure the chairman that we have worked in a very bipartisan effort with members of the new york delegation and governor pataki s office that both of these river navigator positions should be funded in this bill as the other 12 navigators are funded in other appropriations bills across the country
mr chairman i thank my colleague the ranking member of the subcommittee on agriculture rural development food and drug administration and related agencies of the committee on appropriations for yielding me this time in support of hr 2744 and i want to commend and thank the gentleman from texas chairman bonilla and his fine staff for their work on this important bill
i especially want to thank and compliment our new ranking member the gentlewoman from connecticut ms delauro xz4001030 and her staff for her efforts to be sure our nation s diverse needs are met including in agriculture in food safety in pharmaceutical safety and all of the responsibilities this subcommittee has
i have been a very strong supporter of bioenergy funding every year since we first added the firstever energy title to the farm bill in the year 2001
sadly it is the department of agriculture that has been the most lax in this partnership
he was at another one in virginia last week
but one of the key facts that the press fails to report is that the president s budget keeps proposing cuts in the programs he claims to support
year after year we have seen cuts of 50 million or more proposed in the bioenergy program at the us department of agriculture which is a very small program
year after year we have to work here in this house and in this congress to restore it
given the growing support for this program i am happy that we were able to obtain the money in the base bill without the need to offer amendments as we have had to do over the past 2 years
one of the real success stories in american agriculture in recent years beyond this effort to try to convert to renewable fuels has been the rapid rise of farmers markets and roadside stands across our country to help our small family and mediumsized farmers direct market
these markets are not just in rural areas
they are in urban areas where there are no big grocery stores
they are in urban areas where ethnic markets offer great opportunities
they are in urban areas offering economic development activity that links knowledgeable consumers with appreciative vendors
they are in suburban areas
in fact they are right here behind the us department of agriculture where we had to fight to get the department to allow a farmers market to operate so the millions of tourists who come here every year could buy products grown in virginia and maryland and help our local producers realize some of that income directly
we were able to secure with the help of the gentleman from texas chairman bonilla and the ranking member the gentlewoman from connecticut ms delauro xz4001030 as part of this bill to begin funding for the farmers market promotion program authorized in the farm bill several years ago
but there is no doubt that this program could expand greatly in the years to come and we are going to make every effort to do that
mr chairman i rise in support of the schwarz amendment emphasizing the intent of congress that full funding for the control of emerald ash borer must be provided
the emerald ash borer was identified in michigan in july 2002
it has been in michigan for perhaps five years having come in packing material from asia
since then several counties in southeastern michigan and now counties in northwestern ohio have been infected with this creature
so as trees by the thousands are being cut down in our region
as i said the state of ohio has recently asked the department of agriculture for an additional 101 million in emergency funding to control the spread of this insect
this is in addition to the 116 million that was requested earlier this year although usda provided only 102 million
this is in addition to more than 50 million that has already been provided to michigan to control the spread of the insect from its primary infestation site
neighborhoods are being devastated in ohio as they already have been in michigan
i had planned to offer my own amendment calling for emergency use of funds to deal with this problem even though i know that the bill already provides some funding for emerald ash control in the coming year 14 million even though expert opinion suggests that we will need 55 million
they may be different in their makeup but they are equally devastating to the communities they infest
we have seen a rapid growth of invasive species in recent years from the great lakes to our coastal waters to local lakes and streams throughout the country
in my home state of minnesota we have increasingly been challenged to find ways to prevent and control disruptive species like european and asian carp
in many areas invasive european carp have found their way into minnesota s wetlands and lakes while asian carp has found its way into the mississippi river as far north as iowa
one of the few ways in which federal state and local governments collectively combat the threat of aquatic invasive species is through the state aquatic nuisance species management plans
these activities are implemented by states through feasible costeffective management policies undertaken in an environmentally sound manner
in fact currently 14 states have approved plans and at least 11 other states have plans under development
this is the third year in a row plans to attack invasive species are funded at slightly over 1 million
i very much appreciate the work of the chairman and the committee to try to address this very important issue but would suggest that these limited funds are not enough to counteract the billions of dollars in costs associated with invasive species habitat destruction and lost recreational opportunities
simply put we must invest more in these plans if we hope to control the spread of these aquatic pests
madam chairman reclaiming my time i would like to thank the chairman for his commitment and look forward to working with him to have more resources for this vitally important need in the conference report
if you spread that across 23 million high school dropouts in this country that adds up to 50 billion a year less in taxes
so if we are really concerned about generating more taxes we ought to be investing in our people not taking away the kinds of resources that contribute to their ability to become greater taxpayers in this country
mr speaker 1 invested in preschool leaves 7 saved in welfare health care and criminal justice
let s invest in our people
i tell the chairman in many respects just like rosa parks whose life we celebrated just recently you were told to take your people s bill to the back of the bus
we are talking about a war now in the middle east
but unfortunately mr speaker this bill represents the single biggest cut in higher education that we have ever seen in the history of this country
they do not have an education to wrap themselves around so that they can go out into that economic workforce and be protected and know that they can make a living for themselves in this newworld economy
so i thank the chairman for doing the best job that he could but i am sure as he knows the people s bill unfortunately in this budget took a back seat to many other bills that unfortunately i do not believe it should have taken a back seat to
the republican budget is wrong and the prescription is wrong for medicaid over 52 million children women elderly seniors disabled individuals 52 million in america
medicaid pays for 70 percent of nursing home care in michigan
i just left a meeting with my governor in our michigan delegation both democrats and republicans
i rise to support the cbc budget the only budget in this congress at this time that invests in america s families
on the war in iraq we have spent 300 billion and the deficit is blooming
our cbc budget invests in defense homeland security and the veterans at the same numbers that were given to this house by the president
americans have to be outraged that we are not investing in their families and their children and their health care
support the congressional black caucus fiscal year 2006 budget substitute the congressional black caucus cbc fiscal year 2006 budget substitute focuses on the cbc s agenda closing disparities in america s communities and restoring fiscal responsibility to the federal budget process
the disparities that continue to exist in our society in education health care economic opportunity justice retirement security and foreign policy are addressed in the cbc budget
in addition our budget focuses on strengthening our efforts at the department of homeland security meeting some of the critical needs of our troops and improving services to our veterans
and while making these important investments in our country s future our budget places a high priority on reducing the record federal budget deficit
the cbc budget uses the republican budget as the base budget and makes the following adjustments it includes a reduction in the tax cuts from 2001 and 2003 for an individual s adjusted gross income that exceeds 200 000 furthermore it does not adopt the new republican tax cuts
most of the revenue raised in the cbc budget is used to address disparities in america s communities a substantial portion is reserved to reduce the deficit
the cbc budget reduces the deficit by 167 billion compared to the house majority s budget over the next five years this fiscal responsibility is rewarded by a reduction of 27 billion in interest payments compared to the house majority s budget
the cbc budget focuses on closing disparities that exist in our society and investing in america s future
we hope you will join us in supporting these efforts by supporting the cbc budget substitute
although there is an overall increase in the president s request for international assistance for fy 06 more needs to be done to address the ongoing global challenges of health poverty disease and disasters
in addition to research and development the cbc supports additional safety measures for the space shuttle program
the alternative budget supports additional efforts to protect the historical heritage and important cultural role of hbcus in the united states
the cbc realizes that these farmers continue to depend on the department of agriculture s loan and grant programs and has allocated funding to modify cuts in agriculture programs that affect minorities
by supporting these programs the cbc is working to close the existing economic disparities in the us and to help entrepreneurs realize the american dream
the caucus is also determined to ease the transportation disparities in the united states by funding public transportation
the cbc understands that federal support for community and regional development helps promote growth in economically distressed urban and rural communities
to remedy these economic disparities the cbc would like to ensure that the community development block grant cdbg program will continue to improve housing conditions in low to moderate income neighborhoods
the cbc alternative budget represents a comprehensive approach to education and training by closing the achievement and opportunity gaps in education
for those in college the cbc budget raises the maximum amount of pell grants
in addition the cbc budget funds the perkins loan programs as well as job training adult education and vocational education programs that are critical in today s global economy
programs that serve children and families in times of need are essential to fixing the disparities that exist in the us the cbc alternative budget supports additional funding for programs such as hope vi section 8 housing housing for the disabled and the elderly low income home energy assistance and child nutrition
it is a priority of the cbc to provide american soldiers with the equipment necessary to return home from iraq in a safe quick and successful manner
these funds are used to protect our troops with body armor personal gear small arms and ammunition as well as vehicle armor for the construction and maintenance of navy vessels in order to maintain the us naval fleet and jobs associated with it and for other defense purposes to maintain our military strength
thus the cbc alternative budget aims to make critical increases in veterans programs especially funding for veterans health care as well as longterm care initiatives va medical and prosthetic research and mental health care
mr speaker i rise in opposition to the conference report on hr 3010 labor health and human services and education appropriations bill for fiscal year 2006
the bill before us today does not change the core principles rejected in the first conference report
the second conference report still underfunds key programs because of the republicanled congress and the administration s fiscally irresponsible budget priorities continued insistence on large additional tax cuts for the super rich and the wars in iraq and afghanistan
with a record 55 million children in public schools and state budgets stretched thin no child left behind nclb funding is cut by 779 million
title i which is the core of nclb s efforts to improve reading and math skills receives the smallest increase for title i in 8 years only 100 million which means 31 million lowincome children will be left behind
even as the cost of a 4year public college education has increased by 34 percent since 2001 the maximum pell grant is frozen for the fourth straight year at 4 050 and no new funding for all other student financial aid and support programs is provided in this conference report
this conference report will actually cut the federal share of special education costs from 186 percent in fy 2005 to 180 percent by providing the smallest increase for the individuals with disabilities act in a decade
this conference report is way short in meeting the needs of americans
mr chairman there are few moments during the legislative year here in congress which really defines who we are as a congress who we are as a nation and where we are going with our priorities
it is one of these moments today when we have a discussion about our budgets and the priorities that we place in the budget
i submit that one of the reasons i think they are doing a 5year budget instead of a 10year budget is because of the complete breakdown in fiscal responsibility and what the costs of their budget will entail and the explosion of budget deficits in the second 5 years that they do not want to talk about during the course of these next couple of days during the budget
we on the other hand will be presenting a democratic alternative one that does i believe reflect the values and the priorities that we share as americans in this nation
our budget will reinstate the payasyougo rules to instill budget discipline again in the decisions that we are making in these budgets
we achieve a balanced budget under our plan by 2012 just when the massive baby boom retirement wave really starts to hit and we protect important investments in defense in veterans programs education and health care to keep america strong and to help us grow the economy and create jobs
by reinstating the payasyougo rules we will be in a better fiscal position to better preserve and protect the longterm solvency of the social security program
this green line which shows an upward trend that resulted in 4 consecutive years of budget surpluses is congress operating under payasyougo rules
with payasyougo rules it gave us 4 years of budget surpluses 2 in which the congress was not raiding the social security trust fund and using that money for large tax cuts or other spending priorities and enabled us to start reducing the national debt which was an incredible economic dynamic at the end of the 1990s
every dime in surplus that is being run in the social security account right now is being diverted to help finance large cuts for the most wealthy or to help finance large new spending programs a 30 percent increase in federal spending over the last few years alone
that will continue throughout the duration when we are running surpluses in the social security trust fund under their budget proposal
what this has meant was increased borrowing cost year after year after year having to raise the debt ceiling in order to finance the breakdown in fiscal discipline in this place
i do not believe and democrats do not believe it is in our best longterm economic interest to be so dependent on foreign interests to be financing these deficits
it is kind of tough to engage in a meaningful discussion since he has not offered a detailed proposal but from what we understand he is calling for massive new borrowing in order to set up these privatized accounts that he is fond of
in fact social security runs a deficit of 37 trillion over the next 75 years
what the president is proposing to do is to borrow 5 trillion for these transition costs to set up private accounts over the first 20 years alone in order to fix a 37 trillion problem
and that is probably one of the reasons why he is having such a hard time selling his plan out in middle america
he has got a tough job trying to bring forth a budget priority that reflects his caucus s wishes in that
we also in our budget proposal reinstitute the payasyougo rules so that if we are proposing a spending increase or a tax cut in one area we are going to find an offset in the budget to pay for it
and the reason they do not do it at 10 years is because their deficits explode in the second 5 years
but their budget has also hidden the true and real cuts that are occurring in their education programs ones that affect real people real students in reallife conditions and will not help improve the condition of education or access to higher education which we desperately need in this country
their budget proposal actually calls for eliminating 43 billion worth of education programs in the next fiscal year alone
we restore these funding cuts as well as 45 billion in the next fiscal year alone
talk to special education teachers and they will say how the lack of education commitment at the federal level only 186 percent of the 40 percent cost share that we promised for special education funding is pitting student against student in our public classrooms throughout the country
the democratic alternative does do a better job while staying true to fiscal discipline and fiscal responsibility by reinstituting the payasyougo rules that worked very well in the 1990s and led us to 4 years of budget surpluses while also maintaining a crucial investment in education programs
as a member of the committee on education and the workforce i am heading to china in a couple of days in order to visit their colleges and universities
china and india are making a major education investment in the future of their countries
they are emphasizing the math and science and engineering programs while we are starting to cut back in these crucial education areas
mr chairman we are here today in this chamber to consider a fantasy budget
it is ludicrous for the house leadership to move forward with this budget debate by ignoring the issues of the day merely to lock in huge tax cuts and offer damaging spending cuts to health care education veterans services and much more
i do commend the president for recognizing the importance of the milk income loss compensation mllc program as a safety net for america s dairy farmers and including an extension of the program in the administration s proposed budget
the republican budget however recklessly zeros out this important program placing struggling family farmers across this nation in peril
we know that the budget has not included the longterm cost of iraq which already cost the country 275 billion the estimated 5 trillion in the next 20 years for privatizing social security and the full costs of the tax cuts
in fact it does not even include a full tenyear budget report
i would expect a complete and full report in a document as important as the united states budget
as the campaign in iraq continues our thoughts and prayers go out to the young men and women in uniform as well as to their families
the budget plan calls for cuts in veterans health care benefits and reduces medical personal by more than 3 000 along with cutting 9 million from other areas in the already overstretched va
that is why the republican budget proposal in effect constitutes taxation without representation because it will be our children and our grandchildren who will be asked to pay for this fiscal mess
i would call on the leadership in the house to pull their budget resolution so that we can have an honest debate with honest figures factoring in a realistic cost of the iraq operation
we all know that everything that we purchase in this country has got an energy cost component in it and so when we address the energy issues we know that when we can provide more supply of energy whether it comes from someplace else on the globe whether it comes from the northern hemisphere whether it comes from the united states whether it is renewable energy or whether it is a consumable energy that is at least in theory not renewed all of those things add to the overall size of the energy pie
it is our responsibility here in this congress to be able to expand the size of that pie so we have more energy available to the consumers and we know that due to the law of supply and demand the more supply there is of course the less relative demand there will be
the relative costs of energy will either be slowed in their increase or actually diminished in some cases and we can see reductions in the price of energy
it is critical to me in the part of the state i come from
i have watched this policy here in the united states and we tend to take sides a little bit
i would take the stand that natural gas in this country for example we have a huge domestic supply of natural gas in the north american continent underneath nonnational park public lands
we have a tremendous supply of natural gas offshore in the outer continental shelf gulf of mexico and a lot of that is as we stand here off limits to producers
that has driven up the cost of natural gas in my district and all across this country and put an additional price on virtually everything that we sell and purchase
i would point out that iowa and the corn belt are held hostage to the price of natural gas in two ways
mr chairman i rise today to urge my colleagues to vote in favor of the peterson amendment to end the 20 year moratoria on natural gas production from the outer continental shelf and gulf of mexico
undoubtedly the most demanding use of natural gas by the farm sector is in the production of nitrogen fertilizer
the surge in natural gas prices over the last four years has been a key reason why nitrogen fertilizer costs have jumped by nearly 50 percent at the farm level
nitrogen fertilizer is an essential component in today s highyielding agriculture and accounts for more than 40 percent of the total energy input per acre of corn harvested
natural gas has been the fuel of choice for more than 90 percent of the new electric generation to come online in the last decade
american agriculture is being held hostage to high natural gas prices yet we have a plentiful supply right here in the united states
a vote in favor of the peterson amendment will be a vote for agriculture
we have initiated a traceback system for an animal id in this congress
i introduced that amendment in the committee on agriculture last year
we are going to get that done in this congress in the next couple of years and then we can take a look at it from the perspective of what is the most legitimate approach
but right now we have our cart in front of our horse
as i listen to this debate and i am listening to the points that are being made by the other side and by the way i rise in opposition to the sweeney amendment one of the questions that has not been answered here is what is the distinction between a steer a hog and a horse
i know they do that in other places of the world
i had some zebra in africa last year and actually it was the best meat i had on the continent
i never felt the desire to eat a horse but they do that in other countries
and if you have seen those horses as i have in dry lot that were not taken care of you do not want to turn these horses over to the people who do not have the means to take care of them
what is wrong with marketing american products that help that reduce the deficit in the balance of trade
another thing we can not do is set up a species in this country that sets it up as a sacred species
in the final analysis that budget came to the floor and after weeks and months of discussion and arm twisting it passed by a vote of 214212
there is clearly a mixed signal here and clearly some dissension in the democratic ranks
but when you pass a budget in the spring and it is passed by this body and the other body then the subcommittees of appropriations have to follow that budget
they operated in savannah
but when you look at the context of some of the other programs and you realize this is run by the ncaa the national collegiate athletic association and they are the same people who put on the rose bowl the rose bowl alone generates 30 million in revenue
it is my hope on these 29 programs that are terminated that the local the state level will step in the private sector will step in and a lot of what they are doing are duplicated in other programs
those were the earmarks memorial hospital in savannah georgia st
joseph s hospital in savannah georgia a project for the city of moultrie the warner robbins aviation museum the civil rights museum in savannah georgia and brunswick hospital
these were a lot of good programs that i personally hoped to get in things that were within the budget that were doable
and yet in the end because of the legislative process all earmarks had to be eliminated
in the bigger picture of things you have to do what the body can pass what there are votes for
in this case where did the money go
i have to say i am a little disappointed in what we have gotten for our money
lots of things like the job corps program are funded in this bill
despite its tightness in some areas mr regula xz4003340 has worked with the committee to put on what i think is a solidly balanced bill and face the economic realities of today with today s budget
mr chairman democracy is sweeping the world and we should be proud that our country has become the greatest force for dignity of men and women in history
athenians and the french republics the budding democracies in latin america all collapsed in debt which led to dictatorship
in america the federal government made a basic promise in the 19th century to provide for the common defense
in an age including the war on terror this promise to defend america is very expensive
it is expensive to send armies to afghanistan or to stand watch across the demilitarized zone in korea
but we must do this and we must fully support americans in uniform
in the 20th century the federal government made a second promise to ensure retirement security for americans who worked hard and played by the rules
so the size of meeting the retirement security promise is extremely large in fact beyond the current means of this government
some say we should borrow more but we already borrow too much and we have seen past democracies drown in debt
our growing economy right now is already yielding more tax revenue to meet the nation s needs but for the foreseeable future those new dollars should be used to support americans in uniform and to already honor the retirement security promises that the federal government has made
we could say yes and then we would be much more popular in the short run
but in the long run there would be more debt a smaller economy a smaller future for our children
mr chairman i rise today in suppor of mrs delauro s amendment to strike part of section 757 of title vii of the agriculture appropriations bill for fiscal year 2006
in 1966 the arizona cotton growers association and the arizona cotton planting seed distributors deeded a piece of property located at 4135 east broadway road in phoenix to usda for 100 to help with the construction of the western cotton research center
mr speaker the vast education cuts brought before us today in this conference agreement and additionally in the budget reconciliation package that we may see today are telling signs of the priorities of this congress
this conference agreement provides a mere 11 million increase for head start a pivotal program for preschoolaged children in lowincome families across the nation
i urge my colleagues to join me in prioritizing students wellbeing and vote no on this conference report and on the budget reconciliation package
mr chairman today i rise in support of the spratt substitute and in opposition to h con
their fiscal year 2006 budget proposal continues to move in the wrong direction and next year s deficit will likely be the largest in history with at least 400 billion added to the national credit card
while the department of homeland security receives an overall increase in funding the budget largely follows the president s request which cuts needed resources for the first responders who risk their lives every day to protect us
the republican budget requires 20 billion in cuts to medicaid
medicaid cuts would result in 80 million less for rhode island
my state has successfully leveraged federal medicaid dollars and currently offers coverage to many vulnerable lowincome pregnant women parents of young children and other groups not included in the federal mandate
in contrast the spratt substitute provides 45 billion in additional funding for no child left behind and other valuable programs such as student loans and school lunches giving students the resources to succeed
how does this blueprint honor those who serve our country in uniform
mr speaker i rise today in opposition to the labor health amp human services and education appropriations bill before us
my concerns about specific cuts in this bill are many
it cuts funding for no child left behind an already vastly underfunded mandate it fails to offer even the small increase in the maximum pell grant that was established in the house bill and it sets a funding level for the national institutes of health that would decrease the number of federal research grants for the second year in a row
major cutbacks in the areas of education and health care will have a tremendous economic impact on our nation
i have heard from many of them in recent weeks in opposition to the devastating cuts to the title vii health professions programs
while the administration has made it clear that community health centers are a priority to them this bill nearly eliminates the very programs that health centers rely on to recruit nurses to work in areas that are facing acute professional shortages and train medical students to work with underserved populations
with 45 million uninsured americans we can not afford to eliminate programs targeted at meeting the needs of the uninsured or remove the support systems that exist for those doctors and nurses who are serving in areas where there is a shortage of professional health services
adult training grants which provide training and related education and employment services to economically disadvantaged adults are cut by 31 million providing the lowest level of funding for these training grants in a decade
mr speaker i rise today in opposition to the labor health and human services and education appropriations conference report before us
before we voted on this bill in november my constituents told me what was important to them
major cutbacks in the areas of education and health care will have a tremendous economic impact on our nation
however the republican leadership set the stage for cuts in these critical programs
last month i outlined my concerns about specific aspects of this bill cuts for no child left behind an already underfunded mandate the failure to increase the maximum pell grant as included in the original house bill and providing insufficient funding for the national institutes of health which would decrease the number of federal research grants for the second year in a row
as these concerns have not been addressed in the second conference report i urge my colleagues to reject hr 3010 again
mr speaker i rise in strong opposition to the conference report of hr 3010 the laborhealth and human serviceseducation appropriations bill for fiscal year 2006
it is unconscionable that the republican majority prepares to fund 70 billion in tax cuts with cuts to key education job training and health care programs
additionally this bill would provide the national institute of health nih which works to research and combat diseases like cancer and chronic illnesses such as alzheimer s parkinson s and als with the smallest funding level increase in 36 years
this bill would also slash 31 million in funding for preventive health block grants and provides virtually no funding for new community health centers
in total this bill ignores the health needs of americans
like i mentioned this was a difficult bill with a tight allocation and i think we have a very good product in the end here because of that
obviously this is very important for iowa and our country as far as soy diesel ethanol biomass all of those things that are critically important long term as far as gaining energy independence for the united states but also doing it in a renewable way that is environmentally friendly
i am very pleased that the chairman has included funding to fight the potential problem and the very real potential problem of soybean rust that has gotten into our country which could be absolutely devastating to a tremendous crop throughout this country iowa and the midwest in particular
i am very pleased also that the bill includes funding for continued work as far as the animal id system that we are trying to get in place so that we can in fact find when we have an outbreak of say mad cow disease something like that that we are able to identify where that animal came from and that we can ensure the food safety
i believe that by continuing the funding of the hatch act and getting the dollars to the universities where they absolutely are needed the hatch act funding will allow continued vital research at our land grant universities and allow them to continue the great job that they do for agriculture for our farmers today to ensure that the breakthroughs of the future will be in the hands of the farmers and for their benefit
we all have concerns about how it has been administered and we wanted to make sure that the agency reports to us on a quarterly basis so that we can in fact make sure that that vital program stays in place
again in closing i just want to say thank you once again to the chairman and the ranking member and all the committee staff
i encourage all of my colleagues here in the house to support this bill
mr chairman i rise in opposition to the amendment
the effect would be that the top experts in the field of vaccine research or cancer treatments or cardiac devices would not be able to advise the federal government about vaccines biological products medical devices and drugs
these top scientists are few in number and very specialized
most of them have worked in research sponsored by industry at some point in their careers
we in congress devised this waiver system so that such experts could serve the government when the need for their services outweighed the potential of conflict of interest due to financial ties to the industry
in some cases waivers are granted only for participation in the advisory group discussion and the individual is not permitted to vote on the advisory committee recommendation
i would like to note that in response to past amendments in the same effect the office of government ethics has said the government would be depriving itself of much of the best and most relevant outside expertise in many areas
they went on to say existing law strikes the correct balance between protecting the government from inappropriate conflicts of interest and recognizing the need for temporary experts who may have unavoidable conflicts in relevant fields of inquiry
mr chairman first let me just thank the gentleman for yielding me the time and for his leadership also to the gentleman from north carolina mr watt xz4004240 the chairman of our congressional black caucus and to the gentleman from virginia mr scott xz4003632 for their leadership in spearheading this very responsible alternative budget
as a member representing one of the largest ports in the country it is clear to me that there needs to be significant increases in port security funding
our budget strengthens economic security priorities by easing disparities in housing and health care for example
the president s budget eliminated the community development block grant program which provides financial assistance towards improving housing and economic conditions in low and moderateincome neighborhoods
the cbc budget also restores approximately 50 million in funding to the public housing drug elimination program
i urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the congressional black caucus budget
mr chairman i would like to thank again the gentleman from virginia mr scott xz4003641 and the gentleman from north carolina chairman of our congressional black caucus for their stellar leadership in spearheading this responsible budget
on the other hand the congressional black caucus budget acknowledges that in order to have a strong america we must have all americans who are not vulnerable
our people can not be desperate if in fact we want a strong america
where is the morality in that
mr chairman i rise in strong support of the arts amendment however in strong opposition to this bill s environmental shortcomings
providing for adequate resources to the national endowment for the humanities which is the largest single funder of humanities programs in our country and to the national endowment for the arts the infrastructure for private nonprofit and federal arts initiatives this should really be a very high priority for this body
mr chairman my district the ninth congressional district of california ranks 24th in the country in the number of arts businesses and 46th in the country in the number of arts employees
since we debated this amendment last year there are 113 more artsrelated businesses in my district and that translates into more jobs for my constituents
many who are eager to restrict funding for the nea and neh forget that organizations which receive grants for these institutions include the museums performing and visual arts film radio television design publishing and educational facilities in all of our districts
in oakland one of the cities in my district most arts education programs continue to face extinction and the students in these communities are the ones who stand to benefit the most from arts education initiatives
for example the berkeleybased california shakespeare theater an arts education grants recipient will offer student matinees and arts integration programs this year which support student achievement and creativity and teacher professional development for some of the most underserved communities in my district
and this bill fails to make critical infrastructure investments in our national parks system
overall this bill represents a 3 percent cut in funding for our environmental programs and once again points to the misplaced priorities of this administration
if you ve never heard of these insects or have never lost a tree in your district to these invaders count yourself lucky
the emerald ash borer has been simply devastating to ash trees in my district in southeast michigan
the borer is native to china and was only discovered in the united states in 2002 but already it has killed more than 7 million ash trees
the emerald ash borer arrived in north america years earlier so we have a huge job on our hands to contain this insect and stop its spread
it is sobering to see so many beautiful trees that have stood in neighborhoods for decades become sick and die
by working quickly we ve managed to significantly slow the spread of the emerald ash borer but people need to understand that every ash tree in the country is at risk if we do nt contain this insect now
to give you some idea of the dimension of the threat there are 750 million ash trees in michigan alone and 75 billion ash trees nationwide
and in turn that same world wants us to make sense out of balancing our budget
but in turn over the years as i have observed this process there has been far too little communication that is meaningful communication between those on the staff level but also the professional level within the committee itself between the appropriations process and the budgeteers
i must say that in the time i have had this job the short time the gentleman from iowa mr nussle xz4002980 has gone out of his way to say time and time again we want to work with you
i have committed myself to trying to have the committee on appropriations once again be a committee designed to preserve dollars not just spend dollars and indeed if we are successful in that effort we will be in partnership with our budgeteers attempting to make sense out of the budget and eventually balance that budget
we are not in this alone
and i must say that the committee on the budget has provided guidelines in the past we have not always followed those guidelines
it is my intention to work as partners in this business so we can all be successful
and i can say without any reservation if we are successful moving our bills this year very rapidly so they are ready for conference in the early spring it will be in no small part a success of the work you all have done
mr speaker i reluctantly rise in opposition to the fiscal year 2006 laborhhs conference report
for the first time in 10 years the bill actually cuts funding for the department of education
the bill provides the smallest increase for the national institutes of health in 36 years
despite the fact that college costs have increased by 34 percent since 2001 the bill freezes the maximum pell grant for the fourth year in a row
mr speaker i also want to express my continued concerned with the weldon refusal clause included in this bill
unfortunately the house majority rejected the senate s reasonable compromise in favor of maintaining a policy designed to limit women s access to reproductive health services
as a member of the joint economic committee i am pleased to speak on the economic goals and policies reflected in the budget
we now have the largest debt the largest budget deficit and the largest trade deficit in the history of our nation
this administration has turned a surplus projected in january of 2001 to be almost 400 billion by 2004 into a budget deficit of over 400 billion
and mr chairman there is no end in sight
the budget deficit for last month set another record as the first time the budget deficit has gone over 100 billion in a single month in the history of our country
the administration has raised the debt limit three times to a record 76 trillion which means 26 000 of debt is owed for every man woman and child in america
data released today by the department of commerce shows that the trade deficit in 2004 was at an alltime high nearly 666 billion 57 percent of our gdp
the alltime monthly trade deficit of more than 59 billion was set in november and the total for january was just barely shy of setting a new record
america is the greatest economic engine in the world
there is absolutely no evidence in the budget resolution before us in the house or in the policies of this budget that the majority understands or even cares about these risks to our economy
this budget uses smoke and mirrors to give the allusion of cutting the deficit in half but it leaves out necessary actions such as fixing the alternative minimum tax which is hurting the middle class more and more and must be dealt with sooner rather than later
in order to preserve the republican tax cuts the budget cuts programs for americans who are struggling just to make it in what for them is a very difficult economy
the gap between the haves and havenots is growing and that should be of great concern to everyone in america
over the period of job gains since may of 2003 the average hourly earnings of workers in nonfarm industries has actually fallen by 6 percent after inflation
as a new study by the joint economic committee democratic staff shows the president s plan for private accounts would create 5 trillion of new debt in the first 20 years but it would do absolutely nothing to address social security s solvency and would do nothing to increase national saving
in fact it would weaken the solvency of social security and probably reduce national saving exactly the opposite of what is needed
as i have seen in my own town meetings americans understand that privatization of social security is a bad idea
madam chairman i rise today in strong support of the slaughtershaysdicksleachprice amendment which would provide a much needed increase in funding for the national endowment for the arts and the national endowment for the humanities
in addition to the enjoyment and lifeenrichment that each participant in the arts experiences the involvement of children in the arts has been shown to improve reading and language development mathematics skills fundamental cognitive skills motivation to learn and social behavior
each year the nonprofit arts industry creates 134 billion dollars in economic activity generating 244 billion dollars in tax revenue for our local state and federal governments and supporting nearly 5 million fulltime jobs all across our country
in my district alone nearly 120 000 people are employed by the museums theaters art galleries and other arts organizations that i am proud to represent
in fact with over 8 000 artsrelated organizations including the metropolitan museum of art the museum of modern art and the american ballet theater my district has the third highest number of artsrelated business in the country
because such a modest increase in funding would bring the arts and jobs to so many people i strongly support the slaughtershaysdicksleach amendment and i urge my colleagues to do the same
i rise in support of the weinermccotter amendment and really urge all of my colleagues to join them in this important issue
their amendment would merely add 19 million to the animal and plant health inspection service and raise it to the level that the president put in his own budget
this would attack all types of invasive species including the sudden oak death the glassywinged sharpshooter but i would like to focus on this terrible asian longhorn beetle which has had a devastating economic and environmental impact in new york state
the asian longhorn beetle was first discovered in 1995 in green point brooklyn in the district that i represent
we had to cut down every single tree in one of our beautiful parks in brooklyn and really cut down trees in a whole section of brooklyn in an attempt to contain this terrible invasive species which we do not know how to get rid of
there was a tremendous effort from the city state and federal government to contain it to keep it out of central park which is many people s favorite spot in new york yet regrettably 2 months ago the beetle was spotted in central park
we have had to chop down over 4 000 trees in new york city in our attempts to contain this invasive species
we need to contain it in new york city
believe me my colleagues do not want this invasive species in their state
work with us in supporting this amendment to contain it and other invasive species that are found in our country
our amendment merely raises the amount to the amount that president bush put in the budget and it is an investment in the economy and the environment of our state
mr speaker i rise in opposition to the conference report
while the bush administration has never fully funded the no child left behind act this bill goes a step further by actually cutting total federal education funding for the first time in a decade cutting no child left behind by 14 billion below the authorized level slashing special education safe and drug free schools education technology grants and freezing the maximum pell grant award for the fourth year in a row despite rising tuition costs
liheap appropriations have failed to keep up with rapid increases in energy costs over the past several years
back in august the republican majority heralded the passage of their massive energy bill a bill that contained 14 billion in tax breaks most of them for wealthy oil gas coal and nuclear industries
at the time they argued that their bill was balanced because among other things it provided 51 billion in annual authorizations for the liheap program
but now in this bill we see that republicans are not willing to fully fund liheap
but in the energy and commerce committee the republicans voted against an amendment offered by the gentleman from illinois mr rush the gentleman from texas mr green and myself to increase liheap funding up to the full 51 billion level
while i was pleased to see increases in the title vii programs and other important health programs this bill did not provide new funds for these programs it simply robbed peter to pay paul
in this case the republican leadership has apparently decided that its more important to provide federal funding for viagra and other erectile dysfunction drugs than it is to fully prepare ourselves for the threat of a pandemic flu such as the asian bird flu
the new conference report eliminates 120 million for pandemic flu preparedness in order to fund these increases with the promise that they will make up for it in other bills
we need to have the funds in place to prepare our public health system for the threat of pandemic influenza now
if they do that it will double the cuts in the bill bringing the total cuts to 3 billion
when in the span of 2 weeks the republicans give the top 1 percent of americans who are millionaires an extra 32 000 a year and cut unemployment insurance and employment service offices to help the unemployed by 229 million and cut head start by 112 million and cut community college training grants by 50 percent and cut the international assistance grants to eradicate child labor by 20 million it is clear what the republican priorities are
while the bush administration has never fully funded the no child left behind act this bill goes a step further by actually cutting total federal education funding for the first time in a decade cutting no child left behind so that it is now 14 billion below the authorized level slashing special education safe and drug free schools education technology grants and freezing the maximum pell grant award for the fourth year in a row despite rising tuition costs
it cuts the cdc s budget by 249 million and provides the smallest percentage increase to nih in three decades
mr chairman i rise today in support of this bipartisan amendment which would benefit counties and local governments in 49 states
congress has chosen to underfund these pilt payments leaving local governments in nearly every state with less funding for education law enforcement firefighting searchandrescue and other services
in my congressional district alone localities have lost over 48 million dollars in pilt funding because of inadequate appropriations by congress over the last ten years
the bipartisan amendment we are discussing today would bring the federal government s payments for pilt a bit closer to the authorized funding level helping local governments in 49 states
mr chairman the budget declares our nation s priorities in black and white and this budget makes america black and blue
republicans have squandered the surplus forcing america to go country to country in search of money to prop up what can not stand on its own fiscal integrity
they talk about acting in america s best interest when in fact we have before us a budget that rewards america s special interests
we are deep in debt and growing deeper because republicans have so many special interests to thank with your money
as ranking democrat on the human resources subcommittee i asked my staff to examine where past republican practices might be in this politically engineered budget crisis
two million of our nation s poorest families will see draconian cuts in temporary assistance for needy families
what in the world is going on
those values can be summed up in one word bankrupt just like this budget
mr chairman i rise in support of this amendment
nationwide nonprofit arts industries generate 134 billion annually in economic activity support 485 million fulltime equivalent jobs and return 105 billion to the federal government in taxes
measured against 14 billion in direct federal cultural spending that is a return of nearly eight to one
between 2004 and 2005 growth in the number of arts businesses outpaced total business growth by 55 percent vs
in my district there are 1 234 artsrelated businesses that employ over 7 000 people
i would urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the slaughter amendment for minor increases in nea and neh funding
mr chairman more needs to be done to address the ongoing global challenges of health poverty disease and disasters so that we can end the inequities in foreign policy
there is 37 billion in the cbc budget for global aids which is 500 million more than the president s budget
foreign aid to africa and the caribbean is increased by 250 million in the congressional black caucus budget to allow developing countries to participate in the global economy
these funds support strategic priorities in the caribbean region improve good governance and reduce corruption increase economic growth and free trade and reduce narcotics trafficking
public health and preventable illness initiatives is increased by 250 million in the cbc budget
more than onethird of the children in africa are malnourished
in the last 10 years approximately 2 million children have been killed in armed conflicts
overall disparity nearly 13 billion people around the world live in poverty and do not have safe drinking water more than onethird of the world s children are malnourished within the last ten years approximately two million children have been killed in armed conflicts many after being forced to be child soldiers many poor countries spend 30 40 of their annual budgets on repaying their foreignheld debt often more than they spend on health and education combined and horrific conditions can lead individuals to become more disaffected and susceptible to recruitment by terrorist organizations
and at least 15 billion in funding this year for the global fund to operate efficiently and effectively
mr chairman i thank the gentleman from south carolina mr spratt xz4003860 for yielding me this time and for his work in developing a budget for all americans
every year the administration and congress are taxed with developing a budget that reflects our nation s priorities in spending priorities that reflect our country s values
this budget adds more than 4 trillion to the deficit in the next 10 years without even including the enormous costs that have been left out of the budget
firefighters on the front lines of the war on terror in new jersey stand to lose 4 million under this resolution which means they will have less protective clothing fewer portable radios than they need to protect our citizens
what type of values would slash funding to the cop program by 95 percent a program that has put over 4 800 police officers on the street in new jersey
in doing so this budget dismantles a critical instrument in new jersey s fight against crime
what type of values would raise health costs for many of the over 620 000 veterans in new jersey increasing drug copayments and imposing new enrollment fees that will cost veterans more than 2 billion over 5 years and drive more than 200 000 veterans out of the system entirely
new jersey would lose more than 100 million per year in federal medicaid funding enough funding to provide health coverage to 6 400 seniors or 34 000 children
if this budget passes over 53 000 children in new jersey will go without promised help in reading and math and 34 000 will no longer be able to enroll in the afterschool programs that not only keep kids safe but also boost academic achievement
that is why the democratic substitute will restore fiscal responsibility to secure our homeland provide for america s seniors and veterans fund education initiatives to guarantee our children s future success in an ever increasingly competitive world and lay the foundation for a society that truly reflects our values and our commitment to a better more prosperous and stronger america
but today there is no confusion there is no muddying of the issues and there is no way to mask the harm this bill would do cut education spending for the first time in a decade slash funding for worker and youth training and provide no increase for home heating assistance for lowincome families
we can pass a bill that will be detrimental to our children s future that will hurt students in need of financial assistance to go to college that will not help families struggling to pay their heating bills and that will severely hinder research and preventive health efforts
when the republican leadership of this congress is content to spend more on tax cuts than on the entire department of education or labor when we can spend 70 billion in tax cuts but can not provide children the access to technology or advanced science and math instruction they need to compete in today s world when we can give millionaires a break but can not provide students even a meager increase in pell grants to help them pay for the rising cost of college when we can shell out billions in tax breaks to oil companies but can not help those in need prepare for what is expected to be one of the costliest winters yet it is clear that republicans have the wrong priorities in mind
mr speaker our nation s children should not have their education shortchanged because the administration had to scrounge around for a few million here and there to pay for tax cuts that benefit a small minority in this country
at a time when people are losing faith in their government and their leaders when they are asking for honesty and looking for answers to their everyday needs this bill provides no answers
since my days in the legislature i have always supported the safe and environmentally sound development and exploration of natural gas off the coast of florida
i helped participate in the development of the section 181 prohibitions
for all of the 1990s and many of my colleagues were here our policy was to convert coal and oilgenerating plants to natural gas and we have done that in over 30 of our plants in florida and we have got more coming online
i am most disappointed in the funding of no child left behind
at a time when school districts are entering into the most expensive part of no child left behind when they are being required to restructure entire school districts entire schools when they are trying to meet the demand and the requirement of a law that we have a highly qualified teacher in every classroom which requires substantial retraining of teachers the attracting of new teachers the paying of incentives for teachers to go to the most difficult schools at that very time the federal government walks away from the commitment under no child left behind
it really shows such little confidence in the future of our young children
it shows such little confidence in the ability of our school districts to restructure themselves to meet the demands being placed upon them
we see cuts here in technology grants that are absolutely essential for the future education of our children
those are absolutely essential to improve the quality of our teachers in our classroom so they can engage in that kind of professionalism
what is most startling is that these cuts in education come at a time when i am not saying put more money in education mr obey xz4003000 is not telling you that but the american business community is telling you this is the most crucial thing you can do
the american electronics association made up of some of the most successful companies in the history of this country their number one priority was to fully fund no child left behind
and this budget goes in exactly the other direction
we do not have the confidence that is necessary and demanded of this country in the future and the confidence in these young people and the necessary investments to be made in them
it is so discouraging to see the lack of confidence in our young people that this budget demonstrates
let me just say that this particular issue is in fact a national security issue
most of the focus we hear obviously is on the potential environmental impacts and impacts on tourism and all of the environmental things we enjoy along our coasts in florida and in california
but let me just say that the biggest impact that could happen with oil and natural gas drilling or exploration in the eastern gulf of mexico is a potential to harm our ability to test and evaluate all of the air force weaponry that is used around the globe
in fact let me read a quote to you
we have to be able to test in the gulf ranges and this drilling will harm that testing
mr chairman i rise today in opposition to the fy06 budget resolution and reluctant opposition to the democratic alternative
unfortunately i do not believe that the choices before us today adequately confront the serious deficiencies in our budget process
the congressional budget process is broken and badly in need of real reforms that will reinstate fiscal responsibility into congress
while i support many of the provisions in the democratic budget including a partial restoration of payasyougo paygo rules and level funding for domestic priorities such as education veterans health care and local law enforcement i am disappointed that this alternative did not include any of the blue dog budget process reforms
budget enforcement rules that apply to only certain parts of the budget will not have a significant impact on our rising deficits as federal reserve chairman alan greenspan mentioned in his recent testimony before the house budget committee
additionally the blue dog budget process reform plan would create a rainy day fund for emergency spending which fortyfive states currently have require a roll call vote on any bill calling for more than 50 million in new spending repeal the house rule that allows the house to avoid a direct upordown vote on debt limit increases and require cost estimates by the congressional budget office cbo for every bill that congress votes on
the fiscal situation in our country is now out of control and only tough budget discipline will get us back on track
on february 17 2004 the national debt of the united states exceeded 7 trillion for the first time in our country s history
in the past year our country has added 700 billion to our national debt
the outofcontrol rise in our national debt over the last year is just another sign of the astonishing fiscal turnaround that our country has experienced over the last four years and another sign of the terrible fiscal position that we now find ourselves in
in 2001 we had tenyear projected surpluses of 56 trillion 20022011
that s a 95 trillion reversal in our tenyear fiscal outlook
both parties need to work together in a bipartisan fashion to bring our budget back into balance so we can avoid the higher longterm interest rates and weakened dollar that are a consequence of rising deficits and a high national debt
to put that figure in perspective projected interest on our national debt next year will be 75 billion more than projected spending on education public health health research and veterans benefits combined 138 billion
in addition to assuming an everlarger share of our annual budgets the interest on our debt and the debt itself is increasing our reliance on foreign borrowers which will weaken our position in the world and increase the risk that another nation will be able to assert greater leverage over america
finally our deficits and debt threaten the social security and medicare programs that have lifted so many of our seniors out of poverty and helped sustain the strongest middle class in history
with a projected 75 year unfunded liability of 37 trillion both parties in congress need to work together to address social security s solvency problem
a few weeks ago i had the privilege of joining nea chairman dana gioa at the folger theater to help judge young high school students in a poetry recitation contest
his english was limited and broken but he was able to say to her that the tour had helped calm his inner turmoil and as he put it helped make some of the hurt go away art touches people in ways words can not describe
in virginia the wolf trap performing arts center has received nea grants for their nationally recognized artistic and education programs
in addition to yearround performances wolf trap offers a variety of education programs both locally and nationwide
its primary education program the wolf trap institute for early learning through the arts places professional performing artists in preschool classrooms nationwide
in classroom residencies these artists use drama music and movement to teach basic skills and encourage active participation and selfesteem in the earliest stages of learning
a modest increase in funding for the arts and humanities can make a difference creating new opportunities for hundreds of arts and humanities organizations and bringing the organizations out into the communities
when the nea budget has been cut we have seen its dramatic effect on the national arts community and specifically on arts education programs developing at community centers and in our schools
now is the time when we must invest in the cultural lives of our citizens and in our children s futures
i can not fathom how a nation as rich and prosperous as ours could not find it in its heart to provide a 15 million increase 10 million for the national endowment for the arts and 5 million for the national endowment for the humanities
shakespeare once said that horses are as full of spirit as the month of may and as gorgeous as the sun in midsummer
they ought not be cut up in such an inhumane way and shipped overseas for people who want to eat horse meat
people in the east coast are adopting them
i first would like to thank the gentleman from texas mr bonilla xz4000370 the chairman of the subcommittee on agriculture rural development food and drug administration and related agencies as well as the gentlewoman from connecticut ms delauro xz4001030 for their leadership in what i know is a very difficult task of allocating funds within the budgetary restraints that we find ourselves
the noxious weed control and eradication act passed the house in october of 2004 and allows the secretary of the department of agriculture to establish a grant program to control and eradicate noxious weeds
this legislation gives local weed management entities the ability to control local weed problems and provides the funding necessary for them to meet a very serious need in many places across the country
i know from my own experiences in kansas we have a difficult time controlling the very difficult and noxious weeds
sericea lespedeza is just one example of many invasive species that create economic hardship across the country and by finally providing these funds we can help in the battle to eradicate this and prevent a major outbreak of noxious weeds
this is a matter in which timing is critical and we need to give our communities our local entities and our farmers landowners the tools they need to manage our natural landscapes
mr chairman based upon previous conversations with the gentleman from texas and the staff of the agriculture subcommittee i am willing to withdraw my amendment under the understanding that we have reached in regard to cooperation on this issue in the future
mr chairman i ask unanimous consent to withdraw my amendment and look forward to working with the gentleman from texas mr bonilla xz4000370 in regard to this issue being considered in the future
madam chairman i rise in strong support of the amendment to increase funding for the nea and the neh
the amount we are asking for today amounts to little more than a comma in the budget a rounding error when compared to federal spending in other areas such as defense
when we shortchange the nea we ignore the 134 billion in business that the arts generate the 48 million jobs the 894 billion in household income and the 25 billion in tax revenues
i urge my colleagues to support this amendment and to vote against any attempts to slash funding from the arts and humanities that may be offered in other amendments
mr chairman i would ask the members on the republican side of the aisle this evening to find one republican mayor in america one who favors what they are about to do to the community development block grant program
it came about because there was a republican president named richard nixon who created what he believed to be the new federalism and there were overwhelming majorities of democrats in the congress who accepted that leadership with this simple idea that yes washington because from time to time they exacerbate problems at the local level and if that was to be the case how would we funnel some resources to the local government but allow and listen to this because it is a critical aspect of the community development block grant program local decisionmaking meaning that the so what does this congress decide to do with this extraordinarily popular and successful initiative
i do not think we can find a republican governor in america who supports what they are about to do with the community development block grant program
the number of substandard units of housing in america that have been brought back to life because of cdbg allocations is most impressive
and then let us throw in the next part of what cdbg does
they might expedite the paving of a roadway to an industrial park so that there can be new business growth and new job opportunities in cities and towns across america
some of them in the lowest income neighborhoods of america
some of them in great middleincome neighborhoods across this nation as well
as a member of the alumni association that is exceedingly small in this congress called former mayors i might point out that if we assembled mayors across america the united states conference of mayors we would be hard pressed to go into that room and find one mayor who supports what they are about to do to the most popular domestic urban program called community development block grant money
just to punctuate what the gentleman from ohio and the gentlewoman from connecticut said we believe in local control and we want to be partners with these communities in solving problems
we disagreed with the president in his budget with the changes that were made to the community development block grant so we made that value judgment and change in this budget
we want to be good partners and we believe in local control in solving those problems
but i want to put it in perspective
pell grants has grown 10 percent per year since 2000 and 124 billion in this fiscal year
that is always the way it has been approached in congress
these green charts do not mean anything compared to what it has meant in the lives of the kids that are receiving a quality education and it has unlocked opportunity for them that is boundless
go talk to any one of their teachers back home in the special education classroom and ask them whether they have seen these increases in their classrooms
we need to look at the results of these programs and find out whether they are getting to the kids in the classrooms
for all of the chest beating about education and the priority see that little red line of the total amount spent on education in our country
that is what the federal government kicks in
they are kicking in all this amount right here
that is what is being kicked in
we have got to focus on results in education and this budget accomplishes that
she does an excellent job there and we really appreciate the leadership she takes in that
the gentlewoman knows that the resolution while it tracks the president s overall number it does not make any specific decisions about the different funding levels that we have in some of these major categories
we can not find in the budget any of what the gentleman from wisconsin just talked about in education
it is a great speech but we can not find it in the budget
i agree with that and i have no doubt that they will bring back a bill with that in mind
in response to my friend from massachusetts he is right and i agree with him
let us get that in the record right now
there are those moments in time
in fact he was not here for our colloquy earlier so let me just report to him
in the budget that we have we did not take the president s assumption with regard to cdbg
and we hope the president can come forward with a little better rationale as to why this program in particular needed the changes that he proposed in his budget
our economy was already in a recession and we found out we had an economic growth deficit
so even though there was more cash in the federal treasury than we were using and you can call that a surplus that did not mean we were meeting the needs of our country
mr chairman i yield myself as much time as i may consume to just respond gently firmly in some respects to some of the characterizations i disagree with of the budget that i am presenting and the republicans are presenting
i definitely respect the congressional black caucus in their effort to put together a budget
mr chairman first let me say to the gentleman from south carolina mr spratt xz4003860 there is absolutely no one on the democratic side that i admire more than the gentleman and the partnership we have in working on these budgets
there is not a constituent i talk to that would suggest at this point in time in our history we do not want to protect the country
we come out here and talk about other people s money very easily on the floor of the house what the taxpayers send us in order to solve problems but we really do need to be mindful of the fact that the most important budget that we ought to be focused on is the budget decided and discussed and sweated over and argued about around kitchen tables across the country
we worry about health care here but seniors do that every night when they are laying in a bed in a nursing home
we worry about creating jobs but small business people do that every night in the quiet of their closed shop
it is funny i have heard people say we should not worry about the error rate in the food stamp program which is now 6 percent
mr chairman 6 cents on every dollar in this country in food stamps is wasted
the interesting and fascinating thing about that is if a small business person ended the night closed that shop door and turned the open sign around to closed and rang up the cash register and they were missing six pennies they would stay all night to find it all night long to find those six pennies that did not add up in their cash register
in these numbers is what i was talking about the concern of education the concern of homeland security the concern of national defense the concern of job training the concern of our environment the concern of transportation the concern of research and development
all of the concerns that we have talked about are embodied in numbers because in washington we define compassion from one year to the next solutions from one year to the next of spending more
if i just spend a little bit more money i will solve all of the problems in the country
that is the fallacy of what we are debating tonight and that is that if we believe truly believe that all we have to do is take more money to washington in the form of taxes and define and design and develop just one or two more programs that hires a number of more bureaucrats that builds maybe a few more office buildings to be filled with those bureaucrats it spends more money it increases taxes and it purports to solve problems
if members think about it we have been trying to solve problems in washington with more spending for quite some time now and those problems do not seem to go away
when the economy grows and when we control spending just like the republican budgets in the late 1990s when we got back to balance and president clinton can take credit for anything he wants that is fine
when it comes to fiscal responsibility and article i of the constitution we are the ones in charge of the budget
as a result last year with fiscal discipline and a growing economy we were able to reduce the deficit 20 percent in 1 year
we want to have the first reduction in nonsecurity spending since ronald reagan was in town back in 1980
and so we accomplish that because we know that mandatory spending that is this yellow part the part here that back in 1995 was half the budget and now is more than half the budget and is growing to even more than half the budget almost twothirds of the budget if we do not start controlling our spending in these accounts
as much as there will be all sorts of discussion today and there has been and tomorrow about medicaid you can not find the word medicaid in the budget
the reason is because what we do is we say the committees of jurisdiction in this instance the committee on energy and commerce should be given responsibility to look through the programs and see if they can not only find savings but reform the program to do a better job of delivering the product to the people who need it
let us continue to always do what we have always done and that is continue what has been what some people say is fraudulent transfers that are going on at the state level where governors and state legislators are put in a position where they actually have to figure out how to game the system how to manipulate the system so that they can get more money from the federal government
i have heard of situations that colleagues of mine have told me from around the country where we actually have a situation where kids teenagers who are eligible for foster care good kids good teenagers that are difficult to find families for so that they can integrate and become part of a family again but the state a couple of states in particular what they have done is they have devised a way to lock those kids into i realize if you measure your compassion from one year to the next with spending i cared at 92 billion this year
what do we do in this budget
the gentleman from south carolina mr spratt xz4003860 and i sat in a room with governors where they said do nt arbitrarily let the number drive the policy that is exactly right
just as a result of this they have committed to come back by june with a reform proposal that the what does the socalled reduction in growth look like
in other words we are asking for just a little sliver just slow down the growth
we have already seen in a kind of a disappointing way that they have not really stepped up the way the president has and how we believe the way i have
in closing let me just say that we will be able to give i believe our kids and our grandkids the opportunity of a debtfree world if we begin with a small step again this year
mr chairman i claim the time in opposition and i ask unanimous consent that the gentleman from south carolina mr spratt xz4003860 be permitted to control 10 minutes or half of the time in opposition
it is because of my responsibility and duty to protect the base bill the base resolution the product that was worked and crafted in a very genuine way through the committee process one that has the support of our majority one that has the support of our leadership one that has the support of our chairman and one that i dare say has and i believe has the support of my friends who bring forth the budget resolution tonight
i said the same to the congressional black caucus because they have done this in a very responsible way every year i have been in congress and for many year before
for all of the haranguing that happens out here about the cuts we know there are a lot more weeds in the garden we could pull we know there is more reform that we could drive
in addition we have a president who is for really i think the first time since i have been in congress willing to step up during a very challenging time in our nation s history when we are at war and say even though it would be easy to use the war as an excuse and not worry about what is happening on the domestic side the president of the united states has said we are going to control spending work on the entitlement programs and try to reform the programs and to meet the needs out there
the fact that the rsc comes forward with a budget that goes a little further as i say i respect that but i do not think that we are going to get the support behind it that we need in order to get it done
now members could say we missed it but i would say for not having a budget in both the house and senate and not having the budget being the force of law with the president i would say that is a pretty good track record and one that i give a lot of credit to our speaker in particular for having accomplished
it will be part of the consideration as we go through the process i am sure throughout the rest of the year as well as we consider the budgets in years to come
mr chairman we are coming to the end of the debate on the final amendment in the way of a substitute
we had more money in the treasury in the federal treasury than we were paying out but we also discovered something that next morning
we were running a deficit in homeland security
we were running a deficit in national defense
in a bipartisan way we said it is time to reduce taxes stimulate the economy
so instead of coming down here today and blaming the republicans for partisan purposes why do you not remember the history you know that it is osama bin laden that had as much to do with this deficit as anybody in this country
because of all of that we have the opportunity in this budget to reduce the deficit and build on the progress we had from last year
last year we cut the deficit 20 percent 20 percent in one year with a growing economy and controlling spending
now i also want to put this deficit in some perspective
well first of all let me show you deficits in the past
look back in 1946 after world war ii we were running a deficit that was 7 percent of our economy
it was 39 percent of the economy back in 1990 when the gentleman from texas mr edwards xz4001180 and i came to congress
we are talking about a deficit plan that gets us below the rate of growth that we need to get to in order to have a responsible budget and we need to pass this plan and get on with business
if i might take just a brief moment in introducing my first speaker i would like to just say on behalf of our side in particular but i think on behalf of the entire congress we always respect members who go on to bigger and better things and today the president made a wise announcement in nominating the gentleman from ohio mr portman xz4003250 to become our us trade representative
what we are asking for in this budget is something that we should do every day in washington and that is look at the results of the programs that we have put in place
and oftentimes we have invented more government to try and take the place of families take the place of neighbors take the place of communities in order to solve problems
and too often in this well of the house we debate between percentages and dollar increases as if if i spend 6 and you spend 7 you must care 1 more
we need a results revolution in government
we need to look at the results we are getting from the programs we have put in place
we led when we got to a balanced budget in the late 1990s and we will lead again today by passing what i believe is the strongest budget the best blueprint to get out of deficits to make sure that we get results from the programs and the dollars that we are spending and make sure we get back on a path to freedom in this country
the bill which is in compliance with h con
hr 2361 provides 261 billion in appropriations for fiscal year 2006 which is 653 million or 22 percent below the fiscal year 2005 level
the bill complies with section 302 f of the budget act which prohibits consideration of bills in excess of an appropriations subcommittee s 302 b allocation of budget authority and outlays established in the budget resolution
however this does not mean that needed services are cut in a meaningful way
two examples from the bill are useful in illustrating this point one in firefighting through the forest service and the department of the interior and the other in water programs for the epa
regarding firefighting i would point out that the base we are using for comparison had higherthannormal spending due to a onetime appropriation of 500 million to be used as insurance in case regular fire fighting appropriations become exhausted
in the water program area the committee looked for ways to secure funding for epa s clean water program a program mentioned even during our own budget resolution proceedings
i understand that gao found over 100 million in expired epa grants contracts and interagency agreements and that the bill rescinds this money in order to fund an increase in the level of clean water program funding to 850 million from the president s request of 730 million
while it maybe the case that the 100 million found in these accounts some dating back to the 1980s would never have been actually been spent the savings constitute legitimate efforts under the budget act
i also note that because this account carries hundreds of millions of dollars in unobligated balances from year to year the impact from budget reductions relative to the current fiscal year are not likely to result in reductions in community investments next fiscal year
the bill reduces a national park service contract authority account by 30 million an account not subject to annual appropriations thereby offsetting discretionary spending through changes in a mandatory spending program
as we enter the appropriations season i wish chairman lewis and our colleagues on the appropriations committee the best in maintaining their admirable pace of bringing bills to the floor
in conclusion i express my support for hr 2361
as chairman of the budget committee i am pleased to note that this bill is consistent with the levels established in h con
overall spending in the bill is 29 million more than the 2005 enacted level and 22 million above the president s request
in most areas within usda appropriators ended up somewhere between the president s request and the 2005 enacted level
none of the president s initiatives to collect 178 million in new or increased user fees was taken up making up the difference through spending reductions in some discretionary programs and through 14 billion in reductions in some mandatory programs authorized for the first time in the 2002 farm bill
the bill makes changes in various mandatory programs that reduce net budget authority by 14 billion
while the use of oneyear savers in mandatory programs to stay within the subcommittee s 302 b allocation has become routine the agriculture committee could change some of these same mandatory programs themselves in order to comply with the reconciliation instructions in the fiscal year 2006 budget resolution
the bill does rescind 32 million in the unobligated balances of the special supplemental nutrition program for women infants and children
i am particularly pleased that this legislation contains critical funding for ag and food safety programs in my home state of iowa
specifically i would like to commend the committee for funding the completion of the national centers for animal health in ames iowa where vital research to keep our nation s food supply safe is being done everyday
in addition this bill continues funding for the agriculturebased industrial lubricants abil program at the university of northern iowa in my congressional district
in conclusion i express my support for hr 2744

he has treated the minority fairly and i very much appreciate that but i believe the bill fails this country in many fundamental ways and that failure is a direct result of the republican budget resolution which requires this committee to cut 117 billion below the amount needed to maintain current services for domestic discretionary programs
the republicans in this house voted by a vote of 218 to 212 to adopt that budget resolution
it should never have voted to give persons who make more than a million dollars 140 000 tax cuts next year and do it all with borrowed money because the result of that vote has been a 400 million cut in epa programs to improve the quality of our air and our water
the result has been a 40 percent cut in the clean water revolving fund
we have 388 billion worth of needs at the community level to fix sewer and water systems and yet this program is cut by 40 percent in this bill
the damage done by this bill can not be fully understood unless we take a look at it in a broader context
when i came to this congress there were 203 million people in this country
when i came there were 108 million cars in america
in the face of that new pressure what are we getting out of this bill
we are getting a 34 percent reduction in the funding for the main bill that will help us to clean up our sewer and water problem
in the teeth of all of that pressure we are crippling epa
we talk about how happy we are to see a slight increase in the national parks budget but in fact there are still 720 positions in the national park service that continue to remain unfunded
in the teeth of all that expanded pressure what do we get
despite this bill we still have a 5 billion backlog in maintenance for the park service a 13 billion backlog for our national forests
i would like to see for instance this bill enable us to buy precious land at pope s creek on the property where george washington was born before a real estate developer can grab it and turn it into condos but we are not going to be able to do that because this bill for the first time in the 36 years i have been a member of this house zerofunds land acquisition programs at both the state and the federal level
for two generations we have had a bipartisan consensus behind certain minimal actions in the environmental area especially in the area of clean water
this bill unravels that consensus because it means we can talk a good game in terms of cleaning up our water and our air but we are not going to put our dollars where our mouth is
madam chairman i do not want to rain on anybody s parade but in a sense i do
in the first years that the republicans were in control they wound up making a very large cut in the arts program
i offered an amendment in the appropriations committee to restore a portion of that cut and that amendment was adopted
but the majority exercised its power in the rules committee and when this bill went to the rules committee the rules committee arbitrarily unilaterally eliminated my amendment which had been adopted by the full committee
but then they proceeded to make the exact same amendment in order with one difference that amendment was to be offered by a republican because the majority party wanted to have the issue both ways
because last year as was pointed out we had an arts funding level which was 49 million below where it was at its high water mark 100 million in real terms after adjusting for inflation below where it had been just a few years earlier
the amendment was passed added 10 million everybody got to put out their press releases and guess what when we wound up in conference with the senate 80 percent of the money was stripped out of the bill
i would hope that if the house wants to demonstrate the slightest bit of sincerity on this issue that having adopted this amendment it will stick to it in conference so that something other than a phony kabuki dance has taken place on the floor this year
the fda will still have a terrible time trying to provide new labels for drugs which had been initially approved but which later had been found to be in some cases a threat to public health
secondly i want to say that i think the bill is inadequate in a number of areas
there is probably more demand in my district for rural sewer and water grants than any other program in the federal budget
when one lives in a community in which more than 50 percent of the households are headed either by someone over 65 or by a woman who has no long work history outside of the home that means that that community has very little tax base and very little economic ability to meet environmental standards for water and sewer and the congress is doing precious little to help those communities
mr chairman could the gentleman split the time in opposition to the amendment in two
mr chairman i simply want to rise in support of the gentleman s amendment
it is hard for me to believe that the rules of the house would mean that this house can busy itself telling other people how they should deal with endoflife issues for dear ones telling independent courts that they should not be quite so independent and yet would not allow the supposedly greatest legislative body in the world to deal with a direct obligation of government which is to ensure the public safety of the american people
this amendment would be in order if no member objects to it
this is the day when this congress chooses to walk away from its investments obligations in education health care job training and the like
this is the guts of the federal effort to try to see to it that regardless of one s station in life people have the greatest possible opportunity to get ahead
the department of labor funding in that department 37 million below the house bill 193 million below the senate bill
that is the lowest level of adult training grants in a decade
in the health and human services area this bill cuts health care to the poor and underserved rural areas of the country
we have only about 10 percent of physicians in america who practice in rural areas and yet onefourth of the us population lives in those areas
we have huge shortages of health care providers in urban underserved areas as well but training grants for health care professionals are cut by 206 million
that program is cut by 20 percent below fiscal 2002 levels and we have a 24 percent cut in block grants for state health departments
we have the smallest increase for nih in 36 years and under that budget because funding for nih does not keep pace with inflation we will actually see 500 fewer research grants coming out of nih than we would have seen 2 years ago
education this is the first cut in education funding in a decade
that is in comparison to a 600 million increase that came from that wellknown liberal george w bush
special education it is up 100 million in comparison to the 508 million request from the president of the united states
that is going in the wrong direction
we cut safe and drugfree schools by 20 percent in this bill
we freeze afterschool programs for the 4th year in a row
that means that there are 14 million kids in this country who want those services who will not get them
no increase in the maximum grant
and then in the reconciliation bill that follows today they are going to add 8 billion more in costs to students who borrow money to go to college
this bill provides 189 million less than the president asked 80 million less than was in the house bill 130 million less than the senate bill
and we do all of this in order to free up necessary room so the republican party can deliver on its 100 000plus tax cuts for people who make 1 million bucks
this is going in the wrong direction
we provided 19 billion more in education since they took over the congress than would have been provided if we had simply passed the republican house bill
mr speaker the gentlewoman claimed there is a 115 million increase in here for low income heating assistance
the net result no help in the teeth of huge energy increases
the fact is the republican party will provide over the next decade 12 trillion in tax cuts to people who make over 1 million a year
yet in this bill they will freeze student loans they will allow people without health care to increase in number by 2 million they will provide the first cut in education in a decade they will cut safe and drugfree schools by 20 percent and they will slash the president s initiative for math and science education
in the teeth of the fact that they have given 14 billion in subsidies to the big energy companies they then say to lowincome people who have to pay those higher prices sorry
despite the fact you re going to have a huge increase in home heating costs we re not going to give you a dime in additional money in this bill that is what they do
what we are going to see today in the reconciliation bill and in this bill is a double whammy on the most vulnerable people in this society
this bill falls far short of our responsibilities in meeting the growing economic and social needs of this country
mr speaker let me stipulate from the outset that the gentleman from ohio is a good man and i think with some exceptions he and i have priorities in this bill that are pretty much the same
what i say is not in any way designed to be an attack upon him or his leadership of the subcommittee but the fact is that this subcommittee has been given an inadequate allocation and as a result this congress is about to make a large mistake if it passes this bill because it will be shortchanging this country in terms of the longterm investments that we should be making in america s working families and programs that are focused on the needs of america s working families
the reason we are in this fix is because the majority just in the last week and a half passed almost 70 billion in tax cuts and a very large percentage approaching 50 percent went into the pockets of the most welloff 1 percent of people in this country people who make over 400 000 a year
it has moved around a small amount of money in hopes of picking up a few votes because of an improvement in rural health care but outside of that the bill is virtually the same
to understand what this bill is doing you must look at it in conjunction with the next step that the republican leadership of this congress has already announced that they intend to take which is to further cut this bill by 1 percent across the board as they cut the entire discretionary budget 1 percent across the board
that means in the end this bill for 1 year alone will be 3 billion less than was provided for these same programs last year
over a 5year period because this sets us on a course over a 5year period if we pass this bill we will wind up spending 15 billion less for programs in this bill than we would otherwise spend if we simply stuck to last year s baseline
in addition to that 2 weeks ago our republican friends pushed through a package of rescissions and reconciliation actions which cut 33 billion out of programs that benefit the same people who are benefited by this bill
they for instance cut 5 billion out of child support enforcement which will result in women in this country over the next 5 years getting 24 billion less in child support money than they are entitled to
they are saying to people on disabilities sorry but you are not going to get your full entitlement in your first check after you are declared eligible for disability right now the law says that if you apply for disability and if you are adjudged to be eligible when you get your first check you will be paid retroactive to the date of application
the bill that passed 2 weeks ago on this floor the reconciliation bill said sorry folks if you are declared eligible you will get only the first 2 months entitlement in that check the rest will be strung out over a period of months the only reason the government saves money under that plan is because people will die before they get what they are entitled to get
so this house has already taken all of those actions which will cut the assistance to middleincome families and poor families in this country by 33 billion and then this bill over the next 5 years will wind up imposing an additional 15 billion cut in resources provided over that time
this time around in sort of scroogenomics fashion we are emptying those children s stockings and instead moving that money into the pockets of some of the wealthiest people in this country
we have 55 million children in public schools
and yet no child left behind funding in this bill is cut 779 million and would be cut 1 billion after the 1 percent acrosstheboard cut is imposed
the college board spelled out that in the last 5 years the cost of a 4year public education has increased by 3 100
and in the reconciliation bill which they passed just 2 weeks ago they are making that problem over the next 5 years 12 billion worse or i am sorry 8 billion worse for those same families by raising fees raising interest rates on student loans
if you take a look at lowincome heating assistance we have a need to at least double that program given the fact that we have these huge increases in natural gas prices and home heatingoil prices
in fact this bill freezes lowincome heating assistance
our republican friends say oh well we are going to try to add 1 billion in the reconciliation bill but we are already told that there is less than a 5050 chance that reconciliation bill will even be passed before congress leaves here for the holidays
and the majority in this bill eliminates the healthy communities access program 83 million gone that helps provide health care to persons who do not have any or who do not have health care
it does not make the investments in health research in education in worker training that any civilized healthy leading society would make
we do not meet our obligations in this bill and i would urge a no vote
in all the bill will provide 4 billion less than the glide path to full funding that the republican budget resolution promised just 2 years ago
but in fact under actions already taken by the majority party in this congress over the next decade they will provide 12 trillion in tax cuts for persons who make more than 400 000 a year the top 1 percent of earners and they have done virtually all of it by borrowing money to provide those tax cuts
if we ask the average family in this country what they need in order to be able to deal with their own problems i think what they would say is they need help to see to it that they have adequate access to education for their children
i think they would ask for fair treatment in the workplace
because of the incredibly confusing prescription drug program which seniors are being asked to sign up for because that program is so incredibly confusing we tried to get the majority to consider a 6month delay in the deadline that seniors have to meet in signing up for that program
i would hope that before this congress ends the congress will recognize that that program is so incredibly convoluted that there must be a delay in the signup deadline so that seniors have more time to make what could be a very confusing and devastating choice if they make the wrong choice
mr speaker i assume this is the last time i will speak on the floor before christmas so i want to wish everyone merry christmas and a happy new year and enough blessings so that you will reconsider some of the mistakes in this bill
while the number of people living in poverty in this country continues to rise this conference report fails to adequately fund programs that work to alleviate poverty
these cuts are in addition to 11 billion in cuts to medicaid that are included in the majority party s reconciliation bill that may be voted on later today
as the number of americans unable to find a job continues to rise this conference report issues devastating cuts to initiatives that help put dislocated workers back in the labor force
at a time when this country should be investing in education and human capital this conference agreement cuts 784 million from no child left behind
these cuts are in addition to a reconciliation bill that cuts 143 billion from student aid for college students
we have a responsibility to ensure that all americans have an opportunity to share in america s prosperity
i can not in good conscience vote for this conference report and i urge my colleagues to vote no
mr chairman i rise in support of the bonilla provision to delay implementing mandatory country of origin labeling which is known as cool for meat and meat products for 1 year
in the 2002 farm bill we added the cool requirement for fruits and vegetables
the house has previously voted to delay mandatory cool in order to review the law and develop a voluntary option
i ask the house to join me in keeping this provision and oppose the motion to strike
it seems like there is quite a bit of discrepancy here in our information
we have tried to put in the pipeline from alaska
currently we are paying 600 percent more for natural gas than many other nations in the world
in the area of agriculture we find that pumping fuel is 20 percent higher this year
we are going to need 10 to 12 cents more per bushel of grain in order to offset the increasing cost of gas and fertilizer
so i rise in support of this amendment
i believe it can be done in an environmentally safe and sensitive way and it does make sense
one of the greatest responsibilities of representing idaho in congress is convincing members who represent other states particularly those east of the mississippi river why some issues matter to us so much
picking up our uncle sam s slack means in the west we each pay higher property taxes and our counties are forced to make tough choices about essential public services
counties in idaho were shorted 755 million from 1995 through 2004 alone
that burden is heaviest where it can least be borne in more rural counties with relatively small tax bases
since almost all the land in the east is private states there have no such concerns
many members of congress from the east care little about how taxexempt federal land hurts folks in idaho
pilt was funded at 200 million back in 2001 and is clearly a step backward in a commitment to compensate counties for financial burdens imposed on them through an overwhelming federal presence
there s no getting around the need for some of the basic services that property taxes provide on the local level but there s no excuse for having to pay extra for the honor of having so much nontaxable federal land in our counties
for the last ten years the members ofthe cbc have boldly trumpeted the fact that there is an education stateofemergency in the african american community and in the mainstream of america
to confront violent fanatics and zealots in the military arena our soldiers must be the best trained and most educated fighting force in the world
to maintain expand and guide the most complex economic system in the history of our civilization in ways that guarantee continued prosperity we must accept nothing less than overwhelming supremacy in education
members of the cbc have proudly supported an increase of 239 billion dollars in the education budget
in listening to the debate today on both sides of the aisle there has been a lot of expression of concern about the deficit and of course i am very concerned about the deficit as well
and the gentleman from pennsylvania rightly pointed out the concerns this might have in the financial markets
but i would like to suggest that in dealing with the budget itself i see only one problem that we have
not so much embarrassing to me because i am accustomed to voting in a small group of people on many occasions but it could be embarrassing to others because for the most part most members would not even conceive of the idea of having a strict interpretation of the constitution and severely limiting the budget
the other day i heard an interview with one of our members and he was asked about a particular program about where the authority came from in the constitution for that program
and his answer was very straightforward and he explained that in the constitution there was no prohibition against that program so therefore it was permitted
in his mind as it is in the minds of many members of congress if there is no strict prohibition it is permitted
and that is just absolutely opposite of what was intended by the authors of the constitution that we would only be able to do those things which are explicitly permitted in the congress and they are spelled out rather clearly in article i section 8 and then we are given the permission to write the laws that are necessary and proper to implement those powers that are delegated to us
i think this improper understanding and following of the constitution has brought us closer to a major crisis in this country a crisis of our personal liberties a crisis in our foreign policy as well as a crisis in our budgeting
i think our other problem is our country and our people and our congresses and our senators have accepted the notion of faith in government faith in the state that the state can provide these great services and do it efficiently
and the current account deficits and this huge foreign indebtedness that are encouraged by our ability to maintain a reserve currency it is going to lead to a crisis where this spending will have to come in check
and hopefully we will be able to deal with this in a budgetary way and institute some restraints
this program that we follow and this philosophy we followed prompted our federal reserve to create 620 billion in order to finance the system
i made my living in the oil and gas business
we are in a world economy and we are losing our jobs
i was in the industry when the price went from 2 to 50
mr chairman i thank the distinguished gentleman from south carolina for yielding me this time and i thank him for his great leadership in putting together a budget that is a statement of our values that is balanced in terms of our priorities and balanced fiscally
he has always conducted the process of creating a budget in a way that has informed members has done so with great dignity and great fairness and great respect for all points of view
i wish we would all join in acknowledging the great leadership of the gentleman from south carolina our ranking member on the committee on the budget
mr chairman in 1994 the first item in the republicans contract with america was the fiscal responsibility act
it is clear that in the 10 years the republicans have become addicted to deficits
the february budget deficit my colleagues of 114 billion for the month of february a deficit of 114 billion is the highest monthly deficit ever and the first time it ever went over 100 billion in one month
in 2001 president clinton left president bush with a projected 56 trillion in surplus
in just 4 years president bush has turned that record surplus into a record deficit of nearly 4 trillion a 10 trillion swing in the wrong direction
make no mistake these deficits are the direct result of republican policies huge tax cuts for the wealthy a refusal to pay as you go poor planning for a war of choice in iraq
america is awash in red ink because of republican budget irresponsibility
it does not cut the deficit in half as republicans claim
in fact it makes the deficit worse
the budget is dishonest in another way it fails to show any deficit figures at all after 2010
in our new partnership for america s future democrats have made a commitment to honor the value of accountability including eliminating deficit spending and holding those in power accountable for their actions with a high ethical standard
while republicans ignore the real crisis of ballooning budget deficits the president falsely claims there is a crisis in social security
according to the nonpartisan congressional budget office social security s trust fund will grow every year until a high of 83 trillion in 2032 and continues to be solvent until 2052
the left bar represents the deficit in the general fund between now and 2035 a staggering 15 trillion
the bush administration has taken us onto a trajectory of reckless budgeting that will take us to 15 trillion in deficit in 2035
from 2006 to 2035 15 trillion in deficit
it is clear that there would be plenty of money to deal with the social security trust fund if the president were not using the social security trust fund as a slush fund to give tax cuts to the wealthiest people in america
how on earth are they going to pay the social security trust fund back if they have gone broke on the other side by running up these deficits in the general fund
427 billion in deficit for this year over 100 billion in deficit for the month of february alone this year
the leaders of five protestant denominations the episcopal church usa the evangelical lutheran church in america the presbyterian church usa the united church of christ and the united methodist church recently called president bush s budget unjust
in this bill there are painful cuts to a wide range of valuable programs from epa enforcement to the land and water conservation fund
among them all the cuts in clean water funding stand out as a prime example of what s wrong with the republican budget
more than three decades ago americans rose up in outrage appalled by our filthy rivers and lakes
we have made enormous progress since the infamous day the cuyahoga river caught fire in 1969
about 45 percent of water bodies in the us that have been assessed do not meet our water quality standards
this bill turns back the clock on clean water slashing the clean water state revolving fund for the second year in a row
cuts for this program total 500 million in this twoyear period
sewage blending is a euphemism referring to the practice of allowing some sewage to bypass the secondary treatment phase the phase in which toxic chemicals viruses parasites and other pathogens are removed
furthermore i intend to support the andrewschabot amendment to stop wasteful and destructive logging in the tongass national forest and the hastings amendment to promote environmental justice
mr speaker is it not further part of the usual procedure of the house for the chair to announce the changes as they come in
i rise to commend the gentleman from texas mr hensarling xz4001750 who is a man of principle and a man of personal courage in his quest to restore fiscal discipline to washington dc
in just a few short years the gentleman from texas mr hensarling xz4001750 has emerged as a national leader on fiscal restraint in washington dc and it is an honor for me to be associated with his handiwork in support of the hensarling amendment
i too join in the chorus of those conservatives who have spoken tonight in commendation of the gentleman from iowa chairman nussle who has in fact produced the most conservative budget since the historic years of the reagan administration
i do support the hensarling amendment though which today was endorsed by the 350 000member national taxpayers union americans for tax reform just to name a few because it is long past time for congress to put our fiscal house in order
the omb estimates the total fiscal outlays in 2005 will be a stunning 33 percent higher than outlays as recently as fiscal year 2001
we have seen extraordinary growth in various departments including spending in the department of education which has grown at almost twice the rate of even military spending
the rsc budget known as the hensarling amendment would provide for needed restraint by reducing nondefenserelated discretionary spending by 2 percent and calling for 57 billion more in savings than the committee on the budget s budget but better yet the rsc s budget would dramatically enhance the possibility that members will adhere to the spending levels set out in the budget resolution by providing bold initiatives in process reform point of order protection forcing congress to define emergency spending and account for it in the budget creating budget protection accounts that would allow spending cuts to be directed toward deficit reduction or tax relief just to name a few proposals
voting for the rsc budget is voting for finding more savings in the largest category of federal spending mandatory spending
and voting for the rsc budget is voting for a way to enforce the budget that the house passes and to embrace a series of budget process reforms which if they are not successful in the hensarling amendment may yet be entertained by the 109th congress in the months and days ahead
mr speaker i rise simply to express profound gratitude for the leadership that chairman ralph regula has provided in bringing this extraordinary measure to the floor
the challenge of being in the spending branch of government is to fund the nation s priorities and to live within our means
madam chairman i rise in strong support of hr 2744
madam chairman the farm bill was developed in a responsible forwardlooking manner
it was devised within the terms of the congressional budget and while it addressed farm income it also made substantial investments in research in conservation and in enhancing the nutrition programs that protect the needy
but because of this congress failure to take a similar forwardlooking approach to government debt this bill makes deep cuts in those farm bill programs that were so strongly supported in this house
the fy 2004 agriculture appropriations bill made substantial cuts in farm bill programs the fy 2005 bill went even farther and this bill cuts them even more
they have worked on a bipartisan basis to provide the best bill possible in a bad situation
but in order to meet the cap this bill cuts these mandatory farm bill programs the initiative for future agriculture and food systems rural broadband and local television initiatives the wetlands reserve program bioenergy and renewable energy development the eqip program the conservation security program the wildlife habitat incentives program the farmland protection program and others as well madam chairman the farm bill which was developed in a very inclusive and bipartisan manner has been working very well
in fact during the time it has been in effect commodity program spending has been 15 billion less than originally projected
mr chairman my amendment will remove the words natural gas from the moratorium that has been in every interior bill i am told for 20 some years unbeknownst to many members of this congress that prohibits the department of interior from leasing or subleasing lands on the outer continental shelf our greatest reserve for natural gas
the number one economic challenge facing america was not addressed in our energy bill in my view and the view of many because we did not adequately deal with the clean fuel the fuel that has no no x no so lt cite gt lt cite gt x the least co lt cite gt lt cite gt 2 the cleanburning fuel natural gas that can be our bridge to the future
76 percent increase in oil prices 176 percent increase in natural gas prices
every recession since world war ii has been preceded by a runup in energy prices and none of the runup in prices have equaled the runup in natural gas prices
it is the fastest increase in the cost of education
it is the fastest increase in the cost of our hospital health care
and because fertilizer factories use so much natural gas 21 of them have quit making fertilizer in america and all of them are looking offshore to produce fertilizer
ninety thousand chemical jobs some of the best paying jobs in the industrial sector we have left
it could be bridging us in the transportation field like school buses transportation systems taxicabs delivery trucks easily changeable to natural gas if it was affordable and we had adequate supply
canada produces in our great lakes and sells the gas to us with no environmental impact
when we look at this map and this is my concluding comment the natural gas and oil when we buy 50 oil the whole world buys 50 oil but in natural gas we are at 7
japan and china are 4something and then we look at a dollar 90 cents in russia
this is the most important amendment we will consider in my view in this part of congress
mr chairman i yield myself such time as i may consume to ask the gentleman if we had hearings before it was put in this bill 20 years ago and every year in a row
this funding effort would allow for the total amount of funding for this program at aphis to be 3443 million the same level that was appropriated in fiscal year 2005
the amendment i offer is important to the fruit growers both in pennsylvania and across our nation
the plum pox virus is capable of causing disease in fruits such as peaches plums apricots nectarines sweet and sour cherries
some reports claim 80 to 100 percent premature fruit drop in some plum varieties
with the discovery of plum pox virus in pennsylvania in september of 1999 a survey and eradication program was put in place
through 5 years of survey research and control action the program has been successful in both containing and almost completely eradicating the virus
in fact in 2004 for the first time no plum pox virus was found outside of existing quarantine areas
three years of negative data in several of these quarantine areas allowed the rescinding of those quarantines
after 5 years of testing no plum pox virus has been found in the united states outside the remaining quarantine zone in pennsylvania
as evidence of the virus persistence on june 3 of this year last week the pennsylvania secretary of agriculture announced the discovery of plum pox virus in adams county once again
both the pennsylvania department of agriculture and the united states department of agriculture are currently following the standard procedures to survey and quarantine the area in question
without adequate funding the plum pox virus program will not be able to complete an appropriate survey and the associated procedures which in turn will leave questions about the status of the virus
mr chairman i certainly appreciate the difficult fiscal times we are in
in light of that effort when we get to conference i will be glad withdraw the amendment at the time and work with the gentleman and his staff in the months to come
and the three pillars in this budget i think reflect the principles and the priorities of this house
the tax relief has worked 44 percent growth last year 3 million jobs added to our economy in the last 21 months alone
and third to be sure that we do as the gentleman from south carolina mr spratt xz4003860 says appropriately keep our spending under control we take responsible steps to restrain spending both in domestic discretionary and in the entitlement area
by doing so we reduce the deficit in half within 4 years
the gentleman from iowa has conducted himself in the committee on the budget and here on the floor through an open honest process where people have had the opportunity to say their peace
he has done a great job in listening carefully to the concerns of so many of us in this conference and in the entire congress to be sure we come up with a document that does indeed reflect the priorities i believe of our house the strength of our country the growth of our economy and getting spending under control
i strongly urge my colleagues to support this budget which is although just a blueprint the appropriate statement of who we are and does indeed get us to the point where we are reducing our deficit which is so important but also funding the key priorities in our country
are we in danger of becoming that man
one might expect that these cuts would at least result in significant decreases in our deficits but this is not the case
we continue to face the worstofbothworlds scenario in which we suffer both devastating cuts and dangerous increases in the deficit
we continue to borrow from our children to pay for tax cuts the wars in iraq and afghanistan and the president s social security privatization
may we do justice to those imperatives in the vote we cast tomorrow
madam chairman i rise in support of the slaughtershaysdicksleachprice amendment for increased funding for the national endowment for the humanities and the national endowment for the arts
as cochair of the newly established congressional humanities caucus i am pleased to support this amendment which will in particular increase funding for neh s we the people program by 5 million
we the people is an agencywide program focused on examining and understanding significant events and themes in our nation s history
an additional 5 million will enable we the people to support teacher seminars and institutes with new content focusing on american history and civics media projects focusing on key people and events in american history and preservation projects that preserve and provide access to important historical documents and artifacts that are central to america s historical and cultural heritage
i rise in strong opposition to the spratt amendment
i do not think that happens enough in this house where we have good solid debate like this
our budget lays out a blueprint that invests in defense and invests in homeland security two things that we find to be most urgent at a time when our nation has come under attack recently and where we are engaged in conflict against terrorism around the world
we create in this budget blueprint an opportunity for policies to move forward that create jobs that allow for continued economic expansion that allow us to build upon the fact that homeownership is at its highest rate ever that americans are enjoying a lower tax burden that allows them to make decisions about their children s higher education about their small business about their opportunity to carve out their piece of the american dream
yet the new testament is invoked on a regular basis from the other side s talking points to claim that there will be blood in the streets that there will be mass pandemonium and starvation because onetenth of 1 percent of mandatory spending s rate of growth has been shaven off
you can not look at the spending history of this house and this congress budget in veterans in students with disabilities in hud in education in homeland security and defense and find anyone who has experienced real pain or real cuts in the last decade
our budget lays out that priority investing in defense creating economic opportunity and beginning that long process of making tough decisions the decisions we are paid to make to get our arms around the deficit so that future generations are not burdened and that the current generation current workers current employers current small businesses are not seeing their tax burden go up
but the fiscal year 2006 interior and environment appropriation bill also reflects the kinds of choices made in recent years by this administration and the majority in congress which made this clash of growing needs and shrinking budgets unavoidable
forest service programs that help to promote safety and job creation in rural america are also underfunded in this bill
the president eliminated statewide funding for the land and water conservation fund in his budget
there continues to exist a large inventory of high priority human health and safety threatening sites in our nation s coalfields
the unspent balance in the fund is approaching 2 billion yet this money from a fee assessed on the coal industry is not being adequately deployed to combat these threats to coalfield citizens and their communities
mr chairman i rise in support of the pending amendment and i commend the gentlewoman from wyoming for her leadership on this issue as well as the gentleman from colorado mr udall xz4004121 and the gentleman from utah mr cannon xz4000590
pilt is as important in the east as it is to the west
that particular amendment passed in an overwhelming fashion and in a bipartisan fashion
when americans think of the horse i do not believe they think of it in terms of foreign cuisine on the tables of countries around the european area
each year some 65 000 horses are slaughtered in this country for human consumption in europe and asia where they are sold in restaurants as a delicacy
slaughter is not the same as humane euthanasia administered by a veterinarian in a very controlled environment
each year 690 000 horses die in the us many of which are euthanized by a licensed veterinarian
this would not result in an overpopulation of horses as some suggest
foreigners eat our horses and foreign companies make money and we should stop looking at it in that perspective and start looking at it in the american perspective
mr chairman i want to personally thank the gentleman from south carolina mr spratt xz4003860 so much for the work that he has done in having the record make it clear that we in the house of representatives did have an alternative to what was presented to us
there is a lot of talk about moral values that we hear about politically but i do not care what your religious background is there are always these stories about the sick and the poor in need and on the other side the option is for the rich and the greedy and the insensitive
you do not have to be a republican or a democrat when you look at the document that was placed before us by the majority and then to take a look at the compassion and the common sense that is involved in the alternative that the gentleman from south carolina and his team have brought to us
it would just seem to me that it would make a lot of sense if we invested in our young people that are going to school to make them more productive and make them taxpaying
it seems to me it would make a lot of sense to invest in someone s health so that they would not have to go to community centers which are being cut back that they would not have to go into the hospitals
it seems to me that in the final analysis what we have done is borrow money and ask that we make these tremendous tax cuts permanent and whatever our kids get and our grandchildren get will be the debt that this body can possibly place on them
i just hope that somewhere along the line someone would say that if you really care about this country that you will care about all of its people you will be concerned about its working people and be concerned in making social security something that will be guaranteed for them because we promised them that it would be
but i do not think that anyone takes this budget seriously not if you leave out of it the alternative minimum tax which no one would want to be able to tell their constituents that this 600 billion tax increase that we are going to place on them that we did not mean to do it and no matter how many cities the president goes to no one would believe that he was sincere about reforming the social security system when he knows republicans know democrats know that it is going to take money to do this and that is not in the budget
let me give you some examples that are in this bill and are funded
centers for disease control an agency that is in 43 countries around the world watching out for us
we worry about avian flu but the people that are really doing this are americans in the centers for disease control team that is out there in these 43 nations ready to stand by and alert us if it becomes a greater problem
the number one challenge of government today is to educate people to compete in the world of tomorrow
if you read the literature you find more and more emphasis on the importance of education if a nation is to remain strong if a nation is to provide a standard of living that the people expect that we are used to enjoying in this country
the competition is going to get tougher in the years ahead
you only need to read tom friedman s book the world is flat in which it is pointed out how much is happening or talk to people that have traveled as is the case of my state superintendent to countries in the far east and realize how much emphasis is being put on education
we in the united states need to do the same and this bill recognizes that
our authorizing committee i think took a giant step forward on head start in authorizing it to become more than just a welfare program as was originally envisioned but actually providing that people that man the head start program have some experience in education that they do more than teach
the literature makes it very clear that education does not start at the first grade or even for that matter in the period ahead of that
we fund that in this bill
every member i am sure has had parents in his office with a child with juvenile diabetes or with a parent with alzheimer s pleading with us to do more in medical research to find cures and this again illustrates the compassion of america
we have more than doubled the amount of money going to nih in the last several years because we recognize that this is key to the health of america to find cures to find new ways to address the concerns of the people that all of us have seen in our office who are pleading with us to do something
this bill has 500 programs in it 500 programs that help americans and in many different ways
their number one recommendation is an increase in america s talent pool by vastly improving k12 science and mathematics education
we make that kind of a commitment in this bill
we do give extra funding for math and science and recognize that in the world of tomorrow for our young people to compete they need to have that background
if you have talked with people that work in this program mostly volunteers who take out these meals that allows seniors to stay in their homes for a longer period of time that allows them to see somebody if they are living alone maybe once a day or more often in the week a wonderful program in terms of caring about people
afterschool programs we fund those and those of you who live particularly in the big cities realize how important that is
i talked this morning with a young man that is running an afterschool program in the gentleman from pennsylvania s mr sherwood xz4003720 district a member of our committee where he said how much they can help people with their afterschool programs
there are moneys in here to roll out the prescription drug program because we have a responsibility in this committee to provide for the administration of these programs
global aids is in this bill 100 million to address along with the money in the foreign operations bill that again is very very important and i think we can be proud to be americans
i say it again that when you look at what we have funded in this bill we have funding in this bill for 280 million americans and over many billions of dollars to address the needs of people that addresses things that are very important in their lives
i urge all the members before you rush to judgment on this bill realize that we are in this bill doing a lot of good things for american citizens
maybe it is not as much as you like not many bills ever are as much as people would like that have a high degree of interest but there is a lot of good in here
there is a lot in here for special education
more medical research to address those problems of juvenile diabetes is an example that you hear about in your office more money for education title i more money for community health centers
any of us who have those in and i hope most members do realize how important the community health centers are to people who have no access who do not have a family doctor
liheap again americans recognizing that people in areas of severe weather conditions need an additional helping hand and that is especially true in this time that we are living in where people need to address the problems of excessive fuel costs
take pride in america
take pride in the compassion of the people of this nation as embodied in this bill
mr speaker the complete table of all the funding levels included in the conference report has been printed in the lt em gt lt em gt congressional record as of november 16 and for those of my colleagues who are wondering what each of the programs might be of the 500 you can go to the record of november 16 and pick out a program that you might have a special interest in
many of my colleagues are aware of the difficult choices we had to make in this bill
in february congress received the president s fy 2006 budget request
in light of our budget deficit the president s request assumed a one percent cut in domestic spending exempting both defense and homeland security from this reduction
so many of the programs in this bill play an important part in the lives of american people
i believe an investment in education is an investment in people
in this bill funding for special education is increased by 100 million
this bill provides 100 million to reward effective teachers and to offer incentives for highly qualified teachers to teach in highneed schools
these programs were proposed for termination in the president s budget however we have allocated over 3 billion for the continuation of these important efforts
the sharp rise in college costs continues to be a barrier to many students
in the department of labor we have provided nearly 3 billion for workforce training programs
mr speaker in order to implement more than 400 provisions of the medicare modernization act and ensure senior citizens receive the prescription drug benefits we provided in mma we have allocated nearly 1 billion over the fy 2005 level to the centers for medicare amp medicaid services and social security administration
in terms of earmarks a proposal was made that we take an additional 2 billion as emergency spending and half of that would have been for earmarks
mr speaker and my colleagues i hope you will all weigh carefully what your opportunity here is in terms of voting for this bill
an opportunity to improve health research an opportunity to improve education in title i an opportunity to provide more money for special education an opportunity to ensure that liheap is funded for those in need an opportunity to develop community health centers where poor people can go to get help where they can avoid having to run to the emergency room
let me point out that in 1996 shortly after the republican party became a majority in 1994 and took responsibility in 1996 the total of this bill was 65 billion
i want to mention a special program in here
100 million to help get better qualified teachers in every classroom
homeland security in the form of cdc checking around the world in 43 locations to ensure that avian flu does not reach our shores
i could go on and on about the compassion of this bill in terms of helping people
if you defeat the bill what is going to happen in all likelihood it will give these responsibilities that are embodied in this bill the important programs for america will get rolled into some form of an omnibus bill and will be a continuing resolution
if that were to happen priorities that are embodied in the bill would be lost the things that are so important to all the members of this body but moreover far more important to the people of america 280 million people
i urge a strong positive vote for the bill so we can continue to take pride in america and the compassion of the american people
i know that in our first iteration they did not give us any votes but let me point out to you that if the bill were to fail we would end up with a cr a full year s cr because you know we are not going home without something in this field
in addition if we were to go to a cr if this bill were to fail liheap funding would be reduced by 298 million with no contingency for extreme weather
i might say at the outset that there are no earmarks in the bill none for anyone either side or any person
but i want to tell you what happened to the earmarked money because we had 1 billion in the bill that originally passed the house back early on
mr speaker 250 million is going to nih for research and we recognize that the challenge is great in that field to research medical issues
there is 176 million in liheap and 66 million for community health centers and community health centers obviously provide a place for people who do not have a family doctor and have limited means
these are good uses of the money and i think we all understand that in this time of tight budgets and tight resources we have to set priorities
in so doing we set the priorities i just outlined rather than to go into earmarks
i want to point out to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle that i do not think you want to go home and tell people in the education field that you voted against an increase let me emphasize an increase of 100 million over last year in title i i do not think you want to tell the parents and families of children with special needs that you voted against an increase in special education of 100 million over last year
trio and gearup the president s budget had zero and we put those back in because we think those are good programs
it is important in many communities as is liheap
medicare modernization we are rolling out the new program and we have 980 million in this bill to assist in getting people informed to meet their desires in terms of prescription drugs
that would not be in a continuing resolution
i would guess that almost every member has one or more research grants in his or her district that is funded out of nih
that is very important and we have an increase in that program
in the labor department we have 157 billion for job corps and 148 billion for dislocated workers
well one of the ways that we have gotten the necessary funding to do the items that i mentioned in the way of increases was to eliminate 20 programs
the other body decided to put back some of those but we still have 20 programs that have been discontinued or will be discontinued because again we recognize that we have to manage the resources as carefully as possible to do the important things education research at nih the effort in cdc to deal with the avian flu issue
i think the results of that are reflected in the increases i mentioned
i might say between this and the bill we had previously we added 90 million for rural health programs very important programs obviously and we did this by reducing the avian flu number because we are going to deal with that in another bill that will be coming along shortly
so all in all i want to say again this is a very positive bill it is a very responsible bill in terms of using the resources that are available
this literally is a people s bill but it is a people s bill too in the sense that we manage their tax dollars carefully and try to give them as much in the way of service as possible
i hope my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will take a second look at what we have tried to do in this bill
this is a bill about taking resources that are available and using them in the best possible way to serve the people
we had many hearings in our subcommittee
my colleague from wisconsin was very helpful in those hearings to try to find out what is important to people
we tried to reflect that in the bill given the fact that we had a limited amount of resources
i rise in support of house bill 3010 and i especially wanted to highlight the increased funding for critical rural health programs
access to quality and affordable health care is one of my top priorities and in a district that stretches 23 000 square miles between the canadian idaho and oregon borders the distance creates considerable challenges to ensuring quality health care
in towns like odessa republic davenport primary care coverage is sparse
in addition it is becoming nearly impossible to retain primary care physicians and dentists let alone specialists
this conference report is an important step in turning this tide for rural health care by increasing funds for the office of rural health and research policy rural health outreach grants and area health education centers
training in primary care and dentistry will receive 13 million above the original conference report
these title vii funds have helped support family medicine spokane s rural training efforts which is still producing family practice doctors who want to stay in practice in rural areas like washington wyoming alaska montana idaho
when this bill was addressed on the floor in june i spoke of the need for additional rural health care funds and chairman regula assured me that he would consider increasing those funds in the conference report
i think you are going to have a tough time explaining how you voted against adding 250 million in medical research at nih to deal with the multitude of challenges and to the communities that are earmarked for community health centers to help people without a doctor without medical care
i want to say to my colleagues on our side of the aisle we are not getting any help from our friends on the minority side so i would hope that we will have strong strong support on our side to demonstrate that we can govern that we can pass a very responsible bill with less money than the past because we have managed what we had in a more effective way
but also i say to my colleagues that we want to say to the public that we do care about education that we do care about the teachers that we do care about the students who will benefit from that extra 100 million in title i we want to say to the families of special needs children we do care about your problem and we want to support that extra 100 million that is in this bill
we want to say to those that need community health centers where they do not have access to medical care we want to help you with 66 million additional and with liheap with the northeast in particular and with the community services block grants
they have sacrificed 1 billion worth of earmarks in order to do the things that i outlined before to do more education to do more health research to do more community health centers
so this is something that all of us are taking part in trying to serve the needs of the american people as effectively as possible
today it is 142 billion more than double what it was in 1994
i would point out in the last 10 years we have increased title i aid to disadvantaged students by 91 percent
i was once an elementary principal in a public school and we did not have any special education program
i think we are more and more aware that learning to read early in your education experience is vitally important
we are also recognizing in this bill that the key to a good public education system is a good teacher a good principal a good superintendent caring people
so we put in this bill some additional money to recruit and retrain quality public school teachers and principals
parents who have worked with principals in the school system know how important that is
pell grants we have gone up 64 percent in the last 10 years
again we want to help those students who want to get an education who have limited economic resources to get an opportunity to participate in the american dream
all in all i think we as a congress can take some pride
and we have tried to make sure that every american every american could be in that frontrow seat on the education bus on the health research bus on the labor department programs for job retraining bus
i think this is a bill we can take pride in
my colleagues on my side since we can not get any help from our friends on the minority side for whatever reason i have not quite figured that out but i think our members need to strongly support this bill and continue the pride we can take in our accomplishments since we became a majority since 1994 as i have outlined and particularly in the last 10 years
i hope my colleagues on the majority side will come in and vote in a positive way to increase education to increase medical research to increase a whole host of things that will serve our people throughout this land effectively
i find myself in a precarious position because i do support the agriculture appropriations bill and i think the gentleman from texas mr bonilla xz4000370 deserves a pat on the back for the fine work he has accomplished over the last several months in putting this piece of legislation together
i find interesting that in the auburn journal in northern california one of the areas that has been allowed to be implemented is seafood
so i draw members attention to an article in the auburn journal dated may 25 2005
what this article says is seafood savvy now know where their meal grew up it states in the seafood section at raley s supermarket small blue containers line the shelves filled with red and tan fish
in the bottom righthand corner however a new label is attached a small white rectangle with bold black print that reads product of ecuador product of china or product of usa raley s has been labeling its seafood products since january said keith allen auburn raley s meat department manager
in turn sales will increase providing a boost to texas shrimp producers and the state s economy with these new rules and regulations more texas consumers will have the opportunity to buy lone star state shrimp
stites said consumers will be able to ask for texas shrimp with the knowledge of what is available in front of them so it is a marketing issue very clearly
but i think the people of america want to know where their livestock does in fact come from
and why did they not open their markets and why did they close them in the first place
in some ways it is a safety issue and that is unfortunate
mr chairman point of clarification if the intent is to split the proponents of the amendment so i am a proponent 15 minutes in favor of my amendment and 7 12 minutes each to those that are opposed to the amendment is that what the unanimous consent requests
as my colleagues noticed this is about marketing essentially and it is about the fact that an entire industry was created in places like texas to take advantage of cheap mexican calves bringing them across the border fattening them up and selling them in our food system without any knowledge of where they come from
in turn sales will increase providing a boost to texas shrimp producers and the state s economy they love it when it works to their advantage
on december 23 when the cow was found in the state of washington that had mad cow disease it took exactly 24 hours for 60 of our trading partners to shut off our exports 60 of them
the problem that exists right now and it was very quietly done but on may 21 as i mentioned before the state of durango in mexico can no longer send live cattle to the united states along the texas border because they were mixing cattle between two regions within their state one that has the ability to be exported and the other that does not
there are not many exceptions to the labeling laws in this country rags ribbons screws sponges wicking candle and livestock
it was born it was raised and it is processed in america
it is time we send a message to those that are standing in the way and allow us the opportunity to tell the american consumer born raised and processed in america means something
madam chairman i rise in strong support of the butterfield amendment which would add 2 million to the usda s small farmer outreach training and technical assistance program
as a young man growing up in the el paso upper valley community of canutillo i experienced the many challenges that small and medium farmers face daily
my grandfather father and close family members contributed to the operation of the family farms in the el paso and dell city valley texas
also throughout my tenure in congress i have met with many minority farmers from my congressional district of el paso texas
outreach training and technical assistance are essential to help them succeed in today s challenging agriculture economy
unfortunately while hispanics are the fastestgrowing population in the country they remain a disadvantaged minority when it comes to having the resources to own and farm our nation s land
the small farmer outreach training and technical assistance program has made a great impact in the el paso and las cruces region and without the proper funding for the program i fear our farmers will be lacking the means to succeed
i strongly urge my colleagues to join me in supporting our nation s minority farmers by ensuring the passage of this important amendment and i appreciate the efforts of mr butterfield and others on this important issue
mr speaker i rise in opposition to the conference report on hr 3010
in it congress provides the yearly resources needed to keep our families healthy our children educated our workers employed and our most vulnerable citizens a productive part of our society
he understands that this is the people s bill and he has worked hard to distribute the limited resources he was given in a fair and conscientious way
so my no vote today should in no way be seen as a lack of respect or appreciation for the efforts of ralph regula the chairman of the labor hhs appropriations subcommittee
for example the conference report includes increases in two critical areas to help infants and their families
this program has been instrumental in the prevention of birth defects by encouraging women of childbearing age to take the recommended amount of folic acid daily thereby decreasing the rate of neural tube defects
in addition for the first time this bill also includes programmatic funding for the national media campaign to fight underage drinking which is being conducted by the ad council
i thank the committee for helping our country make progress in these critical public health areas
i voted against the house bill when it came to the floor in june precisely because it fell so short of meeting the needs of america s children families and the most vulnerable among us
i had hoped that the bill would be improved in the conference
it is unfortunate however that in this conference agreement the way they chose to improve overall programmatic funding from the original house bill levels was to take resources away from other priorities and community needs
this report and its funding decisions do not stand in isolation
if approved this bill will impose cuts to essential programs important to americans in at least three major areas
in addition the bill slices international labor affairs the program that helps eradicate abusive child labor practices and protect worker rights
it cuts the education technology block grant program that provides access to technology in schools by a shocking 45 percent from last year s level
in the end this congress will be judged by how well we have served the needs of all our citizens and communities
mr speaker i regrettably rise in opposition to the laborhhseducation appropriations conference report because it grossly under funds the essential programs in education health and human services that help improve the quality of life of the american people
chairman regula has done his best to meet the needs of the most vulnerable in our society with the very limited resources he was given
ironically these inadequate resources are a direct result of his own republican leadership putting tax cuts for the wealthiest in our country before the needs of working and middleclass americans
three weeks ago republicans and democrats defeated the original conference report in a rare show of bipartisanship
there are however two incremental improvements in this revised conference report
nevertheless these modest changes will have little impact on rectifying the enormous gaps created by the funding cuts in this bill
if we pass this conference report the departments of labor education and health and human services hhs will all receive less funding next year than they did in fy 2005
for example the department of labor will receive 430 million less than in fy 2005 resulting in the elimination of skills training for 100 000 personnel in growth industries and the abolishment of job search assistance for 19 million unemployed workers
the department of education will receive 59 million less than it did in 2005 and contrary to the administration s professed commitment to leave no child behind this second conference report will reduce the even start program for lowliterate and lowincome families by 56 percent freeze the english language training program and fund idea with the smallest increase in over a decade
in addition at a time when 45 million americans are without health insurance the department of health and human services will receive 11 billion less than the fy 2005 appropriation
if the majority continues to ignore these values that have set our country apart and contributed to its greatness we will lose our moral high ground and jeopardize our place as the most powerful country in the world
mr chairman as a member of both the congressional black caucus and the energy and commerce committee i rise in support of both the democrat alternative and of the congressional black caucus alternative to h con
the cbc alternative budget invests federal resources in the programs that benefit the constituencies of all of the members of this house education health care economic opportunity retirement security and homeland security
the congressional black caucus budget alternative focuses on closing the disparities that exist in america s communities and invests in the future of this nation by fully funding the no child left behind act at fiscal year 2006 authorization levels expanding the head start programs doubling the funding for historically black colleges and universities and hispanic serving institutions and increasing the size of the pell grant allotment for college students
the congressional black caucus substitute invests in education and funding for the minority health initiative
the congressional black caucus substitute invests in our nation s veterans by restoring the cuts the president s budget proposed in veterans health care and providing enhanced survivor benefits medical and prosthetic research long term care and mental health care
to meet the needs of america and its citizens the cbc changes some of the components of the president s tax program and directs those revenues to making our troops safe in the battlefield and our citizens safe here at home
mr chairman i urge my colleagues to join me in support of the cbc alternative budget
mr speaker i rise today to talk about the republicans budget that was just passed in this house a little while ago h con
somebody in my area the other day asked me the question what keeps me awake at night
we have a serious problem mr speaker our treasury is over 7 trillion in debt
as long as we continue down this road we weaken our position as a world leader because our financial stability is in the hands of other nations
as a nation personal savings has dropped from almost 11 percent in 1984 to about 1 percent in 2004
we are also weak in investment despite historically low interest rates
in fact if you look at this budget you will see that we are spending about 15 billion a week in the war in iraq and afghanistan 15 billion a week
we are not investing and reinvesting in our water and sewage systems
do you think the chinese are investing 15 billion a week in iraq in a war
my background is in finance
through this program seniors pregnant and breastfeeding women and children younger than 5 in 34 states in this country have access to a monthly basket which provides them with basic food such as milk rice pasta juice canned vegetables meat and fish and cheese
inadequate funding for the commodity supplemental food program would result in the removal of more than 75 000 people currently participating in the program
seniors women and children in poverty can not wait until next year to get adequate funding for the food they need
i can only hope that my colleagues in the other chamber will approve the adequate funds to avoid this social catastrophe
by approving increasing fund for this program we will show seniors women and children in need that we care and work for them
mr chairman i rise today in opposition to the republican budget of mass destruction and in support of the democratic and congressional black caucus alternative budgets which recognize the true needs and values of our nation
we do not need to call in weapons inspectors to find the threat to the majority of americans in this budget nor do we need a warning system
in order to pay for those tax cuts the republicans are literally proposing to take away food and health care from lowincome families kill 48 education programs by eliminating the 43 billion that funds them slash veterans health care including cutting 9 million from medical and prosthetic research and undermine community development in struggling neighborhoods by cutting 15 billion in grant programs
in the that state of illinois we could see the earned income tax credit the most effective antipoverty program cut by 1642 million temporary assistance for needy families and child care grants lose 843 million and supplemental security income which helps poor seniors and people with disabilities slashed by 174 million
the 20 billion in medicaid cuts included in this budget resolution are unwise unjustifiable and almost certainly lethal
in my state of illinois medicaid covers 40 percent of all births 30 percent of all children and 65 percent of all nursing home residents
in illinois under the leadership of our governor we are working to expand medicaid to cover more children and more families in face of a growing crisis in health care
it is time to reverse course so that we do not continue to mortgage our country s future and our children s prosperity in order to pay for tax cuts for the rich that we can not afford and that they do not need
what america needs instead is responsible policies that reflect our values help bring our nation together and invests in the future by expanding opportunity
many programs important to georgia are cut including 800 million from the centers for disease control funding for firefighters by 30 percent and 267 million in homeland security funding for georgia
the budget will also eliminate the hope vi program which is revitalizing public housing in georgia
the section 8 housing vouchers cut would remove 8 700 families from the program in georgia
trio programs by almost 13 million for georgia affecting 13 000 students and vocational and adult education in georgia would be reduced by 1737 million from 20062010
these medicaid cuts hurt clayton county where 242 percent of the population in 2003 utilized medicaid
its focus is to reduce disparities that exist in america s communities by investing in the priorities and challenges that americans face today
it also provides significant support for our troops in iraq
at the same time the cbc budget alternative accomplishes these goals in a manner that is much more fiscally responsible than the republican budget so much so as this chart shows the budget deficit each year is much less a total of a 167 billion deficit reduction over 5 years so much so that it saves just in interest cost alone 275 billion over 5 years
with the intention of closing achievement and opportunity gaps in education the cbc budget dramatically increases funding for education and training programs by 239 billion over the proposed republican budget next year alone
millions of atrisk students are hoping to succeed in high school and enroll in college and to make that dream a reality the cbc alternative allocates funding for the gearup program raises the maximum amount for pell grants increases funding for historically black colleges and universities and hispanicserving institutions
in addition the cbc budget funds for the perkins student loan program as well as job training adult education and vocational education programs that are critical in today s global economy
in order to close the existing economic disparities in the united states and to help entrepreneurs realize the american dream the cbc alternative funds job creation programs under the small business administration
the budget also addresses disparities in housing and believes that everyone in the united states is entitled to a safe and comfortable home
the cbc recognizes that advancements in technology and science are necessary to maintain america s competitiveness in today s global economy
the budget supports funding for research and development particularly in aeronautics and nasa and increases funding for the national science foundation the national institute of standards and technology and the department of energy as well as measures for space shuttle safety
moreover the congressional black caucus budget does not adopt the new tax cuts included in the republican budget
the funding for urgent homeland security needs veterans programs and benefits and additional support for defense and our troops in iraq comes from a 78 billion reduction in ballistic missile defense leaving 1 billion in the program for continued research
it is a priority of the cbc to provide american soldiers with the equipment necessary to return home from iraq in a safe quick and successful manner
to that end a portion of these funds have been reallocated to protect our troops in iraq by providing them with body armor vehicle armor and other personal support equipment as well as for the construction and maintenance of our navy vessels which will preserve jobs
the cbc understands that providing homeland security requires appropriate funding to meet the many pressing needs in homeland security and therefore we have substantial funding for port security grants and rail security grants as well as funding for first responders federal air marshals and border patrol agents
the remainder of these funds are used to restore cuts in veterans programs and benefits
the cbc understands that today s soldiers are tomorrow s veterans who deserve our respect and sacrifices not just in word but in deed and in budget
thus the alternative budget makes critical increases in veterans programs and benefits a substantial portion of which is health care
the cbc is committed to reducing disparities in all of america s communities
a top priority of the cbc is to address the exploding deficit problem and that is why our budget reduces the deficit by 167 billion and saves 27 billion in interest payments compared to the house majority s budget
we believe this is a sound budget that will reduce disparities in america s communities and promote and protect the best that america and americans have to offer
on income we changed the revenue by rolling back the tax cuts to the level they were at in 2001 for income over 200 000
again we spend 167 billion less deficit than the republican budget creating 27 billion less in interest payments
now we have heard all of this about massive cuts in defense
now on defense i hope the gentleman from florida is working with the virginia delegation in maintaining a 12aircraft carrier fleet
this budget the congressional black caucus budget has a billion dollars more in shipbuilding than the underlying budget
we have 75 million more in shipbuilding than the underlying budget
we have 75 million more in body armor
we have in homeland security 500 million for port security 100 million for rail security veterans benefits
on behalf of the congressional black caucus this amendment in the nature of a substitute seeks to offer to congress and the american people an alternative budget that is fiscally responsible and aimed at reducing disparities in our communities
these funds total an estimated 363 billion in fy 2006
the remaining funds are used to restore cuts and fund increases in specific budget function areas
these include full funding for no child left behind and providing funds in addition the cbc alternative budget reduces funding for the ballistic missile defense program by 78 billion
the cbc alternative budget reallocates all of this money for additional support for the troops in iraq and other defense items necessary to maintain our military strength and jobs homeland security needs and veterans programs and benefits
revenue raisers and defense reallocation in billions lt p gt general revenue raisers a reduction in the tax cuts from 2001 and 2003 for an individual s adjusted gross income that exceeds 200 000 furthermore the cbc budget alternative does not adopt the new republican tax cuts
the cbc budget applies nearly 4 billion out of the general revenue to deficit reduction in fiscal year 2006
defense reallocation the cost of the ballistic missile defense program is 88 billion in fiscal year 2006
this budget leaves 1 billion in that program for research and development
all of the funds reduced from that program are then reallocated to additional support for the troops in iraq and other defense items necessary to maintain our military strength and jobs homeland security needs under the general allowances function and veterans programs and benefits

mr chairman i thank the gentleman for yielding me this time and i stand in vigorous opposition to this amendment or any amendment similar to this
thanks to the gentleman from florida mr young xz4004391 we have had this moratorium in place since 1983
we need to leave it in place
the environmental studies and testimony that would be required in order to negate any chance of pollution must be gone through before this house ever considers such a bill
it also required the committee to meet the environmental land management cultural science resource and recreation needs of the nation in a responsible manner tough choices were required and i believe the right and most reasonable choices were made
the bill helps meet our fiscal responsibilities by cutting 800 million in discretionary spending from the fiscal year 2005 level but it also allows us enough money that our nation s priorities can be carried out by the diverse departments and agencies funded in the bill
there are many competing interests in this bill that had to be balanced and addressed in a tight allocation
one thing is certain the gentleman from north carolina chairman taylor made a special effort to include both parties in the drafting of lt center gt lt pre gt page h3604 lt pre gt lt center gt the bill places priorities in the areas where they need to be
the bill contains necessary initiatives in forest health in backlog maintenance in the national parks everglades restoration and the national fire plan
mr chairman i rise in support of the alternative budget resolution that will soon be offered by my friend and colleague the gentleman from south carolina mr spratt xz4003860
i do so in light of the fact that the republican budget resolution mirrors the president s request for defense and the spratt alternative matches this funding dollarfordollar but the spratt budget is better because section 401 of his resolution calls on the congress to address serious shortcomings in both the president s budget and the house republican budget resolution
we know right now we are having a great deal of trouble in enlisting young people reenlisting some of the troops
both sides of the aisle and as a matter of fact during the last campaign both the candidates for president said that stopping a nuclear weapon from getting in the hands of terrorists is our top national security priority
last year with a resounding vote of 241 members the house voted an increase for our federal arts agency that we knew would pay us back many times over both in hard dollars and in ways that are simply incalculable for the people we represent
not only was the will of this great body thwarted but also the creative activities of our artistic constituents in every congressional district in this country were stifled
finally the funds that should have been returned to the federal treasury in the form of tax receipts many times over the original amounts never arrived
instead i ask you simply to put these federal art agencies back in business where we funded them last year with an increase of 10 million for nea and 5 million for neh
in it even as he suggested level funding for the agency he asked that american masterpieces a majestic program that emphasizes the best of american art should be increased by 65 million
but unless we provide an overall increase for nea the money is slated to come from challenge america a highly popular program that supported artists in more than 99 percent of our congressional districts last year
challenge america grants go to the towns and hamlets of this sprawling country where big touring companies will rarely go and major actors actresses writers and artists may never appear in person
they energized audiences in texarkana texas and locust grove arkansas and spellbound arthungry folks in albany georgia and billings montana
we can and should do both increase american masterpieces as the president wishes and continue to challenge the artists and their audiences in our congressional districts by funding challenge america
but let me remind my colleagues even with these increases we are far from providing the agencies with the funds they received in the mid1990s
as you see from the first chart nea is currently funded at 121 million but received 176 million in 1992
and neh is funded at 138 million while it received 1755 million in 1994
well every year i stand here and remind you what an economic powerhouse the nonprofit arts industry has become in american
in these difficult financial times for so many of our districts as our local leaders strive to balance their budgets by cutting services we would be irresponsible not to invest in the arts
while other industries have suffered the nonprofit arts world continues to build in strength while it encourages the growth of innumerable small businesses on its periphery thereby creating more jobs
in fact while the national economy has grown at a rate of 38 percent the arts have far outdistanced that number by expanding at a rate of 55 percent
it brightens the life of each one of us bringing us joy and comfort enlightenment and understanding in ways impossible to find otherwise
we have about a 600 million backlog and it is overwhelming to try to address this in an appropriation bill where money is so tight
senators mccain feinstein and alexander are leading the fight in the senate and the gentleman from washington mr baird xz4000110 myself as well as key appropriators such as the gentleman from virginia mr wolf xz4004350 the gentleman from ohio mr regula xz4003340 the gentleman from illinois mr lahood xz4002280 and others here in the house
but what is before us today is actually very important because even in a time of tight budgets the committee on appropriations has seen fit to raise the president s request on national parks by 70 million over last year s funding and 20 million above the president s approval
at a time when we are fighting on so many different fronts to figure out how to balance our budget and move towards a balanced budget where every tradeoff between immunizations and medicaid and whether we support our troops and veterans benefits and all this it is important to remember the legacy of america s national parks america s gifts to the world and i appreciate it very much in this overall important bill that they have increased the funding for the national parks
i would point out that when the bush budget summit agreement came to the floor of this house in the fall of 1990 after many arduous months of negotiation with the bush administration and the democratic leadership and the republican leadership in the house only 88 republicans supported the passage of that bill which had the president s support behind it
in 1993 when we passed the clinton budget act and began the unprecedented march towards lower and lower deficits eventuating in a surplus of 236 billion in the year 2000 not a single republican in either house voted for that deficit reduction effort
mr chairman i yielded to myself to clarify what is in the budget proposal we are proposing versus the budget resolution reported by the committee and sponsored by the republicans
so our budget provides 16 billion more than theirs than the republican resolution for veterans health care in 2006
our budget resolution contains special provisions for our troops to make sure that the increases in life insurance to 400 000 for combat fatalities voted up in the supplemental for 1 year will be extended for future years and that the death gratuity raised to 100 000 will also be continued for future years
our resolution also contains more in the four functions that fund homeland security and make special provisions for increasing the budget for cooperative threat reduction socalled nonproliferation by 200 million
so in summary for our veterans for our troops and for the emerging threats facing us terrorists armed with wmds our budget is not only better funded but better focused than theirs
that makes a big difference when it comes to epa safe drinking water the land and water conservation act and over 5 years our budget is 23 billion in resources and environment better than their budget
i would like to make it clear that education is one of those areas in our budget where we have made a decided improvement and have a notable advantage over the republican resolution
this kind of funding this level of funding can not only preserve current education programs such as vocational education funded at 13 billion which the president and their resolution would simply exterminate wipe out it can also support increases in priority programs like special education
the additional funding we are providing can also help close the gap in funding for no child left behind 12 billion below this year and next year below where it was authorized to be when the act was passed
our budget rejects the reconciliation instructions to the education committee calling for 21 billion in savings over 5 years
the bush administration and the gentleman from iowa mr nussle xz4002980 and the republicans claim that is provided for but that can only be funded in their budget through reconciliation that is through taking it out of other student loan programs
it is one of those things in our budget which we have singled out as deserving of additional funding
mr chairman i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from massachusetts mr neal xz4002910 a former mayor to talk about community development programs in our budget resolution versus theirs
what we have done in our resolution is to make amply clear that the cdbg will survive intact and will be fully funded not suffer some crippling cut as we have provided 9 billion more than their resolution for community development programs over 5 years
first of all in the realm of fiscal discipline we would reimpose a rule found to work and work well during the 1990s a rule that was first implemented by a bill signed into law by president bush the first president bush in 1990 as part of the bush budget summit agreement which laid the foundation for the phenomenal success in the 1990s when we finally moved the budget out of intractable deficits into a surplus in 1998 and into a monumental surplus of 236 billion in the year 2000
in addition it provides when anyone wants to cut taxes when we have a deficit must offset the tax cut so it will not contribute to the deficit it will not further enlarge the problem on the bottom line
on the spending side of the ledger we have brought spending back to current services in many cases restoring deep cuts made by the republicans
well our budget moves to balance in the year 2012 which the gentleman from iowa chairman nussle can not say with respect to his budget resolution
secondly we incur less in deficits each year and over the 10year period of time that we run out our numbers even though we provide current services funding
i met with governors republicans and democrats who have told us a cut of that magnitude would be devastating and we should not cut medicaid by any significant amount so that when the program is revised it has to be revised in pursuit of some arbitrary savings number
there is no difference between us there but we have made some changes in our budget resolution which recommends that resources within the defense budget be shifted to personnel benefits and in particular to see that the 400 000 life insurance increase just provided in the supplemental will be carried forward and that the 100 000 increase in death gratuities will also be carried forward and funded in the future
a signature element is that in the year 2012 it gets to balance but it gets there with balanced priorities
mr chairman when lem keyserling wrote the full employment act of 1946 he was an ardent keynesian and he believed that the government had a major role to play in stimulating an economy in seeking to maintain full employment
keynes believed in deficit financing when the economy was stuck in a liquidity trap and could not get loose
but he did not believe in the kind of deficit financing that we are running today
we have come so far from the year 2000 when after 6 or 7 straight years of fiscal discipline we finally put the budget in surplus a surplus of 236 billion
and it was agreed among everyone there and among democrats and republicans in the house that one thing surely we should do since we now have the resources to do it is no longer borrow and spend the social security trust fund the surplus in it
indeed our proposal was that we use this surplus in the future instead of funding new debt and buying new government bonds instead going into the open market buying outstanding treasury bonds and that way reducing the treasury debt held by the public increasing net national savings which woefully deficient and lowering the cost of capital and boosting the economy
we did not deal then with our longrange liabilities to social security as we could have for the first time in a long time and today we are suffering the consequence of that
now the president has told us he has plans and a budget that will cut this deficit in half over a period of about 5 years
that surely can not be the kind of economy that lem keyserling or maynard keynes had in mind
three times in 4 years this congress at the request of president bush in order to accommodate his budget had to raise the debt ceiling of the united states three times by 2234 trillion
nobody in his right mind thinks that that course can be sustained
it only promises in our estimation more and more debt not less debt
no country in the world could have the kind of current account deficit we have or certainly have the kind of budget deficit that we mitigate the effects of it
and surely one of the things we should be about now is the adoption of a resolution which will take us back to where we were in the year 2000 back to surpluses because we need to be saving not spending as the baby boomers begin to retire
mr chairman i thank the ranking member for his kindness in providing time for me and also the chairman for providing the time he has provided to other congressional black caucus members
in short mr chairman the cbc alternative budget works toward eliminating disparities in housing small businesses economic educational and other disparities created by the administration s fiscal year 2006 budget
for those in college the cbc budget appropriates 450 million for pell grants
in addition the cbc budget funds the perkins loan programs job training and vocational education programs that are critical in today s global economy
our young people particularly african americans are lagging in education when compared to other groups
the cbc understands that federal support for community and regional development helps promote growth in economically distressed urban and rural areas
to remedy these economic disparities the cbc budget ensures that the community development block grant programs will continue to improve housing conditions in low to moderateincome neighborhoods
cdbg provides for these services in a way that recognizes the unique needs of distressed areas in rural urban and suburban communities
in 2004 cdbg assisted 168 938 households across america with their housing needs including financial assistance construction rehabilitation and other improvements
by supporting these programs the cbc is working to close the existing economic disparities in the united states and to help entrepreneurs and ordinary americans realize the american dream
we had deficits of 200 billion 56 percent of gdp in the early 1980s
if you want something to model a budget after then there is a much more recent and much more valid model and that is what we did in 1990 1993 and 1997
in 1990 both sides sat down president bush took part in the negotiations through his staff and we came to the first agreement for the settlement of the budget deficit
the bush balanced budget agreement of 1990 and 1991 laid the foundation for what we accomplished in the 1990s
in 1993 we did the clinton budget
in 1997 we finished it up with the balanced budget act
if you want to see where this budget is likely to lead us i would like to say once again that everybody should look in his mail and he or she will find an analysis of the president s budgetary proposals for fiscal year 2006
you come to table 11 and you look in the far righthand column and you will see the total debt accumulation according to cbo that will be incurred if we follow the president s budget through 2015
mr chairman 5 years ago the budget was in surplus
hard to believe but it was in surplus by 236 billion
i stood here in the well of this house in 2001 and warned that those projections of 56 trillion surplus could disappear in a blink of an economist s eye
when the surpluses of 56 trillion failed to materialize the budget sank into deficit 375 billion in 2003 412 billion in 2004 and an expected 427 billion this year and on and on and on
this budget has 106 billion in additional tax cuts included in it knowing full well that all of those tax cuts will go straight to the bottom line and will add dollar for dollar to the deficit
that is one reason that the cbo says in yesterday s production of the president s budget that the president s budget makes this deficit worse not better by 16 trillion
in other words if we left it on autopilot at current services it would be 16 trillion more in implementing the president s budget
for example it includes 50 billion as a rough cost for our forces in iraq and afghanistan for another year which is more than one can say for the president s budget which does not include a dime
but this budget excludes the likely cost according to cbo in 2007 2008 2009 2010 which cbo estimates to be 384 billion
this budget stops abruptly in 2010 running out 5 years of numbers instead of 10 years of numbers
in fact the gentleman who was in the well just before me emphasized this as one of the sterling features of this amendment
the president has proposed cutting medicaid over 10 years by 60 billion but when the congressional budget office scored his savings and said we can not find 20 billion of savings here maybe 13 maybe 14 but not 20 billion in these proposals nevertheless the committee has said to the committee on energy and commerce to cut 20 billion anyway
when what is off limits in the 68 billion of reconciliation is made clear we can see where the cuts are likely to fall
in other words the safety net
it will be argued i know that this is necessary to balance the budget but in truth none of the 68 billion in reconciliation savings goes to balance the budget
that is because it is more than offset by the 106 billion in additional tax cuts
instead of using these mandatory spending cuts in medicaid to reduce the deficit as they would have us assume these cuts actually are used to offset tax cuts
so there are major problems in this budget particularly when it comes to the key objective and that is reduction of the deficit
and i will return to that in a minute
mr chairman before yielding to the gentleman from texas i would simply like to say that i have here a copy of the cbo s report on the budget january 2005 which shows that in the year 2000 we had revenues of 1 004 trillion under the individual income tax
last year in the year 2004 revenues were 809 billion
in seeking an answer to those questions i would recommend that you look no further than a publication which came to your offices yesterday from the cbo fresh off the press
read table 11 page 2 and look in the far upper righthand corner and you will see the amount of debt we will incur over the next 10 years if this budget which is essentially the president s budget is adopted and implemented 5135 trillion in additional debt
but that is without funding the war in iraq after 2005
but if you want to put the budget back on a path to balance as it was in the year 2000 if you want to avoid the accumulation of that mountain of debt then vote for the spratt or democratic alternative
it accumulates 17 trillion less in debt over the next 10 years than the republican budget base bill
but we warned here in 2001 and in every year thereafter when this resolution came before this house that the other side of the aisle was betting the budget on a blue sky forecast and leaving no margin for error
it is their policy choices made in the face of our objections that have brought us to the point we find ourselves today
in deficit this year by 427 billion last year by 412 billion the year before by 375 billion each year has broken a record for a bigger and bigger deficit
read what our neutral nonpartisan budget shop the congressional budget office has to say in a report that we request every year as a matter of law analysis of the president s budgetary proposals for fiscal year 2006
every member has one of these in his or her office
you only have to read to the second page and look in the upper righthand corner and you will see there that the congressional budget office says if the president s budget is passed and implemented over the next 10 years it will accumulate 5135 trillion in additional debt of the united states
since the president does not have costs in his budget for afghanistan and iraq after 2005 this resolution this estimate does not assume it even though cbo estimates that the additional costs will be 384 billion
if indeed we do what the president is proposing and allow workers to peel 4 percentage points off fica and put those payments into a private account we will incur 49 trillion in debt over the next 20 years
we will not see the budget balanced again in our lifetime
indeed they tell us in this report same page page 2 that the president s budget basically your budget the president s budget makes the situation 2 trillion worse than if we just left things on automatic pilot for current services
this amendment in simple terms will stop the slaughter or human consumption of horses the meat of which will be exported to foreign countries
slaughterhouses in two states
three different slaughterhouse locations in two states
these horses are not slaughtered in this country 65 000 last year for consumption here
they are slaughtered for consumption in europe and asia and 35 000 were not trucked to mexico and canada only to be euthanized there
no americans are affected and only three plants in two states are actually affected
seven pages long that is how many people are in favor of it
well we know from practical experience in five states including california the largest state for the last 7 years this law has been in effect statewide in california and four other states and in california since 1998
practically in the five states that have implemented this law there has been no effect whatsoever
the legislative history is we filed a bill like this in the last congress
we filed it again in this congress
in the last congress after we put on an effort to win support for it we collected 225 cosponsors
and if the 225 members who have supported our bill in the past come forward we will see that the will of the house is that this becomes the law of the land
mr chairman i rise in strong opposition to the republican budget
you d think that d be accounted for in this budget
in the budget
not in the budget
while every other priority is sacrificed in the gop budget billions of dollars more are being funneled into the bloated defense contracts or frittered away in corporate tax giveaways
madam chairman i rise today in opposition to hr 2361
in this time of increased growth and urban sprawl our green spaces are more precious then ever
instead this bill eliminates funding for the land and water conservation fund designed to help local communities preserve open space protect wildlife and make recreation opportunities available in urban areas
in addition this bill cuts funding for the environmental enforcement activities of the epa by 12 million
republicans have consistently sought to weaken environmental standards and this maneuver is the latest in a series of attempts to undermine what have been successful environmental protections and the behest of big business
we have a responsibility to protect our citizens and our environment and this legislation blatantly takes us in the opposite direction
mr speaker i rise in strong opposition to the newer but not better laborhhseducation appropriations conference report
unfortunately the republican majority did not get the message that americans do not want congress to cut 15 billion in critical programs
the education for the disadvantaged program receives the smallest increase it has ever received in 8 years negatively affecting 31 million lowincome children
with the poorly educated workforce the republicans are surely creating there may be too few highlytrained workers to pay into social security to take care of my republican colleagues and me in our retirement
beyond education this bill will literally leave people out in the cold
i urge my colleagues to join me in voting no on this harmful and dishonorable bill
mr chairman i rise today in support of the hinchey amendment and i appreciate the effort he has been doing with these last two amendments and i hope we will continue his work because the amendment is very important
in some cases onethird of the advisory committee s appointees do parttime consulting work research or own stock in the companies whose drugs they are considering
however this week an article in the philadelphia inquirer reported that senior executives at merck threatened to damage a harvard researcher s career if he publicly lectured about the health effects of vioxx
in such an environment where those who are trying to help protect our families are threatened by drug companies it is inconceivable that advisory committee members can remain unbiased as they examine their parttime employer s drugs
we have so much work to do in this area
the hinchey amendment does not put any new requirements upon the fda merely enforces the law as is written and this congress should stand up and enforce the law as explained in previous congresses
mr chairman i rise to engage the chairman of the interior subcommittee in a colloquy dealing with some language in the committee report requiring the epa to fund a national academy of science study
i would point out that our colleague the gentleman from new york mr hinchey xz4001780 who engaged in a colloquy a little earlier stated that there was strong support for this project
in some ways that is an overstatement of that support
i represent the affected area and in fact it has been an extremely difficult process for my constituents
however we all agree that further delay of the project is in no one s best interest
as you have already clarified the report language mr chairman in no way is intended to delay stop or otherwise disrupt the cleanup planned for the hudson river slated to begin in the summer of 12006
further the epa has reviewed the language and found no provision that would require them to disrupt the hudson river project in any way
let me just say that it has long been my position that we should not debate past decisions no the hudson river but look to the future in the region and focus on protecting those communities most directly affected by the cleanup project
this is especially true for the residents of fort edward new york who will be hosting the dewatering site in their community
this amendment i offer today is a supplement to that amendment and one that we have sought a vote on an upordown vote for several years in this body
for that reason in particular i want to thank the subcommittee chairman for affording us this opportunity
the amendment essentially would end the use of taxpayer dollars to enable and subsidize foreign enterprises largely operating in opposition to the vast opinion and support of united states citizens and in fact the majority of states have outlawed the slaughter of horses for human consumption and yet this process continues on
the opposition will say this amendment will lead to an increase in the abuse of horses or horses running wild in our streets
first of all each year 65 000 horses are slaughtered in this country for human consumption in europe and in asia not here where they are sold as a delicacy
many times this is administered improperly causing unnecessary pain and suffering before death and that is after these horses have been transported in excess of 1 000 miles in the most inhumane conditions perceived
passage of this amendment will not cause an overpopulation of horses since each year the numbers are this about 690 000 horses die in the us many of which are euthanized by licensed veterinarians
slaughter represents only 1 percent of the horses that die each year and this would not result in overpopulation of horses as some have suggested
horses are not bred in the united states for that purpose
this amendment simply says that the use of american taxpayer dollars to pay for the salaries and the work of usda inspectors ought to stop and those resources ought to be committed to making sure the food supply and the food chain here in this country are fully protected
let us stop this practice a practice that flies in the face of generations of precedent here in congress and strong opposition by the american public
in fact it is my contention that it will give the usda extra resources to do the job of protecting the american food chain
finally if we are simply going to get into a debate over which organizations support it there are vastly more organizations some of the most preeminent experts in the horse industry who support this legislation including congress s top veterinarian senator ensign who is introducing a counterpart bill in the senate
we know the names of many horses and the fact is horses are not raised in this nation for human consumption
i just simply say before i recognize that the gentleman raises some interesting points and i would hope that the authorizing committee could go to hearings in the near future
the bill provides a total of 262 billion in funding for programs for the department of the interior environmental protection agency forest service indian health service the smithsonian institution and several other environmental and cultural agencies and commissions
the payments in lieu of taxes program has a healthy increase of 30 million above the budget request and more than 3 million above the 2005 level
finally we have restored critical environmental education research and rural water programs in the environmental protection agency and provided some limited increases for initiatives proposed in the budget request including superfund homeland security school bus retrofits the clean diesel program methane to markets initiative and the brownfields program
the budget request for epa while substantially below last year s level and proposed increases in that budget request were funded by elimination of many critical mission essential programs
we heard from nearly every member of the house asking that we provide funding for epa programs that were eliminated or reduced in the budget
the program restoration and increases for the various programs and agencies in this bill are offset by the decreases in land acquisition construction and state grant programs and by lowering the amount provided for the increases proposed in the budget request
it provides the needed funding to keep the agencies in the bill operating at a reasonable level
at this point i would like to ask that a table detailing the accounts in the bill be inserted in the record
madam chairman i would like to thank the staff of both the minority and majority staff and mr dicks and all of those who have worked with the committee in producing this
we are funding the state revolving fund 850 million the same as we did in 2005
unfortunately with the costs and the deficit we have now we can not continue to put more and more in
we are trying to do the best we can by consistently funding our needs in this area
certainly we support both and have done so generously in this bill
in fact this increase would be an even smaller part of that 9 billion and so it would be hardly noticeable inside the total support of the arts
this will cost some 200 staff positions in the department of the interior and forest service
they are responsible for 634 acres in the united states
i ask members to join me in opposition to this amendment
we will certainly stand by our statements to decrease the spending on land if we can manage that and we will count on the house to support us in that area
in no way should this study delay or disrupt either phase i or ii of the planned cleanup of the hudson river or any other ongoing superfund project
i will work with the gentleman to consider modifications to clarify this in the conference agreement
i agree with the gentleman that invasive species pose a threat to the marine environment and we do provide funds in the bill reported by the committee to address the invasive species act
we have also provided other invasive species funds to stop that in areas of timber and things coming in from imports
for instance the hemlock wooly adelgid is one of the invasive species that are threatening one of our species and may wipe it out in plant area
but the gentleman is right and i will work with him to see if we can increase funding in this area in the conference report
i note there are some small increases included in the bill for invasive species efforts by the fish and wildlife service also
mr chairman i rise in opposition to the amendment
in fact we increased it some 30 million in our bill
but the department of interior is responsible for onefifth of the land in the united states and manages programs that affect over 4 million native americans
in developing this bill the committee made a number of difficult choices
mr chairman i rise to claim the time in opposition
the amendment increases payments in lieu of taxes 48 million and reduces the national endowment for the arts by 15 million
in developing this bill the committee made a number of difficult choices
but to unbalance this bill at this time i must rise in opposition
in no way should this study delay or disrupt either phase 1 or 2 of the planned cleanup of the hudson river any other ongoing superfund site and i know of no party involved that wishes that delay
mr chairman i would like to engage in a brief colloquy if you will on the subject of the proposed usgs laboratory in santa cruz california
i would be pleased to assist in a meeting with the gentleman and agency officials on this matter
the committee recognizes the uniqueness and development needs of the war in the pacific national historical park in guam
i thank the gentlelady for her efforts and look forward to continuing to work with her on this matter in the future
mr chairman i make a point of order against the amendment because it proposes to change existing law and constitutes legislation in an appropriations bill and therefore violates clause 2 of rule xxi
the rule states in pertinent part an amendment to a general appropriations bill shall not be in order if changing existing law the amendment imposes additional duties
this working group has 24 members of the republican conference who have backgrounds in urban issues either having served as mayors or members of city councils or otherwise in local government or who by their districts have a natural affinity for urban issues by working closely with their communities and seeing the difficulty of urban revitalization and redevelopment and the commitment to bringing jobs back to our cities
mr chairman i support the committee on the budget in adding 1140 billion to the administration s request for programs under the community and regional development function in the budget which includes the community development block grant
this is an important notation because it is very important for national associations that support urban issues like the us conference of mayors the national league of cities that have had a great deal of concern about the consolidation of 18 programs some of which are currently located in hud to commerce and the reduction in overall spending which was proposed of 30 percent
this house in taking the action of supporting the committee on the budget s resolution does not accept the president s level of funding and looks to restore functions for cdbg that go to important issues in our community such as taking abandoned houses and refurbishing them demolishing abandoned buildings where they can not be rehabilitated taking abandoned lots that might have been strewn with broken grass or be places where criminals congregate and turning them into community parking lots that can help support areas of local community business districts
i want to thank the chairman for listening to the great degree of success that they have had in the past and looking to ways that we can continue to support this program
the result has been to reverse a decade of progress that saw the budget go from the 290 billion deficit when president clinton took office to a surplus of 236 billion in 2000 which was where things stood when the current president bush came to office
unfortunately the combination of recession the need to increase spending for defense and homeland security and excessive and unbalanced tax cuts have taken us to the largest deficits in our nation s history a 375 billion deficit two years ago a deficit of 412 billion last year and for this year according to the bush administration itself a deficit of 427 billion
that is three recordsetting years in a row
it was better fiscally and better in terms of the education of our children the health care of our veterans the development of our communities and the quality of our environment
it would have brought spending in the domestic discretionary accounts back to baseline that is to current services enough to prevent them from being eroded away by inflation but not any significant increase
that in turn was the result of the unrealistic and inadequate budget resolution that the republican leadership pushed through the congress earlier this year
among the worst are its severe reductions in funding for the environmental protection agency
this will mean that many communities in colorado and elsewhere will be adversely affected as projects that have already been approved by state water authorities for future funding probably will be rejected scaled back or substantially delayed
in colorado and across the county there is a need for wise reinvestments of the funds coming into the treasury from oil and gas development on the outer continental shelf and elsewhere
of course there are some good things in this bill
i am particularly glad that because of the adoption of an amendment i sponsored along with mrs cubin mr rahall and mr cannon it includes 242 million for the payments in lieu of taxes or pilt program that is so important to local governments in colorado and across the country
mr chairman i rise with my colleague from wyoming and a number of other colleagues from the west and from the east in support of this bipartisan amendment offered by the gentlewoman from wyoming mrs cubin xz4000880
the amendment would increase funding for the payments in lieu of taxes or pilt program by 12 million
that would not be enough in my opinion but it would be a definite improvement
we were reminded about that when the president s budget proposed a 26 million cut in pilt
so i am glad the committee on appropriations rejected this idea and i applaud them for including 230 million in the bill for pilt
she has a bill that would phase in full funding for pilt over 3 years
i have also introduced a bill with the gentleman from colorado mr salazar xz4006201 that would provide permanent automatic funding and i hope the committee on resources will take this up in the near future
but in the meantime we should pass this very bipartisan amendment which will help counties all over our great country
madam chairman i also would stand in support of the slaughtershaysdicksleachprice amendment
madam chairman i rise today in strong support of the slaughter shaysdickspriceleach amendment to increase funding for the national endowment for the arts and for the national endowment for the humanities
in my district in new mexico arts and humanities are a significant part of daily life the name sante fe conjures up images of georgia okeefe s beautiful flowers and ansel adams breathtaking photographs
in congressional terms these amounts are a blip on the budget screen
but in terms of what they mean to these programs and the constituents who benefit from them such increases are incredibly helpful and can mean the survival of numerous arts and humanities programs around the country
i often hear from new mexicans who attest to the effectiveness of the we the people initiative in strengthening youth understanding and appreciation of american history and culture
in addition to economic benefits of the arts recent studies have shown the significant impact that arts education can have on atrisk youth
they also show decreased frequency of delinquent behavior improvement in attitudes toward school higher selfesteem and much lower dropout rates
this bill is flawed in so many ways and is a disservice to the american people
it is the latest move in the steady drumbeat of a republican legislative agenda that makes working and middle class americans pay for the tax cuts that benefit the ultrawealthiest americans
and it comes at a time when we are confronting the aftermath of hurricane katrina and the huge costs of waging the ongoing war in iraq
title i which is the core of nclb s efforts to improve reading and math skills receives the smallest increase in 8 years only 100 million which means 31 million lowincome children will be left behind
the conference agreement does not include the 81 billion in emergency funding provided in the senate bill for pandemic flu preparedness or any part of the 71 billion requested by the administration for that purpose
community college training grants are cut by 50 percent in each of fy 2005 and fy 2006
under the conference agreement only a few programs receive modest increases over fy 2005 and in most cases even these increases are below the amounts sought by the administration
while the conference agreement restores many of the 50 programs proposed for termination in the house bill these restorations were made at the expense of funding for priority programs such as community health services title 1 grants for lowincome children and special education grants and pell grants
title 1 grants for lowincome children receive a 08 percent increase the smallest increase in 8 years
special education grants receive a 09 percent increase the smallest increase in a decade
the maximum pell grant is frozen at 4 050 for the fourth consecutive year compared to the 4 100 provided in the house bill
mr speaker i rise in opposition to this fy 2006 laborhhs conference report
today we are being asked to pass judgment again on a virtually identical piece of legislation as if shuffling 180 million between accounts in a 602 billion conference report can begin to compensate for the deficiencies in the underlying bill
here s a sample from this legislation s hall of shame there are 779 million in cuts for no child left behind meaning 31 million kids wo nt get the reading and math help they were promised
a freeze in the lowincome home energy assistance program llheap despite the 44 percent increase in natural gas prices and 24 percent increase in home heating oil prices expected this winter
this house has refused to provide sufficient help to families in need despite the fact that it voted a few months ago to give the oil and gas industry a 14 billion tax subsidy
a cut in real terms from the national institutes of health that will result in nih funding 505 fewer research grants than it did just two years ago
a 5 percent cut in critical services for the 74 million unemployed and displaced workers left behind by our increasingly globalized economy
mr chairman i rise in opposition to this amendment proposed by my colleague from oregon
i only wish i had known in advance the gentleman was going to offer this amendment because it is specifically targeted toward my district a tribe in my district that is seeking to gain approval of a compact and take land into trust
warm springs tribe is not a family of five that has gone out shopping somewhere in some other state for land
they have land in the scenic columbia river gorge that is in trust and was in trust prior to the passage of igra and it is on a hillside where they have plans where they could build and they could do that today
they reached a compact with the democratic governor in a long and protracted discussion
we have looked at that and he should know because we know it was done over a 4month period one with readings at a little town in wishram washington during the winter when it is foggy in the gorge
i grew up in the gorge
and in the summer if you want to come and find where the wind blows come to the gorge and enjoy the great recreational opportunities and it blows from the west
the west is where the great urban center of our wonderful state is where there are traffic problems and industrial problems and i tell members that because if there is a problem with pollution in the gorge it is not coming from the east it is coming from the west
he has been a remarkable leader throughout his career and there is no one in this house who can question his sincerity or his knowledge of the issues that he is responsible for
i rise today in strong support of this bill
we will hear much from the other side of the aisle about what is missing from this bill why we are not spending enough in this bill
that is more money than the entire budgets the entire budgets of russia china germany and we could throw in 15 or 20 other countries
but there is also the argument that we will hear on the other side of the aisle about our deficits that our deficits are too high our deficits are growing our deficits our deficits our deficits but every time we bring a bill to the floor there is not enough money in it
they can not rail against deficits and then tell us that we need to spend more money on every program in the federal budget
there are a lot of problems in our country lots of them and we have them in our home towns our big cities our rural areas and this is an effort to deal with those problems
for example our party we have since we have become the majority provided billions and billions more in dollars for education remembering that the education dollar public education was 95 percent state and local funds
and yet 50 percent of the kids who start high school in the united states today do not finish high school
it is about parents it is about school boards it is about teachers it is about kids getting it right taking a serious look at our public educational system in this country and realizing as so many have said that we we are also providing billions and billions of dollars for health care
in this bill we are not even talking about the brand new medicare prescription drug benefit the 400 billion prescription drug benefit that congress just enacted that is just taking place today
again what a remarkable response by the government of the united states to the needs of our senior citizens because everybody knows that health care in this country has changed
one of the predecessor chairmen of this bill was a fellow named bill natcher who served with great distinction in this house for 40 years
and the people who pay the taxes benefit in large part from the services and support programs provided in this bill
there are over 500 programs in this bill
it is a very complex bill the american public is very concerned about the level of acrimony and partisanship here in washington today
we do not have unlimited resources in this country
we have tripled the funding for the national institutes of health the institute that provides the research that supports the research done at american colleges and research institutions around the country that gives us this country the level of quality of health care that it has the best in the world
so we not only have set these priorities in a very tough budget year but he has increased funding
by making further changes in the bill chairman regula has provided an additional 100 million for funding for special education to states
now again both parties have been very supportive over the years of the individuals in education act
we our party i think to our credit have dramatically increased the level of funding in idea
we have again increased liheap which is very important in my part of the country in the northeast
and community health centers for the people who do not have health insurance in this country here is an opportunity to help them to provide health care good solid health care that we all need
mr chairman i rise in strong opposition to the shameful republican budget
yet again the republican leadership neglects the needs of low and middle income families in order to provide hundreds of billions of dollars in tax cuts to the wealthiest of americans
they have the kind of extensive community planning that brings in all of the community groups and organizations the 501 c 3 since the president initially proposed consolidating cdbg and other development programs into one grant program not only have i received all of these letters from members of city councils and mayors they have basically said without this program many of their cities will simply collapse
in addition to these cuts the president has already proposed to cut public housing by 10 percent section 811 disabled housing by 50 percent housing opportunities for persons with aids by 14 percent and other hud programs
i urge my colleagues to reject the republican budget and to support a budget that invests in the future of our country
mr chairman i rise in strong support of the congressional black caucus s budget that is being presented here today
by formula every city town state in america receives funds from this community development block grant program
this money is block granted to these entities in order to assist these cities with everything from infrastructure development assistance with housing so that people can get into homes being assisted with down payments with rental assistance with 501 c 3 s nonprofit organizations that are providing services for atrisk youth for seniors for the kinds of programs that these cities and towns could never fund without this block grant
in many ways this money that is going to the cities is the last of the moneys to deal with poverty to deal with the lack of resources because of the inability of these cities and towns to be able to raise the kind of revenue that could help them with the very basic needs of their cities
mr chairman i rise in strong support of the cbc substitute budget
the cbc budget rejects the failed budget policies of the bush administration and would return us to a policy of investing in education job training housing veterans and community development programs that millions of people depend on
the cbc budget substitute recognizes the vital role that the community development block grant cdbg program plays in improving our communities
these cuts to the cdbg program will leave a huge hole in the budgets of our local governments a hole they can not and will not be able to fill with their own resources
we also reject the 286 million in cuts proposed for the hope vi program and instead provide 500 million for hope vi so that it may continue its important role in rehabilitating our nation s public housing
at some point tomorrow the congressional black caucus will be introducing an alternative budget which we will discuss in detail
there are two choices in particular we will be asking them to consider would you rather provide a tax cut to people who make more than 200 000 per year or would you rather spend approximately 30 billion dollars that you would save if you did not provide that tax cut on a series of things that would benefit our community and have a substantial potential of closing some of the disparities and gaps that have existed for years and years between african american citizens and white citizens in this country
the second question we will be asking will be would you rather spend 79 billion on a ballistic missile defense program which has been tested time after time after time and has failed all of those tests or would you rather spend that 78 billion on providing more security to our troops body armor personnel support equipment and other protective gear for our troops and providing more benefits to our veterans in this country
most of the revenue raised in the cbc budget will be used to address disparities in america s communities
on the military side we would roll back 78 billion in ballistic missile defense spending leaving using 1 billion for research to continue regarding the ballistic missile defense system
this fiscal responsibility is rewarded by a reduction of 27 billion in interest payments compared to the house majority s budget over that 5year period
we will have a responsible budget and i look forward to having the support of our colleagues in this body and look forward to discussing the proposed cbc budget in more detail tomorrow when our substitute is presented to the house
let me just go through some of the things that the congressional black caucus budget will do in various areas
we are planning to submit this budget tomorrow and we will be adding an additional 1 billion in the international affairs category for foreign aid to africa and the caribbean global aids initiative in the state department public health and preventable illness initiatives
we will be adding half a billion dollars in general science space and technology in the following areas nasa research and development nasa space shuttle safety restore research and development funding for the national science foundation department of energy
we will be adding an additional 50 million in the natural resources and environment historically black colleges and university preservation program
we will be adding 300 million in the agriculture budget in support of the 1890 landgrant historically black colleges and universities expanded food and nutrition education programs the us department of agriculture office of civil rights
and we will be restoring and modifying some of the draconian cuts in agriculture programs that affect minorities in particular
we will be adding 1 billion in commerce and housing credit for sba loan programs the 7 a program microloan and new market venture programs adult training and dislocated worker programs manufacturing extension partnerships home ownership initiatives
we will be adding 150 million in transportation most of which will go to amtrak
we will be adding 15 billion to community and regional development to restore the cuts that have been proposed by the president in the community development block grants increased funding for brownfields economic development empowerment zones community development financial institutions economic development assistance
we will be adding 239 billion in education and training with which we will fully fund the no child left behind
in the area of health we will be adding 1 billion
in the area of administration of justice we will be adding 1 billion
and we will be adding 2 billion in homeland security for rail security and port security
and all we are saying to our members in this body is that these things that i have just described are much higher priorities
we believe that a budget is a statement of priorities and in that respect members should know where the money is coming from that is being budgeted and how the money is being spent
our agenda is about closing disparities that exist between african american citizens and other citizens in this country and have persisted over time
they involve closing the achievement and opportunity gaps in education closing the gaps in health care for every american closing the gaps in employment and economic security in wealth and business opportunity in our country closing the gaps that continue to exist in our justice system closing the gaps that continue to exist in retirement security for our citizens and closing the inequities that have persisted throughout our history in foreign policy
the people in my district who make over 200 000 a year have told me that they would rather educate our children and fully fund no child left behind than they would have a tax cut
this is an insect that bores its way into trees primarily in illinois in the northeast and kills them
and we in new york and in new jersey and illinois have had to chop down a lot of them
what my amendment will do is to increase the funding for aphis to bring it up to the level that the bush administration proposed in their preliminary budget
if you have the emerald ash borer in indiana ohio or michigan or in the pacific coast or suffer from sudden oak death in california or oregon or are dealing with the glassywinged sharpshooter in california or of course boll weevils throughout the south all of these are pests which are having a dramatic impact on our economy or is having a budget cut in this round to an unacceptable level
we found when this house weighed into this debate in the past and increased funding through an amendment on the floor we wound up having a substantial positive impact
when the asian longhorn beetle was first kind of discovered in 1999 here in the east coast there were 2 500 trees that were affected
it was down to just 66 in 2004
we are not going to be able to get a 44 million increase in this bill
what the amendment does is try to reach a point that we at least start to win the battle again start to lead to a reduction in the amount of trees that are infected not only by the asian longhorn beetle but by the emerald ash borer and others that i mentioned
there is hardly a state in the union that has not found its trees impacted by these pernicious insects
whether it is the cactus moth or the gypsy moth in washingtonoregon i would urge my colleagues in virtually every state of the union to look to see if you have an insect that represents a pest that is impacting not only the trees in the abstract sense of our environment but also our economy
there is hardly a state in the union that would not benefit from this amendment
the gentleman from michigan mr mccotter xz4002600 who is sponsoring this amendment with some of us in the new york and new jersey delegation is detained
madam chairman i commend the gentleman for acknowledging what i think we all should in the last amendment that we are not giving funding sufficient funding to this aphis account
that was one of the many pests on the list that would be increased in that case
just like in the gentleman s district in the gentleman s state just like in new york just like in louisiana with imported fire ants just like in texas with the mexican fruit fly just like in california with the mediterranean fruit fly this is an underfunded area
madam chairman reserving the right to object i would ask the author of the amendment that would increase by 1 million does he intend to support the amendment that was just passed that would increase the account that he wants to solve the problem in by 19 million
we have had tremendous outlays and expenditures with hurricane katrina the war in iraq and that we really need to hold the line on spending
and what this bill does i believe is unprecedented in my 11 years of being here in the house of representatives
this is a real reduction in spending and i think it is quite impressive
what chairman regula has done is adopted a philosophy which i think everybody in the congress should adopt look at programs very seriously and are they getting the job done
and contrary to reagan s statement that the only thing that has eternal life in washington dc
they are small in the budget realities we are dealing with now nonetheless they are real
we have had in this bill for as i understand it decades conscience protections for health care providers that do not want to perform abortions
but in recent years very aggressive abortion rights advocates have been putting pressure using regulatory agencies and state governments and courts on hospitals and other institutions to begin performing abortions when the officials and the workers in those institutions did not want to do that
the working families in my congressional district have not seen their incomes double in that time period
we have seen unprecedented challenges that we have had to face this year hurricane katrina recovery from that hurricane wilma which significantly affected my district and the state i live in and then of course we are fighting a war a war on terror in this country
i just ask all members to keep in mind you will hear statements that this bill is going to devastate health care in america
the discretionary accounts in this bill represent less than onetenth of 1 percent of total health care expenditures
i came here to act in a responsible fashion and that is what this bill does
i would point out that we hear a lot from the american equine veterinarian practitioners and the american quarter horse association about their great concern for these horses and yet there are hundreds of organizations in the country today who provide funding through their foundation to provide retirement homes for unwanted horses
yet i am not aware that the american equine veterinarian practitioners do that through a foundation nor the american quarter horse association nor do they do it through a foundation and they are the most prolific breeders of any breed in the country
they are the only ones slaughtering horses in america
in addition to that the attorney general of texas who is now a us senator wrote a legal opinion while he was attorney general stating that it was illegal to slaughter horses in texas
and yet despite that the slaughterhouse brought a lawsuit and that case is now pending in us district court
in fact there is an effort made to conceal that selfdescribed killer buyers are at the auction house and they take the horses to slaughter
but most important we have an inconsistent policy in the us government today on this issue
we prohibit sending horses out of america by sea for the purpose of slaughter and yet we allow them to be slaughtered in the united states
the coast of marin and sonoma counties my district is one of the most biologically productive regions in the world
the coastal communities in my district rely on tourism and the fishing industry that could be severely hurt if offshore oil drilling and gas drilling were permitted off our coasts
the people who live in my district do not and will not support offshore drilling
they realize that we need an energy policy that focuses on investments in energy efficiency and renewable energy sources not oil rigs not an endless depletion of our natural resources
this devastation can be seen in the gulf of mexico where ocs pipelines crossing coastal wetlands are estimated to have destroyed more coastal sale marsh than can be found in the stretch of coastal land running from new jersey through maine
but the people that i am so fortunate to represent in marin and sonoma counties do understand
the coast of marin and sonoma county in my district is one of the most biologically productive regions in the world
the coastal communities in my district rely on tourism and fishing industries that could be severely hurt if offshore drilling was permitted off of our coast
if you were to visit this beautiful stretch of coast you would understand why the people who live in my district do nt and wo nt support offshore drilling
they realize that we need an energy policy that focuses on investments in energy efficiency and renewable energy source not oilrigs and the endless depletion of our natural resources
mr chairman i urge my colleagues to join me in opposing the peterson amendment
mr speaker the budget and appropriation bills that we pass here in the house are reflective of our values as leaders in this country
this is only one of the many many many ways that this bill fails to invest in the american people and their children
madam chairman i rise in support of the slaughtershaysdicksleachprice amendment
mr chairman i thank the chairman and the ranking member but i am deeply concerned about a possible indian gambling casino in the columbia river gorge national scenic area
i have had these concerns for at least 7 years and i am extremely disappointed in recent developments
the governor of oregon signed a compact with this tribe on april 6 and it was presented to the department of the interior on april 8 i have been consistent in my position and i have privately informed the confederate tribes of the warm springs reservation and governor kulongoski and his predecessor governor kitzaber throughout my congressional career that i specifically do not support a casino in the columbia river gorge national scenic area and that generally i oppose offreservation gaming casinos
i have persisted in suggesting to the warm springs tribe that they consider a new location on reservation land along a highly traveled route namely highway 26 between portland oregon and bend oregon
this particular proposal came to the federal government on april 8 and it is necessary that i weigh in now
a casino of this magnitude will bring over 3 million nongorgerelated visitors per year a million cars per year to the area and exacerbate traffic pollution and risks to endangered species in the columbia river gorge national scenic area
state and federal agencies have already determined that air quality in the columbia river gorge is significantly degraded and that visibility is impaired 95 percent of the time within this national scenic area
also according to the united states department of agriculture forest service pacific southwest research station this area suffers acid rain and fog as severe as what falls in industrial cities such as los angeles pittsburgh and new york
in all the states i listed budgetary problems persist and gambling does not solve their problems
mr chairman i would inquire of the chairman as to whether the chairman would permit the gentleman from oregon mr walden xz4004190 and me to engage in a discussion of the merits of the amendment
if you had grandfathered those programs in i believe it would be a lot better
just remember you should have grandfathered those existing programs in place
mr chairman i rise today in support of the house of representatives budget plan and thank chairman nussle and his committee for their dedicated work on this legislation
even as our economy has grown and revenues have increased in the past year we continue to spend more than we take in
much of the increased spending in the past few years has gone toward national defense and security including 258 billion in extra funding since september 11 2001
first our budget does not raise taxes in order to pay for more spending as some are proposing in their alternatives
third this budget will set us on course to reduce the growth in mandatory spending which is growing far faster than our economy and comprises nearly twothirds of all federal spending
while nondefense discretionary spending is only about 20 percent of federal spending it is the area in which congress exercises the most direct annual control
by reducing spending in this area by 8 percent we force ourselves to do better at finding the waste and consolidating or eliminating the programs we do nt need in order to make the best use of the resources available
for the first time in eight years congress is finally dealing with the unchecked growth of mandatory spending in this budget
let s be clear despite what we are hearing from some on the other side this budget does not cut any programs that help those in need
in the last ten years federal medicaid spending has nearly doubled growing at an average of 8 percent each year
even with the savings called for in this budget medicaid will still grow by 73 percent over the next 10 years as opposed to increasing by 76 percent
i am concerned that the target in this bill is more than agriculture s total share of mandatory spending
as we conference with the senate i ask that the budget committee work toward a number that is more in line with agriculture s 47 percent share of mandatory spending
the 2002 farm bill has proven to be a very effective safety net for our producers providing support in times of lower prices and reducing support when it is not needed
changing the rules of the game now and then again in two years is not sound policy
budget decisions we make in agriculture today will not only affect the 2007 farm bill but they will also affect our negotiating position in the world trade organization
neither do i and i am committed to working in conference to ensure our final budget outline for the year treats agriculture fairly
as a member of the arts caucus i am proud to support our amendment which represents an important step towards providing these agencies with the funding they need to continue providing critical support for literary design performing arts and cultural projects in south dakota and across the country
i recognize the need for wildland fire protection and i strongly believe that congress must provide federal land management agencies with the resources they need to protect our public resources from fire as well as the lives and property of those who live in and near national forests
it was for this reason that i voted in favor of the amendment offered by my colleague mr beauprez xz4000200 of colorado to increase funding for wildland fire protection
unfortunately i strongly disagree with the source of funding that mr beauprez chose to utilize the national endowment for the arts in order to fund this wildland fire prevention increase
i believe this was a function of the offset that the amendment sought to use and not a lack of support in the house for forest fire prevention
i offer to work with my colleagues in the house of representatives in the coming years to identify ways to fund increased wildland fire funding without raiding the important funds of the nea to accomplish that goal
mr chairman i strongly support the cubinrahalludall amendment that seeks to increase funding to the payment in lieu of taxes pilt program by 12 million
this amendment would bring the federal government s payments for pilt closer to the authorized funding level helping local governments in 49 states while still allowing the interior department to spend 10 million more for administrative costs than in fiscal year 2005
mr chairman i rise in complete support of this amendment and i want to commend the strong and tenacious leadership of the gentleman from montana mr rehberg xz4003350 for his offering of the amendment today
producers in south dakota see tremendous potential in this program and urged its inclusion in the farm bill
in fact had this provision not been in the bill i think that many of them would not have supported its passage
instead the large meat packers have rallied to kill this program because they do not want american consumers to discover how much of the meat in the grocery case is actually imported
and these packing interests have found strong and willing allies here in this body
two years ago in an appropriations bill congress voted to delay the implementation of this program until september 30 of next year
their allies in this chamber are at it again today seeking to delay implementation of this important program for yet another year
leadership in this body is breaking faith with rural america on a host of important issues
rural america is also under attack in the budget process
the 2007 budget which recently passed this body with only republican votes will cut 3 billion from farm safety net programs in the coming years
the president s budget was even worse seeking a cut of almost 6 billion in farm bill programs
because of this budget the farm income safety net conservation programs and food stamps are now facing huge cuts in the coming years
one of the hazards of being one of the lowest in seniority on this side of the aisle is that we run out of time so quickly
i want to thank the ranking member for the work he has done in the process
we are the 15th poorest district in america
we are working very hard to lift our communities in meaningful ways and it is difficult
the one area in which we are succeeding is in the area of making higher educational opportunities more available to minority and lowincome students
this program is serving 6 200 young people in my district a total of 17 projects
trio has a talent search program which serves young people in grades 6 through 12
in addition to counseling participants receive information about college admissions requirements scholarships and various student financial aid programs
over 387 000 americans are enrolled in 471 talent search programs
participants receive instruction in literature composition mathematics and science on college campuses after school on saturdays and during the summer
currently 770 programs are in operation throughout the country
the alternative congressional black caucus budget is a responsible document and i want to thank the gentleman from north carolina mr watt xz4004240 and the gentleman from virginia mr scott xz4003632 for the work that they have done in developing this great document
madam chairman i bring this amendment to the floor today on behalf of myself the gentleman from california mr baca xz4000090 the gentleman from texas mr reyes xz4003370 and the gentleman from georgia mr scott xz4003632 in order to provide much needed financial assistance to our nation s minority farmers and to the 1890 land grant colleges and universities
while i generally support this legislation it falls short in my estimation in the area of funding for rural development
during fiscal year 1983 president reagan initiated the small farmer outreach training and technical assistance program in response to the usda task force on black farm ownership
and i just must say that during the several years that i was embarking on my endeavor to return to this house i was constantly reminded by the people that i came into contact with in my district as to the spending spree they believe the congress has gone on and been involved in over the last number of years
the amount of discretionary spending that we have had in terms of its increase is remarkable
i wish they could go back 16 years from when i left this wonderful institution back in 1989 to show what we are talking about
this chart merely goes back to 1994 but it shows us spending 513 billion in 1994 and we are talking about now stretching our way to 900 billion
i was in my office watching some of this debate and i heard what appeared to me to be crocodile tears expressed by some on the other side about how much we are cutting
and i guess only in this institution is a little restraint in the amount that we are spending in addition to what we have spent in the past considered a cut
most american citizens most of the people in my district believe that if you spent too much maybe you ought to look on the side of spending restraint
the response we got in committee time and time again from the other side was why do we not just raise taxes
and i can not even calculate the increase in taxes they suggested to cover all the programs they want
as part of the requirements under the budget act the budget committee gives an opportunity for any member in the house to appear for 10 minutes to talk about any particular matter within the province of the budget committee
they even were effective in citing a quotation from the mayor of the town in which i was born someone whom i know
and in response to that i said i think it is a worthy program but could you please tell me if we do not cut this where we should find the money to fund it
but the job of the budget committee is to bring us i think some fiscal sanity by suggesting with some enforcement mechanisms numbers within which we will live which is no different than what we do in our daily lives and our family lives
and all i can say is having been gone from this place for 16 years the image that i obtained from people on the outside looking in is frankly not that we have been very restraining in terms of our spending
only in washington dc
and i would just ask if people could understand if other members could have the chance i had to leave this place for 16 years and come back and see the change people coming to us asking for spending no longer requesting it but coming with the expectation that it is an entitlement in the area of discretionary spending
this administration proposes to cut funding for agricultural programs in addition to denying promised benefits to veterans and military widows
we need to put our resources toward meeting the promises we have made to our veterans servicemen and their families in rural colorado that means making sure that veterans do nt have to drive five hours to get the health care they were promised
i will never support breaking the promise to the brave men and women who served our country in the name of freedom and democracy
this commonsense rule payasyougo is mandatory in colorado
in the 1990 s payasyougo brought the budget into surplus and is supported by federal reserve chairman alan greenspan
our plan also includes a provision for a rainy day fund in case there is a need for emergency spending
i will not vote for an increase in taxes
mr chairman i rise today to speak in favor of the cubinrahallcannonudall amendment
in 1976 congress passed the payment in lieu of taxes act in an effort to compensate counties for the loss of property tax revenue that comes with having large tracts of federal lands within their jurisdiction
in my district alone there are over 17 million acres of land eligible for pilt payments accounting for 11 million in fiscal year 2004
in the recent past congress has failed to fund pilt to its authorized level leaving local governments with the burden of answering painful budget decisions
in fy 2004 pilt was funded to only 67 percent of its authorized level falling over 100 million dollars short of what the bureau of land management found to be the authorized level
if adopted this congress will fund pilt to its highest level in a decade
this will help local governments by providing approximately 80 percent of the authorized level for pilt while still allowing the interior department to spend 10 million more for administrative costs than in fiscal year 2005
i can speak to this issue with a great deal of authority that very few of my colleagues in this body can as a member of the american legion a member of the 82nd airborne division association a member of the army ranger association and a member of the association of graduates of the united states military academy
being both a former enlisted solider and an officer who served here and abroad i am concerned that we keep our commitment to our veterans those who have laid their lives on the line and in many cases borne a great price to pay for the freedoms that we have here to have this dialogue
unfortunately there is a tremendous amount of misinformation that is going around the public right now i found this unfortunately being passed out to veterans in my own district that completely disregards the facts in favor of what i would consider a shameless play at political power
as a former numbers person i would like to point out that in the chart that we referenced that spending per veteran has increased dramatically
indeed total veterans spending in the 2006 budget is 689 billion
these increases in this budget carry on a commitment to our nation s veterans that over the past 11 years has been reflected in veterans spending since 1995 when republicans took control of congress
we can see that the rhetoric from the past is hollow from when there was a democratic majority in this body and also a democratic administration
what we have seen since republicans took control of the house is a steady increase particularly after president bush was elected in making sure that our veterans needs were cared for
i respect the leadership of our party the leadership in this congress who has led the way not with hollow words but with straightforward actions to take care of the veterans in this united states who i am proud to represent
since we took control of congress in 1995 we have made tremendous strides in improving benefits for our nation s 25 million veterans and we will continue to do that into the future with new strides in technology reaching out to cover those who have legitimate needs who have served our country and served in harm s way
moreover the republican congress has expanded eligibility for medical care in 1996 and 1999
in the end this budget provides significant relief for veterans who have served
i stand with our leadership i stand with the veterans in this congress who are rightfully supporting this budget
since this is a tight budget year and the dollars appropriated will not fully take care of the emergency situation of the spread of eab and the millions of ash trees in need of more attention from the ccc and omb
this is an emergency situation for our agriculture community and as with any invasive species we continue to run in to the obstacle of funding from omb
this amendment is meant to suggest in strong terms that it is congress s intent that the mechanism within this statute is to be used to meet the foreign pest emergency needs of indiana ohio virginia maryland amp michigan
i think it is a fiscally conservative sane budget and i think it is much needed here in washington dc
furthermore i would like to thank the gentleman from iowa mr nussle xz4002980 the chairman of the committee on the budget for putting forward a very strong fiscally conservative reasonable budget for the american people that is not just good for our priorities here in washington dc like funding national defense like funding homeland security but it is also a good way to rein in government spending and eliminate government programs that have gotten out of control and maybe are not responsive to individual taxpayers
so i compliment our chairman in that regard
this budget would further reduce spending would further rein in government growth and would take on the mandatory spending programs that are going to bankrupt our country
what the gentleman from texas does with this alternative budget is rein in government spending and mandatory programs further further reduce nondiscretionary spending while at the same time funding the president s budget when it comes to defense and homeland security two top priorities of this congress
so i think it is important that we keep all those notions in mind as we vote for this budget
we have so many needs in this country that we have to fund and so many priorities that we must fund
there is a 48 percent increase which totals 419 billion in defense spending and a net increase of 23 percent in nonmilitary appropriated accounts for homeland security including 325 billion for the department of homeland security
with veterans i have a chart here today discussing showing our increase in veterans programs and the spending we have increased in veterans programs
there is a rapid increase in veterans spending especially during this time of war
we are funding veterans programs appropriately in this congress
i think that is a move in the right direction
i think it is appropriate to notice the rapid rise in veterans spending
this budget although restraining nondefense nonhomeland security discretionary spending and taking on mandatory government programs and finding savings although slight we are finding savings in those programs that will enable us to keep continuing to cut taxes and enable us to avoid raising taxes at the same time
mr chairman i do want to respond to only the big dogs eat in this house
mr chairman reclaiming my time this is an interesting chart on the rapid increase in veterans spending per veteran
i think it is important to note what we are doing in health research as an american government and the american people need to know that we are fully funding these programs to look at innovative ways to solve pressing medical issues in our country
because of the tax cuts and because of the rebound in the economy we are reducing the deficit
we are taking on this and we are going to further cut taxes in order to keep spurring the economy
i do commend him for his hard work and efforts on behalf of his constituents which are my neighbors in north carolina
in the last few years we have seen numerous people falling off the tax rolls because of tax cuts
we have seen strong job growth new businesses being formed greater homeownership in america
across the board every group in america is increasing in homeownership
mr chairman i rise in opposition to the resolution under consideration
during committee on the budget consideration of this budget resolution i was proud to join my democratic colleagues in putting forward amendments aimed at refocusing our spending and investments on the priorities that matter to the everyday lives of all americans creating and keeping jobs supporting community development and providing for a safe and secure homeland
despite these dire warnings of security at our ports in particular this budget falls 47 billion short of what the coast guard estimates it would cost to secure our ports
despite the fact that we can not afford our first responders to be unprepared this resolution recommends a reduction of 560 million in first responder funding
mr chairman i look forward to having an opportunity to work with my colleagues from oregon and california in the near future in order to address the expansion of casino gambling to offreservation sites
in my pennsylvania district the delaware tribes of oklahoma have filed suit in order to acquire the right to establish a casino
their claim is based on a conveyance that allegedly occurred in 1737 before our nation s independence
these tribes who are based out of state are only interested in seeing working and senior pennsylvanians gamble away their hardearned dollars
i am concerned about this kind of reservation shopping and i look forward to working with my colleagues from california and oregon and michigan and elsewhere in order to limit these tribes ability to build new casinos on properties not contiguous to existing reservations or on those lands where ownership is based solely on a conveyance that predates the existence of our nation
mr chairman with all due respect to my good colleagues from montana and others who have spoken in favor of this i rise in opposition to it
if it were about food safety then the 52 percent of meat that americans consume would be involved in this labeling process and that is not the case
any meat consumed in retail food establishments is not affected by this labeling
we all have to look at the certified angus beef programs and idaho potatoes to understand that the free market can in fact devise labeling opportunities or labeling programs that do benefit consumers and allow consumers to make that choice
mr chairman i believe very strongly in balancing our budget and reducing the deficit but i think we need to set certain priorities that are important to our families
my hope is that we do this in a bipartisan approach that we develop a consensus and i do want to thank the gentleman from iowa and the committee for allowing us to put some committee report language dealing with education in the budget and with resultsoriented budgeting which i believe we need here at this house
nearly one in three of them are in education
it also eliminates certain programs such as the vocational education nearly 13 billion in cuts
again i believe in education
in my life education has been one of the most invaluable tools that has made it possible for me to open up doors move forward to attain higher goals and make my dreams a possibility
in fact i think we need to restore the funding to these vital education programs especially increasing the 100 maximum pell grant award
this budget proposal in my opinion does not make our families stronger
i urge our colleagues to vote in favor of strengthening and protecting our young children by protecting education
mr chairman again i hope we do this in a bipartisan approach and find a consensus
mr speaker it is sunday evening a time when those of us in the house of representatives are usually not in session
the situation that terri is in has been discussed here on this floor tonight already and you only have to turn on the news or pick up a newspaper to learn about it
she does need assistance in being fed but that is not unusual
i have a perfectly healthy 1yearold little boy and he needs assistance in being fed perhaps not through a feeding tube but nonetheless he needs help
usually congress writes laws with a broad brush but every once in a while an unusual situation will require special legislative action
with such evidence and her parents crying out in her defense how can we not intervene
as we stand here in washington terri is being starved to death
last week this body passed legislation that would protect all americans in cases similar to this one but senate democrats stood in the way of that valuable measure
now for nearly sixty hours terri has been denied sustenance while republican leadership in both houses have negotiated the legislation before us today
though i regret that certain members of this body and the senate stood in the way of passing the legislation
under this legislation terri s case will be reassessed in a federal court and we expect that she will be fed once again
it is my hope that the federal court will handle this case better than the egregious dereliction of judicial duty exhibited in the florida court
mr speaker on this sunday i have looked into my heart and listened to my god in prayer and spoken to my pastor and other parishioners in church
my decision this evening is an intensely personal one in terms of life
as a father husband grandfather and son in law i have searched my soul about what the family must be going through
as a member of congress i know it is in our hands to offer what is the ultimate hope for this young woman
some of us have spoken on both sides of the aisle of holding our loved one in our hands as they died having made the decision not to have heroic measures
for 23 years before working in this body i served as a clinical neuropsychologist
i have been with many patients in persistent vegetative state
and people on both sides are pro life in the richness and complexity and difficulty of it
but let no one who leaves this body somehow imply that whichever the vote is taken one side or the other does not respect life in its richness
many across america have voiced support in an effort to keep terri schiavo alive
while in the hospital tubes were inserted in her digestive system to provide nutrition and hydration
terri schiavo is currently not terminally ill or in the process of dying
the 14th amendment states no state shall deprive any person of life liberty or property without due process of law in this special circumstance we were left with a last legal recourse to help save her life by providing her with the opportunity to have her case heard before a federal court
judge greer of the pinellaspasco circuit court stated i see no cogent reason why the committee should be able to intervene into a case involving the decision of whether or not to remain on life support he added i do nt think that legislative agencies or bodies have business in court proceedings i respectfully disagree
i fear sometimes that in our effort to try to come to some sort of conclusion that we actually overthink an issue once in a while
we think just enough to get in the way of our common sense
and in his very final days he too needed to be fed by a tube
but in the 56 years of life i have been granted mr speaker i shared the most intimate the most profound moment i ever had with my father about 36 hours before he passed away after he could no longer speak after he could no longer feed himself or care for himself in almost any manner at all
he communicated with his eyes and he communicated with a hand on my forehead in the most profound way imaginable
mr speaker we all know that there are deep emotions that are involved in this debate tonight
but mr speaker we this congress we are not here simply because we believe in our hearts that a great mistake is about to be made
the hard work of the gentleman from wisconsin mr sensenbrenner xz4003650 over the last few days of the gentleman from texas mr delay xz4001040 majority leader the work of the gentleman from maryland mr hoyer xz4001890 who may not be on the same side as i am when we take the vote tonight but who has certainly worked hard to see what we could do to make this work in the best possible way for the members who were called back
terri schiavo is in a terrible situation tonight
she has been in a terrible situation for a long time a situation none of us would want to be in a situation we would not want our loved ones in a situation we would not have to decide about but when this happens we do have to decide
when one is my age they probably should have written that down and sometime in the next few days i am going to check to see what i wrote 10 years ago and if i still agree with what i wrote 10 years ago as i suspect many of us will
and what this legislation would do is let a judge come in and look at all the facts one more time and determine if what is happening should continue to happen
i know others have said there is no real difference in just giving someone food and water and putting someone on incredible life support systems
we will see if a judge sees a difference if in fact we are able to give a judge that opportunity
we are asking a judge to come in and decide what a family among themselves could not decide
but nobody has talked about family members getting together and fighting over that decision and what they would want to happen if that fight happened in their family
mr speaker on december 3 1963 theresa marie schindler was born in pennsylvania
throughout this painful and difficult time these same family members acknowledged that terri was in an irreversible persistent vegetative state
today i burned up the phone calling health care professionals that i know back in florida
almost everybody in the health care profession that i spoke to are avid prolife people but they know the sad facts
their comments were almost to a person something to the effect of 15 years of being in a persistent vegetative state is far too long to suffer
we should not be engaged in second guessing many neurologists and onsite health care profession always who have seen the patient performed tests and attested to the courts that terri is not going to recover
my daughter who was born 5 days after terri schiavo is a health care professional who when i asked if she would want me to battle to keep a feeding tube in if she had not signed a living will said to me and i want the members to bear in mind that she is a health care professional who deals day in and day out with patients with feeding tubes but the difference is that they are not in a vegetative state her response to me was sufficient to help me make up my mind
that has always been the way it has been in this country and that is the way it should be
mr speaker i rise in opposition to the legislation
america has seen the anguish in the faces of ms schiavo s family members
the legislation we are considering will determine whether we will send to federal court one case that has been adjudicated in florida s state courts for nearly a decade
this bill stands in stark contrast to the principles of federalism and it is the wrong direction for this congress to take
it is for that reason that congress passed in 1990 the patient selfdetermination act as part of obra 90 which requires all hospitals long term care facilities home health agencies hospice programs and hmos that receive medicare and medicaid dollars to recognize a patient s living will and power of attorney for health care as advance directives
health care organizations must provide patients with written information about establishing an advance directive and document if the patient has an advance directive that is placed in the patient s medical record
patients are then able to decide in advance what medical treatment they want to receive if they become physically or mentally unable to communicate their wishes
my colleague in the senate bill nelson has introduced legislation that would improve compliance with the 1990 legislation and provide a benefit under medicare for endoflife consultation
if we enact this bill it could very well result in an avalanche of cases in federal court
according to medical experts as many as 35 000 americans nearly onethird of them children are in a condition similar to that of terri schiavo
yet we are going to make one single case in florida get all the medicare they want
mr speaker when i came here tonight i had no intention to speak on this issue for frankly the most personal of reasons a year ago my brother and i were involved in making precisely this same kind of decision where my mother was concerned
we had been empowered by her to make that decision we were in agreement on the decision and the medical professionals and her minister agreed with us about that decision
so we got to make that decision in the privacy and with the dignity that one would want for every family in that situation
but while we discuss them a life is in the balance and that is really the only immediate and compelling issue before us tonight
we should make sure that terri schiavo has her day in federal court
mr speaker if we pass this bill we will be intruding in the most sensitive possible family decision at the most illopportune time
by passing legislation which takes sides in an ongoing legal dispute we will be casting aside the principle of the separation of powers
the concept of a jeffersonian democracy as envisioned by the founders and the states as laboratories of democracy as articulated by justice brandeis will lie in tatters
by passing this legislation in a complete absence of hearings committee markups no amendments in complete violation of what we once called regular order we will send a signal that the usual rules of conduct and procedure no longer apply when they are inconvenient to the majority party
but if this legislation was only about principle why would the majority party be distributing talking points in the other body declaring that this is a great political issue and that by passing this bill the prolife base will be excited
if the president of the united states really cared about the issue of the removal of feeding tubes then why did he sign a bill as governor in texas that allows hospitals to save money by removing feeding tubes over a family s objection
when all is said and done this bill is about taking sides in a legal dispute which we should not be doing
today we are sending a case from state courts to the federal courts even though it is already the most extensively litigated righttodie case in the history of the united states
multiple courts have had an opportunity to rule in terri s case including the united states supreme court federal district courts and the florida supreme court
as justice scalia has said himself in endoflife cases like this the federal courts have no business in this field
if we do not draw a line in the sand tonight what limit is there to the democratic principles that this congress is prepared to violate
we are also deeply saddened because we have been in the middle of this saga for quite some time and it is very important you know this is just the latest chapter
in 2003 unhappy with the decisions of the court the governor and the state legislature in florida attempted to change the rules that controlled terri s wishes and to pass what was referred to as terri s law giving governor bush the authority to reinsert the feeding tube
one of the top republicans in the florida house said the legislature should stay out of family court issues the state legislation that failed in the state senate died when some of the leading republican senators said we can not and should not sacrifice our oaths as political officers on the altar of political convenience these were state legislators recognizing the limits of their power
here tonight in the united states congress will we recognize the appropriate limits of our power
leading the charge in this debate are several physicians who are members of congress
let us keep in mind neither this house nor senate has had a single hearing has heard from a single witness has provided any meaningful opportunity for the public to participate in this very important debate
they had that right in state court
they had that right in federal court
they had that right in the united states supreme court which turned down the appeal
it simply creates a new judge in an attempt to achieve a different result or to delay a different decision
one of the chief senate sponsors of the bill said earlier today that the purpose and the effect of the bill in his judgment was to cause the federal judge who will hear this case to reinsert the tube
if this were their family if they some day and i hope they do not and i hope i do not find themselves in this tragic situation one of the most tragic we will ever experience in our lives and they and their wife had come to a conclusion about what they want as a couple or individually as to how they end their life how would they feel if elected officials they had never met who did not know them thought their judgment was superior to theirs
mr speaker i rise this evening in support of s 686
this legislation would allow either of terri s parents to bring suit in federal court for the violation of any right under the constitution or laws of the united states relating to the withholding or withdrawal of food fluids or medical treatment necessary to sustain ms schiavo s life
without due process of law in this case i believe it is entirely appropriate that we err on the side of caution all we re doing is seeking a federal review of what has happened in the state courts to ensure that all constitutional rights all of the basic protections that we afford a criminal have been afforded to terri schiavo as well
in these cases the only thing we can do is follow the law and the law provides for the opportunity for federal review in cases where a person will be put to death
i am aware of the cases in florida state courts and the findings they have reached both in terms of what they believe ms schiavo would have chosen and the likelihood that new treatments could improve her condition
but in this instance i believe we should be as thorough as possible which is why i support this legislation
mr speaker i ask unanimous consent that upon entry of this order the speaker may decline to entertain a motion to adjourn until after disposition of the motion to suspend the rules described in this order that it be in order at any time on sunday march 20 2005 for the speaker to entertain a motion that the house suspend the rules with respect to s 686 and that such motion be debatable for 3 hours equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the committee on the judiciary or their designees
to answer your question our intentions are to come in at 9 oclock
certainly we would not do anything without the distinguished whip s concurrence and okay in consultation with him and we will keep the whip advised if there is any unlikely reason for us to come back earlier than 9 oclock
i want to thank everybody that has worked on this bill particularly those in the senate the democrats in the senate the republicans in the senate
i want to thank the democrats in this house that worked on this bill the republicans that worked on this bill
mr speaker after 4 days of words the best of them uttered in prayer now comes the time for action
a young woman in florida is being dehydrated and starved to death
i welcome this opportunity to join my colleagues in this effort to help defend and protect innocent human life
well perhaps in the technical and irrelevant terms of the house calendar it is not a private bill
it is in fact a very private bill
and in an admission that it is not a very good idea a provision of this bill really quite unusual says by the way we hope no one will pay attention to this in the future
in legal language that is this is not to be precedent setting
what was the fee in the legal case
nobody in here knows
nobody in here has any way of knowing
there are people who believe in what is described as pro life that nothing that terminates a life is ever justified
in fact people have said well if she had said so but many of those who hold that do not think you have a right to say that
judges have done that lawyers have done that in adversarial proceedings they have done that
people did not like the way they voted 4 years ago but what does that have to do with whether or not the husband s wishes and wife s wishes are carried out in this case
what happened has been that this has been very well litigated in florida litigated on a number of occasions with lawyers on all sides
in lawyers terms we can vacate a judgment and then remand it
we dislike what the courts in florida have done so we cancel their decision and we send it elsewhere
if in fact without this bill no new rights have been created why could they not have gone to court without us
but i would not try to defend my judgment in this case
i am proud to be a politician but i think we would all agree that you should not make this kind of a decision this kind of a decision about life in these terribly emotional circumstances
if you do not want a decision to be made politically why in the world do you ask 535 politicians to make it
despite your argument that this is not setting a precedent every aggrieved party in any similar litigation can now come to congress and ask us to make a series of decisions
to allow ideology to triumph in that context is a shame
the gentleman from wisconsin in an effort to find an inconsistency quoted me as being for habeas corpus so people can have their day in court
i do not ever remember supporting a bill in congress where we decided person by person who got the right of habeas corpus and who did not
yes i believe a general right to go to court when you have claimed there has been an error in your criminal procedure makes sense but we are not talking about that here
so if the question is would i be in favor of this house deciding who got the right to bring habeas petitions mr speaker i yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from oregon mr wu xz4004370
none of us are in a position to know what her medical condition is
there are procedures in the state of florida which have been gone through exhaustively to determine that
he has said in strong criticism of the entire judicial system of the state of florida that they did not give her a fair chance that the entire judicial system all of those appeals all of those trials all of that litigation that that did not give her a fair chance and we will now vacate the judgment of florida
if in fact it is to be the rule that people should have this appeal why do you limit it to only one individual
clearly this is an individualized response to a controversy that attracted attention and if you believed in the principle you would have made it uniform
none of the other cases he mentioned are in federal courts because a particular bill was passed in a particular situation to send them there based on a review of those facts
we just heard what would have made an excellent summary in the legal case in this matter but not a legislative argument
he has just cited the inadequacy of habeas corpus in this case
in other words he has acknowledged that this is an inappropriate bill and that is all we have said
mr speaker perhaps it is important for those of us in this chamber to first remind ourselves again of why we are really all here
the phrase in the 14th amendment capsulizes our entire constitution
hubert humphrey once said that a society is measured by how it treats those in the dawn of life those in the shadows of life and those in the twilight of life
it is true that terri schiavo lives among us in the shadows of life
mr speaker she reminds me so much of another woman whose name i will not mention who was in much the same circumstance as terri and a young nurse insisted every morning on singing to this patient
mr speaker in response to the remarks a few minutes ago from the gentleman from massachusetts i want to say that i am not sure whether or not i am on cspan but i am absolutely sure that i am not playing doctor for indeed i am one
as my colleagues know we are here today in an attempt to safe the life of terry schiavo
she is not however in a coma
mr speaker listen to the words spoken just one year ago by pope john paul ii to the international congress of catholic physicians on lifesustaining treatments and the vegetative state a man even if seriously ill or disabled in the exercise of his highest functions is and always will be a man and he will never become a vegetable or a man animal
even our brothers and sisters who find themselves in the clinical condition of a vegetative state retain their human dignity in all its fullness
the loving gaze of god the father continues to fall upon them acknowledging them as his sons and daughters especially in need of help the tragedy of this situation is that with proper treatment now denied terri s condition can improve
terri has been incapable of making relevant decisions particularly concerning her medical care since she collapsed due to a potassium imbalance in 1990 at age 27 just a few years after her marriage to michael schiavo
the governor of florida her state of residence and many in the state legislature want her to live however the florida court system has ruled the husband s guardian rights should prevail
it is important to note that terri never had the opportunity to plead her own case in court and she never executed an advanced directive or living will in writing
although i am not a neurologist by specialty my basic courses in medical school taught me that dehydration is a horrific process
it is a process that only the cruelest tyrants in history have used to cleanse populations
in our nation of checks and balances i believe it is time for congress to check the florida court s decision and pass this life saving measure
starving for the truth when mary jane owen thinks of terri schiavo she remembers a day in 1986 and the hospital in washington
it s a great way to die without enough breath to shriek owen in her early 60s at the time had to speak clearly enough to let this doctor know he was fired
owen who took antibiotics was later cured of her blindness and currently works as a disabled rights advocate in washington dc was nt in the mood to chumbuddy with death
possibly because she arrived in a wheelchair doctors assumed she d prefer to leave on a gurney
described alternately as in a persistent vegetative state and a lockedin condition schiavo who has lived with brain damage since 1990 either does or does not understand what is going on around her
her husband michael says she is an empty vessel who would not have wanted to remain present in body only
that is to say terri schiavo s parents think she can be fed by mouth and the judge in the case declines to find out if this is so
the facts are these terri schiavo collapsed in 1990
she has been in hospitals and nursing homes since then
one nurse carla sauer iyer said terri spoke on a regular basis saying such things as mommy and help me iyer said that when she put a washcloth in terri s hands to keep her fingers from curling together michael saw it and made me take it out saying that was therapy michael schiavo s reticence could well have been an unwillingness to open himself to the cruelties of false hope
the underlying argument for protecting terri schiavo is predicated on the idea that life at its core is sacrosanct something with which we interfere at peril to our own places in the universal order
they are in this because of their politics which appears to be indistinguishable from their theology which appears to be selfpromotional
she falls nowhere into the realm of what medical ethicist james j hughes described as socially dead most of the people in the disability community certainly are not prolife in the classical meaning of that but we sure as hell are against killing people with disabilities owen said
terri was certainly i think rehabilitatable in the early months and years of her travail
its purpose is simple to allow the federal courts to review this matter in the light of terri s constitutional rights
it takes her case out of the florida court system and puts it in the hands of the federal court
oddly enough on this very day last year the pope addressed a group of participants in an international congress on lifesustaining treatments
and i quote a man even if seriously ill or disabled in the exercise of his highest functions is and always will be a man and he will never become a vegetable or an animal i urge every member of this people s house to carry these words in their hearts as we vote
it is our turn to fulfill the promises etched in the declaration of independence to make life more perfect for the pursuit of life
today both the legislative and executive branches of the united states government are acting in concert to defend the life of one such human being terri schiavo
president abraham lincoln said i have been driven many times upon my knees by the overwhelming conviction that i had nowhere else to go this week millions of americans many of my colleagues and i found ourselves in a similar position
through this action congress is not only saving the life of terri shiavo we are making a statement about the country we live in and the culture of life which we seek
today every day in every county in america families doctors hospital chaplains are making lifeanddeath decisions tough decisions and tender decisions
for 215 years it has been a solid principle of this country that congress is not involved in issues like this
today in church at palm sunday services i read the bulletin and as is the usual practice there was a list of the sick and hospitalized the homebound
there are some family tragedies in that list and some tragedies yet to come
but the wisdom of the founders of this government in not putting these decisions in the congress is that they understood that most of the time we would make the wrong decisions
we appreciate the fact that this provides for sufficient time in debate for the issues to be raised and addressed by the house of representatives
my second question which you have anticipated is that in fact members can expect at 12 midnight at the conclusion of the 3 hours of debate between 9 pm
so i appreciate the gentleman s comment and my expectation then is that we will go back in at 9 mr speaker i withdraw my reservation of objection under those representations
it has been in many ways a real debate with each member rising and understanding the seriousness of the issues which we consider
the gentlewoman from ohio correctly stated that terri is loved by her husband by her parents by her brother by others in her family
those of us who have been in that place know how difficult it is
i had not expected as my colleagues had not expected to be back in this house to consider this legislation
but when we disagree with the courts we have had legislation on this floor in recent months to take from them jurisdiction
we now have troops arrayed in iraq to support that principle of the individual of freedom and of law
so i believe tonight mr speaker that every member will vote on behalf of terri schiavo tonight but they will see their responsibility in that act differently
so mr speaker i did as i said what i suppose many have done i went to the proceedings that have occurred in the terri schiavo case caused by the absence of a written directive
then she spoke of her own daughter and such a condition and the discussion she had with her daughter and i hope many of you heard her say this that her daughter said to her that if she was in that state she would not want to be left in that state by her mother and she said no mom if you really loved me you would let me go to my rest and be with god if i thought the florida courts had dealt with this in a superficial and uncareful way perhaps perhaps i would feel that we ought to interpose our view
but no fair reading of the court s decision at the lower court no fair reading of the disposition by the district court of the united states in which they said in quoting judge altobrand of the supreme court of florida not only has mrs schiavo s case been given due process but few if any similar cases have ever been afforded this heightened level of process this report is approximately 50 pages long that was issued by mr wolfson
this case tragically is not alone in the circumstances that have occurred
throughout this painful and difficult trial mr wolfson went on the family acknowledged that teresa was in a diagnosed persistent vegetative state
the court however in an evidentiary hearing and after due consideration said clear and convincing evidence at the time of trial supported a determination that mrs schiavo would have chosen in february 2000 to withdraw the lifeprolonging procedures so that it has been concluded by all of the fact finders in the court systems of the united states in the state of florida under the statutes as the chairman has pointed out established by the state of florida to deal with this extraordinarily difficult human issue because like birth death will come to us all
to some of us it will come in a way that will not raise such wrenching questions but some few of us will individually and with our families have to face this decision and properly the system should be followed to protect us so that neither a husband nor a mother nor a father nor anybody else can make that decision in a manner that is not fair that does not have due process and does not protect us as individuals
in reading the record mr speaker i have concluded that the state of florida in its wisdom provided for that process and accomplished that end
i want to speak from love and compassion not just the law and embrace the strongest profamily position as we move in this debate
this decision on terri does not belong in this congress
in fact it does not even belong in the courts
i believe terri schiavo s case must be judged in that context
terri s life has value and worth and we must do everything we can to protect her rights and those of other disabled people here in america
the law ought not to provide should not provide more protection for murderers guilty of terrible crimes than for an innocent woman lying in a florida hospital bed
americans believe in a culture of life not a culture that tells the weak and vulnerable there is no place for them at the table
i especially thank the chairman for his leadership on bringing this legislation to the floor in the condition that it is in and i would like to compliment all the leadership in the house and on the senate on both sides of the aisle that have worked so hard and so diligently throughout this weekend and given up their palm sunday weekend to serve a very important citizen of this country and someone whom we have an obligation to protect the constitutional rights of terri schiavo
she has a right to her day in court
we look at the circumstances that took place in the florida courts and the continual appeals that we went back through and the relentless efforts to end her life by her guardian her estranged husband who may have a conflict of interest
and as i added up these dollars the settlement for medical malpractice 250 000 preliminarily and the court then ruled another 14 million to terri schiavo and 600 000 awarded to michael schiavo that is 2 225 000 awarded in her behalf
she only had a cat scan back in the early 90s
and when they sent her to the hospice 5 years ago a place where a person is sent to die 5 years she has been there mr speaker and 5 years she has been denied sunshine denied even the ability to be rolled out into the sunshine in her wheelchair
i wanted the opportunity to address the issue of the funding that has gone in on behalf of terri schiavo and the report that i have put together i could easily add several hundred thousand dollars to that that have gone towards attorneys and towards the interests of michael schiavo as opposed to the interests of terri schiavo
and by the way i happen to have another piece of information that flowed to me today a gao audit looked in on that and that organization paid 148 million back in medicaid fees that were inappropriately collected
another question we have is we do not know whether there is a life insurance policy that would name someone as beneficiary in the event of the death of terri schiavo
i have put together the full list of the judges that have heard the case of terri schiavo in the history of this and throughout all of that i can identify judge greer and i can identify a threejudge panel that heard her case en banc and i can identify the supreme court of the state of florida which we saw perform a number of times in the year 2000 and also the united states supreme court which simply refused or denied cert on the subpoenas last week
so if we are going to count judges sitting en banc and if we are going to count supreme courts in totals of 7 and 9 that narrows it down pretty much to one judge that has seen and reviewed all this case and that is judge greer
and i believe that terri schiavo deserves her day in court
terri is not a pvs someone in a permanent vegetative state
she is not in the process of dying
she is not in a coma
even though her husband has now stated that she would have wanted to die he withheld this information for 9 years and never came forth with it until the state law in florida said they would now allow hearsay evidence for living wills
after the heart attack and chemical reaction in 1990 she was taking therapy
and in fact she was able to speak and communicate to some degree until 1993 when he discontinued the therapy
mr speaker 15 years ago or so i worked with colleagues in the senate on the difficult issues relating to the wishes of people who were going to receive medical care if they were incapacitated
in a word what you are doing is allowing the rule of law of this country to be twisted in the winds
where is the respect for individual responsibility that is waved like a banner in this chamber
if we really believe in those values we will stay out of terri schiavo s life today and let the decision of her husband and the ruling of the federal court stand
this is a step in where we have no business
it is pandering for political gain with the next election in mind
in a democracy sometimes we disagree with individual decisions
but if we truly believe in individual freedom and the right to privacy then we must get out of the way and let people be free
mr speaker is it possible for us to let this young woman take her leave in peace
the evidence for that begins in the way this was brought to this body being brought in on st
you do not get any well this is going to happen in a month why do nt you get ready for it
that is the way it is in america
that is why we do not have terri s words in a will
we said to him dad what do you want us to do in terms of extending your life
and so there were two brothers a sister and me and my mother and we had to stand around and decide whether or not we were going to put in a stomach tube a feeding tube
you are throwing all that up in the air and leaving families and doctors with nowhere to go because this is not setting precedent this is something to hide something else some diversion of what is going on in this house
while i continue to support the right of individuals through living wills and families when no living will exists to make such difficult decisions this case is unusual in two ways
first while most families are united in these judgments this family is clearly divided
it merely allows terri schiavo s family the right to have their case heard in federal court a right routinely accorded to death row inmates
the bill that we are going to pass is going to give her due process before she is sentenced to die in this painful manner
convicted serial killers and other death row inmates are afforded federal review in their cases
there is going to be hollow rhetoric in this chamber tonight about the need for investigations and about reviewing facts before acting and about attempts to politicize religious beliefs
judge greer s friday order expressly disregards that authority and he should be held in contempt of this body
we have a woman who has nt had food or drink in over two days
we made efforts in the ordinary course of legislative business to afford terri schiavo her constitutional rights and they were rejected
now we are left with no choice but to implement extraordinary means in the middle of the night
mr speaker the most traumatic moment of my life was when my mother died in my arms
she had chosen not to be dependent on a respirator in a hospital but to die at home with her family
these circumstances or some variant of them occur eventually within every family and whether the federal government has the right to intervene in those private tragedies is the issue before us tonight
but 10 courts have heard from all sides from every relevant witness and all of them 19 judges many of them conservative republicans all have reached the same conclusion that in fact terri schiavo s husband s wishes are consistent with his wife s that the feeding tube should be removed
i have never met certainly not examined ms schiavo but nor have any of the socalled medical experts in this body that have testified on the basis of edited videotapes ever examined her either
but every qualified doctor who has examined her has reached the same conclusion she is in a perpetual vegetative state she has no cerebral cortex
and is not one of the very first principles of politics is that we should not use individual human tragedies people suffering in anguish political pawns to appease the interest groups that keep us in power
mr speaker the night that this was brought up last week we also voted on a budget resolution and we decided to cut tens of billions of dollars out of the program that enables the poorest and the sickest and the most dependent among us throughout this country to be able to live in a dignified safe and sanitary nursing home
but we have no legislative constitutional authority to intervene in these very personal family matters and most importantly we have no moral right to be doing this tonight
mr speaker there are doctors in this chamber there are lawyers in this chamber there are judges in this chamber
tonight in this gallery my daughter sits
i think of the milestones in their lives and the love that i have for them
my heart is raw when i hear the things about terri schiavo and her mother and her father and her siblings because i just lost my brother in november
i think of how my life changed in an instant and all the lives of those who cared for him
what we do in this chamber tonight is as important as anything we have done in defending our nation in doing the things that we do as members of congress
this bill would place a federal judge in the middle of this case after the state courts have adjudicated it after doctors and family members and counsel and clergy and the courts in florida have struggled with it for years
my colleagues wish to put one of those unelected federal judges they always denounce right in the middle of this and say the trial starts de novo
the florida people are not to be trusted in electing their judges and their legislators
instead we are going to put this case and only this case in the federal courts from the very beginning and we instruct the federal courts to ignore the evidence in the florida courts to ignore the procedures in the florida courts to ignore the testimony in the florida courts and to start all over because we have contempt because we do not like the judgments of the florida courts
we have never ever done such a thing in the history of this country and we should not start now
it is a bill of attainder in effect
mr speaker it is an uncontradicted fact uncontradicted except for the speculations of some orators in this chamber that terri schiavo told her husband told her sisterinlaw told her brotherinlaw told various of her friends when attending funerals of close family members who had been on life support that she would not want to live like that the florida court found that to be the case to be the fact
the guardian ad litem appointed by the court in his report to the court found that
george will a noted conservative comentator and philosopher conservative enough so that he famously helped coach ronald reagan for his debates in the presidential debates in 1980 said on television this morning and i quote unless we are prepared to overturn centuries of common law and more than two centuries of constitutional law that says that husband and wife are one therefore clearly this is a decision to be made by the husband now this is not just a decision made by the husband
and who are we to say this is any different from the thousands of cases of donotresuscitate orders that are given effect in our courts and in our hospitals every day other than the fact that this case has gotten a lot of publicity and a lot of public official intervention
and the federal court said not only has ms schiavo s case been given due process in state court but few if any similar cases have ever been afforded this heightened level of process the difference in this bill is not that it is a review of state court but it orders a de novo proceeding to ignore everything that happened in state court as if the state courts did not exist
mr speaker in america we do not let people starve an animal to death
her estranged husband has not allowed her any therapy or treatments or rehabilitation in more than a decade since he won the malpractice award even though many doctors believe that they would help her condition
in fact she was speaking some words before her treatment stopped
but her family is not even allowed to help her because of a judge s ruling a judge who in 5 years has not even bothered to visit her once to see for himself that terri is not comatose that she is not unconscious that she is not in a vegetative state
mr speaker tonight i stand with terri s father a man who raised up his little girl and gave his daughter s hand in marriage with the understanding that she would be protected in sickness and in health for better or for worse with terri s mother who brought her into this world and gave her life and to unite myself with terri s brother who continues to struggle for his sister
be merciful and find true bravery and justice in preserving the life of terri schiavo
i believe it is extremely important that congress step in to protect the life of terri before it is too late
in looking at the evidence in this case i believe the courts have acted irresponsibly
in fact noble prize nominee dr
in fact he said there are many approaches that would help terri
the majority in congress apparently has already decided the proper outcome of the case a decision different from the next of kin and state court judges who have heard evidence from both sides
present law has a process to ascertain whether or not a patient is in a persistent vegetative state and it should not matter what politicians think
present law also places the decisions in the hands of the next of kin the husband
a few years ago a child custody case in the washington dc
area was decided by special legislative language in a transportation appropriations bill
the house passed legislation to fix a result in firearms liability legislation so that the national rifle association got to try the issue in the legislative branch after they had made contributions to legislators who will decide the result rather than being relegated to the impartial judge and jury where ordinary citizens have to try their cases
mr speaker we should honor the rule of law and apply that law in all cases
if congress wants to establish a federal right of review in cases like this a new rule of law so be it but that law should apply to all whether or not they have a member of congress to introduce a special bill
mr speaker i rise in support of s 686 for the relief of the parents of theresa marie schiavo
on march 16 the house passed legislation to avert the tragedy now unfolding in florida
mr speaker while our federalist structure reserves broad authority to the states america s federal courts have played a historic role in defending the constitutional rights of all americans including the disadvantaged disabled and dispossessed
furthermore senate 686 makes it clear that nothing in this act shall be construed to create substantive rights not otherwise secured by the constitution and laws of the united states or of several states in addition the legislation does not reopen or direct the reopening of a final judgment it merely ensures that opportunity for the review of any violation of terri schiavo s federal and constitutional rights in a federal court
as the supreme court held in plaut v spendthrift farms while legislatures usually act through laws of general applicability that is by no means their only legitimate mode of action finally s 686 presents no problems regarding retrospective application
as the supreme court held in landgraf v usi film products a statute does not operate retrospectively merely because it is applied in a case arising from conduct antedating the statute s enactment rather the court must ask whether the new provision attaches new legal consequences to events completed before its enactment
mr speaker the measure of a nation s commitment to the sanctity of life is reflected in its laws to the extent those laws honor and defend its most vulnerable citizens
in our deeds and in our public actions we must build a culture of life that welcomes and defends all human life
the battle to defend the preciousness of every life in a culture that respects and defends life is not only terri s fight but it is america s fight
i commend the other body for passing this legislation without objection and urge my colleagues across the aisle to join us in this fight by passing s 686 to affirm the sanctity of life and to permit terri to continue hers
mr speaker i include for the record a supplemental legislative history on this bill and a letter addressed to me dated today from professor robert a destro who is the attorney for robert and mary schindler who is next friend of their daughter theresa marie schindler schiavo and is a professor of law at the columbus school of law in the catholic university of america
chairman you have asked me to comment on the proposed bill for the relief of the parents of theresa marie schiavo to be brought up in the house today which is the same bill the senate passed earlier today in my capacity as cocounsel in the federal litigation filed by robert and mary schindler on behalf of their daughter theresa marie schiavo
on behalf of the legal team and the family we thank you and your colleagues in both the house and the senate for your efforts and those of your respective staffs on behalf of terri schiavo
the first is that the situation in which the members of terri schiavo s family find themselves is a human tragedy with realtime life and death consequences
terri s parents robert and mary schindler allege that neither they nor their daughter got a fair trial in the florida courts
terri schiavo is the first incapacitated person in the history of the state of florida to have been involved in a substituted judgment proceeding where there is a significant difference of opinion over both the nature of her condition ie
is terri actually in a persistent vegetative state pvs
not only does terri s life hang in the balance so too does the nation s understanding of how a society committed to both individual rights and the rule of law should determine the wishes of persons with severe brain injuries
the florida courts spent many years trying to figure out what to do in such a case
terri s parents have alleged that the law created by florida courts in terri s case violated both terri s rights and theirs because 1
the result was a situation in which terri herself had no assistance of counsel in a case in which her life hangs in the balance
after terri s case the only persons in the state of florida who are not entitled to an independent judiciary and effective representation are incapacitated persons who can not speak for themselves
the state court order for under which terri s nutrition and hydration is currently being withheld was entered after a proceeding tainted by structural defects that call the integrity of the entire fact finding process in to question
the state court order violates the standards set out in both federal and state precedents that recognize the right to selfdetermination in healthcare decisionmaking
both of those cases recognize that accuracy not finality is essential in any case where a guardian has asked for a judicial decree authorizing the death of the a person with a severe disability such as terri s
review of terri s federal claims by a federal court is an essential step in protecting her right to privacy
we have argued in federal court that terri s federal rights were violated by the state courts and that her continued custody in the guardianship violates her constitutional rights
generally speaking such reviews can take place in only two ways 1 direct review by the supreme court of the united states by petition for certiorari or 2 a federal writ of habeas corpus
getting the courts to understand that people in terri s situation are also entitled to habeas relief is both difficult and time consuming
on friday march 18 2005 the united states district court for the middle district of florida dismissed mr and mrs schindler s attempt to get a fair trial for terri because judge moody believed a that terri is not a person in custody entitled to habeas relief b that mr and mrs schindler do not have standing to argue that terri did not get a fair trial and c that the federal courts are duty bound to respect the findings of the florida courts concerning her wishes
this provision also resolves any problems that i may have had with prior drafts of the legislation proposed in the senate
section 2 resolves any questions concerning the right of terri s parents to argue in court on terri s behalf
section 3 allows the court to grant an injunction against further interference with terri s rights should we prevail in our claim that she did not get a fair trial
i raised questions concerning the federal court s unwillingness to undertake a review of state court proceedings not only because of the respect that federal courts owe the florida courts but also because two cases urge caution in framing private legislation
the changes congress proposes to make in the house bill to be brought up in the house today provide an even more effective means that attempted by governor bush and the florida legislature in terri s law laws of florida chapter 2003418
governor bush has conceded that terri did not get a fair trial and urged the supreme court of the united states to review the proceedings in the florida courts
rather it simply allows a de nove review of alleged violation s of any right of theresa marie schiavo under the constitution of laws of the united states in federal court
further s 686 makes clear that nothing in this act shall be construed to create substantive rights not otherwise secured by the constitution and laws of the united states or of the several states consequently s 686 does not reopen or direct the reopening of final judgments in a whole class of cases or in a particular suit plaut v spendthrift farm inc 514 us 211 227 1995
doing so for theresa marie schiavo is proper as the supreme court in plaut made clear that the premise that there is something wrong with particularized legislative action is of course questionable
the supreme court has held that a statute does not operate retrospectively merely because it is applied in a case arising from conduct antedating the statute s enactment or upsets expectations based in prior law
present law normally governs in such situations because jurisdictional mr speaker i reserve the balance of my time
now if we accepted the position that has been made by the opponents of this legislation we would not have had a civil rights revolution in this country if rural courts in the south decided federal questions that were opposed by those who were petitioning to have their civil rights protected
mr speaker in 1995 my friend from massachusetts said in a habeas corpus bill i want judicial review in a reasonable way
i want people who may have had their rights interfered with to be able to sue in reasonable fora that is what this bill does
it does not make a final decision on the issues that are being decided in florida
at 151 lt em gt lt em gt congressional record page h1599 the gentleman from new york mr nadler xz4002890 said if a person thinks a court in a state is depriving someone of civil rights they can go into federal court and at volume 150 lt em gt lt em gt congressional record at page h6580 the gentleman from new york noted that without federal courts obviously the progress we have witnessed in the area of civil rights would have been at the very least stymied and most likely prevented altogether now all this bill does is to allow the parents of terri schiavo to go into federal court to adjudicate her federal constitutional and legal rights
in 1997 thengovernor bush vetoed an advanced directives bill precisely because it would have given specific legal sanction to such involuntary denial of lifesaving treatment
an effort in the texas legislature to amend the bill to require treatment pending transfer to a health care provider willing to provide the lifesaving treatment had been defeated
with no legal protections at all under texas law and ongoing programs in texas hospitals denying treatment with no opportunity to even seek transfer prolife groups entered into negotiations with medical groups that finally resulted in the bill that one formalized more protections for inhospital review two gave patients 10 days of treatment while seeking transfer and three authorized court proceedings to extend the 10 days for reasonable additional periods of time to accomplish transfer
that was not my desire in the beginning and it was not the desire of the entire house of representatives either
wednesday night the house passed hr 1332 which was a bill which i introduced that applied to everybody who is in an incapacitated state a major protection for people who are disabled
and there was a move in the other body to bring it up and it was objected to and that is why this issue was not resolved with a general law of general application
i hope we revisit that issue some time in the future so that we do not have to deal with a specific case again
but we are here because we could not get hr 1332 passed in the other body
i also think this is an issue of priorities priorities of what we put a higher priority on in terms of how we provide food and nourishment to living human beings
in florida they have a statute number 82812 that says if you do not feed an animal you can go to jail for a year and be fined 5 000
so in florida an animal has a higher right than this woman and that is a wrong priority and this bill attempts to correct it
the first means is in the lower federal court through the habeas corpus statute and the second is by petitioning the supreme court directly
in any case even if she is granted a habeas review of her case she faces a major obstacle in that the federal habeas corpus statute essentially requires the federal court to defer to the state court s determination regarding the facts of this case
second terri schiavo s lawyers can try to obtain relief in the supreme court
her lawyers are currently pursuing an ordinary appeal directly to the supreme court but that appeal process will extend for weeks at least and in any case her appeal will likely be denied because the supreme court will generally not take a case without a lower federal court s first establishing a record
and fourth the ordinary review process in the supreme court will take far too long
she will probably die in the interim
consequently terri schiavo s only hope is the current bill which will guarantee a fresh review of her case in the lower federal court immediately without any deference to state court determination and with the lower federal court issuing a stay of the state court order until it can determine the federal claims the court is required to hear under this bill on its merits
my heart goes out to everyone who may have found themselves in a similar situation in the past or might find themselves in a similar situation in the future
i wanted to stay back in connecticut and avoid having to cast a vote because i do not want to play god and either way i vote i feel i am
on both sides of the aisle we ask let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in thy sight o lord my strength and my redeemer sanctity of life sanctity of marriage sanctity of an individual to decide for themselves what should happen to their own life i find myself wondering why is there so much focus on this life when we ignore the countless lives throughout the world who die minute by minute hour by hour day by day from hunger and disease that this congress could address and this congress could prevent
why only terri when there are others like her in our country
mr speaker we meet tonight under extraordinary circumstances and i for one am very grateful to the speaker and majority leader delay for bringing us back because a muchloved disabled woman in florida has been ordered to die by starvation and dehydration
we meet tonight because terri schiavo s family including her parents bob and mary schindler refuse to allow their precious daughter who is not in a coma nor is she terminally ill nor is she in a persistent vegetative state to be killed by starving her to death
let us not forget she has been in a hospice for 5 years
my mother was in a hospice
one goes into a hospice when they are in the process of dying
mention was made earlier by the gentleman from florida mr wexler xz4004300 that everyone agrees that terri is in a persistent vegetative state
let me remind my colleagues that no less than 14 independent medical professionals including six neurologists have said she is not in a persistent vegetative state
william hammesfahr an md board certified neurologist from clearwater florida has testified and he has signed an affidavit as recently as march 6 of this year and he has said ms schiavo is not in a persistent vegetative state
he goes on to point out that she could benefit and i will include this full statement in the record from medical interventions that are available right now as we meet she could be getting therapies medical and otherwise that would make her situation all that much better
she has sat in a hospice to languish denied these basic medical provisions and procedures that could enhance her life
have personal knowledge of the facts states in this declaration and if called as a witness i could and would testify competently thereto under oath
i am a boardcertified neurologist in private practice in clearwater florida
i have previously filed affidavits and testified in the matter involving terri schiavo
she has a large amount of viable brain tissue in her cerebellum space and cerebral hemispheres not just scar tissue or spinal fluid
i have previously testified and i am still of the opinion that ms schiavo is not in a persistent vegetative state
when i examined her approximately two years ago she was not pvs of mcs she was in an alert state able to follow commands able to respond to language and able to swallow
there have been new advances in medical evaluation and treatment for patients like terri schiavo even in just the past few years
for example in november of 2003
as a patient terri schiavo is not in that bad of a condition to begin with
there are a lot of therapies out there that will very likely improve her condition and they all compliment each other so if you do them all in a series she could get a lot better
executed this 06 day of march 2005 in clearwater florida
declaration of william maxfield md facnm i william maxfield md facnm have personal knowledge of the facts stated in this declaration and if called as a witness i could and would testify competently thereto under oath
i am a medical doctor and licensed in florida and several other states
i have extensive experience in treatment of stroke multiple sclerosis brain trauma cerebral palsy other cognitive diseases and congenital problems such as ataxiatelangectasia as well as many other diseases that are treated with hyperbaric oxygen therapy hbot
my experience in imaging and hyperbaric medicine provide a unique background for my work in developing protocols to diagnose and treat conditions that may benefit from hyperbaric oxygen therapy such as the current condition of terri schiavo
in may of 2002 i previously evaluated terri schiavo
i reviewed supplied medical records personally observed and evaluated ms schiavo on two separate days at the request of attorney pat anderson who was involved in the case at that time
these behaviors in my opinion are not consistent with a persistent vegetative state pvs but are those of minimally conscious state mcs
there have been medical advances in the evaluation and treatment of patients like ms schiavo even in just the past several years and since the last time that i examined her
we can then determine if there is improvement in the pattern of her brain and predict if additional hyperbaric 9
she does respond to people she knows and this is not something a person in a pvs state would be able to do
i base this opinion on my 30 years of practice in radiation therapy and as medical director for a hospice program where i have dealt with many patients who are in a pvs state
in my opinion terri schiavo is mcs because if she was pvs she would not respond to the stimuli around her including the music
in my opinion she is in a vegetative state
if she can do that then in my opinion she can swallow liquids
executed this 6 day of march 2005 in odessa florida
we want the venue to be a federal district court in florida to look at this critical matter from beginning to end to determine what has been missed
normally those issues are hard but what is happening in this case is a moral outrage
her husband is in a compromised position
mr speaker as one of 203 democrat and republican members of congress who voted in favor of s 686 a private bill for the relief of the parents of theresa marie schiavo i am pleased that president bush signed this important piece of legislation that may result in the reinsertion of ms schiavo s feeding tube
as i listened to my colleagues debating this issue on the house floor last night i heard many emotional statements from members on both sides of the aisle in support of and opposed to what this bill stands for
due to the urgency of ms schaivo s case this bill was limited in considering just her life
i feel so strongly about this that i was an original cosponsor of congressman dave weldon s recently introduced bill hr 1151 that would have given legal representation to all incapacitated persons who are without written documentation as to their wishes and whose family is involved in a dispute as to the person s wishes
s 686 which we passed early this morning allows ms schiavo s parents to bring the case before the federal court in florida and they would be able to hear all evidence without being prejudiced by any of the information from the florida state case that led to the feeding tubes being removed
as technology continues to advance there will be even more heartwrenching decisions ahead and any of us could be involved in one
the proper role of the federal government in such decisions is not selfevident to me
my view is that when in doubt society should err on the side of life
i am concerned that in this case most members of congress have not had the opportunity for careful study and consideration of the issues raised
in fact i hope each citizen will spend time thinking about how our country can best deal with such cases and praying that we get it right
in this case the courts of the state of florida have thoroughly reviewed the facts of this case and weighed the evidence about what theresa schiavo would want
they have concluded that theresa schiavo through her words and deeds before her accident would not want to be kept artificially alive in a persistent vegetative state
who are we to impose our own personal preferences in this case
mr speaker i come to the floor to just speak about the issue of being here in the first place
like the gentlewoman from colorado i am just an earnest layman not a lawyer or a physician even though i have been very impressed from both sides with the input from the distinguished lawyers and physicians that are in these chambers and i think we should come often now as technology develops exponentially and just ask questions of ourselves about medical ethics and where we really are
to the whole country if you do not want your family in this dilemma and you should not get a living will so that it is clear so it is not questioned so that you will not have a case come to the floor of the house with you
the lesson here is everyone in this country should have a living will so it is cut and dried so we know and the legislative bodies in florida or montana or washington dc
mr speaker i just came in on the plane from north carolina and i found myself thinking a lot about what we are doing here this evening
wondering first of all what this vote is going to cost the american people making a mental calculation that probably 4 5 million we are spending on this one vote this evening and wondering how many children are going to go to bed hungry tonight and how many we could feed with that amount of money how many feeding tubes we have withdrawn by our own indifference in this body by the decisions that we have made in this body that pit one group against another
i found myself wondering where the compassion was last week when we tried to rally the members of this body behind the congressional black caucus agenda and budget and pointed out to them that 886 000 more people died over the last 10 years african americans because they did not get the same kind of quality of medical care that white americans got just the difference in the qualities
the compassion comes out in this one case but where is the compassion when we point out to you every single day that people are starving and dying and seeking justice and you will not hear it
mr speaker i thank the gentleman for yielding me time and i commend him for the work he has put in over the last 4 days to try to bring this bill to the floor
and by the way i think it has been pointed out by some of the people that preceded me scott peterson s case is going to get a federal review john couey the man who confessed to killing that young girl in florida not far from where terri schiavo lives he will get a federal review but there were several features of it
number one by my medical definition she was not in a vegetative state based on my review of the videos my talking to the family and my discussing the case with one of the neurologists who examined her
i encourage all of my colleagues to vote in support of it
in fact for 15 years mrs schiavo has remained in a persistent vegetative state
there is this perception possibly that only one judge has been involved in this case
in fact 19 judges in the state of florida have participated in various legal proceedings regarding terri schiavo
the state of florida through our judicial system has taken testimony from everyone in the family and from everyone who knew mrs schiavo that was capable of giving it
the courts in florida have received expert testimony from many of the most prominent neurosurgeons and neurologists throughout the entire country
the court system and the 19 judges in florida have been unanimous unanimous in stating that from the evidence provided by a standard of clear and convincing evidence that it is mrs schiavo s wish that she not be required to continue in a persistent vegetative state
so i would respectfully suggest for those of us that take exception to the proposed action by the chairman of the committee on the judiciary and by this congress that we stand in the shoes of terri schiavo
we stand in her shoes because what we are simply arguing is that the will of terri schiavo as found by the legal system of florida which is the law of the land as of now that her will be respected and that her will be carried out
with all due respect to the proposed remedy in effect if this bill were to pass what this congress is designating is that the court system of florida will lose its long history of jurisdiction of this matter and others like it and the jurisdiction of the federal court will be substituted
and while i would not dare suggest otherwise i would ask the question if the florida courts had found in favor of terri schiavo s parents would we be here this evening
so it is fair to conclude therefore that the reason we are here this evening is that the majority is unhappy objects to the decision rightfully reached by the courts of the state of florida and as a result the majority wishes to undermine over 200 years of jurisprudence and a long history in this country for respect for our judicial independence as well as the states court systems and the jurisdictions assigned to it
in closing mr speaker i would simply suggest this one thing this is heartwrenching for all americans
each american i believe tonight and today has been searching his or her soul wondering how they would react if god forbid they were in this position
it is simply one that respects the rule of law the rule of law in the state of florida the rule of law which has involved the participation of 19 judges all unanimous in their view
not a single medical piece of evidence has been provided by anybody who has diagnosed or in person witnessed mrs schiavo that has said anything other than that she persists in an vegetative state
and yet this congress seeks to replace and substitute our judgment even though not a single one of us as far as i understand has ever diagnosed mrs schiavo nor do we have the medical expertise to do so and yet we are willing tonight to replace with our judgment the judgment of the most prominent doctors in our country and a court system which has labored extensively to yield a just result
those determinations have been repeatedly ratified over the past 7 years by 19 judges in more than 10 trials appeals or other proceedings
in an unprecedented procedure the united states house of representatives and the united states senate are voting to direct a federal court to relitigate this entire matter
these discussions occur in bedrooms across america
also intensely personal decisions are made in hospital and hospice rooms across this country
by forcing this vote through congress the republican leadership is demonstrating that no bedroom in america and no hospital room in this land is beyond the reach and power of this federal government
it is my hope that from this tragedy more people will understand the importance of determining their own futures and that of their family in the form of living wills
mr speaker i rise today in strong support of s 686
the fourteenth amendment establishes that no state shall deprive any person of life liberty and property without due process of law everyday in cases where the action of the state will result in the death of an individual that individual is provided the opportunity to have their case heard in both the state and federal court systems
my thoughts and prayers as well of those of my constituents in 19th district of texas are with terri and her family during these difficult times
i apologize for not knowing the state that the gentleman is from but the representation regarding the care of theresa schiavo by her husband as represented in the chamber is totally inaccurate
theresa s husband and i am quoting from the guardian ad litem report the independent guardian ad litem report that was required by florida law during the special session in october of 2003 it says theresa s husband michael schiavo and her mother mary schindler were virtually partners in their care of and dedication to theresa
michael schiavo and terri schiavo were awarded 750 000 in economic damages
and there is no truth to the accusation that he would benefit financially from that damage award and there certainly was not 2 million in damages awarded
a report to governor jeb bush and the 6th judicial circuit in the matter of theresa marie schiavo theresa marie schiavo was born in the philadelphia pennsylvania area on 3 december 1963 to robert and mary schindler
they dated for many months and married in november of 1984
theresa and michael moved to florida in 1986 and were followed shortly thereafter by theresa s parents and siblings
about three years later without the apparent knowledge of her parents theresa and michael sought assistance in becoming pregnant through an obstetrician who specialized in fertility services
for over a year theresa and michael received fertility services and counseling in order to enhance their strongly held desire to have a child
she was very proud of her fabulous figure and her stunning appearance wearing bikini bathing suits for the first time and taking great pride in her improved good looks
on the tragic early morning of 25 february 1990 theresa collapsed in the hallway of her apartment waking michael who called theresa s family and 911
the cause of the cardiac arrest was adduced to a dramatically reduced potassium level in theresa s body
sodium and potassium maintain a vital chemical balance in the human body that helps define the electrolyte levels
the cause of the imbalance was not clearly identified but may be linked in theory to her drinking 1015 glasses of iced tea each day
while no formal proof emerged the medical records note that the combination of aggressive weight loss diet control and excessive hydration raised questions about theresa suffering from bulimia an eating disorder more common among women than men in which purging through vomiting laxatives and other methods of diet control becomes obsessive
in september of 1990 she was brought home but following only three weeks she was returned to the college park facility because the family was overwhelmed by terry s care needs on 18 june 1990 michael was formally appointed by the court to serve as theresa s legal guardian because she was adjudicated to be incompetent by law
theresa s husband michael schiavo and her mother mary schindler were virtual partners in their care of and dedication to theresa
in late autumn of 1990 following months of therapy and testing formal diagnoses of persistent vegetative state with no evidence of improvement michael took theresa to california where she received an experimental thalamic stimulator implant in her brain
michael remained in california caring for theresa during a period of several months and returned to florida with her in january of 1991
theresa was transferred to the mediplex rehabilitation center in brandon where she received 24hour skilled care physical occupational speech and recreational therapies
in 1993 the malpractice action concluded in theresa and michael s favor resulting in a two element award more than 750 000 in economic damages for theresa and a loss of consortium award non economic damages of 300 000 to michael
there is no evidence in the record of the trust administration documents of any mismanagement of theresa s estate and the records on this matter are excellently maintained
proceedings concluded that there was no basis for the removal of michael as guardian further it was determined that he had been very aggressive and attentive in his care of theresa
this was in the face of consistent medical reports indicating that there was little or no likelihood for her improvement
in early 1994 theresa contracted a urinary tract infection and michael in consultation with theresa s treating physician elected not to treat the infection and simultaneously imposed a do not resuscitate order should theresa experience cardiac arrest
it had taken michael more than three years to accommodate this reality and he was beginning to accept the idea of allowing theresa to die naturally rather than remain in the noncognitive vegetative state
efforts to remove michael as guardian were attempted in subsequent years without success
in 1997 six years after theresa s tragic collapse michael elected to initiate an action to withdraw artificial life support from theresa
more than a year later in may of 1998 the first petition to discontinue life support was entered
he concludes that michael schiavo s testimony regarding the basis for his decision to withdraw life support a conversation he had with his wife theresa was not clear and convincing and that potential conflicts of interest regarding the disposition of residual funds in theresa s trust account following her death affected michael and the schindlers but he placed greater emphasis on the impact it might have had on michael s decision to discontinue artificial life support
at the time of mr pearse s report more than 700 000 remained in the guardianship estate
by the chronology of this case specifically referencing michael s change in position relative to maintaining theresa following the malpractice award
mr pearse recommended that the petition for removal of the feeding tube be denied or in the alternative if the court found the evidence to be clear and convincing the feeding tube should be withdrawn
mr pearse also recommended that a guardian ad litem continue to serve in all subsequent proceedings
in response to mr pearse s report michael schiavo filed a suggestion of bias against mr pearse
this document notes that mr pearse failed to mention in his report that michael schiavo had earlier formally offered to divest himself entirely of his financial interest in the guardianship estate
the criticism continues to note that mr pearse s concern about abuse of inheritance potential was directly solely at michael not at the schindlers in the event they might become the heirs and also choose to terminate artificial the suggestion of bias challenges premises and findings of mr pearse establishing a well pleaded case for bias
in february of 1999 mr pearse tendered his petition for additional authority or discharge
he was discharged in june of 1999 and no new guardian ad litem was named
most of the motions in these efforts were denied but not without apparent careful and detailed review by the court often involving hearings at which considerable latitude was afforded the schindlers in their efforts to proffer testimony and admit evidence
the testimony of these parties referenced specific conversations in which theresa commented about her desire never to be placed on artificial life support
nearly gruesome examples were given eliciting agreement by family members that in the event theresa should contract diabetes and subsequent gangrene in each of her limbs they would agree to amputate each limb and would then were she to be diagnosed with heart disease perform open heart surgery
there was additional difficult testimony that appeared to establish that despite the sad and undesirable condition of theresa the parents still derived joy from having her alive even if theresa might not be at all aware of her environment the court denied the schindlers motions to remove the guardian allowing that the evidence was not sufficient and in some instances not relevant
the decision was appealed to the florida 2nd district court of appeals dca and was affirmed in january 2001
two days after the clamping of theresa s feeding tube the schindlers filed a civil action in their capacity as natural guardians for theresa
the trial court in emergency review granted a temporary injunction and the tube was unclamped
in october 2001 the 2nd dca concluded that the schindlers have presented no credible evidence suggesting new treatment can restore mrs schiavo the injunction was lifted and plans moved forward to discontinue artificial nutrition
fresh and exhaustive motions regarding new evidence were again crafted and proffered to the trial court by the schindlers resulting in a lengthy hearing
in particular the sworn statement of a single osteopathic physician dr
webber claimed that he could improve theresa s condition and had done so in like and similar cases
the quality of evidence in this affidavit was marginal but the court allowed it to create a colorable entitlement to additional medical review
webber who had served as the basis for this entire process at the 2nd dca did not participate in the exams or the procedure
video tape recordings were made of some of the examinations along with segments in which family members interacted with theresa
written reports of the examinations were prepared by all five physicians and a very detailed hearing was held in october of 2002
four of the physicians were board certified in neurology as suggested by the court and one physician was board certified in radiology and hyperbaric medicine
evidence presented by michael schiavo s two physicians and the fifth physician selected by the court was reasonably deemed clear and convincing in support of theresa being in a persistent vegetative state with no hope for improvement
the 2nd dca panel of judges engaged in what approximated a de novo review of all of the facts testimony and video tapes presented at trial
the appellate court affirmed the trial court s ruling and its conclusions and in addition ordered the trial court to set a hearing date for removal of the artificial life support
multiple amicus briefs and affidavits from parties supporting the schindlers were submitted through the schindler s actions and in some instances independently to the court
the schindlers acting on behalf of theresa filed a motion in federal district court seeking a preliminary injunction to stay the removal of the artificial life support from theresa scheduled to occur on 15 october 2003
on 6 october 2003 florida governor jeb bush filed an amicus brief in support of the motion for a preliminary injunction
the brief argues that removal of artificial nutrition resulting in death should be avoided if that person can take oral nutrition and hydration
that theresa is in a diagnosed persistent vegetative state is explicitly recognized
the florida legislature in special session passed hb 35 e on 21 october 2003 authorizing the governor to stay the disconnection of the artificial feeding tube and required among other things the appointment of a guardian ad litem to produce this report
other suits and actions were initiated immediately the governor became a named party in the matters involving theresa schiavo
no one in this chamber questions the pain heartache and personal struggles that every member of ms schiavo s family has had to deal with over the last 15 years
but heartbreaking decisions like this are deeply intimate personal and private matters and the federal government and this body in particular should not inject itself into the middle of this private family matter
and i know the pain that this causes families only too well because it happened in my own family not even 5 weeks ago
her children came together to make that very difficult decision and no one in my family felt it was essential that i or any other member of congress file legislation to stop it
do we really want to set the precedent of this great body the united states congress to insert ourselves in the middle of families private matters all across america
when i ran for congress i did not ask my constituents for the right to insert myself in their private personal families decisions and they do not want me to make those for them
i have never met michael schiavo or terri schiavo or the schindlers and the vast majority of people in this body have not either
we do not have the expertise or the facts in enough detail to get into these kinds of decisions and make decisions on these kind of cases
now i have heard a lot of things said about this legislation and about the very proceeding that we are engaging in this evening
the accusation that because we have 3 hours of debate on an unprecedented piece of legislation that seeks to insert the federal government in between a family while overruling state courts and circumventing the constitution that is an outrageous accusation and not worthy of a representative elected to craft and debate legislation
i think it is important to note that president bush when he was governor of texas in 1999 signed a texas law that is on the books today that was just used a few days ago to allow a hospital to withdraw over the parents objections the life support of a 6monthold boy over the parents objections
this law that has been used several times and as recently as a few days ago liberalized the situations under which a person in texas can avoid artificial life support
under it life support can be withheld or withdrawn if you have an irreversible condition in texas from which you are expected to eventually pass away
there is an obvious conflict here between the president s feelings on this matter now as compared to when he was governor of texas so i thought that was an important conflict that should be raised here this evening in our discussion
let me just close my remarks by reiterating there is no room for the federal government in this most personal of private angstridden family matters in which a family has to make the most personal of decisions when dealing with the course of care of a loved one
ms schiavo made it clear as opposed to what the gentleman from wisconsin said that she would not have wished to remain in a persistent vegetative state and the guardian ad litem report well documents that
in fact it documents it to such a degree that it cites the specific conversations referenced by her family members when she attended funerals of loved ones who were in similar situations when they had life support removed and she had stated that if god forbid she was ever in this situation that she would not have wished to remain on life support
she made it clear that she wished not to remain in a persistent vegetative state which she is in today
and this us government should not step in to circumvent the wishes of one dying woman
the independent guardian ad litem appointed to represent terri schiavo has said in his report that despite the facts cited by my colleagues on the other side of the aisle who have said that terri felt pain and laughs and cries that that is factually inaccurate that her cerebral cortex has been liquefied and that is the area of the brain that responds to emotion and reason
additionally they talk about six neurologists and eight physicians that have said that she is not in a persistent vegetative state
the five courtappointed physicians that have examined terri two appointed on michael schiavo s side two on the schindlers side and one courtappointed physician who have all examined her the board certified neurologists who had scientificallybased academicallyresearched testimony their testimony was deemed to be clear and convincing by the court that she was and is in a persistent vegetative state
in addition to that i want to just close with the commentary from the guardian ad litem
you hope she is going to sit up in bed and say hey i m really here but do nt tell anybody or i m really here tell everybody but schiavo never made eye contact
he concluded that the medical and legal evidence behind schiavo s diagnosis of being in a persistent vegetative state was credible but he still felt that for all their expertise those medical experts would never truly know where schiavo was
as a physician i have dealt with endoflife decisions in families as they struggle countless times
first and foremost there is no living will in place and second there is a fundamental disagreement between terri s husband and her parents two who normally would agree
when loved ones disagree our society strongly strongly believes in individual rights and that they must be preserved
that is why all state death penalty cases get a final review in federal court and that is all that is being asked here
as i sat in church this morning i struggled with this and i prayed
i prayed for a decrease in the emotion
how many others in this country are now in longterm care facilities with feeding tubes but able to breathe on their own their hearts beating strongly
it is unfortunate in many ways that this venue is where this issue will be decided but removal of this feeding tube under these very public circumstances is a slippery slope down which we and the united states should not tread
and over those 30 years i have had countless men and women who have come to me in situations of decisions that had to be made regarding family members and in the privacy of a home or in a waiting room we have dealt with those decisions
the shame of this debate is that in spite of the fact that we are a great legislative body we are a body that determines peace and war but we are not a hallowed body
and the fact that we are engaged in this debate is proof positive of the fact that we are a fractured body
and what we need to also understand is that we live in a world of echoes a world of echoes
and a thoughtless word falling from the lips of members here can travel around this country and do even more damage to the divisions that we have in this nation
as i looked at her precious little face i thought of terri schiavo s mother and father how they must have cradled their little girl loved her watched her grow given her hand in marriage
given the complexity of who should have final say over terri s life an estranged husband who is now in a common law marriage or her loving parents it is only reasonable that additional levels of appeal be given
mr speaker let us join terri s mother and father and cradle terri in the arms of a just and good decision
mr speaker it is a sad day in america when a society as great as ours and filled with as many opportunities as ours turns its back on one of its most vulnerable disabled citizens
congress has no business interjecting its opinion in the endoflife decisions of any family
she is not terminally ill or in the process of dying
the most difficult decision i ever made in my life and my father s
but we consulted with the physicians and we were able to get her to a point where she could live off of life support and leave it in the hands of god and that is what we did
i do not know anyone here in this legislative body who wants to interject their opinion in any family s decision but starving a woman to death when death is not imminent is wrong
and tonight mr speaker there is a woman in florida that is being starved and we are acting tonight to preserve her right to live and give her the opportunity of a tomorrow
i say to you tonight mr speaker this is not about terri schiavo it is about every one of us in this room
mr speaker i rise in support of this bill tonight with a heavy heart as is everybody in this chamber
i would though like to address an important issue that we have not talked much about and that is the conflict of interest that i believe her husband has with respect to his decisions that are supposedly in her best interest
i have to disqualify myself as an auditor if i have got a conflict of interest that is in appearance or in fact
this body has heard much about the importance of conflicts of interest whether in the sarbanesoxley bill that talks about the relationship of auditors and their clients or campaign finance laws where it talks about the impact that money has on these conflicts of interest
terri s husband has in my mind a significant and apparent conflict of interest in this matter
her husband is her guardian and he is duty bound in my mind to make decisions that are in terri s best interest
this is a conflict of interest between what is in his personal best interest and his wife and children s best interests and those of terri s
mr speaker the gentleman made a statement if i understand correctly that passage of this proposal before us today would translate into a savings of 400 for each family in america
in addition we also plan to consider hr 8 the death tax repeal permanency act of 2005
we will not be in session tomorrow to accommodate members traveling to rome for the funeral services of his holiness pope john paul ii
not only are we going to be able to see the nationals play the first home game in 34 years but we are going to finally pass bankruptcy reform legislation that can get to the president s desk and be signed
on average passage of this legislation will save a family of four 400 a year and 400 a year is a very important amount of money for an awful lot of people in this country and that is the price that they are paying because of the abuse that we have seen of our bankruptcy law that has been going on for years and years and years
i happen to believe that it is essential that we provide that 400 in relief to the american people just as quickly as we can
because it is true 35 amendments were submitted to us in the committee on rules
let me say a modified closed rule means that the minority is offered a chance at providing a substitute cobbling together a package that in fact is an alternative to the measure that we have brought forward
mr speaker we would have made in order a substitute had they given it to us
the exact same opportunity existed on this bill which has gone through congress after congress with an excess of 300 votes in the past
we said a substitute would have been made in order if it had been submitted to us in the committee on rules
if i could reclaim my time what i am suggesting is that because of abuse of bankruptcy filings that take place today that is a cost that is imposed on american consumers to the average family of four of in excess of 400
after 4 years of record deficits and 2 trillion in new debt one would think that the republican majority would have a better understanding of what bankruptcy is
they are lucky this law does not apply to their actions in the last 4 years
case in point the bill preserves the millionaires loophole used by the wealthy to hide up to 1 million from creditors and courts into offshore accounts known as asset protection
if one can afford a highpriced lawyer to set up an asset protection trust they are a lot better off in bankruptcy than a middleclass family struggling to pay off large hospital bills
we should have one rule one standard in the law of bankruptcy law that applies to every american regardless of income and regardless of wealth or position
the rule provides for 1 hour debate in the house equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the committee on the judiciary
for at least four previous congresses members have been trying to reform our when in doubt bail out society in favor of personal responsibility
with this rule and passage of the underlying legislation s 256 we will finally see some movement in the right direction
federal bankruptcy filings per judgeship have increased by 71 percent from 2 998 in 1992 to 5 130 in 2003 and it represents the largest case load in our federal court system
this creates a backlog that slows down the process for those really in need of bankruptcy protection
bankruptcy reform provisions found in s 256 include but are not limited to abuse prevention so debtors who have committed crimes of violence or engaged in drug trafficking are no longer able to use bankruptcy to hide their finances needsbased credentials where if a debtor has the ability to partially repay debts he or she must either be channeled into a form of bankruptcy relief that requires repayment or risk having the bankruptcy case dismissed as an abusive filing spousal and child support protections to help single parents and their children by closing a loophole used by some spouses currently avoiding their child support responsibilities
child support and alimony payments are currently seventh in the priority list of payments closing the mansion loophole require a debtor to live in a state for at least 2 years before he or she can claim that state s homestead exemption
there are business privacy protections to prohibit the disclosure of names of a debtor s minor children with privileged information kept in a nonpublic record
current law allows nearly every item of information supplied by a debtor in connection with his or her bankruptcy case to be made available to the public
the reforms included in this legislation will be very beneficial to our society without ignoring the need of those suffering financial uncertainty
i want to point out mr speaker to the gentleman from florida that medical expenses are specifically covered in the bill and all other extenuating circumstances are covered in section 102 of the bill allowing judicial latitude
to my distinguished colleague from florida in regard to the amendment process in the committee on rules my colleague knows that the other side was offered an amendment in the nature of a substitute
every one of those 35 amendments could have been included in an amendment in the nature of a substitute but apparently they just could not get their act together did not have an amendment and passed on that opportunity
in regard to the gentlewoman from california and the concerns about identity theft opponents of the means test of the bankruptcy legislation have attempted to claim that a debtor should be except from the means test if the debt is related to identity theft
a consumer who is victimized when an identity thief establishes credit in the consumer s name is not liable for any of the debts incurred by the identity thief
bankruptcy relief is therefore not necessary in regard to identity theft
in the 105th congress hr 3150 bankruptcy reform passed 306118
in the 106th congress hr 8333 passed the house 313108
in the 107th congress hr 333 passed the house 306108
in the 108th congress hr 975 passed the house 315113
the gentleman from virginia mr scott xz4003641 was not one of those voting in the affirmative on any of those occasions but i want to point out to the gentleman in regard to his concern over medical and healthrelated expenses for a debtor spouse and dependents on line 23 page 8 continuing through line 10 page 9 this covers the treatment of medical expenses for the debtor spouse of the debtor and dependents of the debtor
so medical in any situation mr speaker medical or otherwise no debtor is denied access to bankruptcy relief
all s 256 says is that in a limited range of cases a debtor with meaningful capacity to repay may have to file in chapter 13 as opposed to chapter 7 in no case is a debtor denied access to the bankruptcy system
in response to the gentlewoman from texas mr speaker a substitute amendment was offered in every other congress that bankruptcy reform was considered
every other congress in which bankruptcy reform was considered the minority submitted a substitute amendment
in regard to health care expenses and i am reading from a march 29 2005 crs report for congress titled treatment of health care expenses under the bankruptcy abuse prevention and consumer protection act conclusion
health care expenses will generally be considered in one of two contexts in a bankruptcy filing
factoring in these expenses may also reduce the debtor s disposable income under the means test mr speaker i reserve the balance of my time
in speaking to that senate 256 needsbased test includes several safeguards and exceptions for special circumstances including those of veterans a specific reference to a debtor who is subject to a call or ordered to active duty in the armed forces to the extent that such occurrences substantiate special circumstances
the bill excuses a debtor if he or she is on active military duty in a military combat zone from the mandatory credit counseling and financial management training requirements
in response to the gentlewoman i have got a letter from the national child support enforcement association february 8 2005 that i will insert for printing in the record
in addition during the lengthy 3 to 5 years duration of consumer bankruptcies as they happen every day under present law debtors often succeed in significantly delaying or even avoiding repayment of child support and alimony arrearages altogether
and worst of all under present law significant collection tools used to require the payment of current s 256 would provide these children with first priority in the collection of support debts allow the enforcement of medical support obligations prevent any interruption in the otherwise efficient process of withholding earnings for payment of child support and insure that during the course of a consumer bankruptcy all support owed to the family would be paid and paid timely
in response to the gentleman from illinois the reform bill significantly limits two practices that some wealthy filers use to hide assets from bankrupt creditors
under the current system in states with unlimited homestead exemptions debtors can shield the full value of their residencies from creditors
in addition the bill adds a specific provision that prevents filers from shielding funds in an asset protection trust when fraud is involved
in fact these practices will continue unabated unless this legislation is passed
more than 35 democratic amendments were offered in the rules committee yesterday
yet none have been made in order
there is no reason for limiting the debate in this manner
the argument will be made that this has been 9 years in the making
all the information we have available suggests that medical bills are the second leading cause of personal bankruptcy in the united states
it is in my opinion hypocritical to prevent debate on an amendment that could ameliorate some of the issues facing this bankruptcy reform legislation
at this point mr speaker i will insert a list of all 35 amendments which the republican majority has blocked from being considered in the lt em gt lt em gt congressional record
amendments submitted to the rules committee for s 256 and denied consideration by the rule h res 211 1 emanueldelahuntdingell prevents debtors from shielding their funds from bankruptcy liquidation through socalled asset protection trusts 2 filner exempts disabled veterans from the bill s means test 3 filner exempts from the bill s means test consumers who are victimized by identity theft 4 inslee exempts from the bill s means test consumers whose debts are the result of serious medical problems 5 delahunt requires debtor corporations to file for bankruptcy where their principal place of business is located 6 sanders establishes a usury rate for credit card companies above which credit card companies can not charge consumers 7 sanders caps fees credit card companies can impose on consumers at 15 8 sanders prohibits credit card companies from changing interest rates based on changes in consumers credit information 9 sanders prohibits credit card companies from raising interest rates based on consumer credit reports 10 ruppersberger requires credit card solicitations to be accompanied by a brochure explaining the consequences of the irresponsible use of credit 11 schiff exempts from the bill s means test consumers who are victimized by identity theft if at least 51 of the creditor claims against them are due to identity theft 12 lofgren exempts from the bill s means test 1 families facing bankruptcy due to a serious medical hardship that drains at least 50 of their yearly income and 2 families who lose at least one month of needed pay or alimony due to illness 13 lofgren exempt from the bill s means test a single parent who failed to receive child or spousal support totaling more than 50 of her or his household income 14 scott va exempts from the bill s means test provisions 1 debtors who have business losses incurred by a spouse who has died or deserted the debtor 2 debtors who have had serious illness in their family and 3 debtors who have been laid off 15 scott va exempts from the bill s means test provisions debtors who have business losses incurred by a spouse who has died or deserted the debtor 16 scott va exempts from the bill s means test provisions debtors who have had serious illness in their family 17 scott va exempts from the bill s means test provisions debtors who have been laid off from their jobs through no fault of their own 18 nadler sunsets the bill after 2 years 19 watt prohibits annual credit card rates higher than 75 20 watt includes the costs of college in the calculation of debtor s monthly expense 21 ruppersberger exempts from the bill s means test debtors who have declared bankruptcy due to high medical expenses 22 hastings fl prevents credit card companies from increasing rates on consumers who use their credit cards to pay for extraordinary medical expenses also prevents hospitals from generating negative credit information on consumers who are paying their bills in good faith 23 meehan exempts from the means test disabled veterans whose indebtedness occurred primarily as a result of an injury or disability resulting from active duty or homeland defense activities closes a loophole in s 256 which exempts only disabled veterans whose indebtedness occurs primarily while on active duty while failing to exempt disabled veterans whose indebtedness occurs after they have left active duty 24 jackson lee makes debts arising out of state sex offenses nondischargeable in bankruptcy proceedings 25 jackson lee clarifies congress intent that nuclear liabilities be covered by the priceanderson act and not by bankruptcy laws 26 jackson lee makes debts arising out of penalties imposed on businesses for false tobacco claims nondischargeable 27 jackson lee strikes the bill s means test provision 28 woolsey requires credit counseling agencies to provide free services to recent veterans of the military who served in combat zones 29 slaughter requires credit card companies to determine before they approve a credit card whether a student applicant has the financial means to pay off a credit card balance it restricts the credit limit to minimum balances if the student has no independent income and it requires parental approval for credit limit increases in the event that a parent cosigns the account 30 slaughter applies the highest median income of any county or metropolitan statistical area in the state to all residents of the state petitioning for bankruptcy protection 31 millendermcdonald provides the bankruptcy courts a higher percentage of the fees collected when a debtor files for bankruptcy 32 maloney ensures that debtors emerging from bankruptcy make child credit payments first before payments on credit card debt
the current version of the bill does not ensure that child support payments will have priority over the other types of unsecured debts such as credit card debt 33 meehan and berman provides a modest homestead exemption for people who have suffered a major illness or injury 34 jackson lee provides additional protections to debtors who are the victims of identity theft 35 jackson lee increases the means test limit on parochial school tuition expenses from 1 500 to 3 000 so that families chapter 13 bankruptcy can keep their children in schools that conform to their deeply held religious beliefs
it seems that if the republican leadership deems legislation important and that is their prerogative it is willing to push through the other body s version without the opportunity for debate here in the people s house on any amendments
what also concerns me is the unworkable means test contained in this legislation
in the long run the net effect of this legislation will drive more americans deeper into financial crisis and weaken our social structure and the nation s economy
my respect for the chairman of the committee on the judiciary is immense and he has thrust all of these hearings and all that were in committee where 40 members of the committee on the judiciary had an opportunity to participate
further parliamentary inquiry so the gentlewoman from new york s request to put in the record the material
mr speaker there is objection to a member s placing in the record a member who had made a statement supporting the things that she asked to be submitted that is being denied
reclaiming my time in any event both bills will be on the calendar next week
i presume the gentleman from south carolina mr spratt xz4003860 will be invited to the conference at some point in time along with others
as the gentleman knows we have had some problems at least from our perspective in being included in the conferences from time to time
our citizens are confronting as my colleague knows very high gas prices 220 230 250 in some areas of the country
i understand that the committees of jurisdiction are expected to be marking up next week or are in the process of marking up the energy bill
mr speaker i am outraged because the bankruptcy bill stabs the american people in the back
the reason why i say that is because we have a bankruptcy code that allows for the discretion of the judiciary in the bankruptcy courts to be able to determine whether your case is frivolous
but now we have put in place what we call a means test which indicates that hardworking american families middleclass families who have faced catastrophic illnesses divorce loss of job in this horrible economy these individuals will be barred from entering the bankruptcy court because they do not meet the irs guidelines
this rule should be defeated because the american people are being stabbed in the back
mr speaker i rise in opposition to this rule and to this morally bankrupt bill that puts corporate greed over fairness for ordinary folks
make no mistake mr speaker this bill is a bigtime corporate payoff that was drafted with one overriding goal in mind that is profits profits profits
i am all for curbing abuses in bankruptcy and would suggest that we start by closing bankruptcy loopholes for millionaires and taking steps to address predatory lending and payday loans rather than a onesided harsh industry payoff
this bill should include real solutions to address the really hard problems fueling the financial difficulties so many in this nation are facing
mr speaker i rise in opposition to this rule
there is much that should be law in this bill but as written it should not pass
if this bill becomes law children will have to compete for the first time with credit card companies in state court for the limited assets of debtors emerging from the bankruptcy process
i support this and as a new yorker i am really concerned that these provisions go into effect to protect the financial sector in the event of another terrorist attack
but these positive aspects of the bill are outweighed by an unacceptable feature that the majority has refused to address the fact that the bill pits child support claimants against credit card companies in state court for the assets that the debtor has when she or he goes into bankruptcy
in other words kids will lose
i offered an amendment to address this but the committee on rules did not make it in order
the sponsors say that they take care of this but none of their steps address the new threat created by the bill to protect children from having to fight credit card companies in state court
mr speaker i request permission to place in the record in response to this statement statements by bar associations across this country women s organizations women s legal defense asserting what i have said that children are put second to credit card companies
the domestic support provisions in the bill may have been intended to protect the interests of mothers and children unfortunately they fail to do so
moving child support to first priority among unsecured creditors in chapter 7 sounds good but is virtually meaningless even today with no means test limiting access to chapter 7 fewer than four percent of chapter 7 debtors have anything to distribute to unsecured creditors
in chapter 13 the bill would require that larger payments be made to many commercial creditors as a result payments of pastdue child support would have to be made in smaller amounts and over a longer period of time increasing the risk that child support debts will not be paid in full
perpetrators of violence against patients and health care professionals at women s health clinics have engaged in concerted efforts to use the bankruptcy system to evade responsibility for their illegal actions
in this regard we have worked to end poverty improve welfare reform create affordable quality childcare and guarantee workplace protections for survivors of domestic violence
the bankruptcy system is another crucial safety net for women and legal momentum is concerned that the changes to the bankruptcy system proposed in s 256 would be harmful to the economic security of women and families
in addition the legislation fails to hold perpetrators of violence against workers and patients of women s health care clinics accountable for their actions
in 2001 women represented 39 of households filing for bankruptcy while men filing independently represented only 29
single mothers are the group most at risk for bankruptcy in the last 20 years bankruptcy filings for femaleheaded households have increased at more than double the rate of bankruptcies in other households
this legislation will make it more difficult even the child support provisions in the legislation will not help women and children
legal momentum is concerned that unlike in the conference report of last year s bankruptcy legislation s 256 does not include a provision to prevent perpetrators of clinic violence from declaring bankruptcy to avoid responsibility for their actions against patients and health care providers
we urge you to oppose hr 685 because it poses significant concerns for the economic selfsufficiency of all working people in the united states and will cause substantial financial inequities in the process
the issue of bankruptcy reform is of profound concern to lccr because as a general matter disadvantaged groups in our society disproportionately find themselves in bankruptcy courts as a result of economic discrimination in its many forms
for example divorced women are 300 percent more likely than single or married women to find themselves in bankruptcy court following the cumulative effects of lower wages reduced access to health insurance the devastating consequences of divorce and the disproportionate financial strain of rearing children alone since 1991 the number of older americans filing for bankruptcy has grown by more than 120 percent
this age group tends to file after being pushed out of jobs and encountering discrimination in hiring which could result in loss of health insurance or victimization by credit scams or home improvement frauds that put their homes and security at risk and african american and hispanic american homeowners are 500 percent more likely than white homeowners to find themselves in bankruptcy court largely due to discrimination in home mortgage lending and housing purchases and to inequalities in hiring opportunities wages and health insurance coverage
hr 685 proposes a number of changes in current bankruptcy law and supporters claim that enactment is thereby necessary to stop abuse of bankruptcy laws
in addition hundreds of thousands of women and children who are owed child support or alimony would be harmed under hr 685 as it forces them to compete with credit card issuers and therefore would make it less likely that support payments will be made to those in need
hr 685 also fails to address one of the key reasons that bankruptcy filings have increased in recent years a reason that is the willful doing of many of the financial institutions that are lobbying in support of the bill the aggressive marketing of credit cards to our most financially vulnerable citizens such as women students seniors and the working poor
according to a recent article in the washington post credit card companies continue to offer credit in record amounts in an aggressive campaign to saddle more americans with debts
yet these same companies have steadfastly resisted even the most modest reforms to help consumers avoid placing themselves in financial jeopardy in the first place such as requiring clearer disclosure about late payment fees interest rates and minimum payments
we strongly urge you to reject hr 685 because it would radically alter the bankruptcy system in a way that imposes hardships particularly on the most vulnerable among us
both the domestic creditor and the commercial credit card creditor could pursue the debtor and attempt to collect from postpetition assets but not in the bankruptcy court outside of the bankruptcy court is precisely the arena where sophisticated credit card companies have the greatest advantages
while federal bankruptcy court enforces a strict set of priority and payment rules generally seeking to provide equal treatment of creditors with similar legal rights state law collection is far more akin to survival of the fittest whichever creditor engages in the most aggressive tactic be it through repeated collection demands and letters cutting off access to future credit garnishment of wages or foreclose on assets is most likely to be repaid
it is useful to recall the context in which these provisions were added
in the 105th congress the bill s proponents adamantly denied that the bill created any problems with regard to alimony and child support
although the proponents have now changed course the child support and alimony provisions included do not respond to the provisions in the bill causing the problem namely the provisions limiting the ability of struggling single mothers to file for bankruptcy enhancing the bankruptcy and postbankruptcy status of credit card debt and making it more difficult for debtors march 11 2005
the bill s sponsors view this increase as a product of abuse of bankruptcy by people who would otherwise be in a position to pay their debts
some people do abuse the bankruptcy system but the overwhelming majority of people in bankruptcy are in financial distress as a result of job loss medical expense divorce or a combination of those causes
in our view the fundamental change over the last ten years has been the way that credit is marketed to consumers
credit card lenders have become more aggressive in marketing their products and a large very profitable market has emerged in subprime lending
test to assess an individual s ability to repay his debts and as a remedy to irresponsible consumerism and lax bankruptcy law while the stated concept is fine people who can repay their debts should do so the particular mechanism proposed is unnecessary overinclusive painfully inflexible and costly in both financial terms and judicial resources
existing section 707 b already allows a bankruptcy judge upon her own motion or the motion of the united states trustee to deny a debtor a discharge in chapter 7 to prevent a substantial abuse courts have not hesitated to deny discharges where chapter 7 was being used to preserve a welltodo lifestyle and the united states trustee s office has already taken it upon itself to object to discharge when in its view the debtor has the ability to repay a substantial portion of his or her debts
according to a study by the national center for educational statistics even in 1993 1500 would not have covered the average tuition for any category of parochial school except seventh day adventists and wisconsin synod lutherans
in order to yield a few dollars for credit card issuers this bill would force many struggling families to take their children from private or parochial school often in violation of deeply held religious beliefs for three to five years in order to confirm a chapter 13 plan
finally the bill takes direct aim at attorneys who handle consumer bankruptcy cases by making them liable for errors in the debtor s schedules
other provisions that will deny access to bankruptcy court the meanstest is not the only provision in the bill which is designed to limit access to the bankruptcy discharge
for example sections 306 and 309 of the bill working together would eliminate the ability of chapter 13 debtors to strip down liens on personal property in particular their car to the value of the collateral
this group of debtors would be deprived of any discharge whatsoever either in chapter 7 or chapter 13
in all cases this will reduce payments to unsecured creditors a group which ironically includes many of the sponsors of this legislation
the industry is plagued with consumer complaints about excessive fees pressure tactics nonexistent counseling and education promised results that never come about ruined credit ratings poor service in many cases being left in worse debt than before they initiated their debt management plan mandatory credit counseling would place vulnerable debtors at the mercy of an industry where according to a recent senate investigation many of the counselors are seeking to profit from the misfortune of their customers
the cumulative effect of these provisions and many others contained in the bill along with the meanstest will be to deprive the victims of disease job loss and divorce of much needed relief
the bill s proponents argue that it is good for consumers because it will reduce the socalled bankruptcy tax in their view the cost of credit card defaults is passed along to the rest of those who use credit cards in the form of higher interest rates
in alaska one in 1712 households files for bankruptcy
in utah the filing rate is one in 365
the states with the ten highest bankruptcy filing rates are in descending order utah tennessee georgia nevada indiana alabama arkansas ohio mississippi and idaho
the deepest hardship will be felt in the heartland where the filing rates are highest
while individuals over 55 make up only about 15 of the people filing for bankruptcy they are the fastest growing age group in bankruptcy
the bankruptcy filing rate reveals holes in the medicare and social security systems as seniors and aging members of the babyboom generation declare bankruptcy to deal with prescription drug bills copays medical supplies longterm care and job loss
in 2001 approximately 1 in 123 adults filed for bankruptcy
that same year 1 in 51 children was a dependent in a family that had filed for bankruptcy
the presence of children in a household increases the likelihood that the head of household will file for bankruptcy by 302

in bankruptcy st
where are the family values in this congress
mr speaker is it not customary as a normal matter of comity in this house to allow all material requested to be placed in the record
mr speaker in light of new information i withdraw the appeal
mr speaker in addition to those who get sick or lose their job this bill will also hurt small business entrepreneurs
they go into business and consider a riskbenefit ratio that includes the possibility of making a lot of money but also includes the possibility of losing everything and ending up in bankruptcy
they will be stripped down to essentials like food and rent for 5 years and that is average rent for the area not what they may have been living in
denying bankruptcy protection to people who need a fresh start will only increase the number of people in our community who feel they have nothing to lose
i rise in support of the rule for consideration of s 256 the bankruptcy abuse prevention and consumer protection act of 2005
as we now consider this rule and the legislation later today i believe it is particularly important to keep in mind bankruptcy reform s extensive deliberative history before the committee on rules the committee on the judiciary and both bodies of congress which i would like to briefly summarize
in the 105th congress 4 days were devoted to the committee on the judiciary s markup of bankruptcy reform legislation
in the 106th congress alone the committee on the judiciary entertained 59 amendments over the course of a 5day markup on bankruptcy reform legislation which included 29 recorded votes
in the 107th congress the committee on the judiciary considered 18 amendments during the course of its markup of bankruptcy reform legislation and the house thereafter considered five amendments
in the last congress the committee on the judiciary entertained nine amendments to the bill and five amendments were considered on the house floor
also in the last congress the committee on rules made two amendments in order in connection with a similar bill addressing bankruptcy reform which was considered on the floor
we have a committee report earlier in the 106th congress one from the 105th congress and then we have a committee report from the 105th congress on the house side
all of these are debates in the lt em gt lt em gt congressional record when this bill has come up and we have had conference reports filed amendments filed original bills filed
the time to pass it is now and that is why this rule is coming up in the way it is structured the way it is
mr speaker i rise in support of this rule for consideration of s 256 the bankruptcy abuse prevention and consumer protection act of 2005 s 256 consists of a comprehensive package of reform measures that will improve bankruptcy law and practice by restoring personal responsibility and integrity to the bankruptcy system
as we now consider this rule and the legislation later today i believe it is particularly important to keep in mind bankruptcy reform s extensive deliberative history before the rules committee the judiciary committee and both bodies of congress which i would like to briefly summarize for you
in the 105th congress 4 days were devoted to the judiciary committee s mark up of bankruptcy reform legislation
in the 106th congress alone the judiciary committee entertained 59 amendments over the course of a 5day markup of bankruptcy reform legislation which included 29 recorded votes
in the 107th congress the judiciary committee considered 18 amendments during the course of its markup of bankruptcy reform legislation and the house thereafter considered five amendments
in the last congress the judiciary committee entertained nine amendments to the bankruptcy legislation and 5 amendments were considered on the house floor
also in the last congress the rules committee made two amendments in order in connection with a similar bill addressing bankruptcy reform which was considered on the floor
for example conferees during the 106th congress spent nearly 7 months engaged in an informal conference to reconcile differences between the house and senate passed versions of bankruptcy reform legislation
in the 107th congress conferees formally met on three occasions and ultimately agreed after an 11month period of negotiations to a bipartisan conference report
this transcript goes on for 160 pages in the committee report which shows that everybody had an opportunity to speak their peace
now amending this bill is what the people who wish no bankruptcy reform have in mind because they know the other body has had difficulty in finding time to debate this bill and vote cloture
the gentlewoman from new york ms slaughter xz4003780 whom i greatly respect has voted against this bill every time it has come up when she has cast a vote in a rollcall
they have never supported it in the past
they offered a substitute which was voted on and debated in the house of representatives
i personally think that amendments protecting our men and women returning from military service in iraq and afghanistan would be a good idea and i feel very strongly that the amendment protecting the victims of identity theft from bankruptcy is an important measure that should be debated on the house floor
in fact just 2 days ago lexisnexis identified more than 300 000 americans that their personal information may have been stolen
in some cases it will take those people 6 years to get back their identity
but if my colleagues in the majority do not agree that protecting americans from identity theft is an important issue why will they not let the body debate it
that is the way things are supposed to happen here in a democracy
to be fair we have not debated this bill under open rules in the past but we have certainly debated them under rules that allowed amendments
this chart shows the number of amendments that the committee on rules made in order on this bill in every congress since the 105th and i insert in the record at this point a list of the rules
number of amendments made in order on bankruptcy bills 105th109th congress 105th congress h res 452 12 amendments made in order
106th congress h res 158 11 amendments made in order
107th congress h res 71 6 amendments made in order
108th congress h res 147 5 amendments made in order
109th congress h res 211 closed rule 0 amendments made in order
this chart shows a disturbing pattern mr speaker a pattern that has become common practice here in the house
in every congress republican leaders have allowed fewer and fewer amendments to be debated
we started at 12 amendments in the 105th congress and in the 109th congress we have a completely closed rule
zero amendments are in order
there is less and less democracy in this house and every congress fewer voices are being heard on the floor
the democrats on the committee on rules last month issued a report studying the disturbing trend toward less democracy and deliberation in this house
so mr speaker i say again we have disallowed the amendments that would have let us make this a better bill a bill that would protect more vulnerable people in this country including our soldiers who have returned from iraq most of those in the national guard and reserves many of whom are losing their houses because they were called back time and again and were to able to maintain their houses
mr speaker i rise in strenuous opposition to this unfair bill
mr speaker i rise in strong opposition to s 256
this bankruptcy bill is touted as reform but it is actually a wolf in sheep s clothing intended to allow credit card companies and other lenders to gouge consumers when they are most vulnerable
in fact 90 of all bankruptcies are filed due to the common financial emergency of a lost job or lack of medical coverage
the wall street journal recently featured the case of a constituent in my district
crystal herndon a single mom in haywood california earns 15 an hour
ms herndon got sick with pneumonia causing her to miss six weeks of work and rack up over 5 000 in medical bills
it s hard to see the abuse in real instances of need such as these especially when many americans live paycheck to paycheck
the bill requires the debtor in some cases to have to challenge big corporate lenders in court to prove they are eligible to seek relief under chapter 7 of the bankruptcy code
in addition this bill also allows creditors to threaten debtors with costly ligitation that will force many families to needlessly give up their legal rights
in their continuing compassion the republicans have crafted this socalled reform so that a parent seeking child support from a bankrupt spouse will have to fight it out with creditors in order to receive payment
finally mr speaker with all of the perks they ve awarded to the big credit card companies republicans have done nothing to ensure that they are held accountable for their role in this consumer crisis
there is nothing is this bill that stops the abusive predatory lending that lands too many americans in bankruptcy in the first place
the link between illness job loss and health insurance is a harsh reality in our country today
it is morally reprehensible to suggest that we exploit medical tragedies befalling honest hardworking americans in order to grant the wishes of the credit card companies
mr speaker i rise in strong opposition to this unfair undemocratic closed rule and to the underlying bankruptcy bill
this lopsided bill will make it harder for families and seniors with debt problems arising from high medical expenses job loss divorce or other financial hardships to address their problems while doing nothing to rein in the credit card companies whose practices have led to much of the rise in bankruptcies
s 256 presumes that bankruptcy filers are simply bankruptcy abusers looking to game the system and avoid paying their bills ignoring the clear evidence that the overwhelming majority of people in bankruptcy are in financial distress because of job loss medical expense divorce or a combination of these causes
when this bill was in the committee on the judiciary we had a pseudomarkup that lasted all day and was a complete embarrassment and a waste of time for all of the members for the republicans would not even consider one amendment no matter how meritorious or beneficial to the american people even if the amendment addressed issues not previously considered because of the republican leadership s insistence on reporting out a clean bill in order to avoid a conference committee
i rise in opposition to this rule
again in the committee on rules a number of amendments were offered to allow a debate on these issues but not a single one was made in order today
in certain cases my republican colleagues acknowledged the merits of the amendments but maintained it was simply not the time to address the issue
i am particularly disappointed that the very reasonable amendment offered by the gentleman from california mr schiff xz4003610 was not made in order
i am sure that most everyone at some time in their life has experienced the frustration of losing their wallet
those on the other side of the aisle say they sympathize with the issue and would like to address this matter at some point in the future but i ask why do we not do this now
what better place to talk about the rights of bankrupted identity theft victims than in the bankruptcy reform bill
just yesterday an article ran in the new york times about another security breach potentially leaking social security numbers driver s licenses and addresses of over 300 000 people
mr chairman the sheer weight of logic plus our considerable mutual charm i think has some hope in that direction
mr chairman i rise today in favor of this amendment
believe me a lot of work went into this in the midst of all of the other pressures of various other items that were before them
in every one of these bills particularly in this energy bill people have things to which they are deeply committed including my good friend the gentleman from arizona mr flake xz4001340 with respect to both the philosophy involved and what the consequences might be from any given item
now in the great scheme of things this might not seem like a lot to a lot of people but for those of us who understand what it is if we can actually grow our own renewable energy with sugarcane in the form of biomass can actually provide by being converted to ethanol
and this is something where we are getting support from the oil and gas companies in texas in louisiana
hawaii and florida can join in because we are growing sugarcane sugarcane can become ethanol ethanol can help reduce the dependency on oil and gas
we can grow our own energy in hawaii if we get the chance to do this
they are going to give us the chance and if this works i am in contact with people for example like at southern university in louisiana just speaking with them tonight with the idea that perhaps we can take the sugarcane industry and instead of always having to be in the position of having to defend ourselves against wage slavery around the rest of the world that we will be able to have good jobs good income in the united states of america and be growing our own energy
if the gentleman will yield i will be happy to bring in prickly pears
might i just say for the edification of my good friend the gentleman from arizona mr flake xz4001340 that when you take those two cans of coke that you are talking about just tell me whether the diet coke is cheaper than the other one that has sugar in it
i offer this amendment to hr 6 with the hope of reducing our nation s reliance on oil and advancing our efforts in hawaii to become more energy selfsufficient
my amendment authorizes a 3year demonstration program for the production of ethanol from sugar cane in hawaii
the state of hawaii has passed a law that goes into effect on april 1 2006 mandating a 10 percent ethanol blend for gasoline consumption in the state
oil refineries are building ethanol storage and blending facilities in anticipation of meeting the requirement
i urge my colleagues to allow floor debate on this demonstration project and rule this amendment in order
the bill would place the secretary of energy in charge of the permitting process the official record and the only environmental review document
putting doe in charge will create more bureaucracy not more refineries
epa s clean air act knowledge is an asset in expedited permitting not a liability because the doe is much more likely to issue permits that will be struck down in court
mr chairman i rise in support of the capps amendment
this is really about what are we really doing here in congress
in 1995 reformulated gas containing mtbe entered the marketplace in maine
two years later the maine bureau of health reported that they found mtbe in 7 percent of maine s public water supplies
one year later in 1998 it was found in 16 percent of maine s water supplies
in 1981 shell engineers were joking that mtbe stood for most things biodegrade easier or menace threatening our bountiful environment or major threat to better earnings
we have had a discussion here about what members of congress knew back in the 1990s
what we know now is that the industry knew in the early 1980s that this was a hazard to groundwater and they went ahead and put it in the gasoline anyway
the manufacturers or the taxpayers in all of our communities
well there is a court in manhattan yesterday new york federal district court refused to dismiss 80 lawsuits brought on the ground that the majority is trying to eliminate and the judge said innocent water providers and ultimately innocent water users should not be denied relief from the contamination of their water supply if defendants breached a duty to avoid an unreasonable risk of harm from their products
mr chairman i rise in support of my friend s amendment
when there is a decision being made to site a plant which if there were an accident could be catastrophic i think that the people who make the decision whether to build the plant or not should be politically accountable to the people who live in the place where the plant is going to be sited they should have visited the place where the plant is going to be sited and they should have some clue as to what the locality is of where the plant will be sited
for all those who believe in home rule vote yes on the castle amendment
mr chairman i would like to thank chairman hobson for his leadership in bringing this important legislation to the floor and i also thank him for his continued commitment to the yucca mountain project
one argument posed by opponents of this initiative is that interim storage would create a de facto permanent repository which undermines our national policy of disposing highlevel radioactive waste in a permanent deep geologic repository
the committee correctly notes prior to the mid1970 s the federal government encouraged the reprocessing of commercial spent fuel and even developed reprocessing facilities in several states including south carolina
mr speaker of all the things to come on the floor of the house of representatives and claim with a straight face that we should have a debate about claiming that what is in the bill with regards to the mtbe is an unfunded mandate is one of the biggest whoppers i can imagine with all due respect
we specifically authorize in the bill additional funding 50 million to avoid the creation of unfunded mandates
it is in the bill a specific allocation of 50 million to avoid the creation of unfunded mandates
the bill before us dedicates some of that balance specifically to go out and inspect existing underground storage tanks to enforce if those inspections find that there is a leak and to fund improvements in the operation of these underground storage tank programs
it is in the bill
if anything it is a specific allocation in the bill to enforce the program that we have to put additional funds into it and to make sure that we prevent the problem
that is telling the states you want to use mtbe in your gasoline supply to get cleaner air fine
the bill also has a provision in it that over the course of the next i think 10 years depending on some scientific studies and various things there could be a point in time that we have a federal ban on mtbe
people forget in the 1991 clean air amendments we required an oxygen amendment to make the gasoline burn cleaner in nonattainment areas
there was not a mandate to use mtbe but there was a requirement in nonattainment areas you had to do something in terms of putting more oxygen in the gasoline to make it burn cleaner
the gentlewoman mentioned two of them in lake tahoe one in california where there have been outofcourt settlements for several millions of dollars because of that odor
you can sue and win as has been shown but that does not mean that it in and of itself is defective
interestingly enough in one of the cases the gentlewoman from california quoted the amount of the settlement was less than the legal fees that the law firm representing the community in california claimed
mr speaker i want to rise in strong support of the rule
it is a good rule in spite of some of the comments that been made about it
i believe that the committee on rules has made in order about 30 of those
it may be a little bit fewer than that but a large number of amendments have been made in order including a substitute by the gentleman from michigan mr dingell xz4001100 the ranking member of the committee on energy and commerce
we accepted amendments on the floor on some of the more controversial areas in the bill
the bill before us has a firsttimeever guarantee that the states have the automatic right to go in and inspect these facilities for safety conditions
mr chairman i rise in strong support of hr 6 the energy policy act of 2005
the bill would provide leadership in energy conservation by establishing new mandatory efficiency requirements for federal buildings and expands the energy star program to tell american consumers what products save the most energy
it would for the first time give an expedited procedure hopefully in brownfield areas and highunemployment areas for expanding or building some new refineries
we have not built a new oil refinery in this country for the past 30 years
it is time for the house of representatives to say we want a strong economy based on the world s best and most open free market for energy supplies and also to put some incentives in for conservation
mr chairman as the gentleman well knows the gentleman from illinois mr shimkus xz4003730 offered an amendment in the committee that struck the participatory funding language from the conference report but at that time i assured the gentleman from georgia and the gentleman from mississippi and several other interested congressmen in the committee that when we go to conference with the senate we will work out language that is fair and balanced and protects the rights of the incumbent local utilities and also the independent power producers to find a fair and balanced way in which to build and maintain the transmission system for our great nation s electricity grid
if the gentleman will continue to yield there will be a provision in the conference report that comes back when we report the conference out
mr chairman i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from texas mr gene green one of nine democrats on the committee on energy and commerce who voted for this bill in committee
madam chairman i do not think it is a surprise that i rise in strong support of the barton manager s amendment since i am the barton who authored the amendment
but i just want to tell my good friend from massachusetts whom i just listened to extremely closely as he told his tale of woe about his amendment being accepted in committee and not accepted in the manager s amendment we found out as we went to implement it that there were some things we did not understand about his amendment
now i am sure the gentleman explained it clearly and concisely and i was probably listening to one of my staffers and probably just did not hear his explanation but it was actually retroactive in application
madam chairman had we accepted it and put it in the manager s amendment there would have been an immediate outcry to implement some standards that were not yet implementable because it would have been retroactive
that is the primary reason it is not in the manager s amendment
as we go to conference we will continue to work with the distinguished gentleman and we probably can find some way to get some part of it in in the conference
but that is the primary reason that particular amendment is not in the manager s amendment
madam chairman first i rise in opposition to the dingell substitute
i do want the record to show that i supported at the committee on rules that it be made in order so we could have a full debate
the dingell substitute if it were actually to be implemented into the bill and become law would go far beyond anything currently being considered in the electricity sector
the dingell substitute would take that to 5 million and in some cases 25 million
the bill before us does repeal the public utility holding company act but the bill before us keeps in order the reporting requirements under puhca so the sec would have the ability to maintain analysis of records and things like that of the companies that are subject to puhca
basically i would say that the dingell substitute is well intentioned but in some cases it goes too far and in some cases it is silent on the underlying bill
first let me simply say i understand the concern of the gentlewoman from california ms eshoo xz4001240 about the situation in the power markets in california 4 to 5 years ago and i know she feels more needs to be done
as we speak there is litigation in process to have more done in that area
he and i have been working toward a solution to the contamination problem in new hampshire and across the nation
committee staff and i stand ready to assist in every way and are fully committed to resolving the problem before the bill is presented to the president for enactment
madam chairman i will just say that we are in opposition to the dingell substitute and would urge a no vote at the appropriate time
had he sent it to me i would have had to reply in the negative that i could not make the contribution
but i recognize his right to do it in that manner
i oppose the markey amendment because i want to pay less for gasoline in texas
i would like to tell the members that my great state is selfsufficient in energy production and selfsufficient in oil but it is not true
if one wants to say it is a little it is less than we use in a year in this country
i would point out that in terms of the environment we have been producing successfully in prudhoe bay for almost 30 years without any harm to the environment as the gentleman from alaska chairman young showed in those pictures when he was up here right before me
and we are doing it in a safe and environmentally effective fashion
we could do that also in anwr
i want to thank our colleagues in the other body for already agreeing in the reconciliation instructions and i urge a no vote on the markey amendment
mr chairman i rise in opposition to this amendment
i could hardly get them to get in the car
but i did have one vehicle in my life that would have met the standard that is in this bill
i represent an assembly plant in arlington texas a uaw plant
if america wants more fuelefficient vehicles they are available in the marketplace today
mr chairman i rise in mild opposition to the johnson amendment
she has been very gracious to come up to me on the floor and then her staff and committee staff have been working and we really thought that earlier in the week or late last week we had an amendment that everybody could agree to
she states and i agree that the consumer has a right to know what the fuel economy is of that particular vehicle and under current law the way the tests are conducted there is some discrepancy as she has pointed out in her statement in support of her amendment
i voted in the negative on that and i think when that rollcall is called the majority of the house is going to be in the negative
we are going to oppose this amendment and support the gentleman from michigan s mr rogers xz4003421 amendment in the nature of a substitute or amendment to the johnson amendment
mr chairman parliamentary inquiry since the rogers amendment which is next in line amends or perfects the johnson amendment does the gentleman from michigan mr rogers xz4003421 have to seek recognition to offer his amendment before the close of debate on the gentlewoman from connecticut s mrs johnson xz4002051 amendment or does he wait until her debate concludes and then offers his amendment
mr chairman i claim the time in opposition
on the johnson amendment immediately prior i was in mild opposition
on this amendment i want to be recorded in strong opposition
most of the amendments before the body today there may be a paragraph a page most of them are amendments that were at least debated in one of the committees of jurisdiction
there are 50 pages of efficient standards in this amendment
what is not in this amendment is anything that would increase production anything that addresses clean coal technology i believe or hydrogen research or any of those things
it is certainly lengthily drafted but i can not conceive at this stage of the game after all of the hearings and the markup and the amendments we have already had in this congress and the debate that went on in the prior congress in the conference report that this house voted on two times that the house would accept this amendment
i would ask to engage in a dialogue with one of the authors of the amendment if they wish to do so
in the beginning he has some efficiency standards
the gentleman from new york may not understand it either because he may not have had much advance work in drafting this
he is saying the states can set a standard but once the standards in the bill kick in on january 1 2010 the federal standard preempts
while the gentleman is trying to get me an answer this is the kind of thing that if we had this in regular order in a markup there would be counsel at the desk and members of the committee of jurisdiction would ask the counsel to explain it and if it is a drafting error then that could be corrected
after that paragraph i just read then you go back and just out of the blue it says in determining whether to defer such acquisition the secretary shall use marketbased practices when deciding to acquire petroleum for the strategic petroleum reserve again i am going to assume that this was a cutandpaste effort and something got left out and that should be in another place
at this stage of the game to adopt this even as well intentioned as it is would not put the congress in the best light
he offered his amendment in committee
it is my understanding and i could be incorrect about this that michigan wishes to ban drilling in the great lakes and ohio perhaps does not
if i could reclaim my time the gentleman from michigan is a valued member of the committee and has several amendments that were accepted that are in the bill
i hope he is at least in a quandary about maybe voting for the bill at some point in time although he has not yet done so
mr chairman in summary i oppose this amendment
i think we have pointed out a number of flaws in it
mr chairman i rise to qualify in opposition
since the gentlewoman was born in texas it gave me another reason to say yes
but if for some reason we can not satisfy these safety concerns since i am probably going to be the chairman of the conference i would reserve the right to drop it in conference after consultation with the gentlewoman if we can not work out some of these concerns
and i would simply say that the gentleman from minnesota mr oberstar xz4002990 the ranking member on the committee on transportation and infrastructure has offered an amendment that would authorize 20 million for the administrator of general services administration to proceed with the sun wall design project and the majority is prepared to accept it and work with the gentleman from michigan mr dingell xz4001100 and the gentleman from minnesota mr oberstar xz4002990 to maintain it in conference with the senate
mr chairman i rise in opposition to the amendment and i yield myself such time as i may consume
we had a debate in the committee on energy and commerce on this amendment and i glanced at it and it appears to be the identical amendment
for purposes of reducing waste of oil and decreasing demand for foreign oil not later than 6 months after the date of enactment of this act appropriate federal departments and agencies identified by the president shall propose voluntary regulatory and other actions other actions sufficient to reduce the demand for oil in the united states by at least 1 million barrels per day from projected demand for oil in 2013 now let us go through that
i guess when i hop in my pickup truck to go to the store to get some milk then i am wasting gasoline
but the gentleman from california goes on to say in subsection b if the president determines that the departments and agencies lack the authority or funding to implement the actions proposed in the section i just read then the president should come to the congress and request the necessary authority now here we have an economy that in the last year in the united states demand for energy has gone up not down
the price of gasoline in nominal dollars has doubled in the last year
we are only producing around 7 or 8 million barrels a day domestically but somehow just by having a group hug in the federal agencies we are going to find a way to reduce demand by 1 million barrels
mr chairman i support the amendment and i strongly encourage the majority to support it and we will work with the gentleman in conference to maintain it if he will promise to work with his hawaiian senators to get them to do that also
i am in support of the abercrombie amendment and hope that the house accepts it
we accepted amendments in the committee for animal methane livestock methane
mr chairman i rise in respectful opposition
i think the underlying bill which has an authorization to increase the crude strategic petroleum reserve and build it out to a billion barrels and also try to build some new refineries in this country if we take those two things together we will have the same effect as the gentlewoman s intent which is to create the ability if we ever need the spr to move the large amounts more quickly and to refine them more quickly and thus disrupt the american economy as little as possible
mr chairman i rise in support of the conaway amendment
it is a study to ask the department of energy and the department of labor to see what the supply of labor is in the oil field industry both in the short term and the long term
there is a big natural gas plague going on in texas right now
mr chairman i rise in opposition to the amendment
mr chairman we have not built a new refinery in the united states since 1976
you have to have an existing refinery site or a manufacturing site that is no longer in use and you have to have very high unemployment
we are not mandating that anybody has to seek one of these but i think it would be a positive to build 5 6 7 million barrels of new refinery capacity in this country using stateoftheart technology so that we can meet 100 percent of our refined product needs take some load off the existing refinery base and yes create some jobs in america
i was at the white house earlier this week and was briefing the president on the energy bill that came out of the various committees and when i mentioned this particular element which i consider to be an important element of the bill something that we did not have in last year s bill his initial offthecuff reaction was a it was very good and b could we add abandoned military bases
obviously it is not in order to change the amendment on the floor but when we go to conference if the president decides that the official position of the white house is to support the amendment plus add abandoned military bases we will have a debate in the conference and hopefully add that
we need it in this country
let us vote for jobs in america
mr chairman i rise in opposition to the amendment
uranium mining is necessary for the production of enriched uranium that is necessary to create nuclear fuel used in nuclear power plants
with respect to the gentleman from new mexico s mr udall xz4004131 specific concerns for uranium mining issues in his home state i would like to point out the provision specifically excludes new mexico from receiving any funding under this provision
but the part that i want to read into the record is and i have great respect for the congressional research service but it very plainly states in section c of section 631 and i am going to read this verbatim limitation
no activities funded under this section may be carried out in the state of new mexico that is the plain language of the section no activities funded under this section may be carried out in the state of new mexico now the gentleman from new mexico has every right to offer an amendment to strip the section if he has some concerns generically about its impact nationally but if he has any concern about this program being used in his home state it is not going to happen because it very clearly states in this amendment this section c of the section 631 it can not happen
would i put something in there or approve something or is there some secret language some code word that the gentleman and i either one do not know
no activities funded under this section may be carried out in the state of new mexico boom
now i am not saying the congressional research service did not tell the gentleman what he read in the record
mr chairman i claim the time in opposition although i am actually supportive of the amendment but i had to apparently say i was opposed to get the time and i yield myself such time as i may consume
the gentleman from arizona mr shadegg xz4003680 offered a similar amendment in markup that was adopted
mr chairman if the gentlewoman will yield it is in texas
mr chairman there are so many ways to oppose this particular amendment that i am at a little bit of a loss as to which way to start in opposition but i think i will start first on the procedural opposition
that was defeated overwhelmingly in the neighborhood of 231188 or something like that
secondly i want to talk about the concept that is embodied in the capps amendment that somehow this is an unfunded mandate
what she is seeking to strike is a provision in the underlying bill which was in the bill last year that says you can not de facto go in and in an existing lawsuit state that mtbe because it is mtbe or also ethanol is defective because of its chemical composition
in fact several years ago in the medical malpractice legislation where we capped damages capped awards cbo said that is not an unfunded mandate
but this year the cbo analysts in question looked at it and said while the evidence was difficult to ascertain it could be construed as an unfunded mandate
any particular court and any particular jury may find in this case or that case and we are not precluding that but to somehow say that now because if the safe harbor provision were to become law that you would actually have to prove mtbe was defective that somehow that is an unfunded mandate to me is just beyond the pale
in a new jersey case a court ruled that mtbe was an oxygenate that congress contemplated would be used frequently
we have the second line that this is not an unfunded mandate because we are not precluding what states can or can not do in the future
and lastly on the item of whether mtbe is defective as a product just because it is mtbe it has clearly been ruled in several cases and common sense would dictate that something that is made properly and used properly and actually cleans up the air there is no way that can be a defective product
i am giving members three lines of reasoning to vote against the capps amendment and i would hope that when the vote comes that we keep the language in the bill and we are able to go to conference with the senate and continue to work to find a compromise if we need to do more to expedite the cleanup in those states that have mtbe contamination
the second point i want to make is i am not going to disparage what the gentleman from california mr waxman xz4004250 just said but when we were debating these amendments back in the early 1990s we had numerous instances where he went on record saying that mbte was something that should be included as an oxygenate
he even offered an amendment in committee to increase the oxygenate requirement to 3 percent
i quote from the gentleman from california mr waxman xz4004250 this level of oxygenation required in the clean air act amendments is high enough to achieve most of the benefits of oxygenated fuels but low enough to allow several different oxygenates to compete for market share
mr chairman i ask unanimous consent to speak out of order and engage in a colloquy with the chairman of the committee on agriculture
i give the gentleman my assurances i will work with him on language that reflects the commodity futures trading corporation s jurisdiction in its vital role in market transparency
mr chairman i ask unanimous consent to speak out of order to engage in a colloquy with the gentlewoman from ohio ms pryce xz4003270
the gentlewoman is correct for the third time in a row
i would encourage my friend from washington as he once again gets another amendment in the bill to consider voting for final passage
he is going to have more stuff in the bill than i am
so at some point in time the weight of the evidence is that he should be supportive of the bill
mr chairman i rise in opposition to the amendment
the amendment does not codify existing powers in the federal government
the current environmental justice programs are in no danger of being repealed
the subject of the amendment executive order 12898 is already in effect and requires each federal agency to make achieving environmental justice part of its mission by identifying and addressing disproportionately high and adverse human health or environmental affects of its programs policies and activities on minority populations and lowincome populations
in my opinion this amendment is a step backward in allowing minority and lowincome communities the opportunity for individual choice and economic freedom in creating jobs and encouraging development in these lowincome areas that are in such desperate need of revitalization and economic growth
epa already has several offices that have responsibility for overseeing and instituting environmental justice programs including two specific ones the office of environmental justice and a national advisory committee that gives national focus to environmental justice concerns in all environmental protection programs at the epa
mr chairman i rise in opposition to the amendment
mr chairman i rise in opposition to the castlemarkey amendment and i wanted this behind me
so this is a sacred day in aggie history and that is the only thing i object to
admittedly it is a big boat and it looks threatening i will grant that but we already have existing provisions in law to make sure that these terminals that are already in existence are as safe it is possible to be
this particular section of the bill that is before us simply says that we are going to need more lng facilities which is shorthand for liquefied natural gas and we have tried to craft in the guarantee that the state has a stronger role not a weaker role
what this provision does is if a state agency has not made a decision has refused to make a decision and one of the parties goes into the district court here in washington dc and asks that a decision be made that will expedite the decisionmaking process
for the first time if this provision of the bill were to become law we would give the states a guarantee to actually go in and inspect these facilities under federal law not under state law but under federal law
i have told the gentleman from delaware and i will tell the gentleman from massachusetts if we defeat this amendment and we go to conference with the existing language and we need to in some way strengthen the states rights end of this provision i am going to be for that
that is why we have the increased state guarantee in the bill because i insisted upon it but we can not stick our heads in the sand and say we do not need more lng facilities
we have about 30 pending permits for lng facilities right now under consideration and what this language does in the bill is give an expedited provision that the federal energy regulatory commission is the lead agency to expedite the federal part of it
so i would respectfully ask for a no vote on the castlemarkey amendment and then what we need to work on in the conference we will work on
madam chairman i rise in opposition to the amendment offered by the gentleman from michigan mr dingell xz4001100
it frankly goes far beyond anything being considered currently in the electricity debate particularly with respect to utility security ferc ratemaking authority reporting requirements and industry accounting
in addition this amendment would fundamentally rewrite portions of the natural gas act something that is clearly outside the scope of this debate
it does not repeal puhca which facilitates the construction of new construction and promotes badly needed investment in the electric utility industry
it does not provide ferc the flexibility needed to regulate markets that develop in the future by issuing prescriptive rules procedures and penalties
madam chairman i hope that the congress will join me and other likeminded colleagues in opposing this amendment
i appreciate all his efforts and the faith he has placed in me on this issue which is so critical to new hampshire a state that has been affected significantly and obviously other affected states
however i am not satisfied that what we have agreed upon in principle is sufficient to the problem or comprehensive enough to have my support and i would rather not rush it simply for the sake of being done today
does the gentleman agree that spending additional time will result in an improved product that will provide a mechanism to ensure that our drinking water is clean and safe today and into the future
does the gentleman also agree that the principles we have established so far including a fair funding system strict cleanup standard and an appropriate amount of time for contamination discovery will be safeguarded in the final product unless equivalent mechanisms can be developed
as one who served on the committee on the budget and was here in 1995 i would suggest that this would be classified if one is an accountant as a contingent unfunded liability or a hypothetical unfunded liability
but it will not be that way in the end because there are two choices that we face here today an easy choice which is to vote yes and to have the status quo and to go forward as we have in the past or the hard vote is to really solve the problem
i have established it with the chairman a task force that is going to work between now and conference time on a plan that will structure a remediation program that will clean up the water not 10 years from now or 20 years from now not unfairly in this community and not in that community and not in this state or that state but across the whole country
my constituents deserve a workout for this problem and we as policymakers have an obligation to work together in a bipartisan fashion in our conference to come up with a solution
it is my hope that this solution will include the creation of a fund that will include participation by all the potentially responsible parties a way to settle claims in a quick and fair fashion that reduces the overall cost
i do not want to see communities like south tahoe city suing their own lawyers to try to get the money back so that they can actually perform the remediation that they had planned to do and might have been able to do if it had been settled in such a fashion so that they did not have to deal with other costs
madam speaker i thank the gentlewoman and commend her for organizing this hour that we can talk about this energy bill but we all hope we not only hope can pass on this floor but can actually in this congress become law because we have waited too long
anwr has been an issue in this congress and much of the united states for years and years and years
when i got elected to congress in 2002 anwr was very much on my mind because one of the first issues we talked about was an energy bill
i had an opportunity to go up and see that much talked about much described very valuable piece of real estate in august of 2003 with a few of my congressional colleagues
i have in front of me tonight a map that puts alaska in relative size to the lower 48 states in proper perspective
anwr is in this region
louis airport that most of us and many americans have landed in
i have also heard that in relative size it is about like dulles which we are all very familiar with back here in the washington dc area
this map very quickly puts in perspective one other key thing the amount of oil represented by 1 million barrels per day coming from that one small piece of real estate and that is a conservative estimate of the amount of oil that can be generated from this anwr reserve over 1 million barrels a day
several other energy sources are addressed in this bill wind power which i certainly embrace coming from colorado
we produce a little wind power ourselves but so do our friends from rhode island and connecticut represented in gray by about 37 million acres dedicated to wind energy
in red down at lake okeechobee where they utilize solar as we do also in colorado but some 448 000 acres are dedicated to solar energy generation to again apply the energy to 1 million barrels from anwr in one day
or in green again the coastal plain or in black the acreage as i mentioned from the lambert airport
ethanol is in yellow
ethanol is also of interest to the eastern plains especially in colorado where we grow a whole lot of corn
but you see the massive amount of land acreage 805 million acres that would have to be dedicated to growing corn to produce as much ethanol as we get from a million barrels of oil a day in alaska
we ought to remember that there are precious few people who actually live in that very difficult very hostile environment in the world anwr which is literally on the coast of the arctic ocean
if i can put this map back up i will put it in proper perspective
we actually flew over in a very small plane landed on a gravel runway and visited these people in kaktovik about 270 of them actually manage to survive in that very very difficult environment
they go out when the arctic ocean opens up a little bit and get in the open water and they are allowed to get three whale a year
if anybody is interested in maintaining that environment unchanged it is them
it is covered with caribou and a little bit of short grass as i saw it in august when i was there
and actually the caribou from 1972 to current days in about a 30year window have increased not decreased
the experts the scientists tell us that if we would develop anwr and frankly had we gone ahead and done it in 1995 when congress actually approved it and president clinton vetoed the bill today we would be bringing over a million barrels a day to the lower 48 from anwr
now what do the people in anwr think
and the president looked at us and he said you are missing something here and we all leaned forward in eager anticipation
mr speaker i rise in opposition to this rule and the underlying bill because despite republican claims this energy bill really does not help american families with the cost of power or the skyrocketing gas prices
in the committee on rules my colleague the gentleman from nevada mr porter xz4003240 and i offered a simple amendment that would have included yucca mountain in the nuclear site threat assessment study already a part of the energy bill
regardless of how any of us feels about yucca mountain the federal government has a duty to assess the risks not just to protect nevada and our neighbors in the west but for the wellbeing of our nation
unfortunately the committee on rules did not put that amendment in order
i urge my colleagues to oppose this very backward very foolish very good piece of legislation if you are in the energy business
i rise in support of this amendment which would strike the provision in the bill to expand the number of assistant secretaries at the department of energy one of which being an assistant secretary for improved management of nuclear energy issues
circuit court of appeals the second highest court in the land struck down the epa s radiation standards which they said were inadequate for a mere 290 000 years
creating yet another layer of bureaucracy is not the answer to this nation s energy problem and certainly the department of energy has done nothing nothing in its history to warrant additional funding and additional support
mr chairman i feel like the skunk at the office party but i rise to oppose the funding for the yucca mountain project contained in this bill
yet there is 15 percent more funding for yucca mountain than there was in last year s bill despite the fact that this project is unsafe and riddled with problems and in my estimation can and never will be built
water infiltration and climate are two of the most fundamental factors involved in establishing whether or not the proposed repository can safely isolate radioactive waste and prevent groundwater contamination
in all my years fighting this project i knew yucca mountain was not scientifically sound but i never dreamed and never thought that federal employees would purposely falsify documents to cover up the lack of basic science
in 90 pages of emails the usgs employees fabricated dates and names of programs used in modeling for quality assurance audits and deleted information that did not fit favorable and hopedfor conclusions
in the end i keep track of two sets of files the ones that will keep the qa happy and the ones that were actually used another email says like you said all along the yucca mountain project has now reached a point where they need to have certain items work no matter what and the infiltration maps are on that list
we should be pouring our resources into renewable energy harnessing the sun harnessing the moon not sticking our valuable resources into a hole in the nevada desert
if my colleagues think that nuclear waste is so safe let them keep it in their own states let them keep it in their districts by their children by their children s schools by homes and hospitals synagogues and churches and do not travel across this country in order to stick it in a hole in the middle of the nevada desert
in closing i express my appreciation for the leadership of the committee on science and my colleagues on the committee for their contributions to the development of the provisions in the r amp d title of hr 6
they are bipartisan forward thinking balanced and speak to the importance that we as a congress place on the role of technology in our energy future
i would also express my appreciation for the extremely professional staff of all the relevant committees as well as the key leadership staff who worked diligently on this bill for months and in some cases years
their contributions and those of countless others have resulted in a better bill which i urge my colleagues to support
mr chairman i rise to claim the time in opposition to the daviswaxman amendment
mr chairman the chair did not ask him if he rose in opposition
i rise in opposition to this amendment which strikes from the bill a section that makes two simple but important organizational changes at the department of energy
the director of the office of science already is an assistant secretary in all but title
the second provision contained in section 978 b creates an additional assistant secretary at the department and expresses the sense of congress that the leadership for departmental missions in nuclear energy should be at the assistant secretary level
mr chairman i note that the gentleman from ohio included in the committee report a provision directing the secretary of energy to begin moving commercial spent nuclear fuel into interim storage at one or more department of energy sites
we have an opportunity within our reach to make a real advancement in energy policy but we are about to do the unimaginable pass an energy bill that will do nothing to lower gas prices
in fact according to the department of energy this bill may actually increase future gas prices
when we have done this in the past the price of oil has dropped anywhere from 6 to 11 per barrel
the united states should be the global leader in the development of new and innovative technologies
our amendment will create a 5 billion emergingtechnology trust fund funding the technologies of the future rather than the further counterproductive subsidies to the oil and gas industries provided for in the underlying bill
the bishopmarkeymcdermott amendment would also offer grants to states that meet new standards for efficiency in new building development
in short we offer tax cuts and credits that america will embrace and at the same time create a cleaner and healthier environment for our children
mr chairman let us give americans in the northeast and on the west coast something to cheer about
it is in fact a drafting error
mr chairman i guess what i would say in response is that i understand the questions that the gentleman from texas is raising and i understand i guess the consternation that he has with respect to receiving such a lengthy amendment with little notice
mr chairman i rise to express my support of the amendment offered by mr castle to strike the liquefied natural gas lng siting provision in hr 6
the language included in hr 6 silences the voices of state governments local municipalities and environmental advocacy organizations during the lng terminal site selection process
mr chairman the language in hr 6 solidifying ferc s exclusive role in the siting of lng terminals is entirely unnecessary
until recently only one lng importation terminal existed in the country
there are now five in operation and 6 more have already been approved by federal regulators
the process for selecting sites and approving lng importation terminals is working and in no way requires removing partialauthority from states
furthermore when i cast my vote in support of mr castle s amendment to preserve states rights and strike this language from hr 6 i know that i will also be speaking for many others residing in my district and across the nation
a quartermile long floating lng importation terminal has been proposed in the long island sound between connecticut and long island
lawmakers and civic organizations at every level of government in my congressional district have expressed their opposition to this proposal and are furious at the prospect that their voices will be silenced during the ferc approval process
mr speaker i certainly believe it is one that bridges the needs that we have today with where we need to be in the future as we look to renewable energy sources and alternative sources
we saw it in committee and i would commend the gentleman from texas chairman barton for the wonderful work he did on the bill in committee
we have an economy that has created nearly 2 million jobs in the past couple of years 3 million jobs in the past couple of years
we know that this bill is going to do good work in continuing to support main street support our small business community support our small business manufacturers and will address some of the concerns they have about energy policy oil policy electrical policy and how it affects the business that they carry forth every day
madam speaker what a day we have had here in the house
our energy committee last week we talked about it earlier in the week and we talked about it the past week
we had about a third of the democrats in the house join us in voting that bill out of committee last week
and they did it because it is time for us to have an energy bill and it is the right step in the right way at this point in time
i know that we have some across the aisle many who are going to follow the liberal leadership there and walk in lockstep with the gentlewoman from california ms pelosi xz4003140 but i think we are going to see more of the house democrats join us to make this energy bill a reality for the american people
this wonderful free enterprise system that we have in this great nation of ours has created nearly 3 million jobs in the past 2 years and we need to continue that
i thank the gentleman from nebraska and at this point i yield to the gentleman from colorado mr beauprez xz4000200 who has been a leader on the energy issue has done a wonderful job for his constituents in the state of colorado and is going to talk with us for a few minutes about anwr and the implications of anwr
i think it is so important for us to keep this in perspective
we are talking about 2 000 acres when we talk about anwr and it is in many hundreds of thousands of acres
we have not had a new refinery built in the country in 30 years madam speaker
obviously there are some in this body who would like for us to flip a switch and tomorrow start driving hydrogen fuel cell cars and to start doing things we would all love to see happen to look at more alternative sources
in 2002 the committee spent 21 hours marking up an energy bill and considering 79 amendments
in 2003 there were 22 hours and 80 amendments
in 3 years the republicans in the house have held 80 public hearings with 12 committee markups and 279 amendments
one of the things that we have all learned so well in our public service is if you want less of something pile on the taxes pile on the regulation because you are going to get less of it
i appreciate the leadership that the gentleman shows in the committee on the budget and in the republican study committee as we work to lower taxes and spending and address appropriate regulation
madam speaker i yield to the gentleman from texas mr gohmert xz4006510 who is going to talk with us about the economic issues that affect his district in texas
the estimate is that 500 000 new jobs will be created over the next year by the changes made in the energy policy for this nation
as we continue with our debate as we were saying earlier we will be looking at electricity and we are going to have some provisions in this bill that the federal government is going to lead on energy conservation issues
those will be addressed in the bill also
this bill is virtually identical to dick cheney s energy task force and where the house has been these last 4 years with concerns notwithstanding the enron scandal skyrocketing gasoline prices and demands on scarce oil supplies in unstable parts of the world
for the sake of the country one hopes that there will come a time when the needs and wishes of the public is heard and it will be reflected in an energy policy for this century costeffective and rational preserving the quality of life rather than operating on the cheap
this is one thing that will be able to help us move forward to actually take advantage of proven technology and something that is a very positive development in each and every community across the country
it is the most efficient form of urban transportation in history
this assembly just last month has approved in our transportation legislation almost 1 billion in safe routes to schools
this amendment will leverage these investments to help people take advantage of energy conservation choices they have in getting around their community
first the amendment would establish a conserve by bicycling pilot program in the department of transportation oversee up to 10 geographically dispersed pilot projects across the country designed to conserve energy resources providing education and marketing tools to convert car trips to bike trips
in addition the projects would encourage partnerships between stakeholders from transportation law enforcement education public health environment and energy fields
the project results in energy savings must be documented and the secretary of transportation is instructed to report to congress the results of the pilot program within 2 years of implementation
in recent years there have been significant upgrades to bicycling environments in the communities across the country
the conserve by bike program is a critical step in the right direction
what he said is true there are over 100 million bicycles in this country
we have seen in community after community when there have been opportunities people bike
in my home town of portland oregon we have tripled the number of people who are commuting by bicycle
and when you take thousands of people off the road it makes a difference in air quality
it makes a difference in congestion and it makes a difference in terms of people s health
this is a small step in the right direction
i urge its adoption and i look forward to greater application in the future
mr chairman i appreciate the gentleman s courtesy in yielding me this time and permitting me to speak on this and for his bringing this forward
it is an example of where we can take steps forward to deal with how we put the pieces together in terms of transportation
intelligent transportation has tremendous potential for energy savings to put money back in the pockets of taxpayers and consumers around the country and it is an example that we do not have to make this equation quite as hard as we tend to on the floor of the house
i appreciate the gentleman s leadership in focusing on the notion of the 800 billion that is spent dealing with energy in this country
that is 800 billion yet the amount of money that is spent in research for government and for the private sector is arguably less than 1 percent less than for any other major sector of our economy
i appreciate my colleague s leadership in focusing on what impact research and technology can have in this critical area
by focusing on intelligent transportation it will be one important area of research application that will make a difference for millions of americans it will save hundreds of millions of gallons of fuel and it will improve the quality of life for our communities in the offing
the procedural vote that we had yesterday was without the focus from the cbo that this is in fact an unfunded mandate
the ever growing concerns about energy reliability the enron scandal skyrocketing gas prices increasing demands on ever scarce supplies in unstable areas of the world all have not produced a change in the mindset of congress
congress can not keep up with the american public or the policymakers in china japan or europe
the public supports investing in renewable energy sources but this bill is heavily skewed towards more public subsidy of oil and gas interests already awash in cash
these companies have ample money available to exploit energy resources in this country if they wish
alternative energy sources are shortchanged in this bill
it has been estimated that they get one dollar for every 363 invested in other sources
the public is not interested in cutting deals with specialinterests at the expense of the environment and public health
i am opposed to a provision in the bill that shortchanges public participation in the hydropower relicensing process
by denying rights to private landowners farmers local businesses tribes fishermen conservationists and others who share a direct interest in dam operations the bill would make it less likely that license applicants would agree to an outcome that allows for energy generation as well as protection of the river ecosystem
in oregon pacificorp is in the process of relicensing a number of dams on the klamath river
the company has been involved in an open and cooperative process with stakeholders and i am concerned that the language in the bill would both undermine that progress as well as reduce incentives for other companies to engage in this type of open process
i am disappointed that congress defeated a number of democratic amendments that would have boosted fuel efficiency removed language allowing drilling the arctic national wildlife refuge kept in place important consumer protections and reduced our dependence on foreign oil
this amendment authorizes pilot programs and a national study that will help us better understand the benefits of converting trips from cars to bikes and how to educate people about these benefits in short this bill looks at our energy problem through a rearview mirror it gives too much to the wrong people to do the wrong thing and is dramatically out of step with what the american public needs and wants
one can only hope that as it works its way through the senate and as the public discovers what s in this bill that some of the more unfortunate provisions will be eliminated or modified
there will come a time in the foreseeable future when the needs of our country and the wishes of the public are heard and that will be reflected in an energy policy for this century that is cost effective and rational
mr chairman i thank the gentleman from texas for yielding me this time to speak in favor of this bill and i thank him for his great leadership to bring this bill to the floor
they did the hard work they did in the markup
we have tried to limit the numbers of those fuels in this bill and even asked the epa to look to the future and see what that right number is
the house of representatives has passed energy legislation four times only to have the bills die in the senate because of partisan politicking
i want to thank chairman joe barton for working with me to include a provision in this bill to curb the production of boutique fuel blends and address this issue headon
the current gasoline supply includes specially formulated boutique fuels which are required by law in certain communities
for example missourians can fill their gas tanks up in springfield and drive 3 hours to st
louis ever runs short on their boutique fuel gas stations there ca nt sell what consumers could buy back in springfield
by including this proposal in the energy bill the house is moving the country one step closer to lowering the skyhigh price of gas for consumers
mr chairman with great regret but with even greater conviction i rise in opposition to this bill
it gives terrorists additional targets and puts money in their hands
we would start every day 500 millionplus in the hole on our balance of trade because of the imported oil
in short our oil dependence represents a significant and growing threat to our national security and national security should be first and foremost in the minds and hearts of everyone in this chamber
my cafe amendment would reduce oil consumption in 2020 by 2 million barrels a day
that is more than twice the amount that is expected per day from drilling in the arctic national wildlife refuge
this bill provides just 6 percent to alternatives while providing more than a billion dollars in additional tax breaks
but instead we have decided to close our minds and open our purse in a way that will harm taxpayers and consumers and weaken our economic health and national security
third this amendment would cut would cut us consumption by 2 million barrels a day by 2020 more of a savings than any other single source in the bill
finally support this commonsense sciencebased amendment that will help the nation while leaving more money in consumer s pockets theirs not ours
mr chairman i rise in opposition to the amendment
as i understand it the concern about the bill is that it would create a new senateconfirmed position in the department but the director of the office of science is already treated like an assistant secretary in all but name
he or at points in the past she is senateconfirmed
in fact everything about the director slot is identical to being an assistant secretary except the name and in protocoldriven washington and in capitals abroad that can create confusion and be a problem
i am especially pleased at its focus on renewable energy and i thank chairman barton for including my renewable energy production incentive repi legislation in the bill
in addition to repi hr 6 also helps homeowners across the nation through its weatherization assistance program and makes an important commitment to hydrogen fuel research including my public transit provision to spur the development of hydrogen vehicles and infrastructure
we can take important steps in not only creating a greater sense of independence and lowering the costs at the pump but also help our own economy and the small independent producers who are struggling today
it is critical for our nation to have a national strategy on energy so we can clear many of these hurdles looming in our future
this bill takes our country in the right direction
i have supported the passage of comprehensive energy legislation for the last two congresses and i rise in support of the measure that is before the house this afternoon
while i do not support all of the sections of the bill there are a number of provisions in the energy measure that i believe will enhance our nation s energy policy and energy security
for example the legislation makes valuable improvements in the area of energy efficiency and renewable energy and would make permanent the northeast home heating oil reserve
the electricity title in the energy bill contains some beneficial provisions and i particularly want to call attention to the smart metering title which i proposed 2 years ago in order to accelerate the deployment of realtime metering
i am pleased that during the last congress we were able to reach a compromise which is also reflected in the bill before us today regarding the application of section 210 of purpa and the legislation contains the noncontroversial and muchneeded section that would make transmission reliability standards mandatory
i also remain concerned about the total repeal of the public utilities holding company act without ensuring that adequate consumer protections remain in place
he was willing to work in a bipartisan fashion in order to establish consensus on a number of these measures
i applaud him for that willingness and for the effective work that he has done in bringing this measure to the floor
madam chairman i thank the gentleman from michigan mr dingell xz4001100 for yielding me this time and i want to commend the gentleman for bringing this very important substitute for the electricity title in the bill before the house this afternoon
i strongly support the substitute for the electricity provisions in the bill put forward by the gentleman from michigan mr dingell xz4001100
the dingell amendment would improve current law in a number of ways
it would enhance the ferc s ability to deter and punish parties that engage in fraudulent activities that harm consumers
it would increase civil and criminal penalties under the federal power act modeled on the penalties established in the sarbanesoxley law
the dingell substitute would modernize our laws to give the ferc the necessary tools to prevent and if necessary punish the entities that engage in fraudulent conduct
in addition to the strong consumer protection and antifraud provisions the dingell amendment also retains the less controversial and very useful parts of the electricity title including the muchneeded reliability provisions for transmission lines the net metering and smart metering provisions and ferc lite to name other provisions
the dingell substitute would be a positive addition to the federal law ensuring that wholesale electricity markets operate in an efficient and equitable manner
mr chairman i rise today in opposition to the markey amendment
worldwide demand for petroleum has increased in the last decade
the reality is it takes a long time to go from the oil field to the gasoline station and we have lost considerable time in this regard
ten years ago 1995 104th congress hr 2491 would have allowed oil exploration in the anwr
any caribou unlucky enough to calve in this region would likely die from exsanguination at the hands of the mosquitoes there
the people in anwr are counting on this congress to do the right thing and allow them the rightful owners of these mineral rights to begin developing the sources that were granted to them upon statehood in 1959
mr chairman i stand today in opposition for raising the cafe standards
this is an irrelevant piece of legislation that is not only unnecessary it is an outdated solution in search of a 21st century problem
and in fact the only thing we get with cafe standards down in my district are car dealers with acres and acres of tiny cars they can not sell
mr chairman in the interest of full disclosure i drive a hybrid vehicle
i did not buy it because of any legislation that we passed in this congress
i bought it largely because of air quality concerns back in my district
mr chairman i rise this morning in opposition to the udall amendment
today nuclear power provides 20 percent of power in the united states
we are at a point in our nation s history where we can not afford to turn our back on any reasonable power source to meet our nation s energy needs
mr chairman i rise in opposition to the capps amendment
during our committee hearing on february 16 2005 we had a lively and substantial debate on the mtbe limited defective product liability waiver contained in the energy bill
later in the hearing i asked mr olson if there is any conclusive evidence that proves that mtbe causes cancer in humans
that is because there is no evidence that mtbe does cause cancer in humans
in fact in the us department of health and human services 2002 report to congress hhs found that there is not sufficient evidence to list mtbe as a carcinogen
regardless we do not want mtbe in our drinking water
that is why the energy bill bans its use in gasoline
that is why there are provisions in the bill that will send more leaking underground storage tank trust fund money to help cleanup orphaned and abandoned sites
in conclusion i oppose the capps amendment
i would just say in america we face some great challenges with regard to formulation of our energy policy
china consumes 7 million barrels per day and if china s rise in world prominence is similar to that of korea and japan china will consume 20 million barrels per day in less than 10 years
the last big oil discovery was 30 years ago in the north sea
china is trying to buy oil companies in canada india is trying to buy oil companies in russia the present world production capacity is 83 million barrels a day and we are running an estimated 815 million today which means we are in the red zone
the 14 largest oil fields in the world are 40 years old
mr chairman i want to thank the gentleman for engaging in this colloquy with me addressing the department of defense dod s concern in any decision ferc would make authorizing the siting of liquefied natural gas facilities lng on or contiguous to our defense installations
mr chairman i know and believe our colleagues all recognize the extreme importance of our duty to ensure that our men and women in uniform are able to operate and train in an environment free of any unnecessary constraints
i have spoken with the officials at the department of defense and assessing nonmilitary impacts to installation operations and training is something they are capable of and in fact do on a regular basis
it is my belief the department of defense should have a role in assessing the impact of such proposed sitings to be considered on or contiguous to a military installation or range
i believe that the commission should consider the department s evaluations so that any siting does not interfere with our military s duties as prescribed in title 10 of the us code
mr chairman the comprehensive energy package that we pass today is a major step forward in our ability to provide certainty in the united states energy sector
clean coal technology and incentives for renewable energies are a key part to the future of energy production and consumption in this country
we need relief from high gas prices and this legislation is a step in that direction
i believe that it goes right to the heart of the problem with the mtbe provisions in this bill
in this case hr 6 would shift the costs of cleaning up mtbe groundwater contamination on to the towns the cities and the water districts around this country
in other words it would shift these cleanup costs from the oil companies responsible for the mess to our constituents who have to live with the mess
it is found in 1 861 different water systems 29 different states serving 45 million people
i might point out to my colleagues that there are about 2 billion in the lust fund and it is to cover all kinds of leakage not just mtbe
mr speaker the mtbe industry says it was forced to put mtbe in gasoline by the clean air act amendments of 1990
there is no mtbe mandate in that law
even more damning are the documents unearthed in recent court cases proving conclusively that the industry knew as early as the 1980s about the dangers mtbe posed to groundwater
the special protection for mtbe manufacturers is in this bill because they are finally being taken to task for the damages they knowingly caused
in my district the tiny little coastal town of cambria had one of its two drinking water sources permanently damaged by mtbe
mtbe is responsible after all for polluting groundwater in hundreds of communities
cleanup costs are estimated in the billions
currently mtbe manufacturers are being held accountable in court but this bill gives them safe harbor
just examples all with pending lawsuits from a few of the 29 states being polluted with this mtbe in the groundwater
the special protection in this bill for mtbe manufacturers is completely unwarranted
mr chairman i rise in opposition strong opposition to this bill
in fact according to the energy information agency it will raise prices at the pump
hr 6 grants liability protection for people who make mtbe who are responsible for polluting groundwater in dozens of states leaving hundreds of communities saddled with billions of dollars in cleanup costs
supporters claim it is fair to protect mtbe producers from liability since congress mandated its use in the clean air act but there is no mandate for mtbe and even the chairman of the committee has acknowledged as much
in fact 120 million barrels were added to gasoline before the clean air regulations were ever issued
most damning documents unearthed in court cases show that manufacturers knew the dangers mtbe posed to groundwater and they still added it to gasoline
the result is what we have today over 1 800 contamination sites in 29 different states serving 45 million americans
i wanted to offer an amendment to strike this provision because in its wisdom the house leadership would not want to vote on this
perhaps it is because too many members on both sides of the aisle represent districts with bad mtbe problems in places where lawsuits are pending
mr chairman pursuant to clause 11 of rule xviii i offer an amendment that will strike an unfunded mandate in section 1502
the provision would impose both an intergovernmental and private sector mandate as it would limit existing rights to seek compensation under current law this provision in hr 6 transfers the cost of cleanups from responsible parties to constituents
mtbe contamination has averaged over 1 800 water systems in 29 states
in response to the gentleman from new hampshire mr bass xz4000190 i show him the headline in the newspaper of a little town in my district where they had to sue chevron for 9 billion for contamination of the water supply and it was settled out of court
but they do not have the investigative power in order to understand what is involved in the particular matter
in my entire time on the ethics committee we never had a partisan division
in reality when you look at the rules that we are bound by and the facts generally you will reach consensus and agreement within the ethics committee and that is exactly what happens
but if the clock is running and there are only 45 days and after that time there is an automatic dismissal and that is what is in these rules now it encourages a partisan division
it works counterintuitive to trying to work out what a consensus would bring out which is in the best interest of the institution
and we did change the rules in order to provide for that but we did it in a bipartisan deliberation and that was missing this time
let me just put out that when that issue was before the house the former rules changes we added a 180day automatic dismissal that was rejected in a bipartisan vote by this body just to point out to the distinguished leader
the package was developed in a very bipartisan manner through the task force
the gentleman is correct on the final vote but the package itself was very much developed in a bipartisan manner through the task force in a way that it should have been done contrary to the process that was used on this rules package
mr chairman i rise today in support of the amendment and in opposition to the underlying legislation
this year when oil is averaging 55 a barrel and gas prices are nearly 3 a gallon in some places it is bad public policy to add to the national debt borrowing the money to give to companies who are making record profits
since i have almost all of the agriculture in my particular district this shows teamwork
third this morning in kahalui maui the price of a premium gallon of gas was 298 per gallon
across the street from that gas station stands one of the most highest yield sugar plantations in the whole world a sugar plantation that is threatened across the way threatened across the board
we can preserve agriculture in this country
i am very concerned about the process by which terminals for lng will be selected in this country
but the bottom line is that the process that is in this legislation which supplants the existing process in my judgment tramples on the rights of the states and the individual communities as they have indicated in their letters to us to be able to influence these decisions that are made
in the case of one being located in the delaware river new jersey has some problems with it in terms of boats being able to turn and environmental issues whatever it may be
that is something that none of us in the congress of the united states should endorse
it could be a little bit difficult and there is a court suit pending in california and obviously we need this
for instance it says on page 13 the term federal authorization means any authorization required under federal law in order to construct expand or operate a liquefaction or gasification natural gas terminal including such permits special use authorizations certifications opinions or other approvals as may be required whether issued by a federal or state agency you are basically taking what has been partially codified and developed by procedure and you are trying to codify it here in what is a much tighter measure giving to the energy commission the ability to make the decision and overrule what happens at the state and local levels
this could end up being other things not in this legislation necessarily but this commission could reach out and start to deal with energy lines could start to deal with pipelines and a variety of other things taking away the local jurisdiction over land
yes we have to make them but let us not forget the states and the local communities and that is what in my judgment this legislation would do if we do not amend it
mr chairman i rise today in support of hr 6 the energy policy act of 2005
completion of this energy bill is a step forward in our struggle for energy security and independence
coal accounts for more than 50 percent of us electricity production in the us and in my home state of illinois the coal reserves contain more btu s than the oil reserves of saudi arabia and kuwait
the coal provisions included in today s energy bill could help these plants switch back to illinois coal keep them operating in a more environmentally friendly way and maintains jobs
specifically i am referring to an important provision in hr 6 that authorizes 200 million for fiscal years 2006 through 2014 for the clean coal power initiative ccpi to direct the secretary of energy to carry out pollution control and coal gasification projects to promote environmentally safe energy production using performance goals for coal emissions awarding grants and funding coal gasification projects
further this year in the house science committee i introduced a new initiative that in addition to the clean coal provisions the bill contains provisions instrumental in helping increase conservation and lowering consumption
included in this are ethanol provisions that are used as a replacement and additive for gasoline consumption
this increased use of ethanol will save 13 billion barrels of oil by 2016 improve the trade deficit by 285 billion over 15 years add 135 billion to the american economy by 2016 through increased agricultural although i am pleased the energy bill promotes essential investments in energy efficiency renewable fuels and advanced vehicle technologies much more is needed
i am also disappointed an amendment offered by representatives markey and johnson that would prohibit drilling in the arctic national wildlife refuge anwr
i have consistently opposed oil and gas exploration development and production in the arctic refuge and voted in favor of the markeyjohnson amendment to strike the title from the bill
finally i supported a motion to strike a provision in hr 6 that has been identified by the congressional budget office as an unfunded mandate on state and local governments and the private sector
clean up is a huge and growing problem in communities across the country including my congressional district as mtbe contamination is extremely expensive and taxpayers should not be obligated to pick up the tab
fiction the other side argues that drilling in pristine areas will lower gas prices
fact this bill makes our country more dependent on fossil fuels from places like the mideast as scientists of all ideologies have stated that the limited amount of oil will not result in a lessening of oil dependency for the us fiction opening anwr will weaken opec and strengthen the us fact the bush administration s own department of energy contradicts this point when it determined last year that if world oil markets continue as they currently do opec could countermand any potential price impact of arctic refuge production by reducing its exports by an equal amount
fact drilling in anwr will not lower gas prices at the pump will not protect our national sovereignty and will not reduce our dependence on foreign oil
mr chairman i rise in strong support of the solis amendment to the energy bill
just because a community is facing an economic downturn is no reason to say that population can now be exposed to refineries and their byproducts in their community and that these people do not deserve the protections of the clear air act as just one example
please support the solis amendment and strip out the damaging special rights for refineries in this bill
madam chairman i rise today in strong support of hr 6 the energy policy act of 2005
wyoming is often called the energy basket of america but people in my state who are taking out emergency loans just to fill up their pickup s tanks would not know it
in my home town of casper gas is 210 a gallon in cheyenne it is almost 220
it is 230 in riverton and 240 in jackson
wyoming can not support subways or mass transit when we do not have masses in the first place
this spike in gas prices has real consequences for people in wyoming whose drives to work are measured not by the length of the country and western song on the radio but by the entire country and western album
to keep our economy sound in wyoming we must pass this energy plan
mr chairman while vice president cheney still refuses to release the records of his energy task force it is obvious from the bill under consideration today who participated in the task force and who shaped the energy policy act before us
the us has 3 percent of the world s oil reserves but now uses 25 percent of the oil produced in the world
in 2003 our nation used approximately 20 billion barrels of petroleum per day while producing just under 6 billion barrels of crude oil
our petroleum usage in 2003 was almost 3 times higher than it was in 1950
our consumption of natural gas in 2003 was almost 4 times greater than in 1950
our consumption of coal in 2003 was double the amount we used in 1950
in fact today in 2005 86 percent of the energy we consume is still generated through the use of nonrenewable fossil fuels
in fact the energy information administration concludes that the bill will reduce oil imports by just over 1 percent by 2025 20 years from now
while not taking any responsible steps to lay the foundation for a new energy policy in america the bill before us does provide 8 billion in tax breaks for the energy industry
in keeping with the basic irresponsibility of this legislation less than 10 percent of these tax breaks will go to the renewable fuel industry
hr 6 would also allow drilling in the arctic national wildlife preserve despite the fact that the us geological survey has estimated that there is less than a year s supply of oil in the preserve
only 15 percent of federal land in the rocky mountain states is currently offlimit to oil drilling
similarly hr 6 would provide 2 billion to support research on recovering oil and gas resources from the deep waters in the gulf of mexico despite the fact that oil companies are generating record profits
the costs of cleaning up mtbe pollution will be in the billions of dollars far more than many local jurisdictions can afford to pay from their own resources
while the groups who met with vice president cheney were clearly focused on maintaining the status quo in america s energy policy there are in fact many things that can be done to decrease our dependence on fossil fuels and particularly to decrease our dependence on foreign oil
for example the 2002 farm bill authorized 150 million in spending in fiscal 2006 to support bioenergy initiatives
such reductions in spending on bioenergy especially given the provisions of the hr 6 are misguided
i have not had a chance to speak on the floor but i thought this fit right in line with environmental justice
when many of us came in 1990 the clean air act came up
i saw a special that showed how bad mtbes are and that they are poisoning our waters in many communities
the gentleman from california mr pombo xz4003220 did that in 1996 and my colleagues on the other side fought that tooth hook and nail
mr speaker i rise in opposition to this rule and urge its defeat
the bill could be made much better including by an amendment that i have offered that the committee on rules refused to be made in order
this bill in my judgment guts the coastal zone management act
we are substituting the judgment of governors with bureaucrats in washington that are expected to understand our states better in terms of environmental impact in terms of economic impacts
the beaches on the coast of state of the florida should be judged and policed by the governor of the state of florida not by somebody in an agency in washington
we must answer that question in this bill
when one of my staff members complained to the car dealer that the gas mileage figures were way off for city driving for the car she had selected for its fuel efficiency the dealer said oh that does nt apply to driving in dc i support this amendment because it would require the epa to correct the longstanding inaccuracies in its testing procedures
mr chairman i rise regrettably in opposition to hr 6 the energy policy act
while there are many good provisions in the act that make modest improvements in support of energy efficiency there are major deficiencies in this bill
in addition many are concerned about the effect of greenhouse gas emissions
this body had the opportunity to enact a wisely balanced policy to reduce the demand for oil in this country and to address the supply of fuel by investing aggressively in alternative energy sources
in fact they said it will probably increase the price of gasoline by 3 cents per gallon
what this bill does is to authorize more money for existing energy producers to increase oil drilling in sensitive areas for sources of supply that will not greatly reduce future reliance on foreign oil
yet this bill provides 8 billion in subsidies for the oil and gas industry
the president proposed 67 billion for tax breaks for energy with 72 percent invested in renewable energy sources and energy efficiency
even an existing program to provide tax credits for wind power will sunset this year and has not been renewed in this bill
the commission also advocated providing 300 million per year in manufacturer and consumer incentives for production and purchase of efficient hybridelectric and advanced diesel vehicles
regrettably the amendment to strike drilling for oil in the arctic national wildlife refuge also failed
in fact this country can not be selfsufficient in oil
in addition the bill increases the power of the federal energy regulatory commission the body which has failed to order appropriate refunds for california utility consumers based on the 20002001 manipulation of the power market
while i applaud a number of measures like continuing the energy star program for appliances and providing grants of 50 million in 2006 to develop or promote photo voltaic technologies these measures are modest compared to the overall need for investing in alternative energy sources and passing measures to decrease our dependence on petroleum
this change would increase the total number of senateconfirmed assistant secretaries in the department from six to eight
in fact the new position could have the opposite effect by slowing down the decisionmaking process
in addition to adding more unnecessary bureaucracy to the department this section adds to the ranks over 500 positions in the executive branch that go through the cumbersome senate confirmation process
i have yet to be convinced that requiring positions below the secretary level through the confirmation process in the other body yields better candidates or more effective governmental administration
the gentlewoman in opposition to the amendment has no time because the gentleman has taken her time
i have a gentleman from our side who wants to speak in favor as well
i believe that the department s financial support is not only ill conceived but that it violates the intent of congress in passing the price anderson act paa
the actions of the department of energy in spending large sums of taxpayer dollars to forestall compensation to citizens who were exposed to radiation releases from hanford represents action by a federal agency that is directly contrary to the intent of congress
in underwriting such a motion with taxpayer funds the department violated the intent of congress in passing the price anderson act
your letter notes that the doe does not disagree with the proposition that low doses of radiation can cause some forms of cancer in addition there are government studies that show exposure to radiation contributed to the onset of the claimants illnesses
i further note that the hanford plaintiffs were just successful in filing a motion declaring that the operations at hanford were an ultra hazardous activity this holding is consistent with congress findings regarding the operations of nuclear facilities
i understand that a trial date has been set and that general electric and dupont are taking the position that iodine 131 which was released in enormous quantities from hanford does not cause thyroid cancer
i understand that several million dollars more could be spent in the next year or two continuing to defend this action
that would result in taxpayers money approaching the 100 000 000 being paid to lawyers to prevent compensation to victims of radiation exposure from hanford
it would appear that more money may well be spent to thwart the intent of the price anderson act than would be spent in victims compensation
please provide me with a detailed justification for any continued payment by the department of energy for the defense of this litigation including specific justifications for any motions currently or intending to be filed or appealed seeking to dismiss most or all of the cases and why such action does not violate congress intent in enacting the paa
mr chairman i rise in opposition to this legislation an 88 billion giveaway to the oil and gas industry that does nothing to alleviate the record high costs of oil and gas
at a time when science and common sense tells us we should be doing more research into alternative energy and less drilling in our precious public lands this bill provides 8 billion in tax breaks for companies to do more drilling and less research into alternative energy
in an 88 billion bill less than 500 million is dedicated to any kind of renewable energy research
the legislation promotes drilling in the last vestiges of the great american frontier places like alaska s arctic refuge and the rocky mountain front ruining forever these examples of nature s magnificence all for what amounts to 5 percent of a one year s supply of oil
at the same time it authorizes 80 billion in new spending to assist the big oil companies one reason conservative organizations such as taxpayers for common sense and citizens against government waste oppose this bill
this would eviscerate my state government s ability to regulate proposed projects in the long island sound despite the state s undisputed leadership in the cleanup of the sound
to say we do not trust connecticut to act in the best interests of one of its most prized natural resources is bad public policy and i hope that an amendment offered by mr castle to strike this section will be adopted
rather we should be reducing our dependence on foreign oil by improving our energy efficiency and maximizing our domestic energy production in an environmentallysound way by investing in cleaner more secure energy sources such as solar wind biomass and fuel cell technology
my state of connecticut is a leader in fuel cell technology with several businesses doing research that is on the cusp of revolutionizing the way our nation powers its homes cars and businesses
this bill should be investing in american small businesses like proton energy in wallingford nxegen in middletown and danbury s fuel cell energy companies that already do over 300 million worth of fuel cell business and move us closer to true energy independence
that is the future of energy in this country and that is what this bill should be encouraging
hopefully within the next few weeks we will have a conference report for the house to consider that provides for the extension of the progrowth tax policies enacted in 2001 and 2003 reduces nonsecurity discretionary spending and provides for important reforms of entitlement programs
i am advised also by the gentleman from california chairman lewis of the committee on appropriations who is walking in front of me right now and hopefully will correct me if i am wrong that the gentleman from california chairman lewis has begun the appropriations process in earnest and he has a very ambitious schedule
in fact i am told that we will have the opportunity to schedule appropriations bills for the floor by the middle of may and i anticipate not anticipate we have set as a schedule another way of putting it we have turned over the schedule to the committee on appropriations to get their work done
i have no idea when the negotiations with the house and the senate will start in earnest when we will appoint the conference committee
there is very little difference quite frankly from the house bill and the senate bill and i would assume that the major issues will be taken care of in a matter of days if not a couple of weeks
i do recall that in the last congress when we approached the energy bill there was i think at least 20 if not more amendments allowed on the bill
i would anticipate that the same approach because the bill is very similar to the bill we passed in the last congress would be taken
this is a very very important issue that upholds the integrity of the house that has to do with the image of the house in making sure that the house can enforce its own rules in a bipartisan way
the speaker of the house looked at the last few years and decided that the rules allowed the use of the committee on standards of official conduct for partisan purposes and its ability to act in a bipartisan way was seriously hindered
in the past when the committee wanted to warn a member about certain actions that were not in violation of the rules they used to send a private letter to that member
the speaker in his office looked at the standing rules of the 108th congress in this regard and felt that some minor changes needed to be made one to protect the committee from being politicized and two to protect members rights of due process
i think it is unfortunate that we have found ourselves in this position particularly when the speaker was trying to protect the rights of the members and certainly more importantly protect the integrity of the institution that we have reached this point
i am advised through the speaker that the chairman of the committee on standards of official conduct is working with his ranking member and i would hope that they would come to some sort of agreement in how we get past this impasse
and the gentleman would have to ask the speaker about the process of bringing the rules to the floor in a bipartisan way
but in the substance the gentleman is correct
the speaker was bringing a bipartisan process which means that in order to proceed to an investigative subcommittee you would have to have a majority vote which would be bipartisan a bipartisan vote to proceed to the investigative committee
the gentleman is suggesting that he would like to change for the house and the rights of the members something that is so different than the rules of procedures in courts of law
if a grand jury is deadlocked in an indictment there is no process that goes forward
if there is a full jury in a trial that is deadlocked there is no process that goes forward
as i was saying before i was interrupted and i appreciate the gentleman yielding the point is that both sides in the old rules both sides could shut the process down
now what happens in practice is if that member that has been charged receives from the committee that they are moving towards an investigative subcommittee that is a huge hit on that member whether he is guilty or not
and that is why the speaker thought it was really important that a bipartisan vote be made in order to get to that step
it starts with his own ranking member making a decision in concert one vote to one vote with the chairman whether to submit the recommendation to the committee to proceed
then once they have made that recommendation if they make a strong recommendation to proceed to an investigative subcommittee i guarantee you because you have a republican chairman and a democrat ranking member the committee is going to follow their recommendation more times than not and you will have a bipartisan and in many cases a unanimous vote to proceed to the next step
but the other thing is we are working in a bipartisan way i hope
i do not think we need a complete overhaul of the ethics process but there are certain problems that were found in practice that the speaker felt needed to be done in order to protect the members
the rule does not allow an amendment that i submitted with the gentleman from new york mr boehlert xz4000350 and the gentleman from new mexico mr udall xz4004122 which related to the outrageous hydroelectric relicensing provisions in the bill nor does it allow an amendment by the gentlewoman from california mrs capps xz4000620 to strike the unjustified and unjustifiable gifts to the producers of mtbe
and last of all it denies the gentleman from michigan mr stupak xz4003910 the right to offer an amendment to stop natural gas and oil companies from drilling in the great lakes
the amendment we submitted would have corrected a number of the most egregious abuses unless in this section we apply the new rights to all parties in equal fashion
the bill also forecloses a vote on the billions of dollars bestowed in this bill to producers of mtbe
finally the gentleman from michigan mr stupak xz4003910 sought to offer a simple straightforward amendment prohibiting any state or federal permit to lease for new oil and gas drilling in or under the great lakes one of the great treasures 20 percent of the water in the world the free fresh water which is so important to us
democrats have been trying to work with our republican colleagues to get balanced sensible legislation starting with a clean slate in a bipartisan fashion
the republican leadership chose instead to push an outdated energy bill which had its origins in the secret cheney energy task force and was negotiated in secret conference meetings which excluded the democrats
the bill eliminates requirements for public participation and deference to the states in decisions about the siting of electric transmission lines and natural gas facilities
as far as consumers are concerned it is hard to imagine a better case for increasing consumer protections than the debacle which took place in the west coast electricity markets in 2000 and 2001
the federal energy regulatory commission has determined widespread fraud existed and there are tapes to prove it yet this bill gives only cosmetic reforms in law and in point of fact repeals the public utility holding company act of 1935 which protects consumers and investors
madam chairman it is regrettable indeed that we function under such a constrained rule but the amendment which i have been permitted to offer here contains real benefits for electricity consumers and includes many of the reforms that i and other of my colleagues have proposed in committee markups on the house floor and in conference during consideration of various energy bills
the skill and arts of enron and enronlike rascals will enable them to escape much of the refunds which they should make after the most active kind of wrong doing as we saw in the western part of the united states
i would note a recent standard amp poor report states utility investment in noncore businesses has been responsible for most of the credit deterioration in the utility industry i urge my colleagues to adopt the amendment
madam chairman if my colleagues want a replication of enron and the abuses the stealing the dishonesty that hurt pensioners retirees shareholders others in the industry hundreds and hundreds of ratepayers and hurt the structure of the states in the western united states then vote against this amendment
it allows ferc and the sec to provide the necessary steps that will stop enrons and others like enron from doing what enron did which caused such desperate hurt to millions of americans in the western united states
in point of fact it would be required because of the language in the amendment to properly go to 36 miles per gallon
if you like driving around in small cars this will assure that that will be all that you will have
the amendment would purport to have the agency which would fix fuel economy standards to in fact consider both jobs safety and other questions like that
in point of fact there is no requirement
so those requirements in fact are not requirements but rather an illusion
years ago in 1995 they passed the unfunded mandates reform act
if they had been fair and given this a decent rule then we would have been able to debate these in a proper fashion and they would not be complaining about surprise
the judge had this to say about these kinds of lawsuits and by the way they are in new york and new hampshire innocent water providers and ultimately innocent water users should not be denied relief from the contamination of their water supply if the defendants breached a duty to avoid an unreasonable risk from their products this bill is an immunity bath for mbte manufacturers and for the refineries
mtbe producers according to documents in recent litigation put this contaminant into commerce knowing it could contaminate drinking water supplies
one estimate by experts puts the cleanup cost in excess of 29 billion
while the yucca mountain repository program faces funding problems this is not the bill in which to address those issues and this appropriation more than meets the administration s fy 2006 request
as the us supreme court ruled in its 1993 opinion lincoln v vigil it is a fundamental principle of appropriations law that where congress merely appropriates lumpsum amounts without statutory restriction a clear inference may be drawn that it does not intend to impose legally funding restrictions and indicia in committee reports and other legislative history as to how the funds should or are expected to be spent do not establish any legal requirements on the agency nonetheless report language that conflicts with an agency s statutory responsibilities warrants a response
the committee report directs doe to do something the nuclear waste policy act does not permit to establish one or more centralized interim storage facilities for commercial spent fuel to take title to some commercial spent fuel and to consider altering the order in which utility fuel is scheduled to be removed from utility sites
first it would mean that some state other than nevada which congress ratified as the sole candidate for licensing a permanent repository would win the lottery for hosting an interim storage facility that would open in 2006
the report language helpfully notes that three doe sites in the states of idaho south carolina and washington could be selected
third since the proposal specifies no licensing process and no statutory criteria for site selection it is likely that pure politics not seismic conditions not storage capacity not even security measures would guide doe in its selection of a fast track candidate to begin storing waste in fy 2006
that should send a chill up the spine of any state with a federallyowned site since the policy proposed in the report would not provide protections equal to the nuclear regulatory commission fourth ratepayers should be alarmed by the committee report s interim storage proposal
an interim storage facility could add to costs in the long run increasing ratepayers total payments to the fund
but in this bill security is sacrificed at the altar of whichever lobbyist had the biggest limousine
our families health depends on clean air and water but this collection of tax breaks loopholes handouts and waivers ensures only continued healthy profits for some of the worst polluters in the world
and this bill is not just about more smoke in the air it is about more smoke and mirrors
take for example the synthetic fuel provision that i tried unsuccessfully to strike in the committee on ways and means it is really about tax dodging through synthetic accounting
it does not cause the coal to burn in a less polluting manner
it is about a lost opportunity for america to be the world s leader in energy technology
with our security at stake when so much of the world s oil is located in areas as inflammable above ground as the fuel they hold underground with our families health dependent on not letting the quality of our air and our water deteriorate even further than it has under this administration this energy bill is the latest example of spending today while the future will be billed in dollars safety and health
it is interesting to note that mtbe was first approved for use as a fuel additive by the environmental protection agency epa in 1979
in 1988 the epa approved the use of mtbe once again and significantly increased the amount of it that could be used in fuel
in 1990 congress passed amendments to the clean air act which mandated a fuel oxygenate
in its regulations implementing those amendments the epa once again approved mtbe for use as an additive in gasoline
it is important to point out that these actions including the amendments to the clean air act were vigorously supported by both parties in congress and many national environmental organizations which hailed mtbe as a great victory for clean air
in fact my constituents in south lake tahoe have personal experience with this problem because in 1996 they discovered that their water supply had been contaminated by mtbe
consequently 18 out of 34 wells in south lake tahoe were shut down or suffered limited pumping to contain the contamination
because i believe strongly that the federal government is responsible for mtbe contamination i fought for and succeeded in getting the federal government to participate in the cleanup of mtbe from south lake tahoe water by authorizing and appropriating 1 million in the lake tahoe restoration act of 2000 pl
that appropriation was just a drop in the bucket however as the total estimated cleanup of mtbe in south lake tahoe is just over 69 million
in fact to date the legal fees costs and settlement for mtbe litigation in california is over 750 million alone
furthermore the water industry estimates that full cleanup of mtbe contamination across the country will be over mr chairman mtbe contamination is a serious problem in california and it is time for the federal government to admit that its overt promotion of mtbe is a major reason why we now find this additive in the water supplies of our communities
but more must be done in order to further protect communities like south lake tahoe
representative charlie bass has offered a proposal that would create a task force to seek a resolution to the mtbe cleanup issues in both new hampshire and california
i think this proposal is an important first step and i encourage the house leadership to take a serious look at representative bass s proposal and work towards a more comprehensive solution for mtbe contamination in our communities
in the end mr chairman the federal government helped cause this problem and the federal government needs to help resolve it
mr chairman this is a vital bill for the future of our country and this bill provides a very balanced approach to research in the scientific areas and to energy development and indeed renewable energy as well as vital water projects and infrastructure for this country to keep us economically sound
i would particularly like to commend the chairman and the staff in working with both sides here on this bill
hydrogen is the fuel source of the future and funding in this bill moves us closer to that goal
as i understand it our imports share of oil consumption was 35 percent in 1974
in my home state of pennsylvania which is not normally thought of as a state closely tied to the automotive industry a total of 220 800 jobs are dependent on the industry 39 700 of these people are directly employed by it and when you add in other spinoff employment we are talking about over 220 000 jobs in pennsylvania alone
mr chairman in these difficult economic times i simply do not think it is prudent to put those jobs and this vital industry in jeopardy when it is not clear the benefits potentially derived would merit doing so
mr speaker i know that our colleagues the gentleman from maryland mr hoyer xz4001890 and the gentleman from texas mr delay xz4001040 will be engaged in a colloquy in just a moment and the announcement that i have will i believe relate to the colloquy that they are about to engage in
any member wishing to offer an amendment should submit 55 copies of the amendment one written copy of a brief explanation of the amendment and one electronic copy of the same to the committee on rules up in h312 of the capitol by 12 noon on tuesday april 19 2005
members should use the office of legislative counsel to ensure that their amendments are drafted in the most appropriate format
they are increasing in large part because of global demand and the fact that we have to do everything that we possibly can to ensure that we move in the direction of alternative sources of energy and making sure that we have access to obtain domestic energy selfsufficiency
i wish we could have made a lot more amendments in order but we made 30 amendments in order on this measure
in the 107th congress we made 16 amendments in order in the 108th congress 22 amendments made in order and now in the 109th congress 30 amendments made in order
three of those 30 amendments made in order are bipartisan amendments democrats and republicans joining together to offer amendments and five of those 30 amendments are offered by republicans
the gentleman from texas mr barton xz4000180 the gentleman from california mr thomas xz4004010 the gentleman from new york mr boehlert xz4000350 and my good friend the gentleman from california mr pombo xz4003220 who is here in the chamber
it has been in the works for 6 years
we have been this close this close to making it happen in the past mr speaker and unfortunately the fact that we have not been able to make it happen in the past has played a role in increasing the cost of gasoline has played a role in ensuring that we have not been able to pursue alternative sources of energy has played a role in making us more dependent on foreign sources of oil
so mr speaker i will say that i believe that we now are on the verge of what will be another great bipartisan victory in this congress
i am very proud that democrats and republicans have come together in large numbers on both sides to pass bankruptcy reform legislation class action reform legislation our continuity of congress bill permanent repeal of the death tax and passage of the real id
in fact it could actually raise gas prices by 3 to 5 cents per gallon according to the department s independent budget analysis
mr chairman i thank the gentleman from new york for yielding me this time and i rise in strong support of the bishopmarkey substitute
the administration s own energy information administration analyzed last year s hr 6 and said changes to production consumption imports and prices in it are negligible
i can not support hr 6 as it is written today despite my great affection for our chairman who was more than fair when we had the markup in the committee on energy and commerce but this bishopmarkey amendment would provide critical improvements to it
mr chairman i yield myself such time as i may consume and i rise to offer a perfecting amendment to a good grant proposal offered in section 1512
this amendment simply expands the types of renewable fuels eligible for funding under the grant program in hr 6
there is no change in cost to the grant program or hr 6 under my amendment
pseries fuels were officially designated as an alternative fuel by the us department of energy in 1999
doe also found pseries to have environmental benefits because of the reduction in hydrocarbon and co emissions toxics and greenhouse gases
a pilot plan for this technology is operating in south glens falls new york
this just would show that we are serious in looking at other renewable fuels
we believe pseries fuels are very important and can help us in the future to look at alternative sources of energy other than gasoline
the majority is not really serious in my opinion with all due respect in trying to find alternative ways that americans can get their energy from other than gasoline
congress had a great opportunity to produce a balanced energy policy that is diversified reduces our dependence on oil and invests in alternative energy but our leadership chose to essentially recycle an old bill that favors special interests over consumers
today oil is at over 50 per barrel and we still have nt passed reliability standards to address the electricity blackout that assaulted the northeast and midwest in 2003
in february secretary bodman testified of his familiarity with the ncep s report and of his willingness to work with congress to produce a bill in a bipartisan fashion
there is a laundry list of problems in this bill
there is nothing in this bill that reduces our consumption of oil or reduces the price of oil
the energy information agency has stated in a 2004 report that under policies proposed by the energy policy act by 2025 us consumption is projected to increase to 283 million barrels per day and our country would increase its imports of foreign oil by 85 percent
the bill s provision protecting manufacturers of mtbe from liability for contaminating water supplies means that taxpayers will bear billions of dollars in cleanup costs while at the same time paying mtbe manufacturers 2 billion in subsidies
in a much anticipated ruling yesterday in the southern district of new york a federal judge who had consolidated over 80 mtbe lawsuits brought by local governments and state attorney generals ruled that all of the cases can proceed against the oil industry
including the mtbe liability waiver in the bill would essentially undermine this ruling while at the same time cutting off the most effective tool that states and local governments have utilized to clean up their drinking water
in and around jamaica queens where more than a million nyc residents and businesses rely on groundwater instead of surface water from the upstate reservoirs mtbe has contaminated much of the groundwater supply in the aquifer
yet the republicans in congress have ignored these safety issues and instead provided tax dollars to subsidize building new power plants
while i am not opposed to nuclear power these tax dollars would be better used to insulate homes and assist renewable energy production methods in being brought to market
this bill will allow oil drilling in the alaska national wildlife refuge even though the oil wo nt be available for a decade and even then at levels that would not significantly affect oil prices or imports
doe also found pseries to have environmental benefits because of the reductions in hydrocarbon and co emissions toxics and greenhouse gases
madam chairman at a time of recordhigh energy prices the growth of the economy is at risk and it is critical that congress take the necessary steps to put in place a comprehensive energy policy
the bill before us frankly is more limited in scope than i would prefer
it is not as ambitious as i would like in creating market incentives to overhaul the energy side of our economy but nevertheless support of this bill is a critical first step for congress to move forward to meet the critical goal of an effective national energy policy
the time has come for us to put in place a national energy policy
i rise in opposition to this rule
the state of california sends 50 billion more to the federal government while getting nothing in return for that 50 billion
with this bill californians are being asked to sacrifice even more while getting nothing in return
in listening to state leaders about this bill i could not find anyone from the governor on down who has said that this is a wonderful bill and it should be supported and passed
mr speaker i will include in the record a packet of letters from the coastal commission the california puc the lieutenant governor and the california ocean protection council
i ask my colleagues particularly my california colleagues to join me in voting against the rule and the underlying bill
after participating in the debate and reviewing the products that emerged from our respective committees we foresee serious dangers for the state of california if this legislation is enacted
they were part of the conference report on hr 6 which was considered by the house and senate in 2003
the bill will hand over exclusive jurisdiction for the siting of liquefied natural gas lng facilities to the federal energy regulatory commission ferc preventing the states from having a role in approving the location of lng terminals and the conditions under which these terminals must operate
in addition states will have to seek ferc permission before conducting safety inspections and they will be barred from taking any independent enforcement action against lng terminal operators for safety violations
in other words lng terminal operators can legally exercise market power to drive up the cost of natural gas
when the el paso corporation and its independent affiliates allegedly conspired to withhold natural gas pipeline capacity in order to inflate the costs of natural gas and electricity in california in 2000 and 2001 the state sought relief for these reasons the provision is unanimously opposed by the california public utilities commission which as you know is fighting ferc in the courts for jurisdiction over an lng terminal in the heart of the port of long beach
again both the california coastal commission and the california ocean protection council have indicated that they oppose this provision ethanol mandate provision from hr 6 the clean air act s two percent oxygenate requirement forces refiners selling gasoline in california to blend more ethanol into their fuel than is needed for air quality purposes
instead of improving air quality the unnecessary use of ethanol is increasing pollution in parts of the state according to a preliminary report from the california air resources board
last year you asked the us epa to waive the oxygenate requirement and last week 50 members of the california congressional delegation reiterated support for your request in a letter to acting epa administrator stephen l johnson
under the energy bill coming before the house however california refiners will have to blend even more ethanol into their gasoline or pay in the form of credit purchases not to use it
in a time of skyrocketing gas prices this new mandate amounts to hidden tax on california motorists which will subsidize a single industry located largely in the midwest
according to the us energy information administration eia the ethanol mandate will greatly expand production of cornbased ethanol but only 02 of the nation s corn is produced in california
more important eia projects that the ethanol mandate will result in no increase in the production of cellulosic ethanol ethanol made from agricultural and forestry residues and other resources which is the primary type of ethanol that can be produced in california
in california south lake tahoe and santa monica have been able to reach settlements with the industry for the cleanup of their drinking water after successfully arguing that the industry sold a defective product
if the liability protection in the bill is enacted then mtbe will be deemed a safe product and the industry will be relieved from virtually any obligation to pay cleanup costs
in june 2003 fourteen state attorneys general wrote in opposition to this this bill includes language which will require the secretary of energy to designate refinery revitalization zones in areas that have experienced mass layoffs or contain an idle refinery and have an unemployment rate that exceeds the national average by 10 percent
in areas that meet these criteria the secretary of energy is given authority to site a new refinery within six months of receiving a petition for approval
the criteria outlined in the language would result in much of california being designated a refinery revitalization zone from imperial to east los angeles and north of san jose
in fact more than half of california s 53 congressional districts would be subject to these provisions
the department of energy however is not trained and experienced in issuing air permits and is not familiar with the various rules implemented by local agencies as part of the state implementation plan sip required by the clean air act
an amendment added to the bill in the energy and commerce committee will preempt california s new efficiency standards for ceiling fans pending the implementation of a federal standard
the us department of energy has been notoriously slow in propounding efficiency standards falling years behind statutory deadlines for setting or updating efficiency standards for other appliances such as air conditioners
indeed the ceiling fan standard is part of a california energy commission demand reduction package that will reduce peak power demand by 1 000 megawatts within 10 years saving consumers 75 a year in energy costs and conserving as much power as can be generated by three large power plants
other parties with legitimate interests in relicensing including states tribes conservationists farmers and fishermen would not be afforded the same opportunities
in california there are more than 300 federallyregulated hydroelectric dams over 200 will undergo relicensing in the next 10 to 15 years
denying all stakeholders equal footing in the process is fundamentally unfair and is a recipe for protracted litigation
although time is short the issues we ve outlined have been in the public domain for the past several months going back to november 2003 in most cases
the council is committed to maintaining california as a leader in ocean and coastal management
the council objects to efforts to reduce or eliminate a state s role in the siting of liquefied natural gas facilities
please contact brian maird assistant secretary for ocean and coastal policy california resources agency if you have additional questions or would like to further engage california in efforts to protect and manage ocean and coastal resources
dear congresswoman eshoo as chair of the california state lands commission and a member of the newlycreated california ocean protection council i am writing to express my strong opposition to the energy legislation currently pending in congress
the house energy and commerce committee is currently reviewing substantial changes in federal energy policy including the rewriting the outer continental shelf lands act to grant the federal administration sweeping new authority over california s coastal management and role in planning for coastal development
the state should be able to continue to play a meaningful role in determining the appropriate location of any gas terminal within the state s boundaries
the moratorium was put in place in 1990 by thenpresident george hw
on march 21 the other members of the ocean council joined me in expressing opposition to this socalled energy bill as the council s first official act
today i ask that you let the voice of californians prevail in any decisions being made about the future of our coast
dear representatives barton and dingell on behalf of the california coastal commission the commission i write to express our strong objection to provisions in the energy bill that would compromise the outer continental shelf ocs moratorium on oil drilling seriously weaken the coastal zone management act czma protection of states rights and eviscerate california s role in siting new liquefied natural gas lng terminals
it would eliminate meaningful state participation in the appeal to the secretary of commerce of consistency decisions relative to ocs oil drilling and other federal activities by imposing unreasonable and unworkable time limitations for the processing of the appeal
the time limits set forth in the legislation are totally inadequate to enable the secretary of commerce to develop a complete record for the appeal and to review all the materials finally the commission opposes the legislation s provisions to trump state s rights by giving the federal energy regulatory commission ferc authority over the siting of lng terminals
the energy legislation s provisions are directly contrary to california s strong interest in safeguarding its precious coastal resources from offshore oil and gas drillingrelated activities
dear representative eshoo the california public utilities commission cpuc strongly opposes the liquefied natural gas lng provisions in section 320 of title iii of the energy policy act of 2005 epact and urges you to vote in favor of any proposed amendment to strike section 320 from title iii during markup which we understand will take place on tuesday april 12 2005
this disproportionate control in the hands of ferc could have very serious consequences for california due to ferc s lack of understanding of local conditions such as seismic issues and refusal to have hearings to consider the cpuc agrees that lng terminals are necessary
the real issue is how to make sure they are safely located and what safeguards would be sufficient to mitigate the risks especially for sites in densely populated areas
the point is that even without the lng provisions in this bill there will be new lng terminals to meet our needs
the lng provisions in the proposed epact if enacted would severely undermine the careful evaluation of the safety issues that is necessary particularly in densely populated areas by depriving the states of decisionmaking authority and by allowing the ferc to expedite the processes an control the administrative records
in addition in sharp contrast to europe and japan the lng provisions would insulate the lng terminal operators from any regulatory safeguards against their exercise of market power at least through january 1 2011
in that way the states could apply their expertise not to block lng terminals but to ensure that they are safely sited and some regulatory check could exist to protect the consumers
this concurrent jurisdiction approach worked in the 1970s when the cpuc and the ferc both certificated proposed lng facilities at point conception instead of going forward with the initial proposal approved by the ferc at the city of oxnard
although the cpuc has been blamed for defending our jurisdiction over lng terminals in california in the current litigation between the ferc and cpuc in the ninth circuit the cpuc tried to resolve the dispute and work cooperatively with the ferc at the outset
it was the ferc who rejected the cpuc s request for a hearing in that proceeding even though the proposed lng facilities at the port of long beach would be in a densely populated area and built on landfill with 27 active for these reasons we urge you to oppose section 320 and vote in favor of striking the lng provisions from the proposed epact
we urge you to consider a more balanced approach such as concurrent jurisdiction which would combine the expertise of federal and state agencies and result in real cooperation
can there be any doubt today that western consumers were gouged as a result of energy market manipulation in 2000 and 2001
madam chairman 5 years after the crisis in california no refunds have been ordered because for 5 years the federal energy regulatory commission has insisted it does not have the authority to order the retroactive refunds that will fully compensate consumers
number three transcripts of reliant energy traders from 2000 revealed that reliant power plant operators deliberately kept power offline in order to increase energy prices at the height of the crisis
four on march 3 2003 a coalition of california governmental entities and public utilities presented the ferc with more than 1 000 pages of evidence documenting a pervasive pattern of market manipulation that resulted in disastrous effects on prices and reliability and in march 2003 the ferc confirmed that significant power manipulation had taken place in the west
mr chairman in a cautionary letter to the president last month a group of defense experts including conservatives robert mcfarlane frank gaffney and boyden gray said the following with only 2 percent of the world s oil reserves but 25 percent of current world consumption the united states can not eliminate its need for imports through increased domestic production alone our dependence on foreign oil is putting our country in a perilous situation
i think that collectively the house of representatives should remember that this very provision took down the entire energy bill in the last congress
i do not care what district anyone represents in this country
the national association of counties the national league of cities attorneys general from across the united states have weighed in
the cbo has weighed in and said that
the congress has responded to unfunded mandates by having rule xviii in the house rules
in california successful lawsuits have led to substantial settlements with oil companies and these settlements have enabled some communities to begin cleaning up their drinking water supplies
it s been detected in groundwater in all 50 states
when mtbe is in drinking water we need to clean it up
in response to the public health threat 42 states have established action levels cleanup levels or drinking water standards for mtbe 19 states have imposed full or partial bans on mtbe in gasoline
in justifying the safe harbor some will claim that congress established a mandate to use mtbe when it passed the clean air act s 2 percent oxygenate requirement in the early 1990s
in fact in the south lake tahoe lawsuit arco admitted that it withheld information about groundwater contamination from congress
there s a reason the refiners and the mtbe producers are losing in court there s a reason they re settling claims
in 2003 14 attorneys general including the attorneys general of california new york colorado connecticut illinois maryland massachusetts minnesota new hampshire new mexico rhode island vermont washington and wisconsin wrote in opposition to providing a safe harbor for mtbe
in april of this year the us conference of mayors the national league of cities the national association of counties the association of california water agencies and other sent letters voicing their opposition
mr chairman i rise today in opposition to hr 6 the energy policy act of 2005
for the third time in 5 years the house republican leadership has passed up an historic opportunity to craft an energy policy for the 21st century
with oil prices hitting record levels and repeated predictions that the cost of a barrel of oil could hit over 100 in the coming years we should be focusing our efforts on alleviating our nation s dependence on fossil fuels
instead hr 6 is stuck in the past
unfortunately the majority of the bill s eight billion dollars in energy tax incentives are for oil and gas production
that s billions in tax breaks paid for by our children and grandchildren going to energy companies that have been earning record profits
with 55 oil we do nt need incentives for oil and gas companies to explore his fiscal year 2006 budget called for 67 billion in tax breaks for energy with 72 percent going toward renewable sources of energy and energy efficiency
in contrast hr 6 only provides six percent of the tax benefits for renewable energy and energy efficiency
in addition hr 6 irresponsibly sacrifices environmental protection for petroleum production
despite this the republican leadership s arrogance demands that this provision remain in the bill
gas prices in america continue to reach record heights
this problem is particularly acute in farm country
this legislation sends us in the wrong direction by relying on the fuels of today to provide energy in the future
we can not sacrifice investment in new cleaner domestic sources in order to pay 81 billion to oil producers in tax cuts and subsidies
this legislation would allow the oil industry currently experiencing some of its most profitable years to further their reach through exploration in sensitive environments such as the arctic national wildlife refuge and the great lakes
in order to create a policy that looks to future needs and us security we can not rely on increased drilling and oil refineries
madam chairman i rise in strong opposition to this socalled comprehensive energy bill before us today
this energy package have a new wrapping and bow but it is the same white elephant gift for the american people that sadly passed in this house last congress
our nation s energy policy must strike a sound balance by pursuing improvements in fuel technology and energy efficiency maintaining a clean environment and preserving our wilderness areas and public lands
instead by refusing to commit to improving and investing in sustainable fuel technology we are putting our technology and manufacturing industries at a competitive disadvantage when the rest of the planet is searching for alternatives to fossil fuels
we are missing an opportunity here as a future energy policy this legislation is bumbling along because of following the policies in this bill would be like driving into the future by looking through the rearview mirror with its heavily weighted dependence on fossil fuels
hr 6 falls depressingly short of addressing our energy needs in both the short and the long term
madam chairman more than ninety percent of the subsidies in hr 6 would go to the oil gas coal and nuclear industries leading to more pollution more oil drilling and more radioactivewasteproducing nuclear power
it s the most asked question i hear in my district and rightly so with prices in my home town of more than 3 a gallon and a national average price at a record level of 224 a gallon more than 50 percent higher than average gas prices in 2002
how in good faith can we go back to out constituencies with a national energy policy that does not address the future does not address short term fixes or long term solutions
madam chairman several provisions in hr 6 will weaken california s rights as a state to govern itself
these include changes in lng terminal siting weakening the coastal zone management act and expanding alternative energy projects situated on the outer continental shelf ocs
the bill will hand over exclusive jurisdiction for the siting of liquefied natural gas lng facilities to the federal energy regulatory commission ferc preventing the states from having a role in approving the location of lng terminals and the conditions under which these terminals must operate
another very dear issue in california is the fuel additive mtbe methyl tertiary butyl ether i oppose shielding mtbe producers from product liability lawsuits thereby forcing taxpayers to pick up the tab to clean up contaminated groundwater in places such as the salinas valley the salad bowl of the world which has already tested positive for mtbe
i want to specifically highlight the rose bay ecosystem project in florida s 24th congressional district which i represent
in the 1940s rose bay was a productive estuary and shellfish harvesting area on the halifax river in volusia county
mr chairman i want to thank the gentleman from ohio chairman hobson for his leadership in delivering a comprehensive and bipartisan appropriations bill to the floor today
he has seen the channel deepening project and he takes a real interest in the projects found in his bill and i thank him very much for his leadership
on a more personal note i also want to thank the chairman for supporting the green brook flood control project which is in my district in new jersey
my constituents in new jersey thank him for his commitment to this project
he deserves significant credit for its success and the thanks of thousands of residents whose safety and livelihood in our area of new jersey are very much at stake with the success of this project
there are no easy decisions particularly in a difficult and a tight budget year like this year
it is equally vital that our senators from new jersey take up the fight for this important project and finish the work that we have begun here in the house
madam chairman this legislation takes our nation in the wrong direction and fails to meet our energy needs
but instead the republican energy bill doles out favors to the oil gas and coal companies keeping our nation stuck in the 20th century
my amendment would have promoted the development of geothermal energy in imperial valley california and around the nation creating good jobs and a source of clean domesticallyproduced environmentally friendly reliable energy
they also blocked my amendment to address another very serious issue we are facing in imperial valley air pollution from power plants across the border in mexico
in the 21st century us companies should not be able to skirt their environmental obligations by moving a few miles across the border
my amendment would have simply required power plants in the border region to meet our environmental standards if they wish to transmit electricity into the united states
in exchange for transmission permits from the department of energy power plants in mexicali mexico would have been forced to pay for projects in imperial valley to offset the air pollution they are sending across the border into our communities
with the highest child asthma rate in california imperial county certainly needs the help but the republicans on the rules committee once again turned their backs on us
we will continue fighting for a better approach to energy in this nation
and we will continue fighting for an energy policy that reduces pollution in the border region and around the country
mr chairman i rise in opposition to the amendment
and here we are employing programs that will simply make you pay one more at the pump and two more in taxes because you are supporting this kind of subsidy
i thought it was kind of strange when i was a kid the worse prank you could play it was hardly a prank it was property damage but was to put sugar in someone s tank
nobody is going to come here to washington to lobby against a subsidy that only costs them four cents but boy the sugar industry which reaps millions and millions of dollars in benefits from subsidized sugar is surely going to come to washington and that is why we are going to have this kind of amendment today
i rise in support of this amendment which is very simple
a hybrid honda insight is rated at 61 miles per gallon in the city and 70 miles per gallon on the highway
a comparable traditional honda civic gets just 32 miles per gallon in the city and 37 miles per gallon on the highway
i need not explain to those in my home district of memphis who are paying an average of 215 cents a gallon that we need better fuel efficiency not only for our pocketbooks and our wallets but also for our air and our environment
in addition if indeed we were to travel this route and provide these incentives mr chairman not only would we enjoy a net savings at the pump but we would also enjoy a net increase in jobs estimated according to the union of concerned scientists by some 182 000 new jobs in the service finance insurance manufacturing and retail industries
the second point i would make before yielding is that there have been questions raised by those in the automotive industry regarding how would we define a company that manufactures or assembles vehicles or a domestic manufacturer
i would be more than willing to work with those in conference but my intent is clear
any company that manufactures or assembles vehicles in the united states would be covered under this amendment meaning those at the nissan plant in smyrna tennessee and those at the saturn plant in spring hill tennessee would be covered and protected
this means that companies like peterbilt and even averitt express in my home state of tennessee would benefit from the program as well
finally the program would also assist companies like the largest employer in my district and state fedex
for those of my colleagues who do not know they are a little package delivery company in memphis which plans to introduce 75 new hybrid dieselelectric trucks into service nationwide in the next 12 months
in closing mr chairman this is a good solid amendment
it is one that has no partisan stripes only an effort to help clean up the environment find ways to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and create good old american jobs here in this country
i thank the chairman for his support and ask all of my colleagues in both parties to be supportive of it
finally as my colleagues know the budget measure that president bush proposed would grant about 7 billion a little over 7 billion in tax breaks and a good 70 percent of that would go towards energy efficiency and alternative sources of energy
we have heard in a few brief minutes from both a republican and a democrat their unhappiness that important issues will not be brought forward
so in this week when we could have worked many days and debated many amendments at length we will have some not discussed at all and others discussed for a handful of minutes because this majority can not be bothered with anything as cumbersome to them as open debate and having members have to record themselves
when state governments democratically elected governors and legislatures appear to be obstacles to letting major players in the energy industry get whatever they want then they are to be diminished they are to be dismissed they are to be thrown out of the process
with regard to liquefied natural gas terminals a very important issue an issue which has become more important because of their relevance to the terrorism threat which security officials tell us is the case this bill takes a limited state role in the siting of these and makes it a nonexistent state role
the ability of governors and legislatures i have a republican governor in my state who does not like a proposal to site an energy plant in a wholly inappropriate place way up river in the city of four rivers which the gentleman from massachusetts mr mcgovern xz4002630 and i share
mr chairman i thank the gentleman for yielding me this time and i rise in strong support of the energy and water appropriations bill
first let me thank and commend chairman hobson and ranking member visclosky for their hard work in crafting a bill that addresses so many complex national energy and water infrastructure needs
this year we have made a significant investment in nuclear energy technology
nuclear energy already provides 20 percent of our nation s electricity and in my home state of new jersey nearly 50 percent of the electrical capacity
our committee has been a leader in advancing fusion so that some day we will be able to realize the promise of the cleanest of energy sources
thirty years ago the first power produced in a laboratory from fusion was barely enough to light a small light bulb
mr chairman i credit the gentleman from ohio mr hobson xz4001800 and the ranking member for grappling with some tough policy decisions in this bill
for example yucca mountain which is facing delays this bill includes money 660 million for yucca mountain in anticipation of a licensing agreement being signed
but most importantly to me and to the new yorknew jersey region in the army corps portfolio this bill reflects our committee s continued recognition of the value of our federal investment in the new yorknew jersey harbor deepening project
i can not overstate the economic importance of the port which is the third largest in the united states
therefore i rise in support of the bill and urge other members to do so as well
madam chairman i rise in strong support of hr 6
yet we continue the cycle of tolerating irresponsible energy policies continuing to discourage investment in domestic energy production and subsequently becoming more dependent on foreign sources of energy
and for the safety and security of our homeland i want the united states to be reasonably selfsufficient in meeting the demands of our current energy consumption
hr 6 makes strides in ensuring our domestic security by streamlining the permitting process for renewable and traditional sources of energy while protecting the integrity of the environmental review process
through this important legislation we will have increased ability to utilize the vast renewable energy resources on our public lands in an environmentally responsible manner
first of all let me say that the arctic national wildlife refuge is 195 million acres of alaska set aside in 1960
also in 1960 they set aside 15 million acres for exploration for oil
but the 1002 area will continue to provide as the usgs has already said an estimated oil reservoir for this country that will equal the amount of oil we will get from saudi arabia for 30 years madam chairman 104 billion barrels would make it the largest oil reserve find in the world since the nearby prudhoe bay discovery was done 30 years ago
we are not talking about a pristine wilderness area that one would find in any of the southern 48 contiguous states that have forests
so with that madam chairman i just wanted to bring to the members attention that this is not the pristine wilderness that most people have in mind
the bill increases state funding from the lust trust fund for states containing a larger number of tanks or whose leaking tanks present a greater threat to groundwater it requires onsite inspections of underground storage tanks every 3 years it institutes operator training requirements for tank owners and operators and the legislation allows states to stop deliveries of fuel to noncompliant regulated tanks in order to achieve legal enforcement
mr chairman i rise to congratulate my good friend the gentleman from texas mr barton xz4000180 the chairman of the committee on energy and commerce for his leadership in forging a comprehensive cohesive energy policy for our nation
i am concerned however mr chairman that the current language in title 12 specifically section 1281 weakens the protections afforded the sensitive and proprietary information used to determine energy prices
the cftc has a long history of sharing futures and options trading data with other federal and state regulators that agree to abide by the public disclosure restrictions found in section 8 of the commodity exchange act
first i would like to thank the gentleman from new york mr boehlert xz4000350 chairman of the committee on science and the gentlewoman from illinois mrs biggert xz4000270 chair of the subcommittee on energy for their hard work and cooperation in developing the foundation of title ix the r amp d title of this bill
while the bill on the floor today has provisions that are not acceptable to many democrats and republicans there are good points worth mentioning in title ix
the department as well as the traditional large research universities could benefit from the enormous pool of talented researchers in the nation s smaller colleges and universities and i encourage greater collaboration
i would also like to highlight the work of several of our members on key components of doe research and development in title ix the interest of the gentleman from california mr honda xz4001850 in the progress of the next generation lighting initiative the stanford linear accelerator and the joint genomics institute and his work with the gentleman from connecticut mr larson xz4002330 on transit bus demonstrations of fuel cells the continued dedication of the gentlewoman from california ms woolsey xz4004360 and the gentleman from colorado mr udall xz4004131 to clean renewable and efficient energy technologies the work of the gentleman from illinois mr costello xz4000820 to ensure that utilization of our vast coal resources only gets cleaner and more efficient the vision of the gentlewoman from california ms zoe lofgren xz4002450 in support of domestic fusion energy research and international fusion projects the work of the gentleman from tennessee mr davis xz4000971 to ensure good science continues at oak ridge national laboratory particularly in the area of highend computing the efforts of the gentleman from north carolina mr miller xz4002781 to establish a nationwide network of advanced energy technology transfer centers to get technologies off the laboratory shelf and into the marketplace finally the tireless commitment of the gentlewoman from texas ms jacksonlee xz4001990 to research and development at historically black colleges and universities and other minorityserving institutions
the r amp d programs authorized in this bill will provide the means to produce energy that this country will need for the foreseeable future
this important amendment would have permanently banned oil and gas drilling in and under the great lakes
the current ban is set to expire in 2007
in fact the great lakes make up 95 percent of the united states fresh surface water
for those of us in the great lakes states the great lakes represent a critical component of our environment our economy and our identity
congress has a history in support of banning drilling on the great lakes
a ban was first approved in 2002 and has been extended twice since
while i am disappointed the rules committee has prevented the house from including a ban on drilling on the great lakes i plan to work night and day with my colleagues to get a permanent ban approved either in conference or as a standalone piece of legislation
mr chairman today congress took a significant step in establishing a comprehensive national energy plan to help lower gas prices and improve the reliability and accessibility of energy in wisconsin
this energy bill requires five billion gallons of renewable fuel to be included in all gasoline sold in the united states by 2015
although i am generally pleased by the passage of the energy bill it nevertheless contains some disappointing provisions and i will be working expeditiously in the weeks to come to improve the bill even further
in particular i plan to push for the inclusion of a ban on oil and gas drilling in the great lakes
overall there are many beneficial provisions in this bill such as resolving permit confusion improving electric reliability and mandating federal energy conservation
very quickly i want to thank the chairman for inclusion of a number of provisions in the bill such as the provision encouraging the siting on liquefied natural gas lng which is important to energy security to cut into the rising natural gas prices that threaten our economy
the top concern of homeowners and manufacturers in our district are the high natural gas prices
providing energy assistance to families in cold and hot weather is a public necessity and i thank the gentleman from michigan mr dingell xz4001100 and the gentleman from texas chairman barton for accepting two new amendments one which would require the department of energy and the national cancer institute to conduct a health assessment of those living in proximity to petrochemical and refinery facilities
we have an energy bill for the first time in my 12 years in congress
granted we can not produce ourselves out of these high energy prices but we have to produce in our own country if we ever expect to lower the prices
twothirds of the world s oil reserves are in the middle east controlled by opec
if we allow production in anwr we will see great benefits at a very low temporary cost and see thousands of goodpaying jobs created over the next 25 years
i have been there many times madam chairman and i can tell you that we can produce it and the bears and the caribou will be in anwr just like they are in prudhoe bay
mr chairman i reluctantly rise in opposition because the gentlewoman from california ms solis xz4003840 is a good member of our committee and we work on lots of issues together
we have probably more refineries in the district i represent now than anyone else in the country and those are our jobs are our tax base and what economic development we have and they are blue collar jobs
they are minority jobs in our district
i am concerned though about what is happening in our country
that is why i think the provision of the bill is really good and i think the amendment does a disservice maybe to our whole country because we need to expand our refining capacity again reopening those make them get the permits but also make sure that we keep those jobs in our country instead of moving overseas
it is an issue we have been dealing with at least in the committee on energy and commerce for a number of years
mtbe was mandated maybe not specifically in the clean air act of 1990 but reformulated gas was
and for an area like i have in houston we have been using mtbe as a reformulated gas in our gas to clean up our air because it replaced the lead that we used to have because lead was polluting
but whatever we have in our gas tanks is not something else we want to smell or taste either
but epa informed congress in 1990 that a reformulated oxygenate requirement would be met almost exclusively by mtbe and congressional statements at the time reflect that knowledge
in fact it was first approved by the epa in 1979 to comply with another federal gasoline mandate in reducing lead
the reason this bill has this provision in here is because we mandated reformulated gas in certain areas including the district i represent
we have not had trouble with mtbe in groundwater or surface water pollution at least in the houston area
the oxygenate requirement has done a great deal to clean up our smoggy urban air and to this day the epa will talk about the success of it particularly in the houston area
a case in point the city of santa monica is suing its former law firm over the 66 million legal bill for its trouble in suing over mtbe
and let me quote from some of the remarks earlier in the clean air act
and there is a way we can have both but not by taking away the ability to have mbte which is probably the most in use because it is the most efficient in reformulated gasoline
we have a great safety record not only in our own country but worldwide in liquefied natural gas
in houston we are too big to walk so we will have to have gasoline and we have to have something to cool our homes in the summer
that is why we need to have a federal role but the states will still have a very important role in this process
the bill creates new authority for states to inspect lng terminals for safety and security beyond what they have in interstate natural gas projects
lng import terminals are engaged in both foreign and in most cases interstate commerce
approval and siting is properly done in the national interest consistent with the commerce clause of the constitution
states participate in the ferc s national environmental policy act process and have new authority in this bill to inspect for safety and security
let me repeat state permitting authority remains in place under hr 6
this legislation provides investment in water infrastructure essential not only to our country but to the texas economy
i want to thank the gentleman from ohio mr hobson xz4001800 the gentleman from indiana mr visclosky xz4004170 and also the gentleman from texas mr edwards xz4001180 for their assistance on these projects particularly two flood projects hunting and greens bayous in my district
thousands of my constituents homes and businesses are at risk from catastrophic flooding in these areas and the funding in this bill 500 000 and 150 000 each keeps these projects on track
the new policy to rein in reprogramming by requiring committee approval over 1 million is very sound
we should note a few brief points about projects that have been lost to reprogramming in the past and need to be made whole
mr chairman i include for printing in the record written commitments from the corps under two administrations
that is the same principle behind the extremely wise reprogramming policy of the future in this bill
i regret that members of my staff were not able to meet with you on september 12 2001 to discuss this project in more detail
i can further assure you that we will reprogram up to 20 million in construction funds as required to this project to ensure that this schedule is maintained irrespective of any shortfall in the fiscal year 2002 congressional appropriation
given the discrepancy between the fy 02 corps budget and the amount of funding required to keep this project on schedule i am requesting that the corps return the full amount of reprogrammed money to this project in its fy 02 budget
i would also like to request a meeting with you in my washington dc office along with congressman chet edwards during the second week in september to discuss this issue
if you have any questions on this matter please contact bob turney in my washington office at 202 2251688
dear congressman green this letter is in response to your concerns regarding the proposed reprogramming of funds from the houstongalveston navigation channels texas project
thank you for your involvement in the development of the water resources infrastructure within the state of texas
loew for two consecutive years the congress appropriated sufficient funds in the energy and water development appropriations bill to permit the completion of the navigational features of the houston ship channel project in four years
maintaining this optimal construction schedule is a priority for us because it will add an additional 281 million to the project s return on investment and save taxpayers 635 million in increased escalation and investment costs
in the spirit of cooperation we and the houston port authority are willing to support the corps request to reprogram funds from the houstongalveston navigation project
however we would first ask to receive assurance in writing that the corps will reprogram other funds to the houston project to replace those lost
in addition if the dredging project suddenly moves ahead of schedule the corps must do everything possible to ensure that a delay does not occur
this section of the bill requires the secretary of the interior to suspend collection of royalty fees from oil and gas companies operating in the deep waters of the gulf of mexico
the authors say this provision is needed to encourage oil and gas companies to explore for and produce oil and gas at water depths greater than 400 feet in the gulf of mexico
just yesterday he said with oil at more than 50 a barrel by the way energy companies do not need taxpayer funded incentives to explore for oil and gas mr chairman the deep waters of the gulf of mexico have seen consistent and striking growth in oil and gas exploration for 10 straight years
clearly no one needs an incentive to explore for oil and gas in one of the most vital areas in the world
i find it ironic that the provision this amendment attempts to strike would stop the collection of royalties yet throughout hr 6 the 25 billion in subsidies that the gentleman from west virginia mr rahall xz4003310 pointed out 2 billion of which go to the ultradeep provision is so strongly supported by the majority leader
i think it is time for the members of congress to say in terms of subsidies and handouts to rich profitable companies when is enough enough
gas prices are high now in part because we have had no comprehensive national energy policy for the past few decades
according to the energy department this coastal plain is the largest unexplored potentially onshore basin in the united states
even better oil could be developed in anwr as soon as 3 years from the first lease sale and none of it would be available for export
of equal importance to me in this bill is my provision on ultradeepwater and unconventional onshore natural gas
according to an analysis by the energy information administration this program will increase production of natural gas by 38 trillion cubic feet and oil by 850 million barrels increase federal royalties in more than sufficient amounts to pay for the effort and lower the price of both fuels but not without this bill
madam chairman i offer a manager s amendment which sets forth clearly all of the changes we are proposing to make in our comprehensive energy bill
madam chairman this amendment makes some technical changes adds a few provisions which were part of the hr 6 conference report from last congress and clarifies some of the provisions contained in this year s bill
we make technical changes in the ceiling fan efficiency standards
we clarify references to the firearm laws in the nuclear security provision which had referred to a law no longer in existence
we clarify dates in the nas mtbe study rulemaking and appropriation authorization dates for the lust program and clarified the bumpup dates
we have also included the on road and offroad diesel rules in the fuel harmonization study
we also tried to avoid a 64 million score on our employee benefits amendment we adopted in committee
some of our other changes include clarifying that the 3year time period in which the federal government must establish energy efficiency standards on certain products be prospective only
like we did in the bill of the last congress we moved the photovoltaic program from doe to gsa
we added back into the bill some of the provisions contained in our hr 6 conference report of the last congress
several were in the research and development title and include the western michigan demonstration project the western hemisphere energy cooperation project the arctic engineering research center and the barrow geophysical research facility
we had to drop this provision because the parliamentarians thought it could be subject to a point of order in our committee so we are putting it back in now
the other amendments are purely technical in nature such as removing duplicative provisions passed by other committees
if i had a youngster who was a sophomore in high school a junior or maybe a senior i would be very concerned about their future if we do not solve our energy problems
we are going to go to work on the senate to try to get those two votes that we have not been able to get in 4 years over there 4 years
i know that back in the early days and i go back to history sometimes if you look at the past and see that we should not make the mistakes of the past but sometimes they light a light for us to see what happened and see what caused it to happen
back in the 1940s back in the late 1930s we had a president named franklin delano roosevelt
but one of the other speeches that he made that scholars have noted and many people have listened to and many have used it as a part of their thrust in their discussion he said to some generations much is given of some generations much is expected but this generation has a rendezvous with destiny that rendezvous with destiny turned out to be world war ii
then george bush the father of our present president just some 10 or 11 years ago sent 450 000 youngsters over to the desert in iraq
it was a war to keep a bad guy named saddam hussein who is now in a cage from getting his foot on half the known energy sources in the entire world
that is provided for in this bill
and then our youngsters can say with a great bit of courage and great bit of hope in their voice what school am i going to attend rather than what branch of service am i going to have to enter
the name of udall is almost a sacred name in the west
mr chairman i rise in support of the amendment
mr chairman i ask unanimous consent to speak for 5 minutes in support of the amendment
mr chairman we are in favor of the amendment of course and i just want to point out that the daviswaxman amendment strikes section 978 which i will have the opportunity maybe at a later time to go into in more depth but it strikes out improved coordination and management of civilian science and technology programs which would create two new senateconfirmed assistant secretary positions within the department of energy increasing the total number of senateconfirmed assistant secretaries in the department to eight
mr chairman i ask unanimous consent to claim the time in opposition to the amendment though i will speak in favor of the amendment
mr chairman i seek the time in opposition to the amendment and i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from california mr radanovich xz4003300
mr chairman as my colleague said a moment ago this amendment is laudable and i admire the gentleman for pushing it but i have to say that in reality it is really special treatment for one company with one facility in one state
pure energy corporation is the only company i know of in the united states to have a patent for technology that can convert urban waste into a doerecognized fuel called a pseries fuel
further the company in question also receives funding and grants from the doe in support of this technology
government agencies are a lot better suited to determine the value of burgeoning technologies in their respective fields than congress would be and we should leave these decisions to the experts
the hard cold facts about this amendment are that the gao released studies in july 2004 that were titled mergers and other factors that affect the us refining industry which attempted to discover the cause behind higher gasoline prices
mr chairman i ask unanimous consent to take the time in opposition though we do not oppose the amendment
mr chairman i ask unanimous consent to claim the time in opposition though we do not have opposition to the amendment
there are a number of reasons why in my district clearly one of the most important is simply the cost of energy whether it is home heat whether it is the cost to manufacturers which is costing us jobs
what they have asked for us is to help them with their higher overhead ultimately helping them with their competitiveness helping jobs to remain in our district
i am also hearing from home owners many of the elderly in my district with older homes who need some help some incentives to improve their homes some tax assistance so they will have more energyefficient homes to those who are building new homes more incentives
this bill will reduce the time for depreciation recovery and improve the opportunity for those companies to update those lines helping in efficiency helping in opportunity to have cheaper energy
especially important are fuel cells and in fact providing new jobs and better technology
fuel cell technology in the united states is growing
the use of it is growing and in fact jobs in that field are growing
it is one that has been utilized in other parts of the world to a further extent than it has been utilized in the united states
the help in this bill will encourage further use of fuel cells
in some parts of the country like the west coast gas has jumped to more than 250 for a gallon of unleaded
america is in the midst of an energy crisis that threatens our national and economic security
it reduces our dependence on foreign oil by expanding domestic supplies and allowing oil and gas exploration right here in the united states
and this legislation makes a significant venture into the use of renewable fuels like ethanol and biodiesel environmentally safe alternatives that can be found in the corn soybean and sugarcane fields right here in the united states
it would create nearly half a million jobs in the manufacturing construction agriculture and technology sectors
madam chairman earlier this year i reintroduced the residential solar energy tax credit act which would provide a 15 percent tax credit for the purchase of solar water heating systems and photovoltaic systems to be installed in residential settings
i am pleased this provision has been included in the tax title to hr 6 the energy policy act of 2005
the solar energy industry in our nation has been growing at a clip of 25 percent per year for the past several years yet us manufacturers export 75 percent of their products because of the higher upfront costs of solar energy systems as compared to other energy sources
national polls consistently find that over 85 percent of americans want greater support for solar power and solar power can play a role in our energy mix from coast to coast
and in stark contrast to the protestations of my friends on the left we are willing to embrace these technologies
total funding for energy and water development in fiscal year 2006 is 29 746 000 000
until we begin to clear out the enormous backlog of ongoing work we are reluctant to start new projects therefore we did not include any new starts again this year in this bill
in part this is because for the first time in years we received a budget request in which many congressional priorities are already at the funded level
however even with that request as a good starting point the total amount that we can provide for the corps is less than what the house passed in fiscal year 2005
with a healthy base request and a lean 302 b allocation we did not add as much for member projects as we have in previous years
we were harsh but fair in how we dealt with these member projects
we think this is not good management and we have done a lot in our bill to try to focus the corps on these continuing contracts
we have taken extensive efforts to try to reform this program because we think that they may not have the money to restore what they should and if there is a big plume in all of this that they can not really tell us what it is all about
another area that we have a problem with is in the continuingcontract area
i think it is a tool that they need but we need to make sure that they are not using them to excess and they are not using them to do things that either the administration did not want to fund we did not want to fund or the senate did not want to fund and that this money is not being shifted around or execution is being done that would inhibit our ability in future years to fund programs by the original funding by the corps
the department of energy received a total of 24318 billion in the energy and water bill
we actually need longer visions in these programs so that we know what we are going to end up with in the waterways in the future and we know what the department of energy s plans are in the future
i want to state that i fully support the yucca mountain repository and our bill fully funds the request for yucca mountain in fiscal year 2006
however we continue to be frustrated by the delays in getting the repository open and we are concerned about what will happen after that first repository is built
the department of energy estimates that each year of delay on yucca mountain costs the government an additional billion dollars half from the legal liability for doe s failure to begin accepting commercial spent fuel beginning in 1988 as required by the law and the other half from the costs
in addition the authorized capacity of yucca mountain will be fully utilized by the year 2010 with no place to dispose of spent fuel generated after that date
if we want to build a new generation of nuclear power reactors in this country we have got to demonstrate to investors and the public that the federal government will live up to its responsibilities under the nuclear waste policy act and to take title to commercial spent fuel
the europeans are doing this very successfully and there are some advanced reprocessing technologies in the research and development phase that promise to reduce or eliminate some of the disadvantages of the current chemical process
we add funds to the nuclear waste disposal account and direct the secretary to begin accepting commercial spent fuel in fiscal year 2006 for interim storage at one or more doe sites
we also include additional funds and direction within the nuclear energy account for the secretary to select an advanced reprocessing technology in fiscal year 2007 and to establish a competitive process to select one or more sites for an advanced fuel recycling facility
the committee provides additional funds for the reliable replacement warhead that we initiated in last year s conference report
we placed the reliable replacement warhead in the context of a larger sustainable stockpile initiative which we view as a package deal with several key components
secondly we propose a modest slowdown of life extension work on the old warheads in preparation for a shift to the newer replacement warheads
this is coupled with a significant increase in dismantlement rates to bring down the stockpile to match the president s decision about the size of the stockpile by the year 2012
frankly in the long run i am hopeful the secretary s task force on the nuclear weapons complex will propose some sensible steps to modernize the doe weapons complex and bring it into line with these coming changes in the size and composition of the stockpile
we made a significant reduction to the domestic mox plant because of the large unexpended prioryear balances in that project caused by the continued liability dispute with the russians
in my opinion this is truly a bipartisan bill that represents a hardfought but ultimately fair and balanced compromise
i also want to thank the chairman of the committee on appropriations the gentleman from california mr lewis xz4002392 and the ranking minority member the gentleman from wisconsin mr obey xz4003000 for their support and for allowing us to move this bill forward in such an expeditious manner
i want to especially acknowledge our agency s detailees taunja berquam and felicia kirksey for their invaluable assistance in putting this bill and report together
total funding for energy and water development in fiscal year 2006 is 29746 billion
therefore we did not include any new starts or new project authorizations for the corps in this house bill
in part this is because for the first time in years we received a budget request in which many congressional priorities are already funded at a reasonable level
however even with that request as a good starting point the total amount that we can provide for the corps is less than what the house passed in fiscal year 2005
with a healthy base request and a lean 302 b allocation we did not add as much for member projects as we have in previous years
we were harsh but fair in how we dealt with these member requests
this is not sound financial management and suggests that the corps is more focused on moving money around frequently to meet the corps determination of project needs irrespective of the allocations provided in annual appropriations
in some cases the corps is awarding continuing contracts for projects that received no appropriation in fiscal year 2005 or have not been included at all in the budget request for fiscal year 2006
also the corps uses accelerated earnings on continuing contracts to pay its contractors more than is appropriated for a project in the current fiscal year
in part these accelerated earnings on continuing contracts are one of the drivers for the corps extensive reprogrammings and also one of the mechanisms the corps uses in its pursuit of the 99 percent expenditure goal
this practice has to stop and we include language limiting the corps ability to obligate the government in excess of appropriations
the department of energy receives a total of 24318 billion in the energy and water development bill an increase of 105 million over the budget request but 101 million less than the fiscal year 2005 level
i continue to support the yucca mountain repository and our bill fully funds the request for yucca mountain in fiscal year 2006
however we continue to be frustrated by the delays in getting that repository open and we are concerned about what happens after that first repository is built
the department of energy estimates that each year of delay on yucca mountain costs the government an additional 1 billion half from the legal liability for doe s failure to begin accepting commercial spent fuel beginning in 1998 as is required by law and the other half from the costs
in addition the authorized capacity of yucca mountain will be fully utilized by the year 2010 with no place to dispose of spent fuel generated after that date
if we want to build a new generation of nuclear reactors in this country we need to demonstrate to investors and the public that the federal government will live up to its responsibilities under the nuclear waste policy act to take title to commercial spent nuclear fuel
the europeans are doing this successfully and there are some advanced reprocessing technologies in the research and development phase that promise to reduce or eliminate some of the disadvantages of the current chemical processes
we add funds to the nuclear waste disposal account and direct the secretary to begin accepting commercial spent fuel in fiscal year 2006 for interim storage at one or more doe sites
we also include additional funds and direction within the nuclear energy account for the secretary to select an advanced reprocessing technology in fiscal year 2007 and to establish a competitive process to select one or more sites for an advanced fuel recycling facility
the committee provides additional funds for the reliable replacement warhead which we initiated in last year s conference report
we place the reliable replacement warhead in the context of the larger sustainable stockpile initiative which we view as a package deal with several key elements
second we propose a modest slowdown of life extension work on the old warheads in preparation for a shift to the newer replacement warheads
this is coupled with a significant increase in dismantlement rates to the committee provided for an aggressive nuclear nonproliferation program within the national nuclear security administration
we made a significant reduction to the domestic mox plant because of the large unexpended prior year balances in that project caused by the continued liability dispute with the russians
i want to thank all the members of the energy and water development subcommittee for their help in bringing this bill to the floor today
i also want to thank the chairman of the appropriations committee mr lewis and the ranking minority member mr obey for their support and for allowing us to move this bill forward in an expeditious manner
i especially want to acknowledge our agency detailees taunja berquam and felicia kirksey for their invaluable assistance in putting this bill and report together
mr chairman i share the gentleman s support of this important program and i share his goal in this field
finally i agree with the gentleman of the importance of this effort and encourage the department of energy to make the necessary budget requests in the future to continue this very important effort
mr chairman as the gentleman from florida is aware the budget is very tight this year and due to the lack of federal funds many projects the committee supported in the past did not receive appropriations this year
as the gentleman knows i have got three grandchildren living in florida so i am interested in the state of florida and i appreciate the gentleman s bringing this to our attention
it is a very comprehensive and detailed bill in a lot of scientific ways
i think also as important if not more so is the vision for the corps and the waterways in the future
also the vision for the department of energy both in the weapons area and in the area of future costeffective power for this country so that this country can compete in the world in the future are both dealt with in various stages in this bill
here in the united states we have between 250 and 300 years of a coal supply
that is more than the amount of recoverable oil contained in the entire world
i am proud to represent the anthracite coal fields of pennsylvania which have the largest anthracite coal deposit in north america arguably the largest deposit in the world
in the united states we consume about 205 million barrels of oil per day
with continued research of coal the potential of the united states becoming energy selfsufficient in an environmentally friendly manner is enhanced
in pennsylvania alone there is an excess of 200300 million tons of waste coal that has accumulated over the years
a company in gilberton pennsylvania in my district is ready to do convert this waste coal to diesel fuel and electricity on a large scale
they clean up the environment by burning waste coal reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides and air toxics develop cleaner more efficient power systems sponsor promising technologies that are too risky for private industry to undertake alone provide a model for future governmentindustry technology partnerships and provide tremendous job opportunities in this country not in the middle east
in 2002 president bush said we will promote clean coal technology the president recently outlined four important objectives that need to be included in this energy bill
these objectives are all met by clean coal programs encourage the use of technology to improve conservation encourage more production at home in environmentally sensitive ways diversify our energy supply by developing alternative sources of energy and create more energy choices and help us find better more reliable ways to deliver energy to consumers
mr chairman to begin to address the second order amendment which as i say may be technically and in parliamentary terms called a perfecting amendment but in fact it would gut the amendment it does not get at the heart of the problem which is that the tests are wrong
it can be fixed without giving the folks in the state of michigan or other automobile manufacturing areas heartburn
in fact my colleague earlier talked about how some hybrid vehicles behave differently under different situations
the tests themselves need to be changed not an afterthefact fudge factor so that when you go into the showroom to purchase a car and you see the number in the window for city mileage and highway mileage you will have a reasonable expectation that that car when used on actual american streets and actual american highways will give mileage comparable to what is posted there
the way it is today with the tests that we have your actual mileage may bear no relationship whatsoever to what is printed in the window
but what if you had something in your car that was giving you realtime information that would say turn right now and save 10 minutes and you could use that every day
multiply that by the millions of people commuting doing the same thing and it adds up to a real difference in our fuel use
suppose you had a system in your car that told you where the open parking spots are and how to get there
mr chairman i rise in opposition to the energy legislation that we are debating on the house floor today
having served in this body for more than six years i understand the difficulties in balancing competing interests to obtain a policy that benefits the nation
there are some good points in this bill
it does authorize increases in research on efficiency and renewable energy in future years
instead of investing in cleaner long term solutions this bill brushes aside our nation s future energy needs in order to provide nearly 8 billion of taxpayer dollars to the oil gas and other traditional energy industries to promote shortterm polluting energy sources
these tax incentives should not be going to industries that are thriving but should be used to invest in our future by increasing research funding for alternative energy sources such as wind energy fuel cells and fusion
everyone knows that we have a serious energy problem in this country
yet we have an energy bill that is stuck in the past that yet again seeks to drill a little deeper in a few more places
mr chairman i rise today to express my concerns with the army corps of engineers and my hope that language included in this bill will rein their disregard for congressional requests
in the 12th congressional district the environmental restoration of grover s mill pond is a most egregious example of the army corps disregard for congressionally mandated projects
located at the site made famous by orson wells war of the worlds radio broadcast grover s mill pond is not only a historic site but it is a recreation destination within west windsor township and a vital link in the township s stream corridors and watershed area
this pond in its current condition is not only an eyesore for the community and the residents that live near it but gives off an unpleasant odor in the summer
thankfully the committee has once again designated funding for this project and i expect that the army corps will follow congressional designation and not once again shortchange my constituents in favor of a project they deem more worthy
unfortunately other unfinished projects in my district such as mccarter s pond and rogers pond did not receive additional funding in this bill
i am hopeful that the strong and clear direction the committee has given the army corps in this bill will force them to complete such projects in the future and encourage them not to create such unpleasant situations in the future
i hope this legislation will serve as an important step in reforming this agency and ensuring that our communities receive the environmental restoration assistance they desperately need
we have included such beneficial programs as energy efficiency and renewable energy research and development in the areas of solar wind geothermal bioenergy and other alternative energy sources that will be critical to our future energy independence
we have also increased support for the basic sciences at the department of energy generally and focused on several programs in particular such as nanotechnology research and development advanced scientific computing research and fusion energy sciences
it is a credit to the collegial bipartisan nature of the committee on science members and staff that all of these important provisions are included in a product that both sides of the aisle can support
drilling in the arctic national wildlife refuge and liability waivers for producers of mtbe are not going to reduce gas prices today and are not steps toward a sustainable energy future
and in contrast the bill does not address increasing fuel economy standards which is a concrete step we can take to reduce energy consumption
what we need is to put a strategy in place that will help this country over time become less dependent this bill does not do enough to make this nation less dependent on energy be it from imported or domestic sources
we need a bill that focuses on our longterm future needs not one that is stuck in the past
in light of the fact that the speaker has not yet decided who he wants to appoint as conferees does the gentleman have any thought as to when we might contemplate having the conference committee meet and then of course the conference report on the floor
as the gentleman knows until the conference committee report is adopted it has the appropriations committees somewhat in limbo as it relates to allocations to the committees and then allowing us to make the 302 b allocations
mr speaker i yield further to my friend in terms of what expectations he might have as to timing from this point to when we might adopt a budget in light of the fact it is my understanding from the staff of the gentleman from california mr lewis xz4002391 that there is hope that we will start to mark up bills sometime in midmay
although they live relatively close by it is a 45minute commute in traffic and a lot of gas and they spend a lot of money on gasoline
in addition to that energy independence of course is part of our national security
so we are hopeful that we will fashion a bill in a bipartisan way that we can see passed and signed by the president
mr speaker the last item i would ask the majority leader about is as the gentleman knows the ethics process in the house is essentially at a standstill
efforts to move the ethics process forward have failed so far both in committee and on the floor when virtually all of the members on the gentleman s side of the aisle now twice have voted to table motions that would have provided for the appointment of a bipartisan task force to make recommendations to restore public confidence in the ethics process
as the gentleman knows the gentleman from maryland mr cardin xz4000640 he was sitting to my left here although he is now to my right maybe he is running for office and wants to position himself but the gentleman from maryland mr cardin xz4000640 and mr livingston performed an outstanding service for this house in coming together and adopting and presenting proposing a bipartisan ethics process
we had that in place as the gentleman knows and it was changed we believe in a partisan fashion
it reflects the bipartisan agreement of the livingstoncardin committee and the bipartisan vote of this house some years ago in adopting the livingstoncardin option
in the alternative of course when we might find an opportunity to support a bipartisan commission that could again look at this and try to get us off the dime
we want to see this institution not mired in ethical questions of our side or of the gentleman s side
mr speaker i ask the leader respectfully if he thinks that we might proceed in either direction or perhaps both and i yield to my friend
that meant as the gentleman knows that it would have to be bipartisan because the committee is equally divided so we would have to have at least one other member assuming one party was united on either side one other member of the other party to join in the disposition of a case
we believe that that was not necessary in order to protect individuals and members which we think is an appropriate dueprocess protection
every change that i know of in the ethics rules have been affected by a bipartisan agreement until this one
there were only a few votes i think we were almost unanimous on our side which is not unusual which is why the ethics rules has historically been separate and apart perhaps in the rules package but agreed to in a bipartisan fashion
what we have created is the ability of both sides to stop investigations in their tracks
what we have done however in changing the rules which were adopted in a bipartisan fashion is to allow either side to preclude the investigator from gathering the facts
that is as if we could preclude the police or the fbi or others from gathering facts that they would then in turn submit to a decisionmaker whether a grand jury to bring an indictment a prosecutor to bring a charge a petit jury to bring a conviction
mr leader we obviously have a disagreement in the perceptions as to what the rule does and does not do
it is my suggestion that resolving this in a way that is bipartisan will be productive for the house
the fact is though that it would be in the best interest of this house and this country for us to resolve these matters in a bipartisan way either through as our leader has proposed a commission to be a joint commission equally divided as was the livingstoncardin commission or in the alternative to consider hr 131
we did vote against the rules package but we had agreed to the components and there was no controversy about the ethics component in the rules package
there were other things with which we disagreed obviously but that was an agreement and it was reached in a bipartisan fashion
this was not reached in a bipartisan fashion
and yes as both parties usually did i can remember it is getting more difficult to remember but i can remember when we were in charge and your side used to vote unanimously against our rules package and we pretty much do the same because we have some disagreements
it was not on these provisions as you know because a change was made not in a partisan sense according to the gentleman from maryland mr cardin xz4000640
but i would hope that in the coming days we could move towards in a bipartisan fashion move towards resolving this issue
that does not mean that some democrats will not vote for it but none of the ranking members were involved in this policy and they are not voting for it
as a bipartisan group of 26 national security officials including robert mcfarlane president reagan s national security adviser and jim woolsey president clinton s cia director recently stated in a letter to president bush it should be a top national security priority of the united states to significantly reduce its consumption of foreign oil
in fact at a time of record profits for the oil and gas industries these traditional energy producers stand to reap 93 percent of the tax incentives in this bill or 75 billion
renewable energy and conservation receive only 7 percent of the resources allotted in this bill
it would provide more than 22 billion to the oil and gas and other energy industries in tax breaks direct spending and authorizations
furthermore the problem with it is that is why we do not have an energy bill because the majority leader demanded of the senate that that be in there and the senate would not take it
madam chairman the best way that i can characterize this bill is that it is a jurassic park bill in that it is about dinosaurs of dinosaurs and in a sense by dinosaurs
if you drill in mt
and it is a dinosaurlike philosophy that we should decide to subsidize technology being developed in the late 1800s in 2005
we should be giving these subsidies to the nascent wind solar wave power energyefficient cars so we can build energyefficient cars here rather than in japan
that is not what happened to this bill where 94 percent of the subsidy goes to an industry the most profitable in american history one company had 8 billion profit in the third quarter last year on your 55 a barrel oil
that is what is going on in this bill
madam chairman the gentleman from alaska mr young xz4004401 asked a very important question where are the technologies that we can use to avoid having to destroy the character of one of our most pristine areas in america
you see starting in 1975 it went up dramatically because we had a bipartisan consensus to demand to use existing technologies to improve our automobile efficiency
the fact of the matter is these are not future techno dreams that someone has dreamed up in their garage somewhere they are technologies that exist today
we need to get back on the fuel efficiency wagon as we were in the 1980s on a bipartisan basis and not put a mustache on the mona lisa
mr chairman i would just in support of this amendment report how successful our country has been previously with this experience
i want to point to a graph showing our fuel efficiency in 1975 that when we were adopting fuel efficiency standards rocketed up and almost doubled to 1985 then stopped when we lost our commitment to fuel efficiency
the average fuel efficiency today is less than it was in 1985
we were successful in driving safe efficient fuelefficient cars
we can do it in america
it will do so by cutting in half the royalty that is scheduled to be applied under the blm criteria
we are actually quite high probably in the neighborhood of almost twice sometimes what the private sector and private lands charge
this is very similar to a provision we passed last year in the energy bill and it really follows the tremendous growth of wind energy we are experiencing
well actually wind energy is growing about 30 percent a year which is rather a herculean growth rate that we are having and that is because we have abundant wind energy thankfully in this great land of ours
i know in many places we are having success with wind
in washington state we are proud of the largest wind farm in the north american hemisphere at state line washington which has about 263 megawatts powers about 25 000 homes
we have several projects in washington state in fact on public land in washington state we have at least 600 acres very eligible for economically efficient production of wind energy
actually wind energy has been reduced in price this decade by 80 percent
the gentleman from california mr pombo xz4003220 was good enough to agree to an amendment in the resources committee to state a national goal of generating 10 000 megawatts of renewable energy from our federal lands within the decade
this is one small step in that direction
denmark hopes to have 50 percent of their electrical content generated by wind and other renewables in 2025
this is not pie in the sky it is very achievable
we want to grow those jobs here in america eventually have a domestic wind turbine job base industrial base and we have a lot of jobs to create hooking up those wind turbines
i want to thank the gentleman from texas mr barton xz4000180 the chairman for the very fairminded way that he handled this in committee in giving both sides an adequate degree of leeway to argue their positions
in recent years we have seen a sweeping consolidation of the oil industry at almost every level the manufacturing level wholesalers refiners and retailers
most people who live in a community for a long time are accustomed to talking about their local service station where they know their mechanic and their owner where they know the prices but those days are in the past
in 2002 the senate committee on government reform permanent subcommittee on investigations studied consolidation of fuel refineries
the subcommittee s findings are now over 3 years old and are alarming in their prescience
this amendment would achieve that goal and give us the data we need to ensure that consumers are protected from price inflation and our small business owners can compete in a fair market
there have been a number of studies but each study has been conducted almost in a vacuum without considering the entirety the entire scope of this problem a problem that is putting small independent retailers out of business and driving up prices on every street corner in america
mr chairman i rise today in support of mr castle s amendment
under current law three new liquid natural gas facilities have been constructed in recent years and six others approved
current law permits construction of liquid natural gas facilities but it does nt do what this bill in its present form would do virtually guarantee construction of liquid natural gas facilities in any location where there is a strong energy demand regardless of state and local concerns that arise
in fact these concerns and state and local governments ability to represent them ought to be elevated in importance
the leadership of this house has turned a deaf ear to the concerns of long islanders and to the many americans in predicaments like my constituents
before moving forward with any legislation in regards to liquid natural gas facilities this body must fully vet the issue through hearings and the commissioning of appropriate studies
i have an amendment that i will be discussing later on in the day that speaks to the purpose of my standing today in general debate and that is to make i think the declaration that we clearly need to have an energy policy
my amendment will engage farmers and ranchers in texas and all over the nation to give them extra training and resources to assess the availability and viability of bioenergy
but it is important that although this legislation may not be all that we want it to be the very fact that there is going to be a review of electricity and transmission is important the very fact that we acknowledge the high cost of gasoline even though i might say to my distinguished friend from tennessee i offered an amendment that might determine why there is such an increase in gasoline prices why the transportation costs are so high and of course that was not allowed
this is not a getyou time in america
i want jobs in my community
in fact i had an initiative that would report on the deposits in texas and louisiana offshore so that we could be more independent of foreign oil and do more domestic drilling in a safe and environmentally manageable way
in some sense yes that global warming is not mentioned that more of the environmental emphasis is not mentioned but if we do not move from point a to point b to point c to have a real energy policy there will be no way if you will to ensure for the american people a safe and secure america
for example the bill provides for much needed advances in energy efficiency renewable energy and nuclear
according to recent studies overall prices are rising because of the razorthin supply and demand balance in the global crude oil market ie
the increase demand for oil in china and india has played a major role in driving up oil prices around the world
in addition the situation in iraq has not helped
unfortunately there seems to be no end in sight to this problem
according to the energy information administration eia prices in 2005 are projected to remain high at an expected average of 228 per gallon for the april to september summer season 38 cents above last summer
monthly average prices are projected to peak at about 235 per gallon in may
as in 2004 the primary factor behind these price increases is crude oil costs
in the united states additional changes in gasoline specifications and tight refinery capacity can be expected to increase operating costs slightly and limit supply flexibility adding further pressure on pump prices
while these may be the facts it does not sit well with my constituents back in texas and for that matter with all americans
thus as the bill moves along the legislative process i will be working with members and industry to establish a sense of the congress that the secretary of energy acting through the administrator of the energy information administration should commence an immediate investigation on the causes of high gasoline prices in the united states and in collaboration with the petroleum industry and the congress develop a solution to such prices
it is important for me to mention that i will also work with members of congress to encourage the secretary of the interior in consultation with other appropriate federal agencies every 2 years to transmit a report to the congress assessing the contents of natural gas and oil deposits at existing drilling sites off the coasts of louisiana and texas
for this reason the 18th congressional district can claim wellestablished energy producing companies and suppliers as well as those engaged in renewable energy exploration and development
everything we as consumers eat touch or use in our daytoday lives have energy costs added into the price we pay
today our society is in the midst of major sociological and technical revolutions which will forever change the way we live and work
we know that the geological supply of fossil fuel in not infinite but finite
we know that our nation s best reserves of fuel sources are in the forms of coal and natural gas among others
i appreciate very much the 47 billion in funding provided to the army corps of engineers but let me express my disappointment that we have not been able to stretch the dollars to provide work on new projects
more importantly having worked on legislation dealing with inland flooding i can tell you that flooding is a very serious issue in my district
might i also acknowledge my concern on the funding for nonproliferation in nuclear weapons
while i wish we had been able to include more dollars in this area i am pleased that we were able to increase their funding by 8 million over last year
i want to join the gentleman from texas mr gene green as relates to our port in houston a very important economic arm but also an entity that needs a great deal of oversight and funding for security and also operation
new projects are extremely efficient in job creation and there are many competitive projects across the nation
i appreciate very much the 47 billion in funding provided to the army corps of engineers but let me express my disappointment that we have not been able to stretch the dollars to provide work on new projects
more importantly having worked on legislation dealing with inland flooding i can tell you that flooding is a very serious issue in my district and i would look forward to working with this appropriations subcommittee through conference to be able to provide some greater assistance
mr chairman might i also acknowledge my concern on the funding for nonproliferation in nuclear weapons
while i wish we had been able to include more dollars in this area i am please that we were able to increase their funding by 8 million over last year s levels
there are several elements of debate between the majority and the minority and between the house and the administration but in general it seems that a fair compromise has been reached
new projects are extremely efficient in job creation
there are many competitive projects across the nation and in my district which should have been provided for
we are being accused on every front of employing double standards as we march on in war and talk about peace in the middle east as we spurn our own neighbors in cuba but ask people in the occupied territories or in korea or in south asia to forgive and forget as we talk about liberating people but allow tens of millions to die from hivaids in africa
but considering the box we are in i believe our appropriators have done an admirable job here to fund important priorities and serve the nation s energy and water needs
yet i am very disappointed in the support for the yucca mountain nuclear waste respository at an amount of an additional 310 million
the project needs more consideration and more study there is much opposition in nevada and the people of that great state deserve better from this congress
in a desire to pass any comprehensive energy bill some of my colleagues may be willing to overlook the massive damage that this bill would do to our existing clean air policies
as a matter of fact i acknowledge and applaud txu and ups for their efforts in the right direction in north texas but section 1443 of hr 6 would give polluters in dirtyair areas extra time to continue polluting
section 1443 would delay the adoption of urgently needed antipollution measures in communities throughout this country for a decade or more
my amendments presented to the committee on rules would have corrected this or would have also given some time for the companies to record their progress but of course they were not made in order
this provision will mean more asthma attacks hospital visits and premature deaths for residents of the ozone odor nonattainment areas which includes the area that all my great friends over here live in and i live in
mr chairman i thank the gentleman for yielding me this time and i rise in strong support of the markey amendment
according to the us geographical survey this area would produce far less oil than the us consumes in a single year and is the only conservation area that protects a complete spectrum of arctic and subarctic ecosystems in north america
the ecosystem will be seriously damaged by drilling in the anwr make no mistake about it
drilling supporters claim that everything can be done in the refuge using ice roads and platforms
but even if ice roads did not melt in summer months the reality is that there is simply not enough water in the refuge to create the roads and platforms necessary to drill in the anwr refuge
that means the only alternative truly is permanent gravel roads crisscrossing the refuge and in fact there is not one oil field in alaska s north slope that does not have permanent gravel roads
in fact the federal government the state of alaska the arctic slope regional corporation and others are in the process of leasing 50 million undeveloped acres in this region
or if just california increased their use of currently available clean diesel technology cars pickups and suvs just to the levels seen in europe today just california could save 110 million gallons of gasoline by the year 2010
so this vote is not about oil it is about our values and how we balance the value we place on a critical environmental resource and its ecosystems and the value we place on exploration in a lowyield area
mr chairman i rise in opposition to this amendment
this question specifically was litigated in 1985 in the dc
and the adjustment in information that the rogers amendment to my amendment brings is an amendment that will bring down the miles per gallon for those that are high achievers and bring it up for those who are actually low achievers
my amendment has a goal of taking a small step toward energy independence in the following way we have something called a strategic petroleum reserve managed by the department of the interior which has in that reserve about 700 million barrels of oil allowing us to maintain a temporary shield from increased costs on oil
the purpose of my amendment only allows it does not require the secretary of energy the discretion of including ethanol biodiesel and other alternative fuels in the strategic fuel reserve
ethanol and other biobased fuels are two of the ways in which america can truly become more selfsufficient in fuel production and usage
it is projected in another 15 years our imported petroleum will rise to 75 percent
by 2050 most easily drawndown reserves in the world will have been drawn down not just by our country but by nations like china for example which are using more and more petroleum every year
we simply can not live in the 20th century any more
increasing use of renewable fuels will result in significant economic benefits to our nation as well
for example biodiesel production is dramatically increasing going from about 5 million gallons in 2001 to five times that much this past 2003
and congress expanded the existing reserve in 2000 to include the northeast home heating oil reserve
biodiesel for example contains no sulfur or aromatics associated with air pollution and the use of something like biodiesel provides a 785 percent reduction in co 2 emissions when compared to petroleum diesel
without question the farmers across this country need new value added and with the price of oil skyrocketing and it really will not go down it has not gone down in the last 30 years if you look at the progression of oil pricing in the spot markets for example
i think we here in congress should respond to that inventiveness and that desire of the american people to invent their way to a new fuel future
and in fact when you come to my part of the country and you look across the fields you can see part of america s future in the fields of the future and fuels of the future that will be produced on them and are being produced on them more and more every day
if the gentleman and my colleagues could read the amendment it does not prescribe any format for the secretaries of energy or interior to use in creating this reserve
in fact the reserve could actually be stored in the form of the raw material which is processed very easily and can be done immediately because the processing technology is on line
so it literally could be the type of commodity credit corporation booking that we use for other grains in our country and other material that we use in refining of alcoholbased fuels
so it does not say to the secretary that they have to buy it in this form or store it in a given form
but nonetheless it would be available in the country
so if i could beg the gentleman as we move towards conference perhaps i would like to move forward with this amendment in some form to find a manner in which it can work and with which the gentleman is comfortable
dear congresswoman kaptur on behalf of the over 260 000 members of the national farmers union we write in strong support of your amendment to hr 6 which will establish renewable fuel reserves as an important foundation to lessening our dependence on foreign oil
thanks to your leadership your legislation can help store renewable fuels in case of possible future consumer disruptions
all it does is it allows for 30 communities in our country to adapt alternatively fueled vehicles in their public fleets as well as some of the infrastructure to support it
it allows for those competitive grants to be in the amount up to 15 million as opposed to 20 million
this is not a sustainable position for the united states particularly when spot markets in oil are ringing in at over 50 and 55 a barrel
every family in america is feeling the pain of this
so this program will help us move forward millions of vehicles in the public realm that can help us transition to a new age of energy independence
if we but use our fleets in a wiser way and help transition to these new fuels we can make a difference in the pockets of every single american and leave a better world to our children
today there are 187 000 retail locations in our country from which we purchase our fuels but only 400 stations across 38 states sell e85
i know that the jeep liberty that is rolling off the lines in toledo today has for the first time in us history a 5 percent biodiesel blend as original equipment called b5
someday we are going to get that up to b20 and the farms in ohio that surround the cities that some of us live in are going to provide that fuel
and that money is going to be going in their pockets
we are going to have a new fuelbased age in this nation
i get pretty excited about this because i have seen the future and it is in ohio and it is in iowa and it is in nebraska
mr chairman it is definitely in texas
and we want to be able to use that fuel in a new way
however i firmly believe that we must pursue domestic energy independence in a manner that protects our natural resources like the arctic national wildlife refuge
i am proud to say that my state of minnesota is a leader in the field of renewable energy such as ethanol biodiesel and wind energy
mr chairman on behalf of the citizens of pascoag rhode island who have lived with contaminated water from mbte i rise in support of the capps amendment
in my home state of rhode island the citizens of pascoag were unable to use their water for months due to this contamination
but the provision in this bill that seeks to protect mtbe manufacturers is simply yet another one of many that puts the needs of individuals and families below the requests of industry in this dangerous bill
i will tell my colleagues in rhode island we would welcome the chance to have our gas piped in from some other country because the fact of the matter is our state knows as every other state that has an lng facility knows that if we were to ever have that explode it would decimate a 50mile radius
it threatens the jobs of workers in flint bay city saginaw and other communities in my congressional district and in my home state of michigan
it undermines the hard work of our auto companies and auto workers that is being made through the investment of billions of dollars in alternative fuels and advanced technology vehicles
the drastic increases called for in this amendment would have negative consequences for passenger safety and consumer choice
mr chairman i rise in strong opposition to this amendment
i want to read from a good friend here who says such a proposal would dramatically affect the functionality and performance of vans pickup trucks and sports utility vehicles that consumers in america want and that is by the united states chamber of commerce
one in 10 jobs are related to the auto industry
so we rise in opposition to the johnson amendment and ask that our amendment be considered because the testing is there
it doubles the cost for product and it allows the competition to be more advanced in our competition war than we are now considering
the auto industry in america is fragile
we all know that they have invested millions of dollars in their products to make them better make them fuel efficient do alternative energy sources
consumers deserve to know that the sticker in their window actually reflects the mileage they will get on the road
this will ensure that this measure will improve consumer information regarding mileage without imposing an increase in the stringency of cafe or creating a second fuel economy test for consumer labeling
depending upon the test procedure changes implemented the stringency of the cafe standards could increase by 1020 or up to a 6 mpg increase in the stringency of the cafe requirements
mr chairman i thank my friend from new york for not only offering the amendment but providing a very important point in this debate and that is unfortunately the underlying bill is not going to work because it lacks one crucial element and that is vision the vision to see that we need to pivot off the status quo of the current energy policy and move to a new energy plan that makes sense for a new century
the fact of the matter is and the dirty little secret in this place those involved in energy policy have to admit it is that no matter how many incentives we give to the oil companies how many royalty relief provisions are loaded in this bill even though the president who comes from the oil industry says that it is not necessary given the high price of oil is that we can not produce our way out of the energy challenge that we are facing in this century
we are already in a race against china and india for the limited oil supplies that exist throughout the world
mr chairman i rise in support of this amendment to make this junk food energy bill just a little bit healthier
added to the rest of title 20 this will put 483 million of taxpayer money into the already deep pockets of big oil during a time in which they are reaping record profits
in fact an april 8 2005 wall street journal article relates the news that exxon mobile recently reported a fourthquarter profit that amounted to the fattest quarterly take for a publicly traded us company ever 84 billion
in addition the oil royalties the federal government does not collect from big oil will starve the land and water conservation fund of critical financial resources
in a time of serious budget deficits immense war costs and a sluggish economy we can not afford to grant such outlandish subsidies to some of our nation s largest corporations
mr chairman i rise in opposition to the energy policy act
yet once again the majority refused to work in a bipartisan fashion to craft a balanced and sensible energy bill that meets america s needs
in fact an april 19 2005 wall street journal article relates the news that exxon mobile recently reported a fourthquarter profit that amounted to the fattest quarterly take for publicly traded us company ever 84 billion
of the 8 billion in tax incentives less than 500 million would go to promote renewable energy sources or foster efficiency and conservation programs
in a recent interview president bush said i will tell you with 55 oil we do nt need incentives to oil and gas companies
the few brightspots of the bill like tripling the amount of gasoline sold that contains enthanol by 2012 promoting safe and clean nuclear energy developing the liquified natural gas infrastructure needed in our country ensuring electric reliability and easing transmission all have been overshadowed by the bloated excess and taxpayerfunded subsidies for some of our nation s largest oil and gas companies
mr chairman there are unfortunately many more very bad provisions for american taxpayers in hr 6 and title 20 in particular much of which is premised on a drill at taxpayers expense approach to the management of energy resources on public lands
perhaps the best example is the issue of drilling in the arctic national wildlife refuge
and there are other provisions that standing alone make this a bad bill such as the royalties in kind provision granting broad authority to the secretary of the department of the interior for permitting alternative energyrelated uses on the outer continental shelf and reimbursing oil and gas companies for doing the environmental impact studies that are required under law
and buried deep in this bill under the title named miscellaneous there is another provision that could have major consequences for communities struggling to clean up their dirty air
in considering the most significant change in the clean air act in 15 years i must note the irony that we are just days away from celebrating the 35th anniversary of earth day
in addition the majority party has stuck in the bill a provision that would limit the ability of coastal states to challenge offshore oil and natural gas production
apparently the majority party in congress no longer has much regard for the 10th amendment
i urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this energy bill that does little to lessen our dependence on fossil fuels or the fossil fuels industry dependence on taxpayer dollars
i think the rule however could have been a little stronger if the schwartz amendment would have been made in order so we could have had further discussion about the need for increased investment in alternative and renewable energy technologies
we have two nuclear facilities that are storing a lot of nuclear waste in the upper mississippi river region right now
many of us feel it makes sense to have a single isolated nuclear waste repository in this country and the studies that have gone into yucca mountain and the funding that this committee is providing it seems to me to be a reasonable and practical approach dealing with the nuclear waste issue
this was a program that was created in the mid1980s to strike balance on the multiple uses of the mississippi region in the upper states
one is habitat restoration for the upper mississippi basin and the other is long term resource monitoring to monitor the effects that sediment and nutrients are having in the basin
one of the first things i did as a new member of congress was help form a bipartisan mississippi river caucus so we could work together from both the north and the south in order to draw attention to the resources that are needed along the mississippi river
finally mr chairman i would commend to my colleagues and include for the record an article that just appeared in the washington post sunday edition under the travel section called lolling on the river it describes the quality of life and unique beauty that the upper mississippi river basin has for all of us in that region
in it the author of the article bill obrian writes the mississippi the river of mark twain who once wrote it is not a commonplace river but on the contrary is in all ways remarkable the river of lasalle marquette and joliet of bb
of historian stephen ambrose who not long ago wrote the river is in my blood
i commend the subcommittee and work they have done in recognizing by fully funding emp the importance of this vital natural resource
lolling on the river following the upper mississippi by land if you think the prairie of wisconsin and minnesota is nothing but nondescript flatlands and farms buena vista park in alma wis is the place for you
specifically the bluff in the park more than 500 feet above the mississippi river which forms the border of the two states
from that bluff on a clear day you can see one of the most aweinspiring panoramas in all of north america
the vista from the bluff in alma on a clear day can compete with any of those places
from that bluff in alma you can immediately understand what wisconsin outdoors journalist mel ellis meant half a century ago when he wrote if you have nt fished ol man mississipp forget about any preconceived notions you may have as far as rivers are concerned
in fact he s a hundred rivers and a thousand lakes and more sloughs than you could explore in a lifetime northeasterners by birth and temperament my wife sue and i knew almost nothing firsthand about life along the upper mississippi
the mississippi the river of mark twain who once wrote it is not a commonplace river but on the contrary is in all ways remarkable the river of la salle marquette and joliet
of historian stephen ambrose who not long ago wrote the river is in my blood
we covered a minuscule portion of it a couple of hundred miles mostly in southwestern wisconsin primarily along state route 35
dressed in camouflage hunting gear he was standing on the riverbank in the upper mississippi river national wildlife and fish refuge with his dog sidney
the next morning at withey s bar in lynxville wis
176 we introduced ourselves to a softspoken gentleman in a flannel shirt sitting on a stool at the end of the bar
les neefe told us that he was born 77 years ago in a wisconsin cheese factory not in a hospital not in the hallway of the cheese factory in the cheese factory
in a room above the boiler
over coffee neefe rhapsodized about the pleasures of living in a houseboat docked on the mississippi six months a year and he made two recommendations
first he suggested that to get a real taste of wisconsin we should go to the cheese shop up the road in ferryville and buy some sharp cheddar old sharp cheddar then to get a real taste of river life we should stop by p amp m concessions next to blackhawk park in de soto
i ca nt think of anywhere i d rather be than right here said kroning a mother of five who was born and raised in de soto
we go to a cubs game once a year in chicago and i m a nervous wreck the whole time so what is the allure of the mississippi
typically 15 barges are connected together in front of one pilot boat
and that he d rather toil on the upper mississippi than on the lower especially in the dead of summer because down near new orleans and memphis it s too hot and the skeeters are bigger than i am an hour north of genoa on state route 35 not far past la crosse wis we came to perrot state park a verdant 1 400acre refuge
it s 2 350 miles long it s home to 100 species of fish most notably walleye sturgeon and catfish in these parts it drains all or part of 31 states and two canadian provinces
some of it s true some of it s not we met schleicher a 65yearold retired car salesman at the municipal marina in red wing minn the final town on our river drive directly across the bridge from hager city wis
paul minn to its mouth in louisiana
for 10 apiece he offered to take us on a leisurely twohour cruise in his old military flatboatturnedriverboat
once we cleared the dock schleicher allowed each of us in the small group on board to take a turn piloting the boat for a few minutes
i rise today in strong support of hr 6 the energy policy act
we need a balanced energy policy in this country and this bill takes great strides towards achieving that balance
therefore i am in strong support of this energy bill that allows for exploration in the arctic national wildlife reserve anwr which will allow for more domestic supply of oil
the surge in natural gas prices over the last 4 years has been a key reason why nitrogen fertilizer costs have jumped by nearly 50 percent at the farm level
this rise in prices has contributed to the growing reliance on imported fertilizer
for that reason i am in strong support of the natural gas provisions in this bill and would urge members to oppose amendments that would weaken any natural gas provisions in the bill
i urge my colleagues to vote in favor of the energy policy act
madam speaker i thank the gentlewoman for organizing this special order and i ask the gentleman from idaho if he would pause a moment to engage in a brief colloquy with the gentleman from idaho mr otter xz4003050 because the gentleman holds some expertise and that is the need to continue to build refineries in this country crude oil refineries
could you speak for a moment about what we expect will happen with refinery construction in this country if we pass the energy bill as it is presented
energy first of all is a component in everything that we buy
if there is any one item that adds to inflation in all the products that we purchase in this country it is energy because it takes energy to produce anything it takes energy to deliver anything and it takes energy to go pick it up and buy it
if we do not have an effective energy policy we are paying more for all goods and services in this country than is necessary and that means it makes us less competitive in the rest of the world
we know how much energy we bring in across from the middle east and venezuela and other parts of the world that is imported into the united states
but we sit in this country on a significant supply of domestic crude oil
this bill puts in place the motion to construct the refineries that we need so that we can bring the crude oil in and get it refined
as i asked the people up there around the kaktovik area they said yes we have to go hunt the caribou during a certain time of the year but really the resident caribou in the drilling area are only in there from midmay until the end of june
they come in to calve and then they leave about the end of june
nothing is going to move during that period of time except the caribou and when those young calves get old enough to walk back they go back over to canada out of the area so nothing would be going on in that region when the caribou were there
it is kind of a caribou maternity ward in that part of alaska
the concern about someday running out of crude oil why would you keep it in the bank forever when we have other opportunities for different energy supplies that will be developed as science and technology catches up
by the way the alaska pipeline if the north slope oil runs out and it looks like it is heading in that direction that pipeline has to stay full almost all the time or it starts to erode inside the pipe it turns to rust and it may not be able to be put back up on line
that is a huge and valuable resource that began construction there in about 1972
in that same region is all of the natural gas that is already developed that we do not have a good way to deliver it to the lower 48 that is the pipeline
we have done i think what we can do here at least for now but we need that natural gas we need it into the corn belt we need it for a lot of the reasons that the gentleman from colorado said and i am glad he is in here talking about corn and ethanol with regard to energy
in the part of the country where i come from we have constructed ethanol production to the extent that within the next 2 years we will be able to say that we have built all of the ethanol production all the plants that we have the corn to supply in the fifth district in iowa the western third of iowa
biodiesel is coming along in the same shoes as ethanol only a lot faster because they have learned from the people that blazed the trail in ethanol
we have tremendous wind energy that has been put in place there in the last 4 to 5 years
so we sit in this country without being able to get the pipeline down from alaska where the gas is it is already developed and that is a process that if all goes well could maybe get done in 6 years
but within the lower 48 states earlier we saw the map of the layout of the natural gas along the east coast the west coast and the outer shelf around florida and in the central part of the united states
one of these esteemed gentlemen has made the statement on this floor and i am going to repeat it and i believe it and that is that we have enough known natural gas reserves underneath nonnational park public lands in the united states of america to heat every home in america for the next 150 years
people in the corn belt pay going into the ground with their fertilizer and then when they take that grain off the field in the fall they have to dry the grain and most times what do they dry it with
so we are more susceptible to high natural gas prices than maybe any place else in the country and we have watched because of that the fertilizer production go offshore to places like venezuela and russia
i remember what happened with the oil cartel in the late seventies when they shut down the oil delivery to the united states and the prices went up
we could be in that same situation with venezuela and russia if we let them take on any more of the fertilizer production
we mentioned the solar energy as a component and that is going on in some of the parts of the country
one of the other things i am concerned about is we have not built a nuclear plant in this country in a generation
mr chairman i rise today to urge funding to redraw the flood plain maps that would assist in addressing flood plan management problems along the missouri river
coupled with that is the fact that the recently completed upper mississippi river system flow frequency study which includes the mainlower missouri below gavins point dam resulted in significant this need for new information is due to the changes in land use and the pressure from development occurring all along the river
estimates indicate that the annual cost of this provision could be in the range of 175 billion
mr chairman there is no better way to look at this issue than through the eyes of a young soldier stationed in the middle east
look into the eyes of a 10yearold american and think of him or her and vote for policies which will make it much less likely that any president would ever ask them to return to harm s way in the persian gulf
in what has become a congressional ritual the prospect of drilling in the arctic has been repeatedly struck down in recognition of the fact that american working families do not want it
some of the nation s largest unions i might point out like the seiu united auto workers united steelworkers and united farm workers are on record opposing drilling in the arctic refuge
one dollar spent on petroleum production creates only 151 in economic value
but that same dollar when invested in energy efficiency creates 223 in economic value
our nation s energy policy should not include drilling in the arctic
mr chairman i want to concur with the gentleman from michigan mr stupak xz4003910 who spoke in favor of a federal ban on drilling for oil or gas in the great lakes
we in cleveland understand that the great lakes contain 20 percent of the earth s fresh water surface and supplies drinking water for over 40 million people
in canada where they permitted drilling an average of almost one spill per month has been documented
why would any state want to take the responsibility of drilling in the great lakes and thus poisoning the well for the rest of america
mr chairman i enter my statement in the record in support of the solis amendment
mr chairman no one wants an oil refinery in their neighborhood
so in order to force one open this bill encourages them to be established in neighborhoods with high unemployment or recent layoffs
the university of texas and the houston chronicle studied the air near refineries in the houston area
i want to express my appreciation to the chair for accepting the modification and my appreciation to the gentlewoman from ohio ms kaptur xz4002110 who i have worked with on this amendment that would double the number of department of energy clean city programs that could apply for a pilot program to invest in alternative fuel vehicles
we can grow our way out of our energy crisis and farmers growing biomass feedstocks that can be processed locally to supply in our case nearby cities such as cleveland and toledo can help us do that
mr chairman i rise in support of the israel amendment
in cleveland ohio my district people do not understand why prices vary from street to street
the gentleman s study is so important because it will provide some insight into pricing into how the market is set up and the small and independent gas station owners who are getting squeezed in the market are going to have their cause elevated
now mustard seed has many advantages over other feedstocks including higher oil content it is easier to grow in colder and drier climates of the us and the conversion process leaves behind an organic pesticide and herbicide
now mr chairman mustard seed has roots deep in all cultures and it is specifically mentioned in the bible
mark in the fourth chapter talks about the kingdom of heaven and says it is like a mustard seed which when sewn in the earth is less than all the seeds that be in the earth
but when it is sewn it groweth up and becometh greater than all the other herbs and shooteth out great branches so something that was understood in the intelligence of the world thousands of years ago needs once again to be recognized because what we have here is a crop that gives a great potential
well this is an opportunity for us to show not only faith in the good will of this house to help america take an important step towards sustainable energy but also faith in alternative energy and faith in our own nation
mr chairman i rise today in opposition to hr 6 the energy policy act
i believe every member in this chamber agrees that our country faces a potential energy crisis if we do not act quickly to establish a new national energy policy
we need to make major investments in energy selfreliance infrastructure and new technologies
it astonishes me that the nation that mobilized to put an american on the moon is not leading the world in developing new clean and renewable energy sources
although transportation is the largest source of oil consumption in the nation hr 6 authorizes drilling in the arctic national wildlife refuge rather than making modest improvements to automobile fuel efficiency standards
instead of investing in renewable energy sources 93 percent of its 81 billion in energy production tax incentives are targeted toward gas oil and other nonrenewable sources
hr 6 includes a liability exemption for manufacturers of mtbe the fuel additive that has contaminated the groundwater of communities throughout the nation including in pascoag rhode island
it also strips states of their ability to provide for the safety of their citizens by granting the federal energy regulatory commission almost unlimited authority in siting new liquefied natural gas facilities
a recent study by the department of energy noted a deliberate attack on a lng tanker could result in a deadly fire reaching as far as a mile away
nevertheless ferc is considering an application for a lng facility in providence in proximity to interstate 95 schools neighborhoods and rhode island hospital the only level trauma center in the state
today the day before earth day we are considering an energy bill that provides massive tax breaks to the oil and gas industry instead of investing in cleaner renewable sources and energy efficiency
again congress has identified a problem and responded in a fashion contrary to the longterm interests of our nation
i am deeply disappointed in this measure and urge my colleagues to vote against it so that we can refocus our efforts on an energy policy for america s future
mr chairman i just want to first of all express what an honor and privilege it is to work on a subcommittee that works in such a bipartisan way with the great leadership of the chairman and the ranking member
madam chairman first let me just say i want to thank the gentleman from massachusetts mr markey xz4002530 for yielding me the time for his leadership and the gentlewoman from connecticut mrs johnson xz4002051 for her leadership in making sure that this is a bipartisan amendment
by allowing drilling in the arctic refuge we are spoiling a pristine natural environment we are furthering our dependence on oil and we are contributing to high levels of asthma such as in my own district in west oakland and throughout the country
mr chairman i rise in support of this bill
i would first like to thank the chairman of the subcommittee mr hobson and the ranking member mr visclosky for their work in putting together the energy and water appropriations bill
i also want to thank both of them for including 48 million in the bill to continue funding the port of oakland s 50foot dredging project in my district in california
as the fourth largest container port in the country the port of oakland serves as one of our premier international trade gateways to asia and the pacific
consumers in my state are struggling with soaring gasoline costs
the price of gasoline in michigan today is 36 cents a gallon higher than it was just 1 year ago
steep increases in the price of natural gas have resulted in skyrocketing increases in consumers home heating bills over the past few winters
the leadership of the house has brought a bill to the floor that will do little or nothing to reign in energy prices
according to the bush administration s own energy information administration the policies contained in this legislation will have a negligible effect on energy production consumption imports and prices
there s 33 billion in oil and gas production tax incentives plus a number of royalty holiday provisions for energy extraction on public lands
the new york times reported in february that the major oil companies are largely uninterested in drilling in the refuge skeptical about the potential there
even the plan s most optimistic backers agree that any oil from the refuge would meet only a tiny fraction of america s needs the crusade to drill in the refuge is a distraction
in the past i believe that we have tended to delay our process because we decided we had to wait until the budget process was already complete and we let supplementals interfere with that process et cetera
so in the past we found ourselves sending our product to the other body just as we go past the end of the fiscal year hardly giving them the time to do the kind of work that they would like to do thus the omnibus et cetera
in fact it might just make the problem worse
this bill was conceived in darkness and born in a den of iniquity
mr chairman i rise today in opposition to hr 6
it rolls back important safeguards in the clean water act and the safe drinking water act which are critical in keeping our waterways clean and safe
at this time in history it is crucial that we work to reduce our dependence on foreign oil by prioritizing energy efficiency and renewable energy
of all the tax incentives in hr 6 only 7 percent are designated to encourage renewable energy and conservation while billions of dollars in tax breaks are funneled to the oil and gas industries
on top of these tax breaks provisions in this bill would provide as much as 2 billion over ten years to companies who drill in the deep waters off the gulf of mexico
instead of increasing corporate giveaways at a time when oil and gas companies are raking in record profits we must redouble our efforts to support renewable energy and conservation
we have 150 000 young men and women over in the middle east protecting our country in that region and largely as well the oil supplies coming into our country
this bill does nothing in order to deal with that problem
in fact the department of energy analysis of an almost identical bill in the last congress concluded that changes to production consumption imports and prices are negligible
this bill tramples on the right of state and local governments to protect their citizens from potentially dangerous energy facilities such as large liquefied natural gas terminals that would be sited right in the middle of densely populated cities in our country even though we know they would be the number one terrorist target constructed in that city
there is a special provision in this bill to protect halliburton from ever facing any federal regulation of a practice of drilling for oil using the hydraulic fracturing technique that actually injects diesel fuel into the water supply
there is a special provision in the bill that provides a 13 billion subsidy to the idaho national laboratory to build a special advance nuclear reactor to produce hydrogen for the hydrogen car
bad bill vote no mr chairman i rise in opposition to hr 6
i have the greatest respect and affection for the chairman of the committee the distinguished gentleman from texas mr barton but i must say in all honesty that this is really a terrible energy bill
in fact i would suggest that this bill is a bit like that old clint eastwood spaghetti western the good the bad and the ugly there is a tiny bit of good in the bill like extending daylight saving time by a month in the spring and a month in the fall
now that was a good idea it really was and i m glad that the gentleman from michigan mr upton and i were able to get it in the bill
but in all honesty i think i have to say that for the most part what we have here before us today is one truly bad and ugly bill first let s take a look at the bad this bill does virtually nothing to address the current spike in crude oil prices or the price of gasoline at the pump
in fact a department of energy analysis of an almost identical bill in the last congress concluded that changes to production consumption imports and prices are negligible this bill would open the pristine arctic national wildlife refuge to oil and natural gas exploration even though there is such a small supply of oil and gas there that most of the oil companies have pulled out of the coalition trying to open it to drilling
this bill tramples on the right of state and local governments to protect their citizens from potentially dangerous energy facilities such as large liquefied natural gas lng terminals sited right in the middle of densely populated urban areas
this bill gives utilities who dam the public s waterways special rights to appeal and change conditions federal resource agencies placed on their hydropower license in order to protect fish the environmental irrigation navigation or other public uses of our nation s rivers
there s a special provision in this bill for home depot that preempts several states existing or proposed energy efficiency standards for ceiling fans
there s a special provision in here to protect halliburton from ever facing any federal regulation of the practice of drilling for oil using the hydraulic fracturing technique that actually injects diesel fuel into acquifers
there s the special provision in the bill that provides a 13 billion subsidy to the idaho national laboratory to build a special advanced nuclear reactor to produce hydrogen for the hydrogen car
this is not what a national energy policy should be a tiny bit of good in a sea of bad and ugly provisions
instead this bill offers up the false hope that drilling in the arctic refuge will solve our energy problems ignoring that the united state s 3 percent of world oil reserves will never match our 25 percent of world oil consumption
for some fuzzy math we would sacrifice the last great wilderness in america an area biologically unique within the american arctic
democrats in this body along with our colleagues in the senate will fight to ensure that the bad and ugly provisions that presently make up the bulk of this bill are deleted or revised
mr chairman i claim the time in opposition and i yield myself 3 minutes
madam chairman i rise in opposition to the barton manager s amendment
let me just begin by saying that inside of the bill there was a provision that i authored in the committee on energy and commerce that was accepted by the chair by the majority
now when you think of all the pollution that comes out of smokestacks that is created by the generation of electricity from coalfired plants or from gasfired plants to create electricity well that electricity is being created in order for the most part to keep our lights on our airconditioning on to make sure that we can live in a modern society
now at the department of energy in the first 5 years of the bush administration they have yet to have a new rulemaking that would improve the efficiency of any of these appliances
now the cumulative impact of that is that we are going to see unfortunately several hundred new coalfired or gasfired generating plants constructed in america
well in addition to the cost to consumers who are going to have to pay for these new plants you also have all of the additional pollution
we have a rise in breast cancer and prostate cancer and other diseases
the majority in its wisdom has decided they are going to impose no burdens on anyone who makes any appliances in america so they have to improve their efficiency which is very typical of the entire bush administration s approach to these technologies
but the impact of having all of these window air conditioners furnaces lighting fixtures heat pumps 3 years from now 6 years from now 10 years from now being just as inefficient as they were 5 years ago is that all this additional pollution has to go into the air the carbon the mercury the sulfur the nitrous oxide that is inhaled by children in our country
and i just think it is wrong without any consultation with me to take my amendment and put it in this manager s amendment to have it deleted from the bill
it just wants to put a big new gas station on top of the arctic wilderness or on top of any other pristine area in our country rather than looking at the technological genius of our country to find some way of improving our efficiency
so even with regard to new standards in this manager s amendment they give this administration 6 years 6 years to come up with new standards even as the bush administration has not done anything for the first 5 years of its term of office at the height of an energy crisis knowing the consequence of all of this pollution going into the atmosphere in terms of its impact upon the health of our country
my colleagues just so you know women in japan contract breast cancer at only onefifth the rate of american women
women in japan contract breast cancer at only onefifth the rate of american women
women in japan contract breast cancer at only onefifth the rate of american women
that means it is not in the genes of the girls it means it is in our air it is in our water
well that is going to be breathed in all that mercury all that sulfur and nitrous oxide and it is going to have a dramatically negative impact upon the health of our country
the provisions which are in the bill already are good
it ensures in other words that they can get the real job done
it also provides real transparency on pricing and trading of electricity in this marketplace
all of the kinds of activities which were identified in the aftermath of the enron and the related scandals is prohibited and the authority is given to the ferc in order to make sure that they get the job done
it is one of the few places remaining in america where man has not scarred the land
if we allow the oil and gas drillers into this refuge we might as well say goodbye to protection of all 544 refuges in this country
the arctic national wildlife refuge is the crown jewel of the wildlife refuge system in the united states
overturning the 39year precedent of never leasing a wildlife refuge to the oil companies where leases did not previously exist will set in motion a series of events that will endanger each of the other 543 refuges spread throughout the states and districts of the members of this body
besides the wildlife refuges drilling in the arctic refuge is widely seen as the first step in lifting the moratoria on drilling on the outer continental shelf of the atlantic and pacific coasts specifically in florida and california
the chairman of exxonmobil recently said that drilling in the arctic refuge is representative of the broader issue of whether drilling will be allowed in other environmentally sensitive places such as the coasts of california and florida
in a 2003 speech to the republican caucus house majority leader tom delay proclaimed the issue of the arctic refuge is about precedent and repeatedly referred to its symbolism
matthew simmons an oil industry banker and former bush adviser recently told the new york times that if you can not do anwr you will never be able to drill in the promising areas
instead of making those vehicles more efficient what they have decided to do is to construct a gasoline station on top of the arctic wildlife refuge in order to fuel those inefficient vehicles
we put 70 percent of all oil that we consume in america into gasoline tanks
in 1975 we averaged 13 miles per gallon we averaged 13 miles per gallon in 1935
but congress because of the energy crisis passed a law mandating a doubling of the standards in 10 years and the auto industry responded and by 1986 the average was 27 miles per gallon and we had opec on its back
we have gone backwards 4 miles per gallon and played into opec s hands as the price of oil goes up to 50 to 55 to 58 a barrel as consumers are tipped upside down every time they go into a gas station in order to pay to fill up their car
in other words to add only 6 additional miles per gallon over what was accomplished in 1986
well we put a man on the moon in 9 years
we improved the fuel economy standards in 10 years by 13 miles per gallon in the 1970s and 1980s but now we are being told that we do not have any longer the ability to do that
what we need is to put a strategy in place that will help this country over time become less dependent
but the president then went on to call upon congress to pass the republican energy bill a bill replete with a rich assortment of tax and deregulatory incentives for the oil and gas companies to explore even though they are essentially already drowning in windfall profits
that is all extra cash in the oil companies pockets
so the president i think has to rely upon his own energy department because his own energy department has acknowledged that this bill that we are debating would result in only negligible changes to overall demand production and imports a bill that the energy department acknowledges will actually increase gasoline prices at the pump between 35 and 8 cents a gallon
so even though the president says the oil companies do not need incentives to drill when prices are so high in this bill we are providing more than 3 billion in tax incentives to big oil
if members do not want to support increasing fuel economy standards for suvs and automobiles so we can take on opec what we have is another series of alternatives that can be engaged in which are much less draconian but will at least give us some improvement in the way this country interrelates with gas oil and other energy sources
mr chairman i rise in support of the amendment offered by the gentleman from new york mr bishop and i am pleased to join as a cosponsor of this amendment
what we need is to put a strategy in place that will help this country over time become less dependent
but the president then went on to call upon congress to pass the republican energy bill a bill replete with a rich assortment of tax and deregulatory incentives for the oil and gas companies to explore a bill that the president s own energy department has acknowledged would result in only negligible changes to overall demand production and imports a bill that the energy department acknowledges will actually increase gasoline prices at the pump by between 35 and 8 cents a gallon
so even though the president says the oil companies do nt need incentives to drill when prices are so high we are providing more than 3 billion in tax incentives to big oil
it gives the ftc the power to require full disclosure by refiners and distributors of fuel pricing policies costs and profits so consumers will be better able to determine whether the oil companies are profiteering from the current volatility in oil markets
our amendment also would extend the renewable energy production tax credit for 5 years so that companies know that there will be incentives out there to make the investment in building new solar wind geothermal and biomass technologies so we can become less dependent on coal and natural gas to generate electricity
our amendment strikes the cap on energy savings performance contracts an important tool used by the federal government to reduce the amount of energy consumed in federal buildings across the country
our amendment would put in place three additional appliance efficiency standards commercial packaged air conditioners and heat pumps residential dehumidifiers and commercial spray valves used in restaurants
in addition under the amendment efficiency standards for residential and commercial furnaces and boilers which have been languishing over at the energy department for more than 10 years would be speeded up
we would strike the home depot ceiling fan language that immediately preempts state ceiling fan standards before there s even a federal standard in place
mr chairman this photo behind me is an lng tanker in boston harbor delivering lng to everett massachusetts
the republican bill eliminates the state and local participation in determining where a facility like this would be placed
in america there were two of these facilities in 2001
six more have already been licensed by the state governments and the federal government in the united states
but it would be very dangerous to exclude the communities that are most affected especially when states know they need the lng we admit that but we want to put it in more remote areas in the state or perhaps offshore and have it be piped in
but the republican majority says no we want to put it in the most densely populated areas and wall out all governors all state officials
mr chairman this issue is one of whether or not you want the federal government to decide if you are on a coastline in the united states that an lng facility is coming to your district
if you want your governor your mayors to have a role some role in deciding where an lng facility is located which would have catastrophic consequences if there was an accident or terrorist attack you vote aye on the castle amendment
if you just want the federal government to decide in the middle of your district where this most attractive of all terrorist targets will be located then you vote no but understand the consequences on the floor today
i think perhaps when we get the final bill out of conference with the senate there may be more in the bill
but to rail against the oil and gas industry as the gentleman did and the provisions in the underlying bill that provide tax incentives for exploration and development of our oil and gas reserves in this country to me rings empty because the substitute or the amendment that is before us that the gentleman spoke in favor of does not strike any of those provisions in the underlying bill
what this amendment does do is basically double the cost of this bill at least the tax provisions in this bill
we have not had time and the chairman of the committee on energy and commerce spoke about the number of pages in this amendment we have not had time frankly to analyze it from a budgetary aspect to see if it violates the house budget we have already passed
but it takes the cost of tax provisions in this bill from about 8 billion over 10 years to about 17 billion over 10 years
now the accounting gimmick as the gentleman from washington put it is called lifo last in first out
it is in common usage and there is a reason
the reason is if we insisted on industry of whatever kind accounting for first in first out it would lead to distortions in the market and it would lead to business decisions based on tax considerations instead of market considerations
last in first out is something commonly used throughout industry not just the oil and gas industry
there are regulations in place to keep them from shifting their inventory around to take advantage of the accounting rule
it is a very sound accounting principle used throughout industry in this country
so i would urge this house not to listen to the words of the gentleman but look at the action embodied in the amendment
this amendment does nothing to the underlying tax provisions in the bill
it doubles the cost of the bill and it would impose upon the oil and gas industry just one industrial sector in this country a retroactive tax increase because under his accounting change those companies would have to go back and recapture what they would have paid in taxes and pay them prospectively over the next 10 years
i hope we have concluded in this body that retroactive tax increases are bad policy
the republican legislation favors corporate america over main street in america
nothing in this bill will lower gasoline prices a single penny
nothing in this bill will alter our dependence on oil
nothing in this bill will address the needs and concerns of the american people facing economic peril at the pump every morning when they put 50 worth of gas into their car
maybe that explains why oil and gas companies have reduced their investment in facilities by 20 percent even as their profits have increased 400 percent
we are grossly wasting our energy resources and other precious raw materials as though their supply was infinite president jimmy carter spoke those words in 1976 almost 30 years ago
it proposes cutting billions in promising renewable energy provisions
the democrats propose and i proposed in the committee on ways and means something radically different in our alternative energy bill actually paying for it
it means last in first out
democrats are proposing something else investing in the 21st century energy sources
that benefits americans and encourages a paradigm shift in thinking to produce energy by saving it
we are addicted to oil and as long as we remain addicted to oil we are not going to get any better in this whole area
we see in america where people are not faced with choosing gasoline over food
republicans want americans firmly rooted in the past relying on fuel sources that make us vulnerable to too many foreign countries
page 1 line 7 through page 2 line 1 of h res 219 states all points of order against consideration of the bill are waived the rule makes in order hr 6 the energy policy act of 2005 which contains a large unfunded mandate on state and local governments in violation of section 425 of the budget act
mr speaker back in 1995 my republican colleagues the socalled champions of states rights led the fight to pass the unfunded mandates reform act a bill they claimed would stop the federal government from imposing the costs of federally mandated programs on states and localities
in all mtbe has been detected in over 1 800 water systems which serve 45 million americans
cbo concludes that the annual cost of this mandate over the next 5 years is likely to exceed 62 million which accordingly triggers the unfunded mandate law republicans so proudly backed in 1995
mr speaker the house can either choose to consider this bill in spite of the bill s unfunded mandate or it can send this bill back to committee and strike the mtbe section from the bill eliminating the violation of this point of order
i know my colleagues all have great confidence in the cbo
he said the congressional budget office is a professional organization that assists the united states congress in knowing in a nonpartisan way those impacts on the laws that we pass
well here it is in black and white
chairman based on a preliminary review of hr 6 the energy policy act of 2005 as introduced in the house of representatives on april 18 2005 cbo estimates that enacting this legislation would reduce direct spending by 11 billion over the 20062010 period and by 04 billion over the 20062015 period
hr 6 contains numerous mandates as defined in the unfunded mandates reform act umra that would affect both intergovernmental and privatesector entities
based on our review of the bill cbo expects that the mandates new requirements limits on existing rights and preemptions contained in the bill s titles on motor fuels title xv nuclear energy title vi electricity title xii and energy efficiency title i would have the greatest impact on state and local governments and privatesector entities
cbo estimates that the cost of complying with intergovernmental mandates in aggregate could be significant and likely would exceed the threshold established in umra 62 million in 2005 adjusted annually for inflation at some point over the next five years because we expect that future damage awards for state and local governments under the bill s safe harbor provision title xi would likely be reduced
that protection would be in effect as long as the fuel is in compliance with other applicable federal requirements
the provision would not affect other causes of action such as nuisance or negligence under current law plaintiffs in existing and future cases may stand to receive significant amounts in damage awards based at least in part on claims of defective product
based on the size of damages already awarded and on information from industry experts cbo anticipates that precluding existing and future claims based on defective product would reduce the size of judgments in favor of state and local governments over the next five cbo can not determine whether the aggregate cost of the privatesector mandates in the bill would exceed the threshold established in umra primarily for two reasons
measures against the costs that would be incurred if current law remains in place the cost to the private sector of extending this mandate would exceed the annual threshold established in umra 123 million in 2005 adjusted annually for inflation
and today we are considering the rule for another important bill the energy bill and the committee on rules made in order 31 amendments this time
but while this may seem to be a small step in the right direction it is a far cry from where this house should be
important amendments on important issues like global warming a topic not even mentioned once in this bill and mtbe liability protection were denied a vote by the heavy hand of the committee on rules and the republican leadership
so we still have a long way to go before democracy is restored in this house
this bill is actually worse than the bill the house considered in the last congress
in just the last 7 weeks gasoline prices have ballooned to 228 per gallon nationwide
in my home state of massachusetts gas prices have risen over 40 cents per gallon in just 1 year
instead it gives kickbacks in the form of tax breaks and subsidies to oil and gas companies which will actually increase the price of gas at the pump
in all the energy industry would receive 8 billion in tax breaks under this bill despite their recordhigh profits
the president s budget called for 67 billion in tax breaks for energy with 72 percent of these tax breaks going toward renewable sources of energy and energy efficiency
but under this bill only 6 percent of the 8 billion in tax breaks goes for the renewable sources of energy and energy efficiency
in a recent statement before the american society of newspaper editors president bush said i will tell you with 55 oil we do nt need incentives to oil and gas companies to explore
what we need is to put a strategy in place that will help this country over time become less dependent if the president is really looking for that sensible strategy he will not find it in this bill
so if this bill does not help control the price of gas at the pump decrease our dependence on foreign oil or invest in renewable sources of energy what does it do
currently both ferc and states play a role in the siting and environmental review of the proposed lng facilities
so why is this provision in the bill
to date neither the house nor the senate has held a single hearing on this issue in supporting this language
the lng provision in this bill directly undermines the ability of state and local officials to ensure that any new lng facility is not sited in an area where it could pose a danger to the surrounding community
on november 21 2003 the department of homeland security warned of an increase risk of terrorist attacks noting of particular concern al qaeda s continued interest in targeting liquid natural gas chemical and other hazardous materials facilities
in my district there is a proposal to construct an lng storage tank in fall river
the tankers that would deliver the lng would have to pass under two bridges in rhode island and two bridges in massachusetts
so if this site were approved thousands of american citizens would be in danger from an explosion or a spill
they have instead pushed for more remote siting in areas less densely populated
so i am pleased that the rule makes in order the castlemarkey amendment which would strike section 320 from the bill and i urge my colleagues to join me in voting for this amendment
as the mayor of a community involved in this debate over lng import terminal siting i am concerned that language currently contained within this draft of the energy bill would severely minimize or take away the right of local and state governments to participate in the process of siting lng import terminals
further i am not convinced that we are currently engaged in a process that would appropriately balance energy interests with homeland security concerns
mark prescott chief of the coast guard s deepwater ports standards division was recently quoted in an april 3 2005 newsday article as saying is it easier to protect an offshore facility
probably not but the consequences of something happening there are far less than the consequences of something happening in a ship channel in the middle of a city if the coast guard recognizes that lng import terminals if placed in offshore or remote settings would pose less of a risk to the public in the event of an incident then why does nt the rest of our government
in this same article the coast guard also spoke to the issue of security for lng tankers in offshore or remote settings in conclusion i vehemently oppose and believe that other local and state officials around the country involved with this lng import terminal siting debate would also oppose any attempts to remove or abridge a state or local community s right to be involved with any and all review processes that pertain to lng import terminals
very truly yours edward m lambert jr mr speaker we have heard about the mtbe provision in this bill
this is a very real problem in many communities across the country and the republican leadership should have at least had the guts to allow an upordown vote on the capps amendment
for years the oil industry has targeted this coastal plain and under the guise of national security they have argued that without access to oil in the arctic we will continue to be dependent upon foreign oil
opening anwr to drilling sets a precedent for the opening of other protected areas in the future
so to my friends in california and florida they should know one thing they are probably next
out of 90 amendments that were offered last night in the committee on rules there were 22 democratic amendments made in order
thanks for making the 22 amendments in order but quite frankly it is not enough
as my colleagues have heard from various members here today a lot of important amendments were not made in order
her amendment was not made in order
the gentlewoman from texas ms eddie bernice johnson xz4002040 just talked about her clean air amendment which was not made in order
the gentleman from west virginia mr rahall xz4003310 had a coal amendment which was not made in order
that was not made in order
her amendment was not made in order
that was not made in order
well it has taken more than 4 hours but they have finally reluctantly recognized that at least on this occasion a democrat the gentlewoman from california mrs capps xz4000620 has a right to offer an amendment a good amendment that strikes a provision in this bill that protects polluters and penalizes taxpayers
in 1995 the republicans passed a law called the unfunded mandates reform act
according to the congressional budget office not the gentlewoman from california mrs capps xz4000620 not the gentleman from massachusetts mr mcgovern xz4002630 not the gentlewoman from california ms pelosi xz4003140 but according to the congressional budget office the mtbe provision in this bill is a big fat unfunded mandate
let me say to my friends in the republican leadership you could have avoided the scene we saw on the house floor today
mr chairman i rise in strong opposition to this imbalanced energy bill which allows big energy companies to exploit our natural resources at the expense of us taxpayers
the bill includes a safeharbor provision for mtbe manufacturers even though the chemical has been detected polluting groundwater sources across the nation including in massachusetts
and the bill would open the door to oil and gas exploration in the arctic national wildlife refuge a pristine habitat that would yield less than threetenths of a percent of world oil production by 2015
at current production levels the us supply of oil will only last another 20 years while the oil supply in saudi arabia is estimated to last another 75 years
mr chairman i rise in strong support of the boehlertmarkey amendment
we know that raising the standard to 33 miles a gallon over the next 10 years which this amendment would do would save 10 percent of the gas we will consume and we know that we have the potential in this country to make cars and light trucks much more efficiently
we have a choice do we want an energy future that is stagnant and dependent on traditional sources or do we want a future that will break new boundaries in innovation and technology reduce our dependency on foreign oil increase conservation and efficiency and ensure the security of our nation
mr speaker i thank the gentleman for yielding me time and i rise in strong support of this point of order
simply saying in the legislation that this is not an unfunded mandate does not make the fact that it is not an unfunded mandate
we have communities throughout california that have had environmental and economic havoc wreaked upon them from the use of mtbe in many instances as the gentlewoman from california mrs capps xz4000620 pointed out after the knowledge was available and was continued to pursue the use of this compound as an additive to the fuels of our automobiles
to suggest now that we are going to provide a safe harbor that we are going to restrict the liability or prohibit the liability from those who knew of the dangers of this to our environment to our drinking water supplies to our citizens and on the other hand we are going to direct communities to clean this up when in fact the resources will not be available to do that they are not there at the local level and they are not forthcoming from the united states
mtbe is just another way in which this congress this republican leadership wants to corrupt the process by which these communities can be made whole
this bill is another missed opportunity to take america into the future to take america into the leadership around the world in energy production energy innovation and energy technology to create a new generation of important products and a new generation of jobs
the first is achievable in the national interest and the other is not
oil independence is not achievable in this bill or in any bill you can bring to the floor
to date these ideas have been treated as a stepchild as they are in this bill
in fact it harms the consumer at the pump by increasing the price of gasoline
in fact it drives us deeper into the dependence on the most unstable countries in the world into the hands of those countries that simply can not provide stable environments for the production of those energy resources
this bill resides in the past century
this bill resides with the old ideas and it certainly resides with the old and tired subsidies that milk the taxpayers to turn around and give them to now the most profitable companies in the american economy at this time
mr chairman of all of the subsidies and all of the giveaways in this bill this one itself may be the most egregious
this is royalty relief to those companies who are drilling in deep water
these companies are drilling in deep water no matter what they do because that is where the oil is and it is very lucrative to do so
this is not about royalty relief this is about a handout to the most profitable companies in the united states
that means mr and mrs taxpayer in america did not get the royalties that these companies should have paid them to drill on the public lands that the taxpayers of this country own
mr chairman i rise in opposition to this legislation and in support of the markeyjohnson amendment to protect the arctic national wildlife refuge
i am pleased to be an original cosponsor of the udalleisenhower arctic wilderness act and am diametrically opposed to drilling in the refuge
markey recently stated we must draw the line against drilling in our few remaining pristine habitats set aside specifically for preserving wildlife for future generations
if we allow drilling in the arctic national wildlife refuge there will be no place in america so special that it can not be opened up for commercial exploitation unfortunately the environmental ethic holds no value with this white house or a majority of my colleagues in this chamber
if the shortfall in supply takes on crisis type dimensions the transition will be much more disruptive economically and socially
let s not drill now squander our last reserve of oil and gain nothing in improved economic security
support the markeyjohnson amendment oppose drilling in the refuge
mr chairman i rise in support of the boehlertmarkey cafe standard amendment
i deeply regret that a majority in this congress for years blocked the department of transportation from raising the corporate average fuel efficiency standard for automobiles and trucks then when the white house changed hands in 2001 and perhaps confident that no real action to raise standards would occur the restriction was no longer included as a rider in the appropriations bills
this short sighted policy has placed us squarely in the situation we are in today
nothing is likely to have a greater impact in accomplishing this goal than making our transportation sector more fuel efficient
mr chairman i rise in vehement opposition to this legislation
it even has the same bill number hr 6 as last time as if it were photocopied with complete indifference to the disturbing news and international developments that have come to pass in recent years
while demand from the us and other industrialized nations is growing on average 12 percent the situation in developing nations has radically altered
demand for oil in these countries is now growing at an average of 27 percent annually
in china demand for oil is growing at almost an exponential rate
another sign of concern is that indonesia a member of opec became a net importer of oil in 2004
these recent increases in worldwide oil demand are not a onetime phenomenon there re here to stay and will continue to squeeze markets and push oil prices ever higher
the social and economic disruptions caused by this temporary disruption in supply were felt for more than a decade
are we prepared or are we preparing ourselves for some permanent downward decline in supply
why are we rushing to exploit pristine wilderness areas like the arctic national wildlife refuge and bestowing more tax incentives on some of america s most profitable companies and individuals to tap our last domestic sources of domestic oil and gas when these sources wo nt even make a dent in our oil and gas needs
had we improved efficiency through higher cafe standards 27 miles for light trucks and 33 for cars back in the early 1990s we could have displaced all the oil we imported from opec today
we have been shortsighted in our energy policies preferring to influence shortterm prices keeping them artificially low while ignoring the longterm consequences of programs and policies that promote greater consumption and profligate waste
energy information administration 2002 figures 405 quadrillion btus world 98 quadrillion btus us mr chairman this bill is deficient and heads our country in the wrong direction
we have lost some 3 million manufacturing jobs in this nation related to higher natural gas prices since 1999
in the last 5 years 90 000 jobs from the chemical industry alone have been lost because of higher natural gas prices
we have doubled the price of fertilizer which increases the price for farmers which is passed on in higher food costs
homeowners have seen a 55 percent increase in natural gas prices in their home
if we want to increase the supplies if we want to lower the cost if we want to save jobs in america that so many people talk about here all the time we have to have more natural gas in this country which means we should be opening up safe opportunities allow states to monitor this all of which is in the energy bill
this amendment is modeled after a very successful program which my colleagues and i initiated in 2001 through the gateway cities region
the gateway region is comprised of 27 cities throughout southern los angeles county one of which has the highest pollution area in the state of california that i and the gentlewoman from california ms millendermcdonald xz4002750 and the gentlewoman from california ms linda t snchez and other members represent
in 2000 the gateway region was identified in a study as having some of the highest levels of toxic exposure caused by diesel emissions in that whole region
mr chairman as my colleague from texas knows the electricity title is very very important to my consumers and my constituents in the southeast as well as in the northwest and one of the provisions in the title that is not there is regarding participatory funding
since that is a fairly standard thoughtout thing in regional transmission organizations i am concerned that the bill does not have any language in there to assure me and my constituents that they are not going to have to pay extra
madam chairman i had an opportunity to go up to and visit in alaska the gentleman from alaska s chairman young district
and as the american people are paying upwards of 250 a gallon for fuel today and we sit in the white building on capitol hill i wonder what they are thinking out there
but i believe that the radical environmental groups have been using this as a fundraising tool for their organizations because what they say is in anwr and what we see when we get there does not exist
dear friend in a few short hours the republican energy bill will be brought up for debate and a vote on the floor of the house of representatives
last week in the energy and commerce committee i offered a series of amendments to increase the average fuel efficiency of cars minivans and suvs
each of these amendments was voted down by the republican majority on the committee ensuring that the most technologically advanced nation in the world will continue to ignore energy conservation and not diminish its demand for oil
i then offered an amendment in the resources committee to strip a provision from the bill that would open the arctic national wildlife refuge for oil drilling
the republicans on that committee voted against my amendment choosing to set up a gas station in this pristine national refuge
if we allow drilling in the arctic national wildlife refuge we will forever ruin this unique wilderness and allow the oil industry to target all 540 national wildlife refuges for drilling and exploitation all for a few meager months worth of oil
furthermore drilling in the refuge is completely unnecessary
if we were to increase the average fuel efficiency of cars minivans and suv s by only three miles per gallon we would conserve more oil in ten years than could ever be produced by drilling in the arctic national wildlife refuge
for the last five years i have led the battle in the house to stop the republicans in congress from selling off one of our greatest natural treasures to the powerful special interests
if this bill passes we will create more pollution forever spoil one of our most important and beautiful public lands and be forced to continue placing our soldiers in harm s way in defense of oil in the middle east
while the government s overall energy strategy is now being discussed in a conference on hr 6 the bill before us today provides a vital additional component of the nation s energy policies
although the appropriations committee provided more funding that the president in certain areas they still achieved a modest but real reduction in total spending for this bill compared with fiscal year 2005
hr 2419 provides 297 billion in appropriations for fiscal year 2006
the bill complies with section 302 f of the budget act which prohibits consideration of bills in excess of an appropriations subcommittee s 302 b allocation of budget authority in the budget resolution
the bill provides 238 billion in discretionary ba to the department of energy doe a reduction of 390 million from the 2005 enacted level
res 95 did allow for an advance appropriation in the elk hills account the committee on appropriations provided for it with a current year appropriation
the bill also defers 257 million in previously appropriated funds for the clean coal technology initiative until fiscal year 2007 providing 257 million in ba savings for 2006 and an equal increase in 2007
this will recover a projected 581 million in fiscal year 2006 with remaining 10 percent or 65 million funded from the general fund of the treasury
in conclusion i would like to commend chairman lewis and the appropriations committee on their steady work in bringing bills to the floor that comply with h con
mr chairman i rise in support of the oberstarnorton amendment
the amendment authorizes the administrator of the general services administration to install a photovoltaic solar energy system photovoltaics in accordance with the sun wall design project on the forrestal building the headquarters building of the department of energy located on independence avenue in washington dc
in fact the sun wall design was selected as the winning design in an national contest sponsored jointly by the department of energy and the national renewable fuels laboratory
the project design was completed 5 years ago in 2000
in fact the time is long past overdue
hr 6 does include provisions aimed at increasing energy efficiency in our public buildings
i am especially pleased to see in the bill section 205 regarding the procurement and installation of photovoltaics in federal buildings generally which i offered and which was accepted as an amendment during consideration of the energy bill last congress
the sun wall project is an opportunity to have the department of energy headquarters building in our nation s capital the building where energy policy is debated and refined stand as a testament to the utility and promise of photovoltaics
in a city of monuments the sun wall project would be a monument to america s commitment to advanced technologies alternative energy and a cleaner environment
i could well envision a procedure that would require the epa to coordinate in a consultative process with the department of energy to resolve environmental issues but the crafters of this bill have i would say knowing the gentleman from texas not intentionally but unintentionally overreached
private parties could locate wharves docks other structures in the water that would obstruct commerce but the corps of engineers has permitting authority that says no you can not do that
with this language the secretary of energy could throw out a century of regulatory authority for example in the case where a refinery has been denied a permit to build a structure in a navigable waterway
mr chairman as members of this house know when i have objections to the content of a bill i am not shy in stating them
i think that the gentleman from ohio and the gentleman from indiana working together in an absolutely bipartisan fashion have produced a bill which is obviously based on some intellectual decisions about how to approach problems rather than being based simply on political judgments and that means that this place is performing as it should perform
that is happening in no small measure because of the leadership of the gentleman from ohio mr hobson xz4001800
that does not mean that i do not think this bill does not fall short in some areas
i think that the budget resolution has made it impossible for this committee to do a number of things that it ought to be doing in the area of energy research
lord knows that is important these days with rising gas prices and all of the rest but i just want to say in my view despite those shortcomings this bill demonstrates that good government is good politics
the gentleman has brought to the floor a bill which is extremely responsible in terms of the way it deals with the nuclear weapons issues that were referenced by the gentleman from indiana
while i have feelings about nuclear power that are very different than some other members in this chamber i want to say i think the gentleman has produced with the assistance of the gentleman from indiana a very responsible bill and i fully intend to support it
but with that exception i do not think we can ask for a better legislative product and as someone who appreciates the traditions of this house i want to extend my personal gratitude to the gentleman from ohio for his contribution in making this the fine product that it is
interestingly enough here this year in 2005 we will produce 45 billion so we are almost there
ethanol today is produced in 20 different states and i predict that within a few years using biomass all 50 states in the union will produce some form of ethanol
we certainly could hit 7 or 8 percent in this country
i can not go through the process that we did last week in formulating this energy bill without thinking of a childhood poem and it goes like this i saw a group of men in my hometown i saw a group of men tearing a building down
for with common labor i can tear down in a day or two what it took a builder 10 years to do and so i thought to myself as i walked away which of those roles am i going to play
are we going to put in place today a public policy that will serve this nation in our competitive efforts with the rest of the world
i can tell you there is no other place in the world that this argument is going on of whether or not we are going to energize our natural resources energize our native creative genius in order to provide the cheapest and the most abundant and most reliable energy source that we possibly can
fortunately for us with the leadership of our chairman the gentleman from texas mr barton xz4000180 we were able to come out of the committee with a great energy bill and in a bipartisan fashion
in fact i myself have voted on this energy bill
although i have only been in this congress for 4 years and 4 months i have voted on the energy bill four times with the great hope that was going to be one thing as a member from idaho s first congressional district i could leave as a legacy
as the gentlewoman from tennessee mrs blackburn xz4000320 mentioned early on we have not built a refinery in this nation in nearly 30 years
garyville louisiana was the last refinery we built in this nation and yet every day we continue to consume more and more refined gas
so our capacity to consume is increasing yet our capacity in relationship to produce and to refine is dwindling
one of the reasons i did that was because there are several idaho concerns down there probably mining more coal than any place else in the word and mining more silver and gold than any place else in the world
there is an exploration company that is environmentally responsible in their exploration and in their research and development for venezuela s natural resources
we are relying on building up their economy in order to support our own rather than doing that ourselves
we heard many many times in the committee as the gentlewoman from tennessee mrs blackburn xz4000320 will be able to attest to we heard many times from the opposition those who would not build but rather tear down that there is not one permit that is waiting to go through the bureaucratic process not one permit in the united states
one thing i found out in caracas venezuela every us oil company that owns a refinery in the united states is down there today asking for a permit to build one in venezuela
in the united states you can sit around for months and years and then decades before you finally get a permit
they said we come down here and we can get a permit in 6 to 8 months
we have to bond it and do everything we do in the united states
the other thing that this bill looks to is something that a lot of people in the united states do not realize
if a refinery today one in garyville louisiana should happen to come across some new technology and that new technology would say they could increase their efficiency or their production capacity or their yield and it happens to be more than 10 percent they do not want to do it
madam speaker i appreciate the opportunity to review some of the facts and figures that we have in the committee
so one of the things that we have to do along with the construction of the refinery along with the potential operation of the refinery is we have to prepare educating the chemical engineers in our colleges and there have not been really jobs at least in the united states that have been forthcoming because of the lack of appreciation if you will for the refinery business in the united states and for the gas and oil business in the united states
madam chairman i rise today in support of the energy bill that we are discussing on the floor
all we are suggesting in this energy bill is that we need to recognize the dynamic forces that are at play in today s economy and that we need to take steps to correct it
for instance natural gas in this nation is hovering in the 7 range but if we look over in the asian areas and in russia it is 95 cents and 70 cents
we are drilling on some offshore platforms that cost billions of dollars to set in place
we are drilling on those with great risk that we will lose money and what we are simply saying is that deep well incentives should be in place
now the incentives that are in place for onshore production are either very difficult areas to drill in or the incentives only kick in after the price falls to a certain level
the consumers in this nation depend on it and they are depending on republicans because our friends on the other side of the aisle refuse to help
mr chairman i rise in support of the abercrombie amendment
what we are engaged in today is just trying to find commonsense suggestions to really sustain the american way of life
mr chairman i rise today in support of the abercrombie amendment
this amendment will authorize a modest program to develop ethanol from sugar cane which would be added to fuel in hawaii to meet the epa clean air act requirements for oxygenated fuels
the state of hawaii also mandated a 10 percent ethanol blend for gasoline in the state in order to improve the state s air quality
if hawaii grew corn they would already be receiving tax credits for ethanol production like almost every other state in the nation
congress has decided ethanol production is worthwhile and has provided at least 10 billion in incentives and tax credits since 1978 when an alcohol tax exemption was made law
congress should pass this amendment in order to have a consistent ethanol policy
in the 19992000 period the price of oil fell to 6 for new mexico type of oil
revenues in service companies like ours fell to 20 percent of the original values
although my wife and i were able to keep every employee for the duration of that period of time about 11 months many many of the firms laid off 68 to 70 percent of their employees and gave pay cuts in the industry
that is the sort of cyclical thing that we face in the oil and gas industry and now that the price has come back up literally there are no workers to be had because they do not wanted to come back to a cyclical industry
the viability of our oil fields really is going to determine the price of natural gas and petroleum in this economy
i want to commend four of our ranking members the gentleman from michigan mr dingell xz4001100 of the committee on energy and commerce the gentleman from west virginia mr rahall xz4003310 of the committee on resources the gentleman from new york mr rangel xz4003330 of the committee on ways and means and the gentleman from tennessee mr gordon xz4001550 of the committee on science for their exceptional leadership in presenting an alternative view to the republican bill that is on the floor today
madam chairman the american people deserve an energy policy that is worthy of the 21st century not one mired in the policies of the past but a bill that looks forward not backward
it is imperative that our country have an energy policy for the future and it is a matter of national security that we reduce our dependence on foreign oil so that we will be able to take care of our own security and not have to send our troops in harm s way for oil
it is critical to our environment that we invest in emerging technologies and renewable energy and invest in energy efficiency and conservation
the republican bill was conceived in secrecy
the price of gasoline is approaching 3 in some parts of our state and nationwide gas prices are up 42 cents above a year ago
of 81 billion in tax incentives in the bill 75 billion a staggering 93 percent is for traditional energy sources such as oil natural gas nuclear power and electricity transmission
indeed this bill makes it easier for oil drilling in protected areas off our magnificent coastlines
the provision on the gasoline additive mtbe a few drops of which can poison entire drinking water systems the provisions in this bill for mtbe are a breathtaking example of pandering to special interests
instead of eliminating mtbe now remember i said a few drops can poison entire drinking water systems instead of eliminating it now the bill gives the mtbe industry 9 years for a phaseout and it would give mtbe producers liability protection in contamination lawsuits
you are poisoning the water supply you do not have to stop for 9 years you have no liability for contamination and on top of that we are going to give you 2 billion in subsidies 2 billion in subsidies to help mtbe manufacturers
the provision on mtbe included in this bill at the majority leader s insistence killed the bill in the last congress and the gentleman from texas mr delay xz4001040 the majority leader is insisting on including it again this year
in fact this is the majority leader s bill that we are debating today
i particularly commend her for her resourcefulness in bringing this amendment to the floor
i rise in support of the gentlewoman from california s amendment to strike really this disgraceful mtbe giveaway and i commend her for seizing the opportunity to offer this amendment
mr chairman as we discussed yesterday in general debate a few drops of mtbe can poison an entire drinking water system
in fact there was a deliberate attempt by the mtbe producers to hide the groundwater impacts of their product from congress
mtbe contamination of groundwater and surface water is a major problem in my state of california and many drinking water wells have had to be shut down because of this contaminant
mtbe contamination has been detected in all 50 states and a recent study indicates that it costs between 12 billion and 63 billion to clean it up
the gentleman from texas insisted on the mtbe provision in the last congress even at the cost of killing the energy bill
in fact this is the majority leader s bill we are debating today
and a loophole in this very law may even allow mtbe to be used indefinitely
it gives mtbe producers liability protection in contamination lawsuits and it gives a 2 billion subsidy to mtbe manufacturers
but in their attempt to shield mtbe producers and big oil companies from accountability republicans have created a huge unfunded mandate for states and localities and it is taxpayers who are stuck with the bill
that is why the gentlewoman from california mrs capps xz4000620 was able to get this amendment made in order under the rules
and then in their attempts to shield mtbe producers and big oil companies from accountability republicans have created this unfunded mandate which is called such by the national water resources association the american public works association western coalition of arid states american water works association the association of metropolitan water agencies the national association of towns and townships the national association of counties the national league of cities the us conference of mayors
mr chairman i ask my colleagues to join us today in defeating the previous question so that we can bring back a rule that will allow us to debate an amendment that would increase funding for research and development for new energy technologies by 250 million
mr chairman for 4 years now the republicans in congress have brought us an energy policy bill that provides billions in subsidies to traditional energy industries already reaping record profits
just a few weeks ago republican leaders brought to the house floor an energy bill that devoted 93 percent of its tax incentives to oil gas and other traditional energy industries and only 7 percent for renewable energy and investments in new technologies
a democratic energy plan would set us on a faster course toward energy independence by investing more of our valuable resources in clean renewable energy resources promoting new emerging technologies developing greater efficiency and improving energy conservation
but these investments are just a beginning and will need our commitment in future years to sustain the innovations and investment levels needed to truly establish a sound energy economy for the 21st century
and while hydrogen may eventually play a major role in replacing gasoline in our cars and trucks the sources of energy to generate hydrogen must begin accelerated development now
for example the national academy of sciences examined the possible benefits of an aggressive investment in solid state lighting
today lighting constitutes 30 percent of all energy use in buildings in the united states
the academy study found that an investment of 50 million a year for 10 years would result in a 50 billion savings between now and 2050
another excellent example fuel cells offer potential benefits in vehicles and stationary applications
fuel cells are essential to a hydrogen energy economy and also have a vital role to play in other areas
the government has an essential role to play in research and development
unless a business can make a reasonable return on its research investment it can not afford to invest in r amp d
so the federal government collects funds from a broad base of beneficiaries the taxpayers and invests in research and development that otherwise would never happen
mr chairman we are the world leader in technical innovation
science engineering and technology have enabled us to build our modern nation and now we need to use these tools aggressively to increase our energy security improve the lives of our citizens and power us in the 21st century
i applaud the energy efficiency and conservation in this bill
i applaud the increasing of renewable technologies in this bill
i applaud the hydrogen fuel cell program in this bill
i applaud the nextgeneration nuclear in this bill
that is the one issue i do not think we do enough in this bill
i believe we need to do much more to increase the supply of natural gas and i hope in conference we can
it can assist us in transportation with our buses taxi cabs delivery trucks by using natural gas rather than oil
we need in the final bill to have a much stronger chapter with natural gas it is the one area that i think we need stronger in this bill
mr chairman i rise in support of this bipartisan amendment
if we want a national energy policy that is truly about economic security for all americans not just those in the auto industry that is about national security for all americans it needs to be comprehensive
this amendment is one of the greatest steps we can take in the area of going forward in conservation
you know we have had the opportunity in the house four or five times to debate the energy bill
and i look at the history of energy policy in this country and the efforts of congress to try to deal with the very real energy demands that we have today in this country
i look at it today and nearly twothirds of the energy that we consume in this country comes from foreign countries
i look at what we are doing wrong in terms of producing additional energy in this country
yeah you know we did not have a lot of dinosaurs die under yosemite or yellowstone you are right but we had a whole heck a lot of them die in the arctic plains
there is oil and gas in alaska
we have the same people who come to the floor year after year and oppose every single attempt that is made to increase the amount of energy produced in this country
mr chairman i rise today in support of the daviswaxman amendment to hr 6
mr chairman section 1287 of hr 6 includes permissive rulemaking authority for the federal trade commission to adopt rules protecting the privacy of electric consumers from the disclosure of consumer information obtained in connection with the sale or delivery of electric energy to electric customers
am i correct sir in understanding that it was the committee s intent to grant the ftc rulemaking authority with respect to the information practices of utility companies not already regulated or to the extent they are not already regulated under the grammleachbliley act
am i further correct that it was not the intention that utility companies be restricted in their ability to report payment history information to consumer reporting agencies
mr chairman i thank the gentleman for his clarifications and for his assistance and the assistance of his staff in this situation
mr chairman i do rise in opposition to this amendment
the committee on resources opposes this amendment because of problems with a definition within the amendment that will prohibit many private landowners from participating in this program
while the intent of this amendment is laudable in reality it is nothing more than an attempt to grant special treatment to one company with one facility in one state
this also does remind me of an important issue in a different part of the bill that is not part of this amendment and that is title ii which contains a crucial provision that will benefit our nation regarding hydropower relicensing
the hydrorelicensing provision in title ii stimulates hydroelectric energy growth by improving the relicensing process between federal resource agencies and their licensees
it does so by striking a balance between environmental concerns and energy production in hydro projects
in the next 15 years hydroelectric facilities that serve over 30 million homes must undergo relicensing
further the licensing process for hydroelectricity is cumbersome confusing and costly with no one party acting as a final arbiter of the competing interests involved in the project
this language will result in greater interaction between the resource agencies and licensees great flexibility in the development of environmental measures and create an increased efficiency in the way we produce safe hydroelectric energy
i want to thank our chairman the gentleman from texas mr barton xz4000180 for including this provision in the bill
i rise in opposition to the pending legislation surprise because it will do absolutely nothing to lower the price of motor fuel and reduce america s dependence on foreign oil
it could have been visionary and it could have been daring in developing new energy technologies and fuel sources
the bill contains 8 billion in tax breaks largely for wellheeled oil and gas conglomerates who are already milking our constituents at the pump
in the resources title alone cbo says there is nearly a half a billion dollars of direct spending to subsidize the oil and gas industry over the next 10 years
there is nothing here that would actually encourage an electric utility to install or invest in clean coal technology
and to add insult to injury the single substantive coal provision in this bill favors western federal coal primarily in the powder river basin of wyoming over all other coals
it would give federal coal from that region an artificial competitive advantage to the detriment of coal producers and consumers in other states
to now provide these producers of federal coal with special treatment in the form of relief from competitive bidding and the payments of royalties is unseemly and has no part in what is supposed to be a national energy policy bill
it is in effect a direct assault upon all other coal including coal from my home state of west virginia and it is a direct assault on consumers jobs and the economy and the communities which rely on coal from states like west virginia who are not given special treatment under this provision
all of this all of it is why every newspaper in my congressional district that has editorialized on this bill has editorialized against this bill
we are engaging in an exercise of microwave legislating today
the president has said with oil at more than 50 a barrel by the way energy companies do not need taxpayerfunded incentives to explore for oil and gas that was president george w bush in the washington post april 21 2005
to my colleagues from the gulf states i would say vote for this amendment if you also support the provisions in hr 6 to distribute 500 million in ocs revenues to coastal states and to redirect 2 billion in ocs to alter deep water research
there is a reason that moms go through the pain and agony of buying an suv and a minivan because they are safe because they can get their whole family in there because they can put a bike in the back and they can get all the groceries in there
the automobile companies today do not get enough credit for all of the money they are investing in trying to make these things efficient
believe me if they could get 40 miles to the gallon in an suv they would be on these front steps having a press conference selling these things
but i will tell you families across this country are suffering in the automobile industry
they have layoffs they have job cuts there is a lack of hope in some areas and anxiety you can not believe in others
let us do that but we can do that without new costs without new burdens without even getting close to this argument that they are going to get into in the cafe debate and accomplish exactly what they want
i think my colleagues can be proud of this amendment as amended back in their districts and tell people that they fought valiantly to get the 2005 standards on stickers for cars they are going to buy today
let us do it the way we know can accomplish what you want and have families at the end of the day saying i am going to show up and build the finest cars in the world right here in the great state of michigan or any other of the 49 great states of this great country
mr chairman as a member of the appropriations committee i rise in support of the fiscal year 2006 energy and water bill
i want to thank chairman hobson and ranking member visclosky for their hard work in drafting this bill
i believe they have made choices with the best interests of improving us water infrastructure and advancing energy programs in mind
i urge all of my colleagues to vote in favor of the fy 2006 energy and water appropriations act
i want to talk about a very important issue that should appeal to all republicans and democrats in this house and that is gas prices
one provision that is included in this bill the boutique fuel reduction act is very very important to reducing the price spikes that we are experiencing
because of the clean air act a very good law we never thought about having a federal fuel system so today we have 18 different base blends of gasoline throw the different octanes in there we have 45 different fuels
so we have a full distribution system national in scope we have pipelines and refineries that are meant to put one fuel out there for america that was built in the 1950s 1960s and 1970s which was the last time that it was upgraded
what that does for all of our consumers our constituents is it makes those boutique fuels short in supply and therefore high in price
it makes the system which is running at full capacity very vulnerable to price spikes if there is any hiccup in supply
but now with the new 8hour ozone rule which has been released last year takes effect in 2 years 474 counties in america will now be out of attainment with respect to the ozone rule
if there is a problem in supply overnight an immediate problem like we had in arizona last year wisconsin on a couple of times with a pipeline break or a refinery fire the epa has waiver authority on a 20day basis to fix that
in addressing both present and future concerns this plan provides real improvements to our energy policy with the goal of reducing our dependence on foreign oil
this bill looks inward by expanding our refinery capacities and tapping into our domestic resources in an environmentally safe way
farmers in kansas and across the country stand ready to help with this effort
i am also aware however that the committee works closely with the corps in this process and that funding decisions are based largely on the priorities put forward by the corps
with this in mind i am very disappointed that the energy and water appropriations bill that we approved today did not contain funding for the cleanup of a logjam on jacobs creek in my district in coffey county kansas
i am disappointed because i have made it abundantly clear to the corps on numerous occasions that i hear more from constituents about this project than any other corps project in my district
further i have asked the corps to make it one of their highest priorities when it comes to funds spent in my district
this logjam began in 1973 but has only in recent years escalated to such a problematic level
along this stretch boat docks are useless and garbage is trapped in the sediment
the absence of funding for this project in the bill leads me to conclude that the corps has once again looked the other way
i fully intend to continue working to see that this project is funded in the final version of this bill
mr chairman i rise in opposition to the legislation
these are enormously profitable industries operating in a time of record energy prices
i strongly oppose a provision in the bill that allows for the permanent activation of the cross sound cable
in doing so the bill subverts the regulatory process and ignores sound environmental policy regarding the depth at which the cable should be buried
in addition to its environmental shortsightedness i also oppose provisions in this bill related to energy transmission
in our own long island sound just off connecticut this is a very real possibility
while energy security is a national issue it seems to me the communities who will live with these siting decisions deserve a voice in the process
we simply wo nt have a world to live in if we continue our neglectful ways
in my judgment it would be far better to develop prudent and lasting alternate fuel energies than to risk irreparable damage to the wilderness of one of north america s most beautiful frontiers
drilling in the arctic will not fix our energy problems with so little oil available up there it could nt possibly as it will take a decade to get the oil down here
mr chairman i rise in strong support of the markeyjohnson amendment to protect the alaska national wildlife refuge
in my judgment it would be far better to develop prudent and lasting alternate fuel energies than to risk irreparable damage to the wilderness of one of north america s most beautiful frontiers
even a modest increase in cafe standards would save more oil than would be produced by drilling in anwr
we simply wo nt have a world to live in if we continue our neglectful ways
mr chairman drilling in the arctic refuge is the wrong answer to the right question
mr chairman i rise in strong support of the markeyboehlert et al amendment
mr chairman i rise in strong support of the support of the amendment to reduce our consumption of oil by increasing fuel economy standards for passenger cars and light trucks
under this amendment the administrator of the national highway transportation safety administration will have maximum flexibility in how the standards are set
this is a common sense amendment which represents a modest step forward in our nation s efforts to become more energy efficient
increased fuel efficiency standards and tax incentives for conservation and renewable energy sources should be at the heart of our national energy policy in a postseptember 11 world
i support the castlemarkey amendment and would say to my fellow republicans if this is the party that believes in local government and decisions being made on the local level and the state level as opposed to the federal level you would be supporting this amendment
it seems absolutely clear as can be to me that if you do not give authority some authority and rights to states and local communities you are going to have companies come in and bully their way because they will not have to be answerable
mr chairman i rise in strong support of the castlemarkeyshaysandrews amendment striking the liquefied natural gas lng siting language contained in section 320 of hr 6
there are risks as well as benefits associated with the siting and expansion of lng terminals in populated areas
in long island sound just off connecticut there is a very real possibility that a facility will be sited with little to no state or local input
we propose an amendment to restore the role of state and local authority in citing decisions
my party has always believed state and local governments know best what works in their communities
mr chairman while energy security is a national issue it seems to me local communities who will live with our decisions far into the future deserve a voice in the decisionmaking process
there is no more important bill in my time here in congress than the bill we are addressing today and there is no more important bill for the state of illinois than the bill we are addressing today
this bill brings clean coal technology strengthens nuclear power and it actually helps renewable power in the aspect of wind power
it brings renewable fuels to the forefront in this debate
so what we have been doing in the past is working
the picture that the gentleman put up he wants it offshore and wants it piped in
one of the most crazy things ever to happen to me is i am sitting in my office and the energy company comes in
they are excited about building an lng facility in the bahamas and they want to pipe this natural gas in to florida
i just can not believe that we want to give up the jobs the energy security and the ability to have these facilities in the united states and put them in remote areas many of them outside the continental united states
in fact this rule even makes an amendment in order that i offered
i think it is the first one i have gotten in about 9 years and i do want to tell my colleagues that i am happy to have it because it will save the government a lot of money
i urge my colleagues to closely follow the debate we are having on this bill today and tomorrow because in its current form i believe it has the wrong priorities
at a time when oil companies are enjoying record profits the bill gives billions of dollars in new subsidies
this brand of taxpayerfunded corporate welfare is so off the mark that even president bush a former energy executive himself recently stated that oil companies have all the incentives they need to keep on drilling in the form of 50 a barrel crude
americans already are shelling out their hardearned cash for the most expensive gasoline in our history
we should not ask them to give out even more in the form of corporate giveaways for the oil companies
one of the things we will hear today and that we have been hearing for years now is that the way to reduce our use of foreign oil is to drill in the arctic national wildlife refuge in alaska
we hear claims that in a few years anwr will be producing 10 billion barrels a day and all of our problems will be solved
well mr speaker the governor of alaska says he does not know if there is any oil in there at all
the new york times reported in february and i will submit this for the record that the oil companies do not think there is much or any marketable oil in the arctic refuge
back in the 1980s they drilled a couple of test holes in anwr and they certainly were not very excited about what they found because even though they have held the results close to their chests two of the companies that drilled those holes have pulled out of going to anwr
in fact they are saying that that is of no use to them
over the past several years chevron texaco british petroleum and conocophilips have all withdrawn from the group that lobbies for drilling in anwr
so if the major oil companies the people who are the experts in the field the folks we depend on to do the drilling if they do not think there is oil there then why are we doing it
they claim if they do not have the right to drill in anwr they will not have any right to drill where the oil really is and that is off the coast of florida off the coast of california and in the gulf of mexico which is where they really want to go
so pay close attention here because if this passes the next oil exploration may be in your backyard
the material previously referred to follows big oil steps aside in battle over arctic washington feb
20 george w bush first proposed drilling for oil in a small part of the arctic national wildlife refuge in alaska in 2000 after oil industry experts helped his presidential campaign develop an energy plan
but if mr bush s drilling plan passes in congress after what is expected to be a fierce fight it may prove to be a triumph of politics over geology
the major oil companies are largely uninterested in drilling in the refuge skeptical about the potential there
and many republicans hope to claim opening the refuge to exploration as a victory in the longrunning conflict between development interests and environmentalists
but only one test well has been drilled in the 1980 s and its results are one of the industry s most closely guarded secrets
no oil company really cares about anwr the adviser said using an acronym for the refuge pronounced anwar wayne kel1ey who worked in alaska as a petroleum engineer for halliburton the oil services corporation and is now managing director of rsk an oil consulting company said the refuge s potential could only be determined by drilling the enthusiasm of government officials about anwr exceeds that of industry because oil companies are driven by market forces investing resources in direct proportion to the economic potential and the evidence so far about anwr is not promising mr kelley said
heading the effort was hunter hunt a top executive of the hunt oil company based in dallas
the refuge their report stated could eventually produce more than the amount of oil the united states now imports from iraq the plan criticized president bill clinton s energy policies both in the middle east where most of the world s oil lies and in the united states
in 1995 mr clinton vetoed legislation that authorized leasing in the alaska refuge
an earlier opportunity to open it collapsed after oil spilled into alaskan waters in 1989 from the exxon valdez
subsequent efforts including one in mr bush s first term also failed
if you ca nt do anwr said matthew r simmons a houston investment banker for the energy industry and a bush adviser in 2000 you ll never be able to drill in the promising areas shortly after assuming office mr bush asked vice president dick cheney to lead an examination of energy policy
by then the industry was moving in the opposite direction
in 2002 bp withdrew financial support from arctic power a lobbying group financed by the state of alaska after an earlier withdrawal by chevron texaco
bp long active in alaska later moved its team of executives to houston from alaska a company executive said
ms desjarlais said her company had a conceptual interest in the refuge but a more immediate interest in opportunities elsewhere other companies have taken similar positions
george l kirkland an executive vice president of chevron texaco said a stillbanned section in the gulf of mexico where the company has already drilled was of more immediate interest
lee r raymond the chairman and chief executive said in an television interview last december i do nt know if there is anything in anwr or not for the interior department however the refuge is the best landbased opportunity to find new oil
any lease revenues estimated by the department to be 24 billion in 2007 would be split between the federal and state governments
in a decade from now when the site might be fully developed that would be about 4 percent of american consumption according to federal forecasts
ken bird a geological survey official who worked on the study said the federal geologists did not have access to test data from the only exploratory well drilled on the refuge by chevron texaco and bp in the 1980 s
an official with one of the companies speaking anonymously because of the confidentiality of the test said that if the results had been encouraging the company would be more engaged in the political effort to open the refuge
big oil senator john kerry said in last year s presidential campaign now calls the white house their home some industry executives say their views are more aligned with those of republicans on a broad range of issues including regulation the environment and energy supply and they were heartened by the initial pronouncements of the bush administration
when this administration came in the president and the vice president recognized there was a problem of energy supply and demand said tom fry the executive director of the national offshore industries association
in 1998 congress set a goal for 2005 to improve the energy efficiency in congressional buildings by 20 percent
it would simply require that any new escalator being installed in federal buildings to be an intermittent escalator
these have been in use in europe for 30 or 40 years and i know that when i first saw one i could hardly believe it
but in addition to that what we would save simply on the wear and tear the pure mechanics of the escalator probably would be even higher than the energy savings
mr chairman the traditional escalators are used more than 90 billion times a year in the united states and with more than 30 000 of them across the country escalators move more people than airplanes
and since almost all of them are out of order a good percentage of the time we know that it is important that we do something to conserve that kind of money and the investment we have made in the escalators
this was borne out by a case study supplied to me from the german embassy which found 40 percent savings in germany
mr chairman today i rise in opposition to the energy bill
today i rise to offer my amendment to strike the refinery revitalization provisions in hr 6
the energy czar is then required to establish refinery revitalization zones in more than 1 200 counties and in each instance can veto our states and communities
in two separate letters in the summer and fall of 2004 the epa stated that it was not aware of any pending permits under the public health laws we are undermining
the following are 15 national entities representing public entities health care entities and civil rights organizations the national association of counties the national conference of state legislatures the national league of cities the us conference of mayors the environmental council of states the state and territorial air pollution program administrators the association of local pollution control officials the south coast air quality management district in california all major environmental and public health groups including the league of conservation voters the national hispanic environmental council the national council of la raza and the league of united latin american citizens
most of the neighborhoods in refinery communities are lowincome minority communities with the least availability to defend themselves from corporate pollution and most are vulnerable to environmental and public health problems yet are targets in this very language
more than 70 percent of latinos and african americans live in counties with dirty air
yet this language would put the department of energy in charge of protecting our health
perhaps before we harm the health of most underserved populations before we strip states and communities of their rights to protect themselves and before we turn a good part of this nation into a refinery revitalization zone perhaps we should have a real dialogue that would have tremendous impacts in our communities that would truly represent those concerns and voices we represent
in fact i will submit for the record a list of 10 of those major organizations in opposition to the mtbe liability waiver
in addition to that i would like to tell my colleagues that right now as it stands we are not paying for sufficient cleanup as it is of underground storage tanks where we know mtbe is leaking
we need to make sure that we support the capps amendment and that we do everything we can to educate the public of the harmful effects of mtbe because in the state of california we are plagued with having to clean up this water
just as the republicans used to agree that local control was a primary factor in their agenda back in the 1990s now they are saying it does not cut it anymore
this provision is an unfunded mandate on our communities and water providers who will be left holding the tab while the polluters cash in
in 2003 the epa only cleaned up 18 000 sites 3 000 sites short of its goal
in 2004 only 14 235 sites were cleaned up 7 000 sites short of epa s goal
despite the need for cleanup funds and epa s inability to meets its cleanup goal this administration has cut funding for cleanups by 8 percent from 72 million in fiscal year 2001 to 694 million in the fiscal year 2005 omnibus
in arizona california georgia illinois kentucky maryland minnesota montana new hampshire oklahoma rhode island south dakota texas virginia and wisconsin the funds are serviced exclusively with fuel taxes
programs in alabama arkansas colorado florida iowa indiana louisiana massachusetts maine mississippi north carolina north dakota nebraska new mexico nevada new york pennsylvania south carolina tennessee and vermont are funded predominantly by fuel taxes
in fact alaska delaware hawaii maryland oregon washington and west virginia do nt have cleanup funds
tennessee s fund is in the process of going broke michigan needs an estimated 17 billion to cleanup orphan sites
authorizing money in this bill will not solve that problem
colleagues the federal government is not paying for cleanups and language amending the lust program supported by republicans will do nothing to help in fact it will further hinder the epa s ability to clean up these sites and states ability to prevent contamination
mtbe contamination is soaring although the use of mtbe in gasoline is rapidly declining detections of mtbe in water supplies are soaring
the number of water systems reporting mtbe contamination in tap water supplies increased more than 15fold between 1996 and 2004 from 137 to 1 861 and the number of states reporting problems more than doubled from 11 to 29 according to ewg action fund s analysis of state water testing data
these figures are not necessarily systems whose customers are currently drinking mtbe in their tap water but those where it has been detected somewhere in the system
in the majority of the affected communities consumers are unaware of the contamination because water utilities take steps to protect them as soon as mtbe is detected
mtbe contamination as low as two parts per billion two drops in an olympicsized swimming pool can produce a harsh chemical odor and taste that can cause tap water to be undrinkable
mtbe contamination affects communities of all sizes with contamination reported from large systems like san diego where the water utility serves 12 million people to the millbrook country day school in massachusetts serving 25 students and teachers
mtbe has been detected in water supplies serving 32 million people in california about 47 million in new jersey about 22 million in massachusetts and 1 million in texas
in some communities a substantial portion of the local water supply has been contaminated while in many others only one or two detections of mtbe have been made
state water testing records obtained by ewg indicate that in almost all systems with just one positive detection of mtbe tests for the compound were conducted in the last four years
this suggests that mtbe is only now showing up in many drinking water systems
since 2003 155 water systems in 17 states have filed suits arguing that mtbe is a defective product and that refiners knew that it would contaminate groundwater before they began adding it to gasoline but failed to warn consumers
in 2002 that argument outlined in devastating detail in industry documents convinced a jury to find shell texaco and four other companies liable for contaminating drinking water supplies in south lake tahoe calif forcing a 60 million settlement for cleanup
in 2003 shell exxon chevrontexaco and 15 other companies settled a contamination lawsuit brought by santa monica calif by agreeing to spend an estimated 200 million on a filtration system to remove mtbe from the city s water supplies
the success of those lawsuits in holding the oil companies responsible for mtbe contamination sparked the first attempt in 2003 by the industry and its political allies to make it impossible for communities to sue on defective product grounds
in turn the push for the waiver set off a rush to file lawsuits by communities with contamination
of the 150plus cases now in court all but three were filed after september 2003 and would be thrown out by the retroactive provision of the delaybarton bill
in the house 21 republicans and five democrats who voted for the energy bill and mtbe liability waiver now are faced with the prospect if they again support it of throwing out a total of 38 lawsuits filed by community water systems in the districts they represent
three members are from new jersey which has a total of 430 water systems where mtbe has been detected far more systems than in any other state supplying drinking water to 47 million garden state residents
eleven are from california where mtbe has been found in 144 water systems serving more than 32 million people almost 90 percent of the state s population
an additional 81 house members 74 republicans and 9 democrats who supported the energy bill and liability waiver represent districts where mtbe has been detected in the water supply but lawsuits have not been filed
thirteen including delay and barton are from texas in their districts are 29 water systems with mtbe contamination
one house member who voted yes in 2003 arkansas democrat mike ross has 50 water systems in his district with contamination
mtbe producers according to documents in recent litigation put this contaminant into commerce knowing it could contaminate drinking water supplies
one estimate by experts puts the cleanup cost in excess of 29 billion
california law back in 1996 we passed this particular amendment and i carried that bill
it was one of the first in this country
under the energy bill this provision is necessary because they will be able to put refineries be able to go onto native americans lands they will be able to go into communities of color in lowincome communities like mine that are underserved right now that have many many egregious projects that are there that are polluting our waters and making our life i think a health hazard
this is the wrong direction to go in with the energy bill
madam chairman i rise in opposition to this bill
it delays the end of 8 billion in special interest tax breaks
in fact as i have outlined above it delays that very possibility
while some continue to blame the bush administration and the republicans in congress the truth is that neither is responsible for the record highs
the reason for the high gas prices includes the cost of crude oil due to a worldwide explosion in demand the lack of refinery processing capacity and the overregulation here in washington
the department of energy predicts by 2025 us oil and natural gas demand will rise by 46 percent with energy demand increasing 1 percent for every 2 percent in gdp growth
in fact this legislation includes provisions to do just that
in order to scale back demand for oil the proposal encourages vehicles powered by hydrogen fuel cells and increases funding for the department of transportation to work to improve fuel efficiency standards
in order to ensure reliable and secure supplies of oil we have no choice but simply to increase our domestic supply
there have been giant leaps in technology that would produce oil and natural gas in an environmentally safe manner
along with the incredible advances in technology transportation and medicine that improve our lives comes the increased need for energy
in addition overregulation by the government also contributes to regional and seasonal price fluctuations that increase costs and of course reduce flexibility to meet consumer demand
for example the 1990 clean air act amendments mandate the sale of cleaner burning reformulated gasoline in order to reduce summer smog in nine major metropolitan areas
the industry will need to invest more than 8 billion over the next 3 years to meet this requirement which will result in higher prices at the pump
this hodgepodge of customized fuel requirements increases production costs which are ultimately reflected in the price of gasoline that we pay today
these varied gasoline specifications also restrict the ability of refiners and distributors to move supplies around the country in response to local and of course regional shortages
we have passed this comprehensive legislation before and i know i speak for a lot of my colleagues probably on both sides of the aisle that we should finally move forward after the large increases in gasoline
the department of energy predicts by the year 2025 us oil and natural gas demand will rise by 46 percent with energy demand increasing 1 percent for every 2 percent in gdp growth
this increase in demand at home coupled with the explosion of demand worldwide has led to the increase in the cost of crude oil
this is the third congress in a row we have tried to pass comprehensive energy legislation
i know i speak for many of my colleagues in saying i hope we can finally move forward and enact this very important and increasingly timely legislation
the department of energy predicts that by the year 2025 us oil and natural gas demand will rise by 46 percent with energy demand increasing 1 percent for every 2 percent growth in gdp
this increased demand at home coupled with an explosion of demand worldwide has lead to an increase in the cost of crude oil
in order to ensure reliable and secure supplies of oil we have no choice but to increase the domestic supply
mr chairman i rise in opposition to the amendment
encouraging and supporting the development of innovative new technology is preferable to arbitrary increases in cafe standards that will truly hurt thousands of american workers
the national academy of sciences also raises concerns about potential increases in highway fatalities if the auto industry is forced into selling a greater share of small vehicles
according to the analysis of the insurance institute of highway safety data in 1999 since cafe standards were first announced in 1975 approximately 46 000 people died in crashes who would have survived if cafe had not encouraged smaller lighter cars
mr chairman i rise today in support of the markeybishop amendment
this amendment includes a provision that permanently bans oil and gas drilling in and under our great lakes
however the committee on rules republican majority refused to allow my bipartisan amendment to be considered on the floor despite strong bipartisan support for it in the house and by the american people
understanding this congress has repeatedly banned oil and gas drilling in and under the great lakes to protect this vital resource
in 2001 the house voted overwhelmingly 265157 in favor of instituting a ban
unfortunately the gentleman from michigan mr rogers xz4003421 undermined my amendment in favor of a watereddown version
that amendment is included in the bill we find before us today
the rogers amendment does nothing to stop drilling in the great lakes
we could have eight different policies on drilling in our lakes
plus it is congress that regulates commerce amongst the several states as is found in the constitution in the interstate commerce clause
the bottomlands of the great lakes will not provide enough oil or natural gas to make even a small dent in the amount of america s energy needs that are supplied by imported oil and natural gas
i ask that my colleagues approve this amendment to enact a permanent ban on oil and gas drilling in and on the great lakes
mr chairman if the chairman would remember he did allow me to offer my amendment in committee but before we had voted to do a permanent ban it was undermined by the rogers amendment which basically says the same thing that it says in the body of the underlying bill which encourages states to enact a ban
that is why we were very disappointed in that especially
in fact in 2001 we did have a moratorium on oil and gas drilling in the great lakes and it passed 265157 with strong bipartisan support
that is why we are disappointed that the committee on rules did not make our amendment in order
mr chairman i rise in opposition to the amendment
mr speaker we need an energy policy desperately in this country
it addresses the energy policy in a very comprehensive way
you know people talk about high gas prices in this country and people go back to their districts and say that gas is high
well one way we can reduce the cost of gasoline for everyone in this country is we expand refining capacity in this country
and we address this in this bill
like our chairman said in the committee if we added five new refineries today in america it still would not address the demand that we have
in many instances when we do get oil and gas drilled here domestically sometimes we have to send that oil to another country to refine it and we buy it back at a higher value
if we open anwr if you put it in perspective if it was the size of the ou football field the area that we are talking about drilling in would be the size of a postage stamp on that football field
and the beauty of it is we can produce oil experts say at least 2 million barrels a day out of anwr and that is exactly what we were importing from saddam hussein in iraq before all of this 911 happened
it is asinine that we rely so much on foreign oil especially in areas around the world that we have carpetbombed
mr speaker i rise in support of the rule and the bill
this legislation is perhaps the most important bill we will deal with in this session
it expands the nation s natural gas supply primarily by clarifying the federal government s role in lng facilities
it doubles our efforts in energy conservation and efficiency it reduces america s dangerous dependence on foreign oil and improves our nation s electrical transmissions
it is just one of many forwardthinking provisions in this legislation
madam speaker i do appreciate the gentlewoman from tennessee yielding some to me so we can talk about what i think is one of the most important bills that we will vote on in the 109th congress and that is a comprehensive energy package
there is i think an incredible statement toward renewable fuels and alternative technologies like the fuel cell but we also have to recognize some of our issues that face us now and what i am talking about is the price of natural gas and how it is impacting our economy and our families in america especially agri business and small businesses
natural gas by the way accounts for nearly a quarter of america s energy supply and is used by more than half of the households and businesses in america
in fact in my district of omaha nebraska about 65 percent of the households are heated and by the way it gets cold maybe not like in the gentlewoman s part of tennessee it gets pretty cold in omaha during the winter and we rely on natural gas
in venezuela it is about 70 cents per thousand cubic feet 40 cents in africa 80 cents in russia
the next by the way is europe with 370 less than half of what we pay in the united states
farm states including nebraska have been hit especially hard by higher natural gas prices since natural gas is the primary material in nitrogen fertilizers as well as the key fuel for irrigation and drying of grains
anhydrous ammonia fertilizer has increased from about 175 per ton in 2000 to as much as 375 last planting season
the increased cost of natural gas has played a substantial role in losing nearly 3 million us manufacturing jobs over the last 5 years according to the industrial energy consumers of america
whether these jobs were located in an auto plant in ohio or a petrochemical manufacturer in houston many have been moved overseas chasing the cheaper natural gas where it is more abundant and plentiful
we actually have a decent supply of natural gas but most of it is off limits and stays off limits in this bill especially around the coastal regions of california and florida
last year this congress passed a pipeline from alaska down to chicago but i am telling my colleagues looking at the politics in alaska this may take decades before that pipeline is run from alaska to the continental united states to provide some price relief for our economy and for heating our homes
so we must look at these natural gas prices in a holistic way meaning domestic production pipeline and we still have to realize that to meet the increased needs of natural gas within our united states we are going to unfortunately have to import some of our natural gas
otherwise if we do not look at it in a holistic way domestic alaskan pipeline and liquid natural gas imports natural gas prices may increase to 13 or 14 per thousand cubic feet
there are many applications to site liquid natural gas to an import terminal where the liquid natural gas comes in it goes in it is unloaded it is turned into a gas and then put into pipelines but we are experiencing the typical notinmybackyard with some extreme overexaggerations of the dangerousness of liquid natural gas
because localities and states have played on this fear those localities in fact in maine a locality even though the states have issued permits are approved permits a locality stops an lng terminal
in this base bill we in the committee on energy and commerce worked on this together in committee
we want the states to have a part in here
this is in the base bill
it means higher heating bills 65 percent of my constituents heat their homes in nebraska by natural gas
by the way we have lost mr chairman about 3 million jobs in the industrial manufacturing bases
just for our farmers our agricultural folks in the midwest farmers have seen the prices of nitrogen fertilizer increase from 175 per ton in 2000 to more than 400 this planting season and we have lost half of our fertilizer manufacturers chasing the lower natural gas prices
mr chairman in regard to safety the gentleman wrote into this language specifically giving the states the right to participate in this process and i encourage my colleagues to vote no
once again the house is debating a comprehensive energy package i do have to say that as far as the ways and means committee is concerned it is just slightly less comprehensive than it has been in the past
but that is because we understand having gone through a conference with the senate the kind of package that will maximize our chances in producing a fair and balanced tax section
in discussing what we do in this particular bill and i enjoy hearing people discuss it as though it is the conference report that is in front of us it is in fact and i will say it flatly and in a negotiating position before us to sit down and work with the senate
it does have renewable provisions in the tax package but by a small amount
in that bill we had incentives for wind open biomass electric cars and alternativefuel vehicles
in the american jobs creation act we provided incentives for ethanol biodiesel geothermal solar open biomass municipal solid mass and refined coal
i know a number of people have a definition of bipartisan but based upon the recent history of the ways and means committee five democrats supporting a measure offered in that committee is unprecedented bipartisan support
i anxiously look forward to the debate on the democrat substitute and would willingly yield time to the gentleman from washington mr mcdermott xz4002620 to make all the points he just made on the majority bill on the minority bill since they include in their entirety the tax section of the majority s bill
i also look forward to seeking to yield to my friend from texas mr doggett xz4001110 during the debate on the minority substitute bill because the provision he just viciously attacked on the floor as being totally unacceptable is in the democrats bill as well
if we could get the mileage out of the gallon of gasoline that they get out of 1 minute we would not need an energy policy in this country
on that i do nt think there is a need to try to add to what they said except to say that the amendment will protect one of the most special places in our country without much real cost in terms of our ability to maintain needed energy supplies
in particular i m pleased that the science committee bill included generous authorization levels for renewable energy and energy efficiency r amp d
unfortunately though this bill like the ones we ve debated twice before remains all too reminiscent of that old western movie the good the bad and the ugly in fact over the years it has only gotten worse and uglier
the us fish and wildlife service says it is critically important to the ecological integrity of the whole arctic refuge which is america s finest example of an intact naturally functioning community of arcticsubarctic ecosystems estimates are that there is six months supply of economically recoverable oil in the refuge s coastal plain
that should not have been included in the bill
raising cafe standards is the single biggest step we can take to reduce oil consumption since about half of the oil used in the us goes into the gas tanks of our passenger vehicles
most importantly according to analyses conducted by the department of energy s energy information administration our need for imported oil will increase by 75 percent in twenty years under provisions in this bill
of the bill s total 81 billion in tax incentives 75 billion or 93 percent is for traditional energy sources such as oil natural gas and nuclear power
voters approved amendment 37 last year which is making a difference in our energy supply
colorado is leading the nation in this area
not only are we producing cleaner cheaper energy we are also providing economic development in rural colorado in places like sterling and holyoke
in fact i am going to be doing a harvesting energy tour in northeastern colorado this weekend with former colorado house speaker lola spradley representatives from the colorado farm bureau and the rocky mountain farmers union and renewable energy companies to talk about how renewable energy can be an economic development boon for rural colorado
but we need federal incentives to help move renewable energy and energy efficiency technologies to the mainstream and yet only 7 percent of the incentives in this bill would promote their development
i also tried to improve the resources committee s energy bill provisions with an amendment dealing with oil shale language in the bill
the bill requires the interior department to set up a new leasing program for commercial development of oil shale with final regulations to be in place by the end of next year
in other words it calls for a crash program to meet a short arbitrary deadline
in colorado we have had several bouts of oil shale fever
the last one started during the 1970s energy crisis and ended abruptly on black sunday in 1982
in conclusion mr chairman we need a plan in place to increase our energy security
in fact fully 30 percent of the world s oil supply comes from this same volatile and politically unstable region of the world
yet with only 3 percent of the world s known oil reserves we are not in a position to solve our energy vulnerability by drilling at home
for every step it takes to move us away from our oilcarbonbased economy it takes two in the opposite direction
i only wish my colleagues in the house could understand that a vision of a clean energy future is not radical science fiction but is instead based on science and technology that exists today
two days ago at the opening of the abraham lincoln museum in springfield president bush attempted to draw parallels between his goal of expanding freedom in the world and lincoln s effort to expand freedom in the us i have some questions about that comparison but i do think it is good to consider lincoln s example when we debate public policy
in fact i wish president bush and the republicans would draw a few more parallels to lincoln in their approach to energy policy because as that greatest of republican presidents said the dogmas of the quiet past are inadequate for the stormy present
we must think anew and act anew then we will save our country and while we are not engaged in a civil war our excessive dependence on fossil energy is a pressing matter of national security
we need to think anew to devise a better energy policy in order to save our country from this energy crisis
maybe we could have afforded such a mistake in the past
in particular i am very pleased that it will provide nearly 580 million to continue and i hope complete the cleanup of rocky flats
with the funding provided by this bill and barring unforeseen developments the department of energy and its contractor kaiserhill should be able to complete the cleanup in the coming months and while the department will have ongoing responsibilities at rocky flats completing the cleanup will enable it to focus even more intently on the cleanup work to be done at other sites
it was because of them and those like them who worked at other sites that i worked with our colleagues from kentucky and ohio mr whitfield and mr strickland as well as others in both the house and senate and with secretary of energy bill richardson and his colleagues in the clinton administration to pass the energy employees occupational illness compensation program act eeoicpa
it provides funding for several bureau of reclamation projects in our state including the coloradobig thompson project and the fryingpanarkansas project as well as the ongoing construction of the animasla plata project
it also includes needed funds for operation and maintenance of a number of reservoirs operated by the army s corps of engineers as well as for other corps activities in colorado
as cochair of the renewable energy and energy efficiency caucus in the house i have worked for years to increase or at a minimum hold steady funding for doe s renewable energy and energy efficiency research and development programs
given the finite supply and high prices of fossil fuels and increasing global demand investing in clean energy is more important than ever
doe s renewable energy programs are vital to our nation s interests helping provide strategies and tools to address the environmental challenges we will face in the coming decades
for our investment in these technologies to payoff our efforts must be sustained over the long term
this bill is 23 million less than last year s bill in the area of renewable energy research
this includes cuts in biomass geothermal and solar energy programs
i believe that the reductions in funding levels for the core renewable energy programs are illadvised at a time when the need for a secure domestic energy supply is so crucial
i am also concerned about the bill s deep cuts to energy efficiency programs such as industrial technologies 16 million and state energy program grants nearly 4 million and a cut of nearly 5 million in the distributed energy and electricity reliability program
when i went up to the arctic national wildlife refuge i saw a tremendously diverse area in terms of wildlife
i saw musk oxen grizzly bears arctic char and this marvelous caribou herd which is the largest in north america migrate to cross the area that we are talking about drilling in
this statute section 631 even appears to permit the department of energy to fund these types of programs in new mexico so long as there are alternative available sources of federal funding that can be utilized also i would point out funds are fungible
a company can use the now freedup money to mine in new mexico
thus this subsidy would indirectly facilitate uranium mining in navajo communities
we should not be experimenting in communities water supply anywhere
at a time of skyrocketing federal deficits and in an uncertain economic future we should not be giving away 30 million to the uranium industry
but as i stated earlier this provision has implications to far more communities than in my district
i ask my colleagues to take a close look at this and consider whether or not they would want this type of dangerous mining occurring in the neighborhoods of their constituents
in closing i ask to include for the record this list of organizations that are supporting my amendment to demonstrate the broad support we received from both new mexico and nationally
dear congressman udall as the executive director of the navajo nation washington office representing the navajo nation in washington dc i wish to express strong opposition to any attempt to reopen the navajo nation to uranium mining
section 631 of hr 6 the energy policy act of 2005 would create a 30 million subsidy for the domestic uranium mining industry over three years to identify test and develop improved in situ leaching mining technologies while proponents of in situ leach mining contend that this type of mining poses a low risk to groundwater contamination the fact remains that the technology is unproven and the possibility of environmental restoration is inconclusive
dear representative eastern navajo din against uranium mining endaum a navajo citizens group that has been trying to stop a uranium solution mining project in two din communities in new mexico for more than 10 years urges you to support the udall amendment to the energy policy act of 2005 hr 6
the udall amendment strikes section 631 which authorizes a 30 million dollar subsidy to companies using the in situ leach isl or solution mining method to extract uranium
this unnecessary act of corporate welfare could indirectly facilitate uranium mining in navajo communities that do nt want it and on a sovereign american indian nation that just this week enacted a statutory ban on uranium mining and processing
endaum believes that solution mining at four sites in church rock and crownpoint new mexico will contaminate the regional aquifer that provides the only source of drinking water for an estimated 15 000 people
even though section 631 contains a limitation that bars the department of energy doe from awarding any of the 30 million in grants for restoration demonstration projects located in new mexico endaum fears that the provision if enacted could fund hri s parent company uranium resources inc
uri which is based in texas and operates three isl mines there qualifies for the doe grants under language in section 631
endaum fears that should uri receive a doe grant to be used at its texas mines it would free up cash to fund hri s defense of its nrc license and eventually to construct the proposed isl mines in church rock and crownpoint
isl mining in a currently used drinking water aquifer in navajo communities is inimical to these objectives and is opposed not only be the overwhelming majority of people in the area but also by the navajo nation government
section 631 authorizes 30 million in federal spending to aid the uranium industry s efforts to develop in situ leaching mining technology
this unnecessary act of corporate welfare subsidizes a mature industry that has existed in the united states for more than half a century and does not need the government to hold its hand any longer
this 89 billion energy bill is ballooning in cost and at a time of unprecedented deficits it is the taxpayers of the next generation that will foot the bill
mr chairman i rise in strong support of this amendment and i congratulate the gentleman from florida mr hastings for bringing it to the floor of the house
the amendment would expand the federal definition of environmental justice directs each federal agency to establish an office of environmental justice reestablishes the interagency federal working group on environmental justice and requires that executive order 12898 remain in force until changed by law
like this amendment that legislation was prompted by our continued concern about the way federal actions have had disproportionately adverse effects on the health environment and quality of life of americans in minority and lowerincome communities
too often these communities because of their low income or lack of political visibility are exposed to greater risks from toxins and dangerous substances because it has been possible to locate waste dumps industrial facilities and chemical storage warehouses in these communities with less care than would be taken in other locations
the sad fact is that in some eyes these communities have appeared as expendable without full appreciation that human beings who deserve to be treated with respect and dignity are living working and raising families there
the amendment like our bill essentially codifies an executive order that was issued by president clinton in 1994
that order required all federal agencies to incorporate environmental justice considerations in their missions develop strategies to address disproportionate impacts to minority and lowincome people from their activities and coordinate the development of data and research on these topics
we need to institutionalize the consideration of these issues in a more longterm fashion which this bill would do
in addition just as the current policy was established by an administrative order it could be swept away with a stroke of an administrative pen
in a nutshell what this amendment like our bill would do is require federal agencies that control the siting and disposing of hazardous materials store toxins or release pollutants at federal facilities or issue permits for these kinds of activities to make sure they give fair treatment to lowincome and minority populations including native americans
the bill tells federal agencies in the past these communities have endured a disproportionate impact to their health and environment
now we must find ways to make sure that wo nt be the case in the future i urge adoption of the amendment
mr chairman i rise today to oppose this flawed shortsighted energy bill which does not give us a national energy policy and provides more than 22 billion in taxpayer dollars to the private industry
i m not sure what era the authors of this bill think we re living in but this bill does not reflect our present or future energy needs in the 21st century
i suspect my constituents in new mexico who are paying 232 a gallon will be concerned about that
one of my great concerns is the provision that allows drilling in the arctic national wildlife refuge anwr
i have been to alaska and i ve seen the tremendously diverse wildlife that will be hurt if drilling occurs in the area
in addition there are native tribes who depend on this wildlife and they have asked congress and the state of alaska to stand up for them and oppose drilling
how can the majority call this bill comprehensive when it does nothing to address fuel efficiency in our vehicles
raising fuel economy standards would reap suv pickup truck and minivan owners a net savings of up to two thousand dollars in some cases
i think my constituents will also be interested in the provision in this bill shielding lawsuits against oil companies who used methyl tertiarybutyl ether mtbe which has contaminated 1 861 water systems serving 45 million americans in 29 states including new mexico
i find it incredibly disturbing that some members of this body place the pockets of oil companies ahead of the constituents in their districts whose lives have been adversely affected by this negligence
the proposed insitu leach mining would leach uranium from an aquifer that is the sole source of drinking water for thousands of people in northwestern new mexico thereby threatening their health and the integrity of their communities
the proposed mining would leave high levels of uranium in the drinking water supply which is a slap in the face of navajo communities that are still struggling to get compensation for the diseases they are suffering from uranium mining conducted near them during the cold war
i offered an amendment to i brought two other amendments to the rules committee that were unfortunately not allowed a vote in the full house
boehlert of new york was designed to fix unnecessary inequities in the hydropower dam relicensing process proposed in hr 6 while still ensuring that the relicensing process proceeds quickly
all stakeholders states tribes private landowners local businesses fishermen irrigators conservationists water sports enthusiasts and other concerned citizens would be given the chance to participate in decisions that affect the health of american rivers
i believe it is only fair to include these stakeholders in the appeals process and i was disappointed that this amendment was not allowed a vote on the floor
we need a comprehensive energy policy that encourages safe domestic energy production that will not drastically harm the environment and cause potential harm to thousands and that does not contain billions of dollars in giveaways to big oil and gas companies
i ask my colleagues to join me in voting against this flawed bill and i hope we can work toward a more comprehensive energy bill in the future
mr chairman i rise today in strong support of the boehlertmarkey amendment to raise fuel economy standards for automobiles and i thank the gentlemen offering this amendment for yielding me time
raising fuel economy standards would reap suv pickup truck and minivan owners a net savings of up to two thousand dollars in some cases
in addition many of the world s major automakers recently signed an agreement with the government of canada that commits them to improving fuel economy standards by 25 percent by 2010
i was glad to see that my bipartisan amendment extending daylight saving time for 2 months was included in this bill
in this bill we finally impose reliability standards on the electric industry so that hopefully that will not happen again
we hope that the senate legislation will even go more in terms of incentives so that private consumers going to the showroom are going to be able to take advantage of those incentives to purchase those vehicles so that we can get those on the road
mr chairman i thank my distinguished chairman for yielding me this time and i rise in strong support of the rogers amendment to the johnson underlying amendment
what this will result in is having automakers being forced to do two or three or four or maybe even more separate tests
this morning many of us we live in different states but we come and commute here to washington
i live in virginia it is 7 miles from the capitol here to my house
it took me more than 30 minutes to get in today
if i had to drive 7 miles in my town of st
he gets accelerated cafe or he gets much better gas mileage with that car when he is in the big city driving
in kalamazoo which is a city of 100 000 where he lives he does not get quite the same mileage because it is a different scenario
in this bill the lust fund leaking underground storage tanks fund has 21 billion to clean up these tanks
the federal government mandated that we had to have oxygenate in this bill in the past and we have done that before we have done that with flu vaccine we have done that for biomaterials access insurance fund
mr chairman as yogi berra used to say it s dja 2 vu all over again i never would have imagined during a time of war in the middle east heading into the summer smog season in cities like washington dc with prices at the pump hitting 250 a gallon we are here today telling our constituents that the wisest course of action the best america can do with its energy policy is more of the same
we should be the world leader in renewable energy and hybrid technologies not playing catch up to the danes germans and japanese
in that regard i regret that an amendment i offered with reps
it once again proposes to despoil the anwr while ignoring the potential for far greater fuel gains through a long overdue increase in caf standards
and it brazenly extends a special interest liability waiver to mtbe manufacturers whose product is polluting groundwater in many of our districts leaving taxpayers to pick up the tab
in my home state of maryland important statewide energy efficiency standards and local lng siting perogatives are preempted
mr chairman i would want to thank chairman hobson first of all for his very good work as i mentioned in subcommittee and full committee his fairness his judicious temperament the fact that he is a gentleman and also that he has exercised a great deal of foresight and leadership over the last 3 years as chairman of the subcommittee
the first area is the area of highperformance computing an area where the united states invented the field and long held undisputed leadership in the world
in the house bill for fiscal year 2004 the committee recommended an increase in funding to enable the department of energy to acquire additional advanced computing capability and to initiate longerterm research and development
despite being faced with budget constraints the department of energy office of science sustained this increase in 2005
however pursuing a 100 millionplus leadershipclass machine with level funding was not going to put us back in the lead
so the recommendation before us today increases funding for advanced scientific computing research by 39 million 25 million for hardware 5 million for computational research and 9 million for competitive university grants to restore the ongoing level of core research in this area that the president s budget recommendation cut
the second area that has been a subject of concern for a number of years in an area where we reduced funding is laboratory directed research and development
as an initial effort to get its arms around this program which reached an aggregate funding level in fiscal year 2003 of 365 million the committee mandated a comprehensive report on projects from the department of energy and initiated a gao investigation
in developing recommendations for last year s bill the committee based its guidance and statement of concerns on the results of those investigations and reports
a quarter billion dollars is a healthy level of funding that could be used to fix many problems in energy research and water infrastructure to name but two
as we state in the report the committee recognizes the value of conducting discretionary research at the national laboratories but we have now brought the funding level to this research back within reason and given it a sense of direction
and my last illustration if you would of a sense of direction that we have had over the last 3 years is in the area of nuclear weapons
in particular coming into fiscal year 2004 appropriations the president was asking for funds for a robust nuclear earth penetrator for studies of new nuclear weapons potentially for new missions for funds to proceed with the preparation of a modern pit facility to manufacture 450 plutonium triggers and a shift to an 18month readiness posture for a return to underground nuclear testing
taken together these policy initiatives signaled a shift in nuclear weapons policy
in 2004 the committee among other things reduced funding for the robust nuclear earth penetrator to 5 million from 15 million ultimately agreeing to 75 million in conference zeroed out funds for proceeding with the modern pit facility and held the test readiness posture at 24 months
most significantly in 2004 4 million of the funds for advanced weapons concepts were fenced so that they could not be spent until the administration delivered a nuclear weapons stockpile plan
in fiscal year 2005 the committee went further and zeroed funding for the earth penetrator while maintaining a 24month test readiness posture
the committee has taken a constructive approach in trying to positively influence better policies
in this year s bill the committee is solidifying the progress made last year and in the previous year
secondly the earth penetrator funding is again zero in the committee recommendation and third test readiness posture is held to 24 months
finally the reliable replacement warhead concept was included in the president s request
essentially in this bill as well mr chairman we are taking an advanced look
we have called for the army corps of engineers the bureau of reclamation as well as the department of energy to undertake 5year plans in programs
i recommend that all members join me in supporting this bill
in a few professions in our society seventh years are sabbaticals and times for reflection
in the congress we ca nt take a year off but i feel compelled to reflect
during this time chairman hobson has led our subcommittee to take a longterm perspective on a number of important issues and this is resulting in some profound and positive changes
high performance computing is an area where the united states invented the field and long held undisputed leadership in the world
in the house bill for fy 2004 the committee recommended an increase of 40 million to enable doe to acquire additional advanced computing capability
and to initiate longerterm research and development on next generation computer architectures ultimately despite being faced with budget constraints the doe office of science sustained this increase in the president s fy 2005 budget
however pursuing a 100 million plus leadershipclass machine with level funding of 25 million per year will never put the united states back in the lead
in the face of an even more constrained funding environment the president s request for fy 2006 pulled back from the strong support favored by the congress
so the recommendation before us today increases funding for advanced scientific computing research by 39 million 25 million for hardware 5 million for computational research and 9 million for competitive university grants to restore the ongoing level of core research in this area that the president s budget recommended for cuts
by taking the longterm perspective and sustaining support for a highly desirable outcome the committee is doing its part to ensure that the us reasserts it technological leadership in the area of supercomputing a technical capability that underpins our ability to invent the future
as an initial effort to get its arms around this program which reached an aggregate funding level in fy 2003 of 365 million per year the committee mandated a comprehensive report on ldrd projects from doe and initiated a gao investigation of ldrd
in developing its recommendations for fy 2005 the committee based its guidance and statement of concerns on the results of the gao investigation and what had been learned from reviewing the extensive doe reports
the committee is today recommending that ldrd be limited explicitly to 250 million in fy 2006 to be allocated to the labs by doe
a quarter billion dollars is a healthy level of funding that could be used to fix many problems in energy research water infrastructure etc so the committee truly recognizes the value of conducting discretionary research at doe s national laboratories but has now brought the funding level for this research back within reason and given it a sense of direction
in particular coming into the fy 2004 appropriations process the president was asking for funds for a robust nuclear earth penetrator rnep for studies of new nuclear weapons potentially for new missions for funds to proceed with preparation of a modern pit facility to manufacture 450 plutonium triggers per year and a shift to an i8month readiness posture for a return to underground nuclear testing
taken together these policy initiatives signaled the house report accompanying the fy 2004 energy and water appropriations bill states the fiscal year 2004 budget request is the second budget request delivered to the committee that is loosely justified on the requirements of the nuclear posture review policy document but lacking a formal plan that specifies the changes to the stockpile reflecting the president s decision on the nuclear weapons stockpile plan the committee reduced funding for the rnep to 5 million from 15 million ultimately agreeing to 75 million in conference zeroed funds for proceeding with a modern pit facility and held the test readiness posture at 24 months
in fy 2005 the committee went further and zeroed funding for the rnep while maintaining the 24month test readiness posture and continuing to defer the modern pit facility
in fy2006 the committee is solidifying the progress made last year
second rnep funding is again zero in the committee s recommendation
fourth the rrw concept was included in the president s request
in light of these examples where taking a longerterm perspective is showing results i fully support the efforts in this fy2006 energy and water development appropriation to get all three principal agencies funded in this bill to adopt and communicate 5year plans for their programs
further we have long underinvested in the water infrastructure of our nation and although this year is no exception the bill undertakes significant efforts to help the us army corps of engineers get effective control over management particularly fiscal management of projects
management improvements prepare the way for the most effective use of whatever level of funding can be supplied in the future
the chairman and i are taking steps to involve all members of the subcommittee in the oversight of the programs we fund
the national priority project designation act which is this amendment would complement the provisions already included in hr 6 by creating an additional incentive for renewable energy deployment and energy conservation at virtually no cost to the federal government
this is a freemarket extremely lowcost way to encourage investment and innovation in renewable energy and energy conservation
in summary the amendment which is modeled after the malcolm baldrige quality award act would recognize and highlight major green building and renewable energy projects
the legislation would direct the secretary of energy to establish guidelines for those interested in the designation to submit applications for an annual award process
the president would then in consultation with the secretary of energy select projects that advance the field of renewable energy technology and contribute to north american energy independence to receive the national priority project designation
winning projects could also use the national priority project designation in their advertising
mr chairman i yield myself the balance of my time and in conclusion i would just like to say that any national energy policy should be heavily invested in energy conservation
yet there are so many important things in this bill
i do not want to vote against the new residential personal 15 percent tax credit for photovoltaics that does not exist today or the 20 percent tax credit for homeowners to install energyefficiency improvements to their home or charlie bass s billion dollar rebate program for investment in renewable energy
and i hope that the conference report after we work with the senate has it all in there because no one in this house wants an energy policy more than me
mr chairman i rise to make remarks on the subrogation provision in the price anderson section of hr 6
mr chairman i would like to discuss a provision in this bill that i have some concerns with
i have the pleasure of representing the department of energy sites in oak ridge tennessee
i am proud of the caliber of contractors we have in oak ridge and the work they do for our country
i have some concerns with section 612 in the nuclear title of this bill
this provision dealing with price anderson act indemnity is reportedly designed to make doe contractors more financially accountable for their actions in support of the doe nuclear mission
the fact is that there are already a wide variety of mechanisms in place to ensure doe contractor accountability from civil penalties of up to 110 000 a day to stop work orders to contract terminations to criminal fines and imprisonment
in the 48year history of price anderson no government contractors have been found to have engaged in willful misconduct are we willing to ask the government s best contractors at all levels the ones we want involved in this business to face significantly increased financial risks that have and will likely remain uninsurable
i believe that we presently have sufficient mechanisms in place to hold the contracting community accountable
the inclusion of this provision in the final energy bill will have the opposite effect as intended
i want to make some brief comments and then engage in some colloquy with the chairman
at no time in my 9 years on the committee on appropriations have i seen this kind of diligence that the gentleman from ohio chairman hobson has shown
mr chairman if i may engage in a colloquy i would like to say a few words on the importance of fielding a leadershipclass computer for open science
in the subcommittee bill in the area of fusion energy sciences the subcommittee offered a very reasonable approach to funding fusion science given the uncertainty surrounding the thermonuclear experimental reactor equipment
as the subcommittee report notes if the united states expects to be a serious contributor to international fusion research in general and iter in particular the nation needs to maintain strong domestic research programs and user facilities to train the next generation of fusion scientists and engineers i think that is exactly right and i want to commend the gentleman and subcommittee staff for putting that strong statement in our report
mr chairman i want to highlight one area in particular that we fund and ask for the gentleman from ohio s comments
mr chairman i rise in opposition to hr 6 the energy policy act
in fact enactment of hr 6 is likely to result in higher prices at the pump for americans
it provides 75 billion in tax breaks and billions more in royalty relief to companies like exxon mobil chevron texaco and conocophillips which are already earning record profits supposedly to encourage these companies to drill more on our public lands and produce more gasoline and oil
the bill also permits drilling in the artic refuge thereby putting at risk one of the last pristine areas in the world simply to gain less than six months worth of oil
instead we should be increasing the corporate average fuel economy cafe standards for cars and trucks sold in the united states to a more reasonable level
mr chairman los angeles is consistently ranked among the worst cities in america when it comes to air pollution and smog
mr chairman i am also very disappointed in the fact that this bill does nothing to address the massive defrauding of californian consumers at the hands of enron and other energy companies during the energy crisis of 2000 and 2001
unfortunately for thousands of californians the energy companies succeeded in their efforts
in the summer of 2000 energy companies overcharged california 25 billion
in 2001 california paid approximately 26 billion for electricity because of the unscrupulous trading practices of the energy companies raising the rates of every california ratepayer
they want us to support a bill that makes real investments in renewable energy and energy conservation
republicans in congress say they want limited government yet they enact legislation intruding on the endoflife decisions for the poor woman in florida
congressional leaders say they want to support high moral standards in government yet they gut the ethics process in the house
and in this socalled energy bill we shower billions on special interests while ignoring our nation s serious energy needs
shell oil reported the highest corporate profits in the history of the united kingdom
the bill fails to address the market abuse and manipulation that caused the california energy crisis costing consumers in california and western states billions of dollars
this bill carves a loophole in the laws protecting our coastlines our forests and our public lands
this bill makes the most significant changes to the clean air act in 15 years allowing corporate polluters to expose 53 million americans to air pollution for years longer than current law
before i discuss the merits of this amendment that i seek to offer i want to extend my appreciation to the chairman of the committee on energy and commerce the gentleman from texas mr barton xz4000180 for his courtesy to me in allowing me to offer this amendment
a balanced energy bill should not just be production of more energy but it should be conservation reduction of the demand side of the equation and i feel that the legislation is lacking in that regard
it does not mandate an increase in the cafe standards for automobiles although i think that is a good idea but we do not mandate it
it simply calls on the president to come up with a plan to lead in an effort to reduce the waste of oil
now in this house even this is controversial as amazing as it may seem
this seems to be the only place in america where trying not to waste oil is a bad thing
the other body voted on this very same amendment and they voted to accept it 99 to 1 now i know we are going to hear in a minute that this is a backdoor way to impose new standards or regulations
it worked in california
when we had our energy crisis a few years ago we had a real energy crunch and the people in california pitched in and almost overnight reduced energy waste by 4 to 10 percent depending on whose numbers you accept
this legislation that is before us overall is going to increase the amount of oil we are going to have to bring in from the middle east
for our national security s sake we ought to simply reduce some of the waste in oil that goes on every single year
i am particularly struck that at a time when we have so many brave american men and women serving overseas willing to sacrifice everything for us we may not be able to muster the political will to ask the american people to chip in a little and reduce the waste of oil
the greatest country in the world can not even find the will to achieve small reductions in the waste of oil
but if he has some ideas let us try to do at least the minimum we can do to reduce the waste of oil that is causing us to bring in and use and in fact overuse oil that we have to bring in from overseas
and the president can simply appeal to people tune up your motors promote oil savings in the industrial sector keep vehicles properly tuned improve the tire inflations improve air traffic management
mr chairman i rise in support of the amendment
we have a member on our side who wants to speak in favor of the proposal
in closing i want to urge support for the amendment and also express to the gentleman from new york mr boehlert xz4000350 for whom i have the highest regard that i would like to work with him along with the gentleman from virginia mr tom davis to find a middle ground and to resolve any concerns that he has
mr chairman the republican leadership in the house has done everything it could possibly do to keep us from voting on this issue
and if we do not support the capps amendment we are keeping this unfunded mandate in the bill and our local governments are going to have to pick up the billions of dollars of costs to clean up the drinking water
and that is why i am speaking for the republican side of the chamber because the republicans came in under the contract with america and said we want to do away with unfunded mandates and we will let them be challenged on the house floor
they can not regulate or participate even in key energy decisions affecting states and localities such as lng facilities or relicensing of hydroelectric dams
and in this bill the most egregious example of arrogant centralization of power in washington is this massive unfunded mandate
now that we know what they may have known in advance that mbte can cause problems in our drinking water they want to shift the costs from the oil companies that have caused the pollution to the local taxpayers
and i guess the republican leadership fears that they might because that is why they have gone to such enormous lengths to not allow anybody in this chamber to vote on this specific issue
every time we asked the committee on rules to allow a motion to strike be in order they denied it
mr chairman i rise today to speak in support of hr 6 the energy policy act of 2005
it s a tremendous step in the right direction for this nation to achieve energy independence
i have been working in central florida over the past several years to promote research into hydrogenpowered vehicles
this bill promotes a cleaner environment by encouraging new innovations and the use of alternative power sources by launching a stateoftheart program to enable hydrogen fuel cell cars to compete in the marketplace by 2020
if our nation is to meet these needs in the coming decades it will be in part due to continued advances in energy efficiency and conservation helping to reduce our demand on foreign supply and stimulating economic growth
i stand in strong support of this legislation and look forward to seeing it enacted into law
madam chairman i rise in strong support of hr 6 balanced legislation designed to reduce our dependence on imported energy a balanced approach that has earned bipartisan support in the house committee on ways and means emphasizes conservation alternative sources of energy as well as finding more domestic sources of energy
twenty percent of all the energy we consume in america onefifth of our energy consumed is consumed at home
in fact the average american spends about 1 500 a year in heating and cooling their home
this legislation today contains provisions out of hr 1212 legislation that provides up to a 2 000 tax credit that homeowners can use in their existing home to make it more energy efficient put in better windows better doors better insulation do a better job of sealing the home
in fact it is the ultimate reason we are insecure as a nation
in fact by promoting the interests of corporations over consumers and pollution over conservation this bill makes the united states much less secure
it is time we stopped all efforts to drill in anwr because this is only a stopgap measure
we should not even be having this discussion because drilling in anwr will not make us energy independent and it will not end our nation s reliance on middle east oil
drilling in anwr will do little to reduce our current dependence on foreign oil because it will take more than 10 years yes more than 10 years to process what little oil may be there
in fact if we spent half the time promoting legislation that encourages the use of renewable energy that we have discussing drilling in anwr we would be close to developing a sensible energy policy that would ensure real energy independence
we would invest in alternative renewable clean energy conservation and efficiency
the automobile industry has changed significantly over the last 3 decades but the epa standards are stuck in the past overestimating fuel economy data
it will require the epa to update its testing standards so that consumers will have accurate fuel economy information in the future
but the only real policies to be found in this immoral legislation are tax breaks for polluters swollen gasoline prices and continued reliance on fossil fuels of the past
this legislation fails to even mention climate change or global warming which scientists of all stripes acknowledge is caused at least in part by high levels of carbon dioxide emissions from automobiles
it is obvious in this energy bill that those who claim that drilling in the arctic national wildlife refuge in alaska will cure our nation s energy policy do not know much about how oil is produced
drilling in anwr will do little to reduce our current dependence on foreign oil because it will take a full decade to process what little oil may be there in the first place
the oil dollars that go to oppressive middle east regimes do not of course help the poor people in these countries
in this way us policies actually discourage democracy in the middle east because we continue to help maintain the economic gap between the rich and the poor
in truth this failure to reduce our dependence on middle east oil along with president bush s supremely misguided invasion of iraq have combined to make americans less secure not more secure
the bush administration has falsely labeled the war in iraq much like the latest energy bill as the essence of protecting our national security when in fact both contribute to our lack of security
already more than 1 500 american soldiers and tens of thousands of iraqi civilians have been killed in this war not to mention the more than 12 000 troops who have been gravely wounded
president bush claims that things are going well in iraq demonstrated by the fact that 150 000 iraqi soldiers have been adequately trained but if 150 000 iraqi soldiers have been trained then why do 150 000 american soldiers remain in the country
i urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join me in this effort to truly secure america for the future
this amendment would ensure that the states have a proper role in the siting of energy facilities
there is this photograph of a large tanker in boston harbor
i do not have the good fortune to represent a city like boston but there are four five or six communities in my congressional district communities of 1 000 5 000 or 10 000 people where a facility like this would change the basic characteristics of that community forever
i believe the restrictions on reprogramming of funds and the constraints on the use of continuing contracts contained in this bill will lead to the inefficient use of appropriated funds and will disadvantage congressionallyadded projects
congress does not fully fund projects in a given fiscal year and the schedule for constructing these large water resources projects is subject to the weather environmental conditions and other dynamic circumstances
however the constraints in this bill are too restrictive
also the bill earmarks nearly all available funding which makes it impossible for the corps to pay back those projects that it took money from in previous reprogramming
while there may have been some unwise uses of continuing contracts by the corps the restrictions in this bill are too severe
current law requires the corps to use continuing contracts whenever funds are provided in an appropriations act but there is not enough money to complete the project
section 104 is inconsistent with current law in that it restricts the amount of work a contractor can do to only that which can be accomplished with fy 06 funds
under section 104 the contractor can not proceed at his own risk in anticipation of fy 07 and future year funding
section 104 is legislative in nature and i intend to make a point of order that will strike it from the bill
section 105 further restricts the use of continuing contracts and has the remarkable effect of restricting the corps ability to carry out congressionallyadded projects in this appropriation bill
section 105 states that none of the funds provided in fy 06 may be used to award a continuing contract that extends into fy 07 unless the administration budgets for the project in fy 07
this means that even if a member has funding for a project in this bill for fy 06 not fully funded there are three options 1 hope to award a continuing contract before administration comes out with its budget in february of 2006 2 award a single year contract for only one increment of the project resulting in increased costs or 3 wait until fiscal year 2008 to award a continuing contract for the project delaying project construction and project benefits
in alaska there are currently eight projects under construction using continuing contracts
seven of these are not in the president s budget
nevertheless under section 105 of the bill a continuing contract could not be used in fy 06 and the corps will have to break the projects into smaller pieces or wait until fy 08 to spend the fy 06 appropriated funds
i believe the restrictions in this bill will delay these important projects in alaska and make them more expensive
information is needed for all projects not just the ones in the administration s budget
in addition i believe that a 5year schedule of spending for each project will allow the congress to better appropriate funding that can match the corps capabilities for individual projects
while i have reservations about the effects of some of the measures required by this bill i believe i can work with the committee leadership as this bill moves forward to see that my concerns are addressed in conference
madam chairman i want to thank the gentleman from california chairman pombo and the gentleman from texas chairman barton for their fine work on a good piece of legislation that starts our process in becoming independent providing energy policy which i have heard none from the other side
and we are talking about an area that is not pristine an area in fact that should be developed that is 74 miles from the pipeline an area that we have developed already in prudhoe bay and we can see the great damage that is done up there
so madam chairman those who would support the markey amendment are really supporting terrorism because you do not want to develop the domestic fuel supply in this country and we can
in fact the gentleman from massachusetts mr markey xz4002530 mentioned it today about special interests serving up special interests
it says dear friend in a few short hours the republican energy bill will be brought up for debate and a vote on the floor of the house of representatives
last week in the committee on energy and commerce i offered a series of amendments to increase the average fuel efficiency and it was turned down by the republicans
i then offered an amendment in the committee on resources to strip a provision from the bill that would open the arctic national wildlife refuge for oil drilling the republicans again voted against it
if we allow drilling in the arctic national wildlife refuge we will forever ruin this unique wilderness and allow the oil industry to target all 450 national wildlife refuges
for the last 5 years i have led the battle in the house to stop the republicans in the congress from selling off one of our greatest natural resources to the powerful special interests
help me continue to fight to expose to the american people the dangers of this extreme and ineffective action by making a contribution today just by the way dial in to wwwedmarkeyorgcontribute
we are no longer the only buyers on the block in this world with china and india in the field
and if we do not wake up we will have a collapse in our economy
we must develop not only anwr but other sources of fossil fuels in this country as well as nuclear and as well as hydro and as well as wind and all those other forms of energy and quit talking about pipe dreams because if we do not there will not be the jobs for the future generations and this country can not lead this world
and to have someone stand on this floor and offer an amendment that will take out the only provisional production is against america against this great nation and in fact would do the wrong thing for this nation
in addition exposure to this has resulted as we know in a number of cases of cancer birth defects and other illnesses
the mtbe provisions presented in the energy bill would restrict the existing rights of states and communities to seek compensation under the law
approximately half the members of our house have served in our state legislatures
i will enter into the record at the end of my statement their opinion in fact that this is a violation of the unfunded mandates act that they too supported in the mid1990s when the majority enacted this very important piece of legislation
for my own district the 20th district in california we believe the costs could exceed 150 million because of the large number of sites that we have
this bill eliminates my district s ability to hold producers liable for the problem and help them assist in cleaning up
res 95 would impose unfunded mandates of over 30 billion in fy2006 alone if adopted by a conference committee
the unfunded mandates proposed in hr 6 would serve to worsen what already is an unacceptable situation
mr chairman i rise today to express my support of the house version of the energy and water appropriations act for fiscal year 2006 and i urge my colleagues to vote in support of this important measure
as a farmer who works the land in colorado s san luis valley i know and understand water issues and i ca nt emphasize how important it is to invest back into local water infrastructure
without this investment i fear we will continue to see a decline in the management of this irreplaceable resource water is the lifeblood of our rural communities
i am pleased the committee included funding for three important projects which i had requested back in march for the 3rd district of colorado
first and foremost the committee included 56 million in funding for construction of the animasla plata project
this funding level represents a 4 million increase over the president s budget request and comes on the heels of a colorado delegation letter which i spearheaded back in march
completion of the alp will provide a muchneeded water supply in the southwest corner of our state for both indian and nonindian municipal and industrial purposes
it will also fulfill the intent of a carefully negotiated settlement agreement in the mid1980s to ensure the legitimate claims of the two colorado ute tribes could be met without harm to the existing uses of their nontribal neighbors
this increased funding will allow the bureau to move forward in a way that will ensure timely completion of the alp and avoid costly delays
the us army corps of engineers in cooperation with the city of pueblo colorado has completed 90 percent of the project including fish habitat structures along a 9mile section of the river below pueblo dam through downtown pueblo
finally the committee also provided a 1021 million appropriation for the army corps of engineers to engage in operations and maintenance at trinidad lake colorado this amount represents almost a 100 000 increase from the fy2005 funding level
the lake is located in southern colorado on the purgatoire river and bordered by the historic santa fe trail
mr chairman i rise today in support of the energy policy act of 2005
finally the energy policy act of 2005 will provide an environment of certainty and stability that will foster prosperity in america
rising energy prices is like a tax that americans must pay everyday in the form of higher gas prices higher costs to heat and cool our homes and higher prices to move products across the country
mr chairman i rise to claim the time in opposition
under the current mms rules what this provision would do would simply provide relief for those companies making multiyear in many cases multi hundreds of millions of dollars of investments to produce oil for our country s needs
i would ask those colleagues to join with me in providing incentives so we can drill for oil in the deep waters of the gulf of mexico
do we drill in the deep waters of the gulf of mexico where such production is welcomed and invited or do we look to other areas where that production is not welcomed and not invited
vote to keep manufacturing in our country vote so we can become more independent of foreign sources of energy
mr chairman i must rise in opposition to this amendment
the gentleman from louisiana mr jindal xz4006340 gave some numbers that apply to what has happened with the leaseholds out on the outer continental shelf in recent times
i am concerned as most are about the energy crisis in this country
at the same time in order for us to reach some independence we need to continue to encourage deep water shallow water oil gas and every type of mining that will help us get out of this problem
the language in this amendment costs the companies approximately twice as much as the simpler testing they are doing now
it achieves the goal we all want to have accuracy in a much more reasonable and a much less expensive way
mr chairman i rise today in objection to hr 6 the energy bill under consideration by the full house of representatives this week
sadly the energy bill does little to reduce our nation s dependence on foreign oil decrease rising oil and gas prices increase our national security protect our environment or encourage investment in renewable energy sources
in fact mr chairman of the 8 billion in tax breaks in this bill only about 6 percent goes toward energy efficiency and renewable sources of energy and the rest goes to the already booming oil and natural gas industry that already receives more than generous incentives
but oil need not be the lead driver in our national security policy
all too often i hear from my constituents in western new york that too many lowincome families disabled individuals and senior citizens are not able to afford their energy costs
my district is particularly hard hit with extreme cold temperatures which cause more families to face unaffordable heating costs and put families and seniors at a higher risk of lifethreatening illness or death if their homes are too cold in the winter or too hot in the summer
mr chairman i rise in support of the conaway amendment
and i rise in support of this amendment because it is a jobs amendment
in the 1980s and the 1990s we saw a great fluctuation in the price of oil and gas
even though today we have higher oil and gas prices some of those folks that were involved in the industry never came back
so it is very important that we support this amendment so that we have more tool pushers more roughnecks and more truck drivers in places like oklahoma
madam chairman i rise today in strong opposition to the energy policy act of 2005
in my home district the average price for a gallon of regular unleaded is 222 compared to 176 just one year ago
yet only seven percent of the tax incentives in this bill will go towards renewable energy and energy efficiency leaving us to be reliant on the same old energy sources
in addition to its misdirected energy priorities the bill contains several dirty little footnotes
that requires a balanced energy policy that aids domestic production but more importantly sends us in a new direction by investing in renewable and energy efficient technologies
perhaps the other body will have a title that will work a little bit better in the hydrogen area and i hope that we will catch the vision of a different way of getting around
imagine that one takes delivery today in spartanburg south carolina of a brand new bmw
they get in the car they program it to go somewhere they take their hands off the wheel
it seems like science fiction but the good news is that we on the committee on science are in the business of making science fiction into reality and it is not that far away
in this bill we have the opportunity to do just that to invest serious money in the technology that can lead us to a hydrogen economy
a fellow drove by in his jeep and said jump on the dam is giving way this place is going to be flooded
and he said i ve got faith in god god is going to save me
the guy in the boat says jump in there is more water coming
the guy no i have faith in god god is going to save me
the man says no i have got faith in god god is going to save me
he says god i had faith in you
this nation has been so richly blessed with so much in the way of resources
i very much appreciate it because this is such an important issue for all of our country but especially for our district in east texas
but the things we are talking about the resources that we have in our district include oil gas coal lignite biomass material
i was just in a couple of lignite mines in my district in the last 2 weeks and we worry about the destruction of property but when we see what has been done and the way the land is reclaimed and reestablished it ends being a work of art
of course we have heard in anwr previously that it would destroy the caribou population
when the pipeline was going to be laid many of us remember back in the 1970s they said it was just going to decimate the caribou
when people complained we should not have oil and gas wells out in the coast because it is going to destroy the fish and the teeming life in the gulf of mexico it turns out after they put offshore rigs out there that is where commercial fishermen went because that was an artificial reef and it ended up helping fishing as well
we also have the eastman plant actually more in harrison county but there by longview and they use natural gas to make plastic products all kinds of products there
if we have cheaper natural gas the papermill that had to close down in lufkin because they could not get cheap enough gas they are planning on reopening if that can happen
clear up in longview there is a man who lost 7 percent of his business when the paper mill closed all because of energy costs
these small business companies in east texas we have got the drillers themselves that go back to work
two are away in college now and our youngest is a junior in high school
since 1999 there has been a significant drop in the number of jobs in the oil field
as the price of oil and natural gas have fluctuated workers have come and gone in this industry
as an example one community in my district kermit texas in 19981999 had some 9 000 people living there
as a result of the downturn in those years and the loss of jobs that community now has 6 000 people living there
even with the significant increases in the price of natural gas and crude oil that we are experiencing today those people have not come back to kermit texas
my amendment would simply require the energy department in consultation with the interior department as well as the labor department to conduct a study of the impact that this shortage is having and to present possible solutions to the shortage
i speak in favor of this amendment
in 1981 there were some 16 million people employed in the oil and gas industry
a dramatic decrease in the number of good solid jobs in this economy and jobs in an industry that is clearly vital to our national interest
i encourage my colleagues to vote in favor of the amendment
i rise in opposition to this rule and to the underlying bill
in 1990 the oil industry began adding mtbe to gasoline in order to make it burn cleaner
25 years later over 18 000 water systems in 29 states are infected with mtbe including three wells in my home district of sacramento
so they went to their friends in washington and the republican majority gave them a blanket amnesty for cleaning up their pollution
mr speaker we should be investing in renewables and conservation
this is how the majority chooses to interpret in this particular case the substance and the intent of a series of amendments made to the bill we voted on last week
and what has been done here with this majority report in that context is a tremendous disappointment to me
we depend we in the minority depend on a process that relies on honesty and good faith and the duties and those duties i truly believe were breached in the case of this report
it is very very important to better protect young girls from falling prey to abusive boyfriends and older men and ensuring that parents have the opportunity to be involved in their daughters medical decisions
ciana accomplished this both these purposes first by making it a criminal offense to transport a minor across state lines in order to obtain an abortion in another state and avoiding a parental notification law in that state
for example the amendments offered to exempt taxicab drivers as has been mentioned bus drivers and others in the business of public transport clergy godparents aunts uncles first cousins of the minor grandparents or adult siblings it would have given any of those individuals who may be sexually abusing a young girl in essence a safe harbor thus defeating the primary purpose of ciana
the characterizations of the amendments as reflected in the committee report accurately describe the safe harbor that would be afforded to abusive men through the amendments offered
in march 2005 75 percent of 1 500 registered voters indicated their support for parental notification laws
the fundamental rights of parents in parental notification laws are supported by supreme court precedent
it helps to ensure the full funding of the important accounts which have been depleted during our global war on terror and our effort to assist the iraqi and afghan people in their efforts to establish functioning democracies in their countries
additionally the bill includes important funding for afghan reconstruction and counterterrorism assistance counternarcotics efforts international food aid and relief to address the terrible tragedies resulting from the massive tsunami that struck the southwest pacific and indian oceans in december of 2004
mr speaker additionally this rule provides important increases in coverage for the servicemembers group life insurance and increases coverage for individual soldiers from 250 000 to 400 000
while neither of these benefits can ever replace the lives of brave american service personnel lost in action they can assist their families through the hard times they will face while recovering from the loss of their loved ones
just yesterday we saw on the front page of the washington post a graphic photograph that captured the terrible effects of the war on an innocent victim and the courage and compassion of the american soldiers who are engaged in the battle
we should keep this image in mind as we commence the debate on the conference report today
many may wish to raise policy issues in this debate
mr speaker i believe in this discussion we should focus our remarks on what truly counts
we have committed 170 000 of our servicemen and women to fight terrorism and advance the cause of freedom in iraq and afghanistan
we owe them our full support in the battles they wage on behalf of the american people and the cause of liberty
i further understand that the chairman of the committee on the judiciary is prepared to file a supplemental report immediately after the adoption of this resolution and also to place it in the lt em gt lt em gt congressional record
this supplemental report will be part of the official legislative history of the bill and will amend the descriptions contained in the original report
the filing of the supplemental report represents the regular order for correcting problems in earlier committee reports filed with the house
it is not unusual to finance wars in this particular fashion
i am very glad that that particular measure was put back in during conference
let me read a couple of things in here
there is line after line of great specificity my good friend the chairman of the committee on appropriations was very careful in crafting a bill that will meet the needs of our personnel
although i remind my good friend on the other side of the aisle this body and the other body vote on a bipartisan basis to make the commitment in iraq
i could read off name after name including the distinguished nominee from the other body of my friends on the other side of the aisle a candidate for president last time who voted in favor of this particular contest
having made that decision once we place people on the line under fire and in danger we owe it to them to provide them what they need
that is a very legitimate point but i think it would it be the height of folly and irresponsibility to not fund people when they are in the field in action
in closing i would like to say that i believe we have had a good debate on the rule today
this bill has been carefully crafted and worked in a way to ensure that our service men and women receive the best supplies and equipment when they go to war and that those supplies and equipment are replenished and replaced in a timely fashion
the men and women serving our cause in iraq ask for nothing more
in good conscience we should give them nothing less

mr speaker in accordance with my request of last thursday i offer a privileged resolution h res 253 as to a question of the privileges of the house and ask for its immediate consideration
and i do this because the committee on the judiciary report on hr 748 mischaracterized amendments offered by members in a way that distorted both the effect of the amendments and the intentions of the members
i offer this resolution to protect the rights of every member in this body
none of us wants to see our amendments mischaracterized in a way that undermines our good faith
none of us wants to see our legislative work distorted in a way that diminishes our motives
there is little doubt in my mind that the amendment characterizations included in the committee report were distorting and damaging
this has never happened before in my memory
the amendments were drafted in a careful and straightforward manner as they have been for each of the last four congresses
mr speaker i am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from wisconsin mr obey xz4003000 a senior member in the house
i want my friend a member of the committee on the judiciary the gentleman from florida mr feeney xz4001310 to understand it is not about anything in the debate that took place to which we were objecting
we debated the bill in committee
we are talking about the titles in the section that were mislabeled
now what we are doing here right now is hoping to raise this question of the privileges of the house regarding the blatant abuse of power republicans mischaracterizing the description of numerous democratic amendments when some of the amendments had been considered in previous congresses
these are the same amendments that were properly entitled in other congresses
another supplemental spending bill for the war in iraq and why
because time and time again the republicans refuse to spend one cent for this war in their sham budget a budget every democrat opposed this year and last year because we need these socalled off budget bills to cover up the exploding deficits the republicans have given not to us but to our children and grandchildren totaling 27 000 for every american
if this were in place it would not have prevented the attacks of 911
this legislation which again the 911 commission has called unwarranted was added by the right wing extremists in the republican caucus whose joy in bashing immigrants is exceeded only by their zest for tax cuts for the wealthy in this country
all i can tell the gentleman is i know there is a lot of discussion about that over in the senate
the house as the gentleman knows passed the budget that has substantial mandatory savings in it
the house is very interested in holding the line on their mandatory savings and the senate is trying to work through this process
i am sure that the discussions will fly fast and furious over next week in trying to get this conference report done
mr speaker i rise in strong support of not only this rule but the conference report as well
i want to congratulate my colleagues the gentleman from oklahoma mr cole xz4000770 and i know we are going to be hearing from the gentleman from georgia mr gingrey xz4001510 in just a few minutes some very thoughtful remarks
this bill is one which encompasses as we all know the very important aspect of ensuring that our men and women in uniform as we are in the midst of the war on terror including iraq have what they need
those of us who were house conferees on the republican side pushed very hard to make sure that we could deal with the driver s license issue the asylum issue and the effort to close the 3 12 mile gap in the border fence which has been discussed here many many times
we simply said to the states as is included in this measure that if a state chooses to give driver s licenses to people who are here illegally then those driver s licenses can not be used for any federal purpose getting on board an aircraft going into a federal courthouse applying for any federal program
well these issues that we discussed and tried to include in the 911 conference last fall unfortunately were not able to be included because our colleagues in the other body chose to resist
i also wanted to compliment president bush who has strongly supported the effort to include the real id act in this measure
i am pleased we are planning next week to hold hearings on hr 98 our goal of putting into place a counterfeitproof social security card so that we can also play a role in diminishing that magnet which draws people illegally across the border and in so doing we can allow the border patrol to focus their attention on the potential terrorist threat coming across our borders and other criminals
it is still a problem with which we have to contend but the measures that are included in this supplemental appropriations bill are critical to dealing with that challenge that we face
i generally congratulate the gentleman from california mr lewis xz4002392 and all who have been involved on both sides of the aisle in implementation of this important measure
as a matter of fact in the state of florida which i respect the people of florida amended our constitution in 2004 and overwhelmingly passed an amendment to our constitution that provides as follows the legislature is authorized to require by general law for notification to a parent or guardian of a minor before termination of the minor s pregnancy now mr speaker the judiciary during its markup which i participated in considered several amendments
there is nothing in the committee report that disparages any of the intentions of these members
and as the chairman said there is no exception provided for grandparents who happen to molest a child for taxicab drivers for uncles for nieces in any of the amendments that were offered
as the chairman said my friend from new york mr nadler xz4002890 has frequently compared this bill to the slave holders protection bill in the 1850s
it really is about this whole notion of abortion and i do not understand the intensity completely but i believe it has something to do with the conscience in all of us collectively that we are beginning to realize that somehow as americans we are bigger than abortion on demand that 40 million dead children is enough and that somehow we need to start asking the real question
if it does then we are in the midst of the greatest human holocaust in the history of humanity
i think somehow we collectively in our hearts understand that and therefore it creates all this acrimony on the finer points but the real abuse of power is that this body has the power to protect these little babies and instead we are debating the finer points in a committee report and i am ashamed of that
mr speaker today i rise in support of the rule for the emergency supplemental appropriations act and the underlying bill
in addition to the needed funds to sustain military operations and reconstruction efforts in the middle east this legislation contains two key provisions that i would like to highlight
the first is language that ensures that funds in the bill will not be used to cancel the multiyear contract for c130j procurement
although their longevity is clearly a testament to the value of these critical aircraft we should be very concerned that the c130e and h models continue to age at alarming rates putting our tactical airlift capability at risk in the near term
in fact several weeks ago the air force announced that they are grounding much of the c130e models because of severe fatigue in their wings including a dozen that have been flying missions in and out of iraq and afghanistan
mr speaker some of these planes were used in vietnam and we are literally flying their wings off in the middle east
mr speaker because of the growing problem that the air force faces in its tactical airlift program i support the c130j language and i would like to express my sincere thanks to the appropriations chairman the gentleman from california mr lewis xz4002392 and the conferees for retaining this language
our immigration laws are in need of reform and i believe these provisions are a positive step in the right direction
we have heard no discussions today about the substance of the descriptions in the committee report and that is because the descriptions of the effects of the amendments in the committee report were accurate
for example the minority views state that the child interstate abortion notification act is overtly hostile to families the minority dissenting views in the committee report also describe the legislation as antiphysician and antifamily now 270 members of the house voted for legislation that the minority views stated was overtly hostile to families fiftyfour members of the other side of the aisle the democrat party voted for that bill
further the gentlewoman from new york ms slaughter xz4003780 who we heard from earlier in her press release last week referred to a conspiracy to falsely rewrite the intent of an amendment first there was no rewriting
the majority of the committee in describing offered amendments do not cut and paste any description of an amendment into a committee report
what matters is not what is in the mind of a member offering an amendment
can the majority leader tell me at this point in time if there has been any resolution of this issue as to where we might stand on those medicaid cuts
again i do not know the accuracy of the letter in terms of the numbers of people but there seemed to be a fair number of people there were over 40 on the letter which appeared to agree with the senate s view obviously a large number on this side who share that view as well
perhaps we might have some discussions about reaching agreement on that issue at some point in time
it simply is about those in power abusing power taking advantage of the minority and not telling the truth
frankly the amendments that were offered there is no language whatsoever that would equate to the description that was in the final report or the report of the particular committee
in fact as the resolution reads although it is the long and established practice on house reports to describe recorded votes with objective nonargumentative captions the committee on the judiciary majority departed from the practice in house report 10951 by captioning those five amendments with inflammatory inaccurate captions implying that these three members of congress were engaging in criminal behavior
and the inaccuracy subjected the members the gentleman from virginia mr scott xz4003641 the gentleman from new york mr nadler xz4002890 and myself to ridicule and of course disparaging remarks in newspaper articles around the nation
now in the course of debate we welcome the ability to debate passionately about these issues
we welcome the media s criticism about the accuracy of the work that we do in this body
but what we do not welcome is a direct mischaracterization of these actual words that were being written and put forward in the debate in the judiciary committee
the issue is in the report you mischaracterized three members of congress whose language did not say anything about what you represented it to be nothing about criminal behavior simply to protect the rights of grandparents and clergy simply to protect the rights of those who innocently might be carrying individuals across state lines
i can not imagine in the history of this congress why an amendment offered by jacksonlee that had to do with a gao study turned out to be criminal behavior or an amendment that had to do with clergy and grandparents turned out to be criminal behavior
mr sensenbrenner i would simply ask in the sense of comity collegiality respect that this be clarified and you ask your colleagues to support this privileged resolution because the members of the judiciary committee must go back to room 2141 in rayburn and sit down and address the laws of this land and the constitution of the united states of america
mr speaker i rise in strong support of the resolution introduced by the gentleman from michigan the distinguished ranking member of the committee on the judiciary from where the underlying legislation was initially reported
in introducing this resolution he has attempted to set the record straight with respect to house report 10951 and the way that it has been patently malreported and maligned the authors of amendments to hr 748 the child interstate abortion notification act of 2005
rule ix paragraph 1 of the house rules states that questions of privilege shall be first those affecting the rights of the house collectively its safety dignity and the integrity of its proceedings and second those affecting the rights reputation and conduct of members delegates or the resident commissioner individually in their representative capacity only
this resolution was properly and justifiably introduced because in this case the privileges of dignity and the integrity of the house s proceedings have been patently violated
my distinguished colleagues have joined to introduce this resolution in order to make it clear to the american people that we do not associate ourselves with the misreported portions of house report 10951
in terms of the personal privileges violated by the report the misreporting and the malreporting of the amendments offered by my colleagues mr scott mr nadler and me affected our rights reputation and conduct
i appreciate the leadership of our members of the appropriations committee but might i say mr speaker that there are a lot of achilles heels in this particular legislation
and frankly this bill and the president s mark and budget cuts border security in half cuts the ice officers in half
so really there is no border security in this bill
today i am going to introduce the save america comprehensive immigration act that really confronts the question that americans are concerned about getting in front of the immigration concern and not behind it
and then of course it is a backdoor way to correct the abuse that was rendered in the committee on the judiciary characterizing members amendments that dealt with protecting children and providing rights to clergy and grandparents as having to do with a criminal act
why were these amendments mischaracterized in the first place
particularly since the same amendments dealing with clergy dealing with taxicab drivers dealing with grandparents and aunts and uncles providing teenagers that opportunity to consult with them were also in 2002 and never characterized as wrongly as they were characterized now
unfortunately the tragedy in iraq continues to grow now almost 160 people killed in the last 4 days
when is the administration going to speak to the issue of a solution in iraq
mr speaker i rise to oppose the rule in hr 1268 the emergency supplemental appropriations act for defense the global war on terror and tsunami relief for 2005 purports to do and i thank the chairman of the committee on the judiciary for what section 2 of the rule proposes to do
previous question on rule h res 258 mr speaker we must include in the underlying conference report a concurrent resolution adding the tierneyleach accountability amendment
the tierneyleach accountability amendment would create a select congressional committee based on the truman committee that existed from 1941 to 1948 during world war ii to investigate and study the awarding and carrying out of government contracts to conduct military and reconstruction activities in iraq and afghanistan
in 1941 with the united states engaged in a major military buildup as part of world war ii senator harry truman dmo became aware of widespread stories of contractor mismanagement in military contracts
from its creation in 1941 until it expired in 1948 the truman committee held 432 public hearings and 300 executive sessions went on hundreds of factfinding missions and issued 51 reports
since 2003 numerous questions have arisen about us government contracting in iraq
from the start of our involvement in iraq questions have arisen about how contracts have been awarded the size of those contracts the quality of contractor work and the use of taxpayers dollars
since 2003 there have been many examples of the misuse of american taxpayer dollars in iraqi contracting
in one case the inspector general raised the possibility that thousands of ghost employees were on an unnamed ministry s payroll
furthermore a government contractor defrauded the coalition provisional authority of tens of millions of dollars in iraq reconstruction funds and little is being done to try to recover the money according to the reports of whistleblowers
billions are being spent in iraq and afghanistan
indeed according to crs this 813 billion supplemental appropriations bill being considered by the house is in addition to the 201 billion that the department of defense has received since the 911 attacks for soldiers deployed or supporting operations in iraq and afghanistan
what is in question is how taxpayer dollars are being spent whether taxpayers are getting their money s worth and whether the highquality equipment and services that warfighters deserve and require are being delivered
a new truman committee would allow us to get the facts on us contracting in both military and reconstruction activities and to fix whatever problems exist
i rise today mr speaker because i believe in the integrity of this house the specialness of this house and the specialness of my colleagues
in the course of that legislation hr 748 the child interstate abortion notification act ciana the debate was vigorous and i know that in this congress we have had our differences of opinion as it relates to the question of choice the ninth amendment the right to privacy and in this instance the question of parental consent
it is interesting to note that those of us who may side on the position of choice and the right to privacy recognize the intensity and the questions being raised about children who are put in harm s way whether or not that means that a child without counsel because of some tragedy in her life has to seek an abortion
the debate in the committee on the judiciary by members on my side of the aisle really centered and focused on the structure of the legislation that seemingly would close the door shut on a child that would seek counsel beyond the parent in this very troubling time in their life
it also sought to clarify whether an innocent bystander who could provide a mode of transportation might in fact be held criminally liable under this particular law
so there were a number of amendments offered by my colleagues one offered that in particular the description of the amendment simply offered by the gentleman from new york mr nadler xz4002890 allowed an adult who could be prosecuted under the bill go to a federal court and seek a waiver to the state s parental notice laws if this remedy was not available
subsequently there was a house report 10951 and in that report a series of amendments were described in particular to give license to sexual predators
subsequently there was another amendment by the gentleman from new york to exempt a grandparent or adult sibling from the criminal and civil provisions in the bill again simply stated as plain as can be
and by the way mr speaker though i am not intending to challenge legislation that has already been passed on the floor of the house albeit i disagree with it vigorously in terms of the restraints it puts on the interaction between a child and confidante a trusted adult who can help steer them in the right direction let me just suggest this was a constructive amendment because it was to give the child an ability to consult with someone that may be out of the pipeline and be out of the child s distress area meaning we have never looked at the point that possibly the parent could be the predator or could be engaged in incest
all of these are terrible things to discuss but in a responsible debate these were the considerations why these amendments were authored
ultimately that amendment to allow a grandparent or sibling to confide or that child to confide in that particular adult or that particular sibling adult sibling it was described by the gentleman s amendment was described as having exempted sexual predators from prosecution under the bill and suggested that it was defeated in a roll call vote
subsequently the gentleman from virginia offered an amendment to protect innocent bystanders who might have someone take their mode of transportation a taxicab a bus or other mode of transportation not knowing who they are carrying and ultimately caught up in the legislation and be prosecuted
a subsequent amendment that limited liability to the person committing the offense in the first degree was ultimately described and suggested that it would aid and abet criminals
then an amendment that i offered the amendment was to exempt clergy godparents aunts uncles or first cousins from the penalties in the bill again to give a young woman a greater latitude of who to seek comfort and counsel from and ultimately that amendment was described ms jacksonlee xz4001990 offered an amendment that would have exempted sexual predators from prosecution under the bill if they were clergy godparents aunts uncles or first cousins of a minor then mr speaker though i had two separate amendments one a gao study that would have determined whether this particular legislation was necessary and whether or not the confusion of the states with different bases of determining parental consent whether or not that created an added problem the description in house report 10951 just lumped them all together which reads that would require a study by the government accounting office so in essence mr speaker my amendment was described as exempting clergy godparents aunts uncles or first cousins of a minor and suggesting that i was exempting sexual predators
so we had a vote last week that ultimately wound up correcting the language in some form
first of all might i say in the prosecution of this particular entity i do not believe that any prosecutor worth his or her salt would allow this legislation to exempt an individual who happened to be a relative who happened to be a sexual predator
there is no basis in the bill
so i thought it was appropriate that if we were going to pass a legislative initiative that we thought would help secure young lives then we needed to have a study that would determine whether or not it was in fact securing them or endangering them
this is not a nice word to say on the floor of the house because as we have seen the rash of attacks on our children two young babies killed just in the last 24 hours little precious danielle having been determined and identified decapitated a couple of years ago as cochair of the congressional children s caucus we were briefed by alonzo washington on that tragic case the cases in florida the cases in texas
nowhere in this gao study would that say that
i would not in the least be hesitant to stand alongside of any member in this body and know full well of their undying commitment to weed out ferret out prosecute and incarcerate those individuals with the most evil intent to do harm to our children
there are politics in this house games that are played at all times
let me also just cite the other jacksonlee amendment that was plain and simple the prohibitions of this section do not apply with respect to conduct by clergy godparents aunts uncles or first cousins simply to say that they could stand in place for example if there was some achilles heel some failure in the parental structure that this child needed to go outside of the family home
so we had hoped that there would have been some solution to this in the committee on rules
the committee on the judiciary majority can not do that in house report 10951 by captioning the five amendments that i mentioned with remarks that would suggest that we are harboring that we are kowtowing playing to sexual predators
the opportunity that was given mr speaker to address this question in the committee on rules was troubling because questions were posed as to why such language was utilized
might i say as an aside mr speaker you realize that the house reports and my colleagues realize the house reports are used in history
so to ask the question why or to suggest to my colleagues that i only stand here today to remind you that if we can find any sense of unity in this very fractured nation and divided house and senate i would simply ask that it be adhering to the rules of this body and the simple reporting of the work we do here every day
in the furor of debate sometimes we step beyond the pale
we are committed we are passionate we believe in what we are standing for and we are americans
we stand in debate with our eyes on the flag of the united states and the words in god we trust this nation s underpinnings allow us to do so
but when sometimes in the heat of debate words flare we are allowed and some will ask that the words be taken down
and in the course of the debate and the vote occurs there is a procedure to address that issue
it is hopefully an effort in a moment of evenhandedness to suggest that this kind of mischaracterization not take place anymore in the committees of the house the final reporting andor the committee on rules and that we strictly stick to the conciseness and integrity of the process which is a nonargumentative objective reporting of the work of an individual member
and certainly mr speaker words such as predator and sexual predator and child predator to be thrown in the direction of members who leave their homes and their jurisdictions every day in the backdrop of some heinous criminal act maybe affecting their own constituents maybe some child law
because as i was driving on the freeway yesterday in texas because of the amber alert that all of the members of this house were willing to support there unfortunately was a highlight of another kidnapped child from new mexico possibly on the run into texas not knowing whether there was an issue of sexual predator or child predator
that is in the annals of news that will be able to be researched
so in essence no one contacted our offices to be able to determine whether or not we actually intended that exemption meaning as the report was being written
i do want to pay tribute to the committee on rules in this instance republicans and democrats who listened to our protest if you will
and frankly mr speaker i had hoped and thought that that matter could be resolved there in the committee on rules
it appeared as stated by the ranking member that the representations being made in the committee on rules is that one the majority stood by it and two that the alterations to our amendments were deliberate
no matter how vigorous the debate in opposition how be it that we would step away from the integrity of this house the respect for the three branches of government and do as was done
that is why we are in this place
that is why a president of the united states can stand with the georgian people and talk about democracy and hold his head up high because we are allowed to stand on the floor and vigorously disagree in a manner where we will not be punished
in the emergency supplemental in the rules that were passed last week the opportunity was taken to clarify the amendments
one that we will be allowed to debate in this body whether it be in committee or on the floor and vigorously disagree and that in that disagreement there will be no punishment
and in many instances the majority now in control of the house the senate the supreme court the executive by one party prevails
in the instance of the committee on the judiciary in this occasion on these amendments the majority prevailed
the minority however felt passion about the amendments and in fact believes that they were right and i personally believe that two amendments one to do a study of the negative impact of this legislation if it might occur or what dangerous procedures might occur of this legislation where would a child seek to go because they were fearful of getting parental consent that was a sincere amendment to get important facts
and in the course of the battle of that particular legislation you can be assured as it was being debated if the glimpses of the words that were gotten were only that it was something to do with sexual predators that just muddies the water of the good intentions that you might be having and the intent of what you wrote in that amendment
it would almost be like those who are abhorring drug cartels and drug dealers that if they were to have an amendment dealing with a gao study determining the extent of drug cartels influence in the united states or the growth of drug cartels between 1990 and 2005 and all of a sudden it was characterized as an amendment for the gao to promote drug dealership and drug cartels you would not want to hear that on the floor but it certainly would be the complete opposite of your intent and it would have mischaracterized the debate where you were standing and trying to determine whether some legislation promoted drug cartels more so than broke them up
in its uniqueness we have checks and balances
and it leaves little room sometimes in another body to go and complain about the workings of one specific body particularly the words that are spoken
mr speaker i hope that in the course of this discussion it was not rendered in anger or anguish
it was simply rendered to say that what occurred deserved the greater attention of this body and that it was on the brink of abuse and the sadness is that we had to rise to the floor more than once before it was ultimately corrected in the waning hours of last week s legislative session
and if any thought came to the mind of a colleague that that was the intent of that member i would assure you that the best approach of that particular colleague would be to query that member in that committee there are a lot of papers here mr speaker because i am looking at this debate that went on and so i will not add to some of the accusations that were made in the debate going back and forth
they are written as with a sunbeam on the whole volume of human nature by the hand of the divinity itself and can never be erased or obscured by mortal power of course this is high language to talk about the rights bestowed upon mankind humankind that they are not found in paper
we will do work in the judiciary committee in the coming days and weeks and months
to the judiciary committee members as we gather on a daily basis weekly basis i believe they will all agree that we have the right to disagree and to debate vigorously in the committee in the rules committee and on this floor
while i appreciate the efforts of the chairman of the judiciary committee for having filed a supplemental report part 2 of house report 10951 i must raise this point of personal privilege nonetheless in order to emphasize the fact that the accuracy and the veracity of house committee reports carries tremendous weight and implications for the reputation professional record and personal life of members of congress
again while the supplemental report to 10951 makes some corrections to the mistakes made in part 1 the report still contains an inaccurate representation of the amendments that i representative sheila jackson lee offered in committee on april 13 2005 in room 2141 of rayburn
the lack of accuracy in the supplemental report just underscores and reiterates the initial malintent to commit a malfeasance
under rule ix paragraph 1 of the house rules mr nadler justifiably asserted his point because not only his but my rights and reputation have been offended by the conduct of the chairman in publishing house report 10951
to reiterate the language used in pages 4549 patently malreported and maligned the authors of amendments to hr 748 the child interstate abortion notification act of 2005
on may 3 2005 the ranking member of the committee on the judiciary led debate on his resolution of privilege h res 253 that concerned the ways in which the act of the chairman of the judiciary committee negatively affected the rights of the house collectively its safety dignity and the integrity of its proceedings so too was this resolution properly and justifiably introduced because in that case the privileges of dignity and the integrity of the house s proceedings have been patently violated
in terms of the personal privileges violated by the report the misreporting and the malreporting of the amendments offered by my colleagues mr scott mr nadler and me affected our rights reputation and conduct
chairman sensenbrenner and his staff rewrote the captions of five democratic amendments to distort their meaning and intent in the judiciary committee report on hr 748
that is in effect what the chairman of the judiciary committee has done here the sensenbrenner standard is a clear abuse of power
chairman sensenbrenner maintains that he was justified in changing the captions because the language of the amendments did not expressly provide exceptions for grandmothers and grandfathers who also happen to be sexual predators
in fact there are an infinite number of possible exceptions that would have to be expressly addressed in every single amendment or bill offered if this new standard were properly utilized
likewise the small business bill of rights which the house is considering today would be renamed the sexual predator bill of rights as there are no doubt sexual predators who own small businesses in america which are not specifically excluded in this legislation
mr sensenbrenner xz4003650 and the republican leadership of this body owe an apology to the democratic members of congress whom they have maligned the following amendments were offered and voted down by recorded votes in the judiciary committee markup of hr 748 the child interstate abortion notification act ciana the following chart demonstrates how judiciary committee republicans blatantly mischaracterized these amendments in their official committee report on the bill
this is in a public document containing the legislative history of this bill description of amendment 1 a nadler amendment allows an adult who could be prosecuted under the bill to go to a federal district court and seek a waiver to the state s parental notice laws if this remedy is not available in the state court
no 1116 amendment description in house report 10951 roll call no
description of amendment 2 a nadler amendment to exempt a grandparent or adult sibling from the criminal and civil provisions in the bill no 1219 amendment description in house report 10951 roll call no2
description of amendment 3 a scott amendment to exempt cab drivers bus drivers and others in the business transportation profession from the criminal provisions in the bill no 1317 amendment description in house report 10951 roll call no3
mr scott xz4003632 offered an amendment that would have exempted sexual predators from prosecution if they are taxicab drivers bus drivers or others in the business of professional transport
description of amendment 4 a scott amendment that would have limited criminal liability to the person committing the offense in the first degree no 1218 amendment description in house report 10951 roll call no4
description of amendment 5 a jacksonlee amendment to exempt clergy godparents aunts uncles or first cousins from the penalties in the bill no 1320 amendment description in house report 10951 roll call no
but i want to talk for a minute about another abuse which has occurred in this chamber a personal affront to three of our colleagues i have never witnessed in my near twenty years serving in this house
this committee report took liberty to mischaracterize and even falsify the intent of several amendments offered in committee by democratic members of this body
at least five amendments to this bill which were designed to protect the rights of family members and innocent bystanders from prosecution under this bill were rewritten as amendments designed to protect sexual predators from prosecution and were then included in the committee report as if that was the original intent of the authors
the thing is sexual predators were not mentioned anywhere in any of these amendments
these amendments were no more about sexual predators then they were about terrorists or arsonists or any other criminal class in our society
when pressed as to why his committee staff took such an unprecedented action the chairman immediately offered up his own anger over the manner in which democrats had chosen to debate and oppose this unfortunate piece of legislation we have before us today
in fact
that is in effect what the chairman of the judiciary committee has done here with all deliberation
and he has ensured that these amendment descriptions will be encapsulated in the record for all time by including those unfair and incorrect amendment summaries in the committee report
and sadly it is just the latest in a pattern of unethical and abusive tactics employed by this majority
how unbelievably arrogant is the leadership of this congress that they would force their own politicized interpretation of another member s work upon this body and upon the american people in an official committee report
and i have no doubts mr speaker no doubts that unless the congressional record is amended to reflect the true captions of these amendments then we will surely see these erroneous captions again in the form of campaign attack mail pieces
in fact when we pressed last night in the rules committee to have the record amended to reflect the honest and accurate captions that belong on those amendments we were defeated on a party line vote
so now these honorable and hardworking members of congress will be forever branded in the official record as having offered amendments which were designed to protect sexual predators when nothing nothing could be further from the truth
mr speaker i have often heard the chairman of the rules committee as well as other republicans talk about the loss of civility in this chamber
but perhaps they will be the last to realize that in order to regain some of that lost civility they need look no further than their own abusive unethical and arrogant administration of this house of representatives the following amendments were offered and voted down by recorded votes in the judiciary committee markup of hr 748 the child interstate abortion notification act ciana the judiciary committee republicans blatantly mischaracterized these amendments in their official committee report on the bill
this is in a public document containing the legislative history of this bill
mr speaker i do rise in support of the supplemental
i have had an opportunity on two separate occasions now mr speaker to travel to iraq to visit our troops in the field and nothing has made me feel prouder to be an american than seeing our troops in action
i also want to commend the troops and the families of the 1158 transportation unit and the 128 infantry guard unit in western wisconsin that are currently serving in the iraq theater right now
but i do have some concerns in regard to the supplemental
i do believe that we owe a higher responsibility to our troops and their families and our taxpayers by supporting more oversight and accountability in this bill such as the creation of a truman commission that the gentleman from massachusetts mr tierney xz4004070 has been advocating for some time
we need more accountability on how the money is being used or misused in iraq right now
this is exactly why the gentleman from michigan mr upton xz4004140 and i offered an amendment to strip funding for the creation of an embassy in iraq not because we do not agree that one is necessary but because we wanted to make the point that that is not an emergency item
miraculously the embassy is back in this bill another 600 million none of it paid for
finally i am concerned that there is no objective criteria to measure progress in iraq
you could do that in korea
in vietnam we had body counts that did not work very well nor was it an appropriate measure to use
mr speaker i appreciate my friend s comments but just to correct the historical record you may recall in the 1960s president johnson did decide to pay for the war
there were some tax increases in order to support the ongoing military operation
it should be done in this instance as well
we are going to be there in future years
therefore the amendments introduced by the democrats in the committee on the judiciary are unnecessary
the descriptions of the amendments in the committee report only describe the potential effects of the amendments if they had been adopted
the minority had the opportunity to include dissenting views in the committee report and they did
if those amendments had all gone on the bill it would have been gutted in the bill and it would have gone down because i would have voted against it and so would the rest of us in the majority
mr speaker as the daughter of a veteran i want to first express my profound respect for our brave men and women serving in iraq but we are not helping these brave troops if we blindly sign yet another blank check for this unjust and unnecessary war in iraq
when you look at what is happening in our own country when you look at health care when you look at the people out there in the street that are suffering why do they have to pay for this war
the established practice of the house regarding committee reports is to accurately and objectively describe the proceedings when a bill is considered in committee
in committee we argue and we disagree and we offer amendments and we vote
we may vote and disagree in committee but when the report is issued it is supposed to be objective
this institution must uphold this established practice of describing a committee markup in an accurate and objective manner so that history is accurately documented and reported for generations to come
republicans that ruled the committee on the judiciary mischaracterized five democratic amendments in an extremely disparaging and distorting manner
when alerted to the misleading and inaccurate description of the amendment in the committee report they refused to correct the mischaracterization
the bill could permit a father who raped his daughter to profit in a lawsuit against his minister
but no one expects that argument against the bill to substitute for the name of the bill in the committee report
in prior congresses democratic amendments like these were described in neutral terms
mr speaker in my 16 years in office i have seldom seen such a blatant disregard for the truth
what occurred in this body last week during the consideration of the bill should be an embarrassment to every member of this congress
many of us have different views and even deep disagreements about the important issues we consider in this institution but we should be using the power of debate to resolve those differences
i am troubled however that the conferees failed to include the provision sponsored by senator byrd urging congress to fund operations in iraq and afghanistan through the normal budget process
our efforts in iraq and afghanistan are no longer unforeseen expenses they are known and they are anticipated
they should be in this budget
this bill is nearly 82 billion bringing the total amount the president has received offbudget for iraq and afghanistan to nearly 300 billion in just 2 years
and even though no one at the white house or the pentagon is willing to admit it everyone in this house knows it
the house bill would have made it all but impossible for the us to help create that kind of confidence in the future
at least now the president has some flexibility to show that the us is willing to invest in a secure and dignified future for palestinians and israelis alike
finally mr speaker i can not support this supplemental because i can not support any more money for the policy in iraq
over 138 000 troops are serving in iraq and i was there over the recess and had the privilege of meeting some of them
these men and women are in iraq because of lies because of deceit and halftruths and they deserve better than more of the same
i can not support everincreasing funding for the war in iraq without a clear understanding from this administration about when and how it will bring our own troops home
this is not in question
our policy in iraq mr speaker is what is in question and i for one simply can not support it
mr speaker i expect this conference report to pass overwhelmingly but there are a number of issues in this bill that i find troubling
first i am troubled that the conferees failed to include the provision sponsored by senator byrd urging congress to fund our military security and reconstruction operations in iraq and afghanistan through the normal budget process
our efforts in iraq and afghanistan are no longer unforeseen expenses they are known and anticipated
they should be in the budget
this bill is nearly 12 billion bringing the total amount the president has received offbudget from the congress for iraq and afghanistan to nearly 300 billion in just two years
and even though no one at the white house or the pentagon is willing to admit it everyone in this house knows it
second i commend the conferees for providing funding to meet critical shortfalls in basic equipment for our troops in afghanistan and iraq especially for the army the marines and our national guard and reservists
but mr speaker we could have done this over a year ago when my colleague from arizona mr renzi and i succeeded in doubling the death gratuity and restoring its tax exempt status
we would have done more but we were told at that time in no uncertain terms by the pentagon that increasing the benefit to 100 000 was unacceptable
fourth i am very disappointed that the conferees failed to include in the final conference report the senateapproved amendment offered by senator durbin to close the paygap for federal employees who are national guard and reserve members and are now serving in iraq and afghanistan
the housepassed bill would have made it all but impossible for the us to help create that kind of confidence in the future
while the restrictions remain at least now the president has the same flexibility to show that the united states is willing to invest in a secure and dignified future for palestinians and israelis alike
and sixth i strongly support the funding provided in this supplemental for the tsunami disaster relief and reconstruction the international peacekeeping missions in haiti and darfur sudan and for international food aid programs
but most importantly i can not support this supplemental because i can not support any more money for the policy in iraq
over 138 000 american troops currently serve in iraq
i had the privilege of meeting some of them when i was in iraq during the easter recess
these men and women are in iraq because of lies deceit and halftruths
i can no longer support everincreasing funding for the war in iraq without a clear understanding from this administration about when and how it will bring our own troops home
this is not in question
our policy in iraq mr speaker is what is in question
we are engaged in a worldwide war on terror a battle against the forces of terror terrorists who hate our freedoms who hate democracy
we have liberated afghanistan and brought democracy to that nation for the first time in its history
afghanistan has gone from a haven for terrorists to an ally in the war on terror
in january we saw the dramatic results when the people of iraq defied the terrorists and went to the polls to elect a new government
we saw another major step with the formation of a new democratic government in iraq just the other day and we have seen democratic movements break out in lebanon
we have seen the libyan government renounce terror and weapons of mass destruction and we have seen the leaders of al qaeda rounded up including just yesterday when the number three terrorist in that organization was captured in pakistan
that is why we in congress must take this step today and approve the emergency wartime supplemental
we have a responsibility to ensure that our men and women in uniform have the tools that they need to take the fight to the enemy and we have an obligation to the families of those brave men and women who have made the ultimate sacrifice in the name of freedom and security to ensure that they are cared for
i want to deal with some misstatements that have been made or have been reported to have been made in defense of this unconscionable lying report of the committee
it was reported as mr nadler xz4002890 offered an amendment to provide sexual predators an exemption from the provisions of the bill if they were adult siblings or grandparents the fact is in the entire debate over that amendment in fact in the entire debate over all of the amendments all of which were characterized as dealing with sexual predators in the debate in the committee over those five amendments no one no one in the majority no one in the minority mentioned the words sexual predators no one in the committee debate said this amendment might protect sexual predators
in respect to my amendment which was characterized as dealing with sexual predators nobody mentioned the words sexual predators or raised that
in that eventuality this would protect sexual predators
yes in that eventuality the amendment would protect sexual predators
i in fact offered a motion to recommit to correct that defect in the bill but the majority voted it down
but they voted it down because apparently they wanted sexual predators in the unlikely event that the parent was a sexual predator to be able to sue
but as i said last week if someone wanted to say on the floor of the house or in the committee as no one did in the committee that one has not anticipated the rare eventuality that a grandparent would be a sexual predator and maybe they should amend the amendment that would have been a fair comment
fair comment in a debate
there is a clear difference between expressing views in a debate and saying that one s amendment could be used by a sexual predator under certain circumstances which might be a fair comment
it is different it is dishonest it is a disgusting rape of the rules of this house to characterize the amendment in a onesentence report that this was an amendment dealing with sexual predators
the words sexual predator or abusers do not appear in the bill number 1 number 2 by the chairman s logic any bill on the floor of the house that gives veterans benefits or gives educational benefits gives benefits to sexual predators as long as it does not specifically exclude them and any such bill could be fairly described as a bill to give benefits to sexual predators
i was saying that the two bills were similar in that both would use and that was in the quote both would use the power of the federal government to export the laws of one state into another and all of these things are opinions
opinions are fine in the views
they are not fine in the reports of the amendment
whereas the committee on the judiciary conducted a markup of the bill hr 748 the child interstate abortion notification act on wednesday april 13 2005 and ordered the bill reported on that same day whereas the committee on the judiciary subsequently reported hr 748 to the house on thursday april 21 2005 with an accompanying report designated house report 10951 whereas during the markup of hr 748 representatives nadler scott and jacksonlee offered in good faith a total of five amendments to the bill all of which failed on partyline votes whereas because representatives nadler scott and jacksonlee called for recorded votes on their amendments under section 3 b of rule xiii the votes were published in house report 10951 whereas although it is the long and established practice in house reports to describe recorded votes with objective nonargumentative captions the committee on the judiciary majority departed from this practice in house report 10951 by captioning these five amendments with inflammatory inaccurate captions whereas when representative sensenbrenner the chairman of the committee on the judiciary was asked about this language and given the opportunity to correct it both in the committee rules and on the house floor he instead explained that it was his purpose and intention to include these derogatory and inaccurate captions in house report 10951 whereas committee reports are official congressional documents to which american citizens will refer when seeking to interpret the bills they accompany whereas although the committee markup and reporting process gives members ample opportunity to debate characterize and criticize each other s views committees have a ministerial institutional responsibility to accurately report the proceedings of committee activities whereas under the procedures of the committee on the judiciary the minority must submit its dissenting views to the majority without having the opportunity to review the report whereas the majority has the opportunity to review the minority s dissent before filing its report whereas earlier versions of hr 748 were reported by the committee on the judiciary on three separate occasions and in each case these amendments or similar amendments were described in these earlier committee reports with objective nonargumentative captions whereas this unprecedented manipulation of a traditionally nonpartisan portion of a committee report constitutes an abuse of power by the majority of the committee on the judiciary whereas a report of a committee offers the majority and minority the opportunity to provide their views and interpretations of the legislation amendments and issues whereas the section of a committee report required by clause 3 b of rule xiii was purposely misused as an opportunity to comment on or characterize the amendments and whereas the vote captions published in house report 10951 appear to be purposefully inaccurate and misleading and reflect negatively on the integrity of the members offering the amendments and therefore belittle the dignity of the house and undermine the integrity of the proceedings of the house now therefore be it resolved that the house of representatives 1 finds that the committee on the judiciary purposefully and deliberately mischaracterized the abovementioned votes in house report 10951 and 2 directs the chairman of such committee to report to the house a supplement to house report 10951 that corrects the record by describing the five amendments with nonargumentative objective captions
mr speaker the basis of my question of personal privilege concerns the manner in which amendments i offered during the committee on the judiciary s consideration of hr 748 on april 13 2005 were characterized in the committee s report on that legislation house report 10951
specifically the report in the section required under clause 3 b of rule xiii of the rules of the house reporting the votes of the committee described my amendments in a manner that denigrated my rights reputation and conduct
in my representative capacity
the language in question appears on pages 45 and 46 of the committee report and it mischaracterizes my amendments in a manner that does not reflect the actual content of the amendments nor the actual intent of those amendments
in fact it uses legislation to describe my legislative actions that is pejorative and inflammatory and that is highly damaging to my reputation
i have never previously in my 12 years as a member of this house nor in my quarter century representing the people of new york had the need to rise on a personal privilege
i have never had my reputation or my legislative efforts so terrible maligned in an official record of any legislative body in which i have served
it is my hope that this is the last time i will ever need to claim the floor in a question of personal privilege
i would observe that the filing a few minutes ago of the supplemental report to the committee on the judiciary report is a tacit acknowledgment of the inaccuracy and untruthfulness of the original report and its reputation in the public domain and renders much of what was said in its defense in the committee on rules and on the floor as the saying goes inoperative i commend the chairman for correcting the record and hope that with this correction of the slanderous report language this unfortunate chapter can be brought to a close
while i would have hoped that this correction would have been accompanied by an apology and by an acknowledgment that this report was a violation of the tradition and norms of the house that is perhaps in the regrettably poisonous atmosphere of the present day unobtainable
this situation is especially sad because it involves the committee on the judiciary s official report on this bill which contained false and misleading indeed libelous descriptions of the amendments i and my colleagues offered in committee in good faith and with the intent of protecting children and families in terrible situations
those characterizations came in the section of the report required by the rules that simply requires an accurate report of all recorded votes
there are many places in committee reports where commentary is appropriate
both the majority and the minority have the opportunity in the report to make their cases and very much to the credit of the gentleman from wisconsin chairman sensenbrenner the committee on the judiciary reports also contain a transcript of the markup
what has never been done and i am not aware of the majority on any committee having so abused its power is to distort the content of the amendments in the section reserved for reporting votes
to place this report and the slanderous language it used in context the last time the committee on the judiciary reported a version of the same bill the report said an amendment was offered by mr nadler xz4002890 prohibiting hr 476 from applying with respect to conduct by a grandparent or adult sibling of the minor same amendment same committee different year
in no case have any of my amendments been described in the inaccurate and pejorative fashion they were in this year s committee report
the committee on rules described the same amendment in the following manner when it reported it to the floor adds to the exceptions to the offense of transporting minors for the purpose of obtaining an illegal abortion grandparents of the minor and members of the clergy even the republican study committee the voice of some of the most conservative of our colleagues described the amendment this way the amendment allows a grandparent of the minor or a clergy person to bring pregnant minors across state lines for abortions these are factual descriptions of the amendment
in fact neither the bill itself nor the amendments contained the offensive terms used in the committee report to describe my amendments
no member of the committee described my amendments in this libelous manner at any time during the debate
nobody in the majority none of the republicans in opposing my amendments in committee debate said that they contained the material which the committee report libelously says they do
as the transcript clearly shows the transcript contained in the committee s report appearing on page 58 to 120 will clearly show
it is regrettable that even in filing the supplemental report the majority felt the need to restate the slander but this time in the section reserved for majority views
the majority however is entitled to its views even if they are not factually based and the appropriate place to express them is in debate and in documents reserved for expressing their views such as the majority view section of the committee report
the minority has a similar right in debate and in its dissenting views and i would not expect the majority to tell us what views we should have or how to express them
unfortunately in this system the honor system failed
this abuse of power of mischaracterizing and slandering the amendments and the members who offered them in the section of the report reserved for simply reporting amendments and the votes thereon could not be allowed to stand or there would have been no end to it
it is about the rights reputation and conduct of members delegates or the resident commissioner individually in their representative capacity only when the majority abuses its power to attack the reputation of member or members as it did in this case the house must act to correct the injustice
the supplemental report filed by the majority is an important step in that direction and i thank the chairman for agreeing to file the correction
the voters have every right to expect us to fight for our beliefs to represent them vigorously and to speak out in clear terms on the important issues of the day
when members of this house transgress those limits we fail the people who sent us here and we fail the institution in which we are honored to serve
i hope that in our conduct we can prove ourselves good and responsible stewards of this public trust
it is my sincere hope that now that the correction has been filed and the slander abated this will be the last time any member has the unpleasant duty of rising in this house to defend his or her reputation and the traditions of this institution
he was one of the great members in the history of this house
i think we owe it to his memory and the memory of others who fought the same battle to remember as this resolution says that it is the long and established practice in the house for reports to describe recorded votes with objective nonargumentative captions
there is enough skill on the part of the majority staff of the judiciary committee to describe any amendment offered by any member in a nonpejorative nonargumentative way
if the previous question is not adopted we would be offering a request to establish a select committee such as the truman committee back in world war ii to investigate and study the awarding and carrying out of government contracts to conduct activities in afghanistan and iraq
the washington post this morning has the most recent story audit of iraq spending spurs criminal probe and then it talks about opening a criminal inquiry into millions of dollars missing in iraq after auditors have uncovered indications of fraud and nearly 100 million in reconstruction spending that could not be properly accounted for
i would point out that stands in stark contrast to what happened in 1941 when then senator harry truman became aware of similar stories and he saw to it that a committee was created in the congress to investigate that situation
i would also point out that was a case where a democratic congress was investigating a democratic administration and no great harm was done to the republic in the process
so i just want to urge members to vote against the rule because in my mind this congress is derelict in its duty and in my mind any member of congress who refuses to recognize how the taxpayers dollars are being siphoned off every day by these operations by these sloppy operations in iraq they are contributing to the fact that the taxpayers are being fleeced
so i would suggest mr speaker sooner or later we are going to have this committee because we are going to be stuck in iraq for another 5 years and we are going to see stories like this headline every week
we ought to be acting like a watchdog in this case
i commend all of the members of the committee on the judiciary for the very important responsibility that they have in protecting the civil liberties of our country
it is that last point the integrity of our proceedings which is what is under assault by the republicans in this action that they took last week
i view what the committee on the judiciary leadership did on this bill as just another extension of the abuse of power of the republican majority in the congress of the united states both in the house and in the senate
in both bodies and let us just speak to our own there is an attempt to limit the opportunity for members to speak on the floor to have substitutes alternative amendments that can come to the floor and on the occasions when they do allow an amendment they decide to misrepresent the amendment
just when we think we have seen it all on the part of curbing debate in this house the republicans not only curb the debate they decide what it is that we said and what it is that we wrote in our amendments that we were putting forth
the disgusting misrepresentations that were advanced by the republicans demand an apology by the chairman of the committee and a pledge by the republican leadership in this house that this will never happen again that this will never happen again
we must be mindful of a standard we must uphold not only for ourselves but for the american people to conduct ourselves at all times in a manner which shall reflect credibly on the house of representatives
in doing so the house must maintain the integrity of all of its proceedings as the rules of the house dictate in the house rules and manual
an official report that the majority of the committee on the judiciary prepared to the legislation at hand deliberately and purposely mischaracterized their amendments in a manner that was insulting and derogatory
we had tried to say at meetings and the gentleman from michigan mr conyers xz4000800 tried to get an agreement with the majority that they would change the record and apologize to admit that there was something wrong with what happened last week and that would have made a difference in bringing this resolution to the floor
but no there was no admission that there was anything wrong with misrepresenting not telling the truth about what was contained in those amendments
in short this should not even be an issue we need to be reviewing and scrutinizing
the behavior exhibited by the republican majority with the committee on the judiciary report flies in the face of the comity and civility and honesty that we should all strive for
as i said mr speaker you even see in this close on this important debate that there is an interest in stopping the conversation
this is in my view an aberration for the gentleman from wisconsin mr sensenbrenner xz4003650
as i said many of us while we may disagree on issues have held him in great esteem and respect
but his point of view is not necessarily the point of view of everyone in this body and his point of view should not be the description of the amendments that members in the minority are presenting to the congress
i want to particularly commend the gentleman from michigan mr conyers xz4000800 and the people who were offended by this though all of us were but particularly in terms of the retelling of their amendments the gentleman from new york mr nadler xz4002890 the gentleman from virginia mr scott xz4003641 the gentlewoman from texas ms mr speaker i will conclude by thanking the gentleman from michigan mr conyers xz4000800 for his courage because it takes a degree of courage to bring a privileged resolution to this floor when you know there will be a continuation of a misrepresentation of what happened last week
mr speaker i thank the gentlewoman from texas ms jacksonlee for her courage in bringing this personal privilege before the house
in fact i would think that the chairman of the judiciary would be sensitive to the treatment of committee reports and would share my view that committee reports should not be misused to hurt a member given that the distinguished chairman was the cosponsor of a resolution in 1983 regarding the alteration of committee reports a matter of seriousness that was ultimately investigated by the ethics committee
the bounds of trust that we need to function in this body are weakened even further by this sorry and disgusting chapter
what the leadership of the committee on the judiciary did is just another extension of the abuse of power of the republican majority in both chambers of the congress of the united states
what they are doing with the filibuster in the other body is to try to silence the minority and break the rules
here in the house there is an attempt to disregard the rules that protect us all corrupt the integrity of our proceedings and demean not only the dignity of this house but going so far as to demean individual members
to preserve the trust that the american people place in us the republican leadership in this house must pledge that this travesty will never happen again
i rise in strong support of the emergency war supplemental and i commend in particular the new chairman of the committee on appropriations the gentleman from california mr lewis xz4002392 and all the members of his committee for masterful and disciplined work on this important legislation
i witnessed firsthand the challenges and opportunities they face and i can tell my colleagues with conviction that heroes and a future of freedom are being forged every day in iraq and afghanistan
and while much work remains i am more confident than ever in the justice and the ultimate success of our cause
and mr speaker i remain confident that we here in congress must do our duty demonstrating the idealism and the perseverance of the american people stand with the men and women serving in our armed forces and speed the passage of this emergency supplemental bill without rancor or without delay
it was just this morning i received an email from dawn heister the courageous widow of master sergeant mike heister who fell in afghanistan along with four other hoosiers just the day before easter
the courage in her email inspired and moved my wife and i to such an extent that i rise today and dedicate my humble efforts and my vote today in favor of this emergency war supplemental in the memory of master sergeant mike heister and his brave wife
but just like our troops the american people deserve the very best protection and the gentleman from california chairman lewis and the members of his committee have succeeded in adding 635 million in budgetary resources for increased border security and enforcement and this also is a critical advance in the war on terror
the money just like what we will invest in iraq and afghanistan will help hire train and equip and support an additional complement of over 500 border patrol agents and relieve current facility overcrowding
this legislation will require all states to prove lawful presence in the united states if their driver s licenses are to be accepted as a form of identification as a travel document to a federal official including federal officials working at airports for the transportation security administration
mr speaker in a country that espouses the importance of protecting the inherent rights of every person abortion denies the rights of our most innocent and vulnerable members our children
this past week i met with patricia while she was in washington meeting with members of congress and staff members discussing the crucial need that we have as a society to strive to address the real challenges facing pregnant women and promoting womencentered solutions to significantly reduce abortion and protect women s health
these organizations ensure that the emotional and physical pain of abortion will no longer be shrouded in secrecy and silence but rather exposed and healed
this past year the prolife movement has enjoyed many major victories in congress
i have worked together with my colleagues here in congress and with president bush to defend the intrinsic rights of all citizens especially the most defenseless
this critical legislation makes it a federal offense to knowingly transport a minor across a state line with the intent that she obtain an abortion in circumvention of a state s parental consent or parental notification law
i am hopeful that in this 109th session of congress we will be successful in securing the rights of parents once and for all and i encourage my colleagues to vote in favor of this bill
the 911 commission was constituted in order to tell the american public what we could do to avoid or stave off another attack like the one that occurred on 911
i rise in support of this rule taking up the conference report because i think the components that we have included recommended by the 911 commission are vital for the purpose of national security for the united states
i will remind the body that in terms of the aliases used just by those 19 individuals they used 364 aliases between them
so as a consequence it was virtually impossible for authorities to follow or detect as they changed their identities as they used these documents in order to rent cars as they used these documents in order to take flight training lessons to learn how to fly here in the united states as they used these fraudulent documents even to board airplanes and crash them into the twin towers and into the pentagon
we know that it only makes sense that when mohamed atta was given a visa that was valid for only 6 months but could use it to obtain a driver s license that was valid for 6 years that in fact we were not tailoring our laws to fit our national security concerns
but as we look at the border security issue with respect to completion of the border fence i talked to a border agent who had stopped an individual originally from kyrgyzstan who had trained in afghanistan who had trained there in jihad at the fence
what this particular border guard told me was that there is a 3mile gap in that triple barrier fence and it was within that area of that gap that this individual tried to come into the us and was apprehended and returned
we need to help them do their job and the completion of this triple barrier fence will achieve that objective because it is in the interest of national security
i think it is proper we bring it up and include it in this bill
i rise in support of the resolution
now transport is not defined in the bill
when the judiciary committee marked up the bill i offered an amendment which said simply that we should exempt taxicab drivers and others in the business of professional transport from the transportation provisions of the bill because as written it would be a federal crime for a taxicab driver to take a young woman who gets in a cab and says take me to the abortion clinic so i can get an abortion
now even if he were not prosecuted there is a civil liability provision in the bill which exposes the cab driver and through the principles of agency the entire cab company to civil liability by the parents of the young woman who find out how she got to the clinic
so let me read my amendment the prohibitions of this section shall not apply with respect to conduct of taxicab drivers bus drivers or others in the business of professional transport however the report in the markup filed by the majority described the amendment thusly mr scott xz4003641 offered an amendment that would have exempted sexual predators from prosecution if they are taxicab drivers bus drivers or others in the business of professional transport now i will let the public decide whether or not that is a distortion
now mr speaker let me just say in any event whatever you think of the bill this distortion obviously speaks to character but in my view the descriptions in the committee report and the distortion of those amendments particularly the one i just described say more about the character of the person responsible for describing the amendment that way and the character of those trying to defend the distortion than it does about my amendment
mr speaker i include for the record an editorial published this morning in the daily newspaper in norfolk virginia the virginian pilot on this issue
a house divided against itself the mood in certain precincts of congress has become so poisonous that people are nt speaking our common language unless they re accusing political opponents of unspeakable crimes
bobby scott for example sought to insert this line the prohibitions of this section do not apply with respect to conduct by taxicab drivers bus drivers or others in the business of professional transport pretty straightforward right
should the us government prosecute a bus driver because a girl in one of its seats is traveling to end a pregnancy
no matter your answer to that question the congressman s wording is pretty clear unless you re a member of the judiciary committee s staff which managed scott s amendment into this mr scott xz4003641 offered an amendment that would have exempted sexual predators from prosecution if they re taxicab drivers bus drivers or others in the business of professional transport in other words the staff of a committee on which scott serves accused him of trying to protect sexual predators arguably a crime in itself
the congress tuesday evening spent an hour debating a resolution to require republicans to change the descriptions which are supposed to be and ordinarily are written in dry neutral language
that debate was itself illustrative of how deep the divisions in congress have become
in the end tuesday s debate was a rancorous parry and feint lasted an eternity and came to absolutely nothing
at the committee on the judiciary markup on this bill some members offered amendments that would have created blanket exclusions from the criminal prohibitions in the legislation without any exceptions for those who would commit statutory rape or incest
those amendments were accurately described in the committee report
those classes of people were taxicab drivers bus drivers or others in the business of professional transport clergy godparents aunts uncles or first cousins of a minor and grandparents or adult siblings if any of the people described in the amendments offered became involved with a minor in a sexually abusive way they would have been flatly excluded from the criminal prohibitions of hr 748 one of the primary purposes of which is to prevent sexual predators from continuing to abuse minors undetected
that purpose is reviewed extensively in the committee report in an entire section entitled ciana protects minor girls from sexual assault the amendments offered at the committee on the judiciary markup were directly contrary to a primary purpose of the legislation
in the very same way those who happen to drive taxi cabs or work in the business of professional transportation should not be free to commit statutory rape and transport a minor across state lines to get an abortion without telling one of the girl s parents
there is nothing inaccurate with describing amendments that would do just that in just that way
the incidence of statutory rape in this country is shocking
creating blanket exclusions in the bill for large categories of people would create a huge loophole in the legislation that statutory rapists could exploit
the final amendment offered was again accurately described in the committee report as an amendment that would have exempted from prosecution under the bill those who aid the criminals who could be prosecuted under the bill that is true as well
that amendment would have excluded from the bill anyone who did not commit an offense in the first degree
in sum the effect of the amendments offered as described in the committee report would have been to exempt cab drivers other professional transporters and certain relatives who are not parents from the criminal prohibitions of hr 748 and that would have prevented the parents from knowing when those perpetrators of statutory rape or incest were secretly taking their children across state lines for an abortion to destroy evidence of their crimes
now to be clear all of the descriptions of the amendments in the committee report are descriptions of the amendments and not of the intent of anyone offering the amendments
the description of the amendments in the committee report were all phrased in the conditional that is they make it clear that the loopholes created by the amendments as written could be used by sexual abusers of vulnerable minors and could be exploited by certain people if those people sexually abused vulnerable minors
the resolution states that the chairman of the committee on the judiciary explained that it was his purpose and intention to include derogatory and inaccurate captions in house report 10951 i have done nothing of the sort of course and that statement is entirely false as i have explained already
indeed the tallies of the votes cast are accurately set out in simple table form in the committee report for all to see
further the resolution contains no allegation whatsoever that any rules of the house of representatives were violated even in spirit because such is obviously not the case even to the authors of the resolution
finally i offered to amend the text of the descriptions of the amendments offered in the sections of the committee report entitled vote of the committee provided that those who offered the amendments acknowledged that due to the way they were drafted they opened the bill up to the harmful consequences of allowing sexual predators to exploit the loopholes such amendments would create in the bill
the minority had ample time to include dissenting views in the committee report and they did so
for example the minority views state that the child interstate abortion notification act is overtly hostile to families the minority views in the committee report also describe the legislation as antiphysician and antifamily further the gentleman from new york mr nadler xz4002890 over the years during which this bill has been debated including this year has gone so far as to claim that hr 748 is akin to the fugitive slave act of 1850 which required the return of slaves to their owners in other states
as the committee report describes the gentleman from new york mr nadler xz4002890 stated it seems to me what this bill is is really akin to the fugitive slave act of the 1850s where you are enabling one state in the south which had slavery to reach over into another state and say we want our slave back and that is at page 56 of the committee report
they are rights of loving and caring people parents who deserve a chance to work with their children through difficult times and express their love to their children in their children s moments of greatest need
the fugitive slave act was a catalyst for the civil war whereas the child interstate abortion notification act passed with overwhelming bipartisan support in the 109th congress by a vote of 270 to 157 including 54 democrats who voted for the legislation
and when an amendment is offered that would allow a sexual predator to exploit a loophole in the bill directly contrary to that bill s purpose i will also tell it as it is
now with all of these facts i would suggest we put this issue to rest and be thankful that the house passed in an overwhelmingly bipartisan fashion a bill that would protect the fundamental rights of parents and the safety of our minor daughters everywhere
however in order to do so i asked that the authors of the amendment admit that the amendment did not specifically exclude the sexual predators from the exemptions they proposed
anyone knowingly and willfully falsifies conceals or covers up by any trick scheme or device a material fact 2 makes any materially false fictitious or fraudulent statement or representation or 3 makes or uses any false writing or document knowing the same to contain any materially false fictitious or fraudulent statement or entry shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 5 years or both the committee on rules discovered last week that the committee on the judiciary report on the child interstate abortion notification act authored by the majority staff in conflict obviously to the united states code contained amendment summaries that had been rewritten by the staff for the sole purpose of distorting the original intent of the authors
furthermore i think the chairman of the committee owes those members an apology for soiling their reputation in the names of partisan politics
it is an affront not only to those of us in the house but to the american people and to history mr speaker and unless it is amended i am sure that we will see these again in the form of campaign attack mail pieces and honorable hardworking members of this congress will be forever branded
no wonder we have a lack of civility in this house
mr speaker i think we can all agree that supporting our young men and women in uniform is a priority for each and every member of this house
whether we are democrats or republicans whether we have agreed with the bush administration s reasons for going to war in iraq or opposed them we all want the united states to be successful in the middle east
but all of us here are patriots and all of us come to the table with our best intentions in mind
our troops in uniform throughout afghanistan and iraq have consistently performed their duty with courage and great integrity
it is incumbent upon us here in the people s house to honor those sacrifices in the only real way we can by providing leadership for this nation that is as principled and as courageous as each of our fallen soldiers
we must insist on accountability and honesty in this government and we too must always be accountable and honest
but i fear that in this body in this congress we have not risen to that challenge
yesterday while walking through the senate halls i saw a picture of senator harry truman conducting a meeting of the truman commission and under that picture there is a statement that says that the truman commission saved the taxpayers of the country millions of dollars during the second world war by ferreting out waste and corruption in the american war effort
by all accounts they were successful in their noble endeavor
and yet we in this congress do not have the courage to insist on the same level of accountability today that our forefathers saw fit to employ over 60 years ago
but the majority in the house defeated our attempts to bring a measure of accountability into the process
and still today we have no truman commission of our own to speak of and no language in this conference report that will create one
and without any oversight commission to investigate and prevent the issues of taxpayer dollars by the pentagon or some unscrupulous government contractors how can we be sure that the 82 billion check we are cutting today on behalf of the american taxpayers will actually reach its destination or be used to protect our troops in the line of fire
after all it is our young men and women in uniform who pay the price for the inability of this body to enforce any standard of accountability
ahmed chalabi who was honored by sitting there with the first lady in the state of the union address has been named the deputy prime minister of the country and the acting oil minister in the provisional government in iraq
can anyone possibly explain how this man has been allowed to accept such a highranking position in the iraqi provisional government
we know what should be in the bill language to create a modern version of the truman commission so we can ensure that men like chalabi do not undermine the war and reconstruction effort place american soldiers at risk and rob american taxpayers blind as we continue to pump more and more money into iraq
but now i want to touch on what should not be in the bill
the majority believes in instituting a national identification card program for the country which is in the legislation
instead the leadership has shoved this extreme measure down our throats as part of the supplemental knowing full well that many members would never support the measure in its current form but will be forced to vote for it because we want to support our troops
how dare they hide behind our men and women in uniform as the brave souls risk their lives every day to protect us from danger
members may recall that during the markup of hr 748 in committee on the judiciary last month five defeated democrat amendments were included in the committee report with descriptions that blatantly and grossly mischaracterized the amendments
i am sure we are supposed to be grateful for this small token but it would mean much more if those responsible for maligning our colleagues here in the house would accept the responsibility for their actions and fix the report
this addition will establish a select committee to investigate the awarding and carrying out of warrelated contracts in afghanistan and iraq
a no vote will simply allow the house to create a muchneeded select committee to investigate government contracts in iraq and afghanistan
mr speaker i ask unanimous consent that the text of the amendment be printed in the record immediately before the vote on the previous question
we are in fact undoing what the 911 commission said
mr speaker i rise to oppose any rule that does not allow for consideration of an amendment to investigate the government contracts with regard to our operations in iraq and afghanistan
this supplemental that we are talking about under the rule is 82 billion in additional spending bringing it to almost 300 billion for spending on combat operations occupation and support for our military personnel
but it also has to ensure that these funds are properly managed and that they are monitored and in that regard we have been largely silent in this congress
we have a situation where it is reported by bbc news that transparency international warns that postwar iraq reconstruction is in danger of becoming the biggest corruption scandal in history
they said there is evidence of high levels of corruption in postwar iraq and it is critical of the united states handling of reconstruction programs
but there ought to be unanimous agreement in this congress ensuring our role that taxpayer dollars are effectively and judiciously spent
it would put a select committee to study among other things the bidding the contracting the auditing standards and issuance of government contracts the oversight procedures and the forms of payment and safeguards against money laundering the accountability of contractors and government officials involved in procurement and the allocation of contracts to foreign companies and small businesses
in 1941 that truman committee saved about 15 billion in taxpayer money 432 public hearings 1 800 witnesses
mr speaker i am really saddened today and i am not sure whether i am more disappointed because of the mischaracterization of the amendments in the committee report or whether i am more saddened by the fact that the members of a committee on which i have served now for 13 years would be here on the floor defending the characterization that was put in the committee s report
this is saddening and if we can not get that i think it would be a really really sad commentary on this institution and what our committee has sunk to in this congress
but they said after the election they knew why they were there they were setting a historical precedent in the cradle of civilization
in talking to sunnis the sunnis were upset with their leadership that told them not to vote
one former general under saddam hussein said if you will do that i believe you will see 95 percent of the violence in iraq go away
it has already sent shivers throughout the middle east and it has helped us right here in america
i have heard people on television i have heard colleagues across the aisle some folks i have great respect for indicating that there is nothing in the real id bill that would have changed anything on 911
because if you look under evidence of lawful status which is required in order to have a driver s license that will be an acceptable form of identification to get on an airplane it says you can not use a driver s license if it does not come from a state that makes sure you are in lawful status
and if you are in a temporary status it must be a temporary driver s license that says on there the same date your permit to be in this country expires
if we had had that in place on 911 then every one of the hijackers would have tried to get onboard an airplane with an invalid outofdate driver s license and should have been stopped
folks this goes in a number of directions all coming together to help with the fight against terrorism
it would have helped on 911 it will help prevent 911s in the future
if we determine that is not necessary we will announce that as soon in the week as possible
mr speaker the committee on appropriations is moving their work along at an extraordinary pace particularly based on the fact that they also were able to get this supplemental done today in a way that has not slowed down the progress we are seeing this year
in many ways the rest of the calendar will respond to the work coming out of the committee on appropriations and ready for the floor
i have spoken with sheriffs and police chiefs back in my district and they tell me we need to be ready we need to learn how to confront these gangs
in virginia no urban area has gone unscarred by criminal gangs
madam chairman i rise in strong support of hr 1279 the gang deterrence and community protection act of 2005
i also want to thank the chairman of the committee on the judiciary the gentleman from wisconsin mr sensenbrenner xz4003650 for his leadership in this area as well
what was once thought to be an urban problem has now moved into many suburban and even rural areas leaving virtually every community and every child in them vulnerable
sadly too many children are turning their backs on beneficial extracurricular activities and turning to the world of guns and drugs and violent activity in order to gain entry into or move up or just maintain status in a gang
in order to gain entry into these things this legislation is absolutely critical
and for those who have avoided being seduced by gang life they are too often held hostage in their homes for fear of being the next victim or the unfortunate one who may witness a gang act and who may later be called upon to testify and they are often times in fear of their life when that happens
in my district the first district of ohio which includes the city of cincinnati the 22 homicides that have occurred as of march put the city on pace to exceed the record number 75 homicides that occurred back in 2003
hr 1279 would help to accomplish this in two ways it would establish new stronger gang and violent criminal penalties as well as strengthen existing ones to deter the acts of violence commonly associated with these gangs
i would strongly urge my colleagues to support this important piece of legislation to ensure that we have a coordinated effort in all levels of government
i want to again thank the gentleman from virginia mr forbes xz4001370 for his leadership in this area
the miami herald study concluded that since adult prisons are in effect often crime schools sending a juvenile there increases by 35 percent the odds that they will commit another offense within a year of release
secondly we know that mandatory minimums distort the sentencing process because the judicial conference and the sentencing commission have found that mandatory minimums destroy honesty in sentencing by encouraging charge and fact plea bargains again the legislation before us ignores these facts and creates numerous new mandatory minimums that will lead to far greater disparities and further discrimination
at a time when we have more than 21 million americans in prisons or jails more than any nation on the planet and 10 percent of these individuals are already serving life sentences it is difficult for reasonable legislators to see how more jail time for more youth can accomplish anything constructive
finally we know now that the death penalty system in this country is incredibly prone to error
mr chairman could i ask the distinguished author of this amendment if this idea occurred to him during the time that we considered the bill in the committee on the judiciary
mr chairman reclaiming my time but we are trying to get rid of criminals from coming into the country and what the gentleman is doing in this amendment is keeping them in the country
in other words deporting them is not good enough
we want to keep them in our prison systems which now house more citizens and now we are adding noncitizens to the population of those incarcerated in america
we have never talked about this position before in the subcommittee or full committee of the committee on the judiciary
i can not think of many people who have had more experience living in innercity communities where there is a tremendous amount of poverty deprivation and pestilence
i want to see people who commit robbery murder rape assaults participate in mob action all of them dealt with accordingly
and although i do not believe in capital punishment i do believe that they have to be punished
i would hope that we would take it back deal with it appropriately and bring a bill that we can agree on that punishes those who deserve to be punished but to demonstrate that we understand sensitivity and not put children in jail as adults
mr chairman i rise today in support of the watersscott amendment which strikes out all mandatory minimums in hr 1279
the mandatory minimums proscribed in this legislation will only result in many young people serving long sentences at least ten years based on the circumstances of rather than the crime itself
perhaps it is no surprise that mandatory minimums have come under criticism for being discriminatory in nature
additionally as suggested in the recent booker decision judges often refuse to hand down mandatory minimums if they feel that they are draconian
with the proposed changes we may even see juries unwilling to convict an obviously guilty defendant if they know that doing so will result in ten years imprisonment
creating laws that are likely to go unenforced will not foster faith in the criminal justice system or help take down gangs
any member wishing to offer an amendment should submit 55 copies and one copy of a brief explanation of the amendment to the committee on rules in room h312 of the capitol by noon on tuesday may 10 2005
members should use the office of legislative counsel to ensure that their amendments are drafted in the most appropriate format and should check with the office of the parliamentarian to be certain their amendments comply with the rules of the house
mr speaker i rise in strong support of this rule and the underlying legislation
at the close of his statement the gentleman from massachusetts mr mcgovern xz4002630 bemoaned the fact that we do not have enough amendments to be made in order by democrats
the fact of the matter is the gentlewoman who just spoke my very good friend from dallas ms eddie bernice johnson xz4002040 is going to have an amendment made in order under this rule
the gentleman from texas mr cuellar xz4006570 is going to have an amendment made in order under this rule
the gentlewoman from california ms watson xz4004230 is going to have two amendments made in order under this rule
the gentleman from virginia mr scott xz4003641 who is sitting here on the floor along with the gentlewoman from california ms waters xz4004220 is going to have an amendment made in order under this rule
the fact is six of the 10 amendments that are going to be made in order under this rule are being offered by members of the minority creating an opportunity for us to consider a wide range of alternatives in dealing with what everyone acknowledges is an extraordinarily serious problem
i want to take a moment to talk about three other amendments that are made in order under this rule that are very important and i urge support for those amendments
we know when we look at the number of gangrelated homicides that have taken place in southern california in the last 5 years in the county where i live los angeles we have had 307 gangrelated homicides
but of the remaining 2 percent who come in tragically many of them have been perpetrating crime and tragically they are attracted to gangs
so i will say that the amendment of the gentleman from virginia mr goodlatte xz4001540 which i think is a very good one will actually call for an additional 5 years of incarceration if in fact the gang member the criminal is found to be here illegally
mr speaker it is with a great deal of pride that i rise today to support both this rule and the underlying bill and to point out to my good friend on the other side that this is a bipartisan bill and it is a bill that is designed to reach a major problem in our country today which is the rise of violent gang crime
but what concerns me the most mr speaker is the metamorphosis i have seen in violent gang activity across our country
first of all there has been a huge change in numbers
my good friend from georgia mentioned earlier that as we sit here and debate this bill there is probably between 750 000 to 850 000 gang members in the united states
to put that in perspective if they were an army from a foreign country it would be the sixth largest army in the world
and that is not waiting to get in our borders but already here
in some of these gangs in order to be able to get in if you are a woman you have to be raped in for 30 minutes by six different individuals
if you are a male you have to be either beaten in or to some of the gangs you have to murder somebody to get into the gang
and they have become national and international in scope
they may be in los angeles but they are ordering the violence in another part of the country
also one of the things that concerns us most is that many of these gangs have become the most proficient smugglers of individuals and weapons in the country and it is a small linkage between the gang activity that we are seeing and their connection with organized terrorist activity
what this bill says is that if you are a gang leader you can no longer order violence in one part of the country by a 16 or 17year old and expect to go scotfree because the federal state and local government is coming after you
it also says that we are going to use the combined strength of the federal state and local government to protect citizens in our own borders from the domestic terror they face from gangs
mr speaker i would suggest that if this bill fails we might as well put a sign on a billboard that says coming to a neighborhood near you soon because that is the growth we are seeing in violent gangs
my good friend just raised in his opposition to the bill the support of the california gang investigators association
but when i heard the other side a while ago say that they believe that giving arts and crafts to violent gang members will do more to deter crime than empowering law enforcement agents and locking up gang members in jail that i have to admit still shocks me
the department of justice estimates there are currently over 25 000 gangs and over 750 000 gang members who are active in more than 3 000 jurisdictions across the united states
specifically the bill would provide for the designation of high intensity gang areas higas to identify target and eliminate violent gangs in areas where gang activity is particularly prevalent
the bill would also create a statute to prosecute criminal gangs similar to the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations statute rico that has proven so effective against organized crime and would provide more than 385 million over the next five years in grants to support federal state and local law enforcement efforts against violent gangs and to coordinate law enforcement agencies efforts to share intelligence and jointly prosecute violent gangs
finally under hr 1279 several categories of gangrelated offense would be subject to mandatory minimum sentences of at least 30 years in prison for cases of kidnapping aggravated sexual assault or maiming
dear chairman sensenbrenner on behalf of the members of the association for los angeles deputy sheriffs alads which represents over 7 000 deputy sheriffs and district attorney investigators in los angeles county
i am writing in support of hr 1279 the gang deterrence and community protection act of 2005 and hr 1528 defending america s most vulnerable safe access to drug treatment and child protection act of 2005
we have supported the efforts of senators hatch and feinstein in their antigang efforts and stand ready to be of any assistance we can be in your committee s efforts to obtain the same goals
not only have they become prevalent in most urban inner cities but have become a scourge in our rural communities as well presenting a threat to this nation s bread basket
this legislation provides new law which will aid in this strugg1e not only attacking the gangs but with its companion bill begins to focus on their drug business as well
we urge you to continue your work on fighting gang violence in america we support all of the provisions contained in hr 1279
the provisions of hr 1279 that in part deal with increased penalties clarification of definitions and increased resources and appropriations will greatly aid us and our law enforcement counterparts with gang investigations deterrence and prevention
hr 1279 offers a significant opportunity to make an impact in the fight against violent crime
the department of justice estimates there are currently over 25 000 gangs and over 750 000 gang members who are active in more than 3 000 jurisdictions across the united states
specifically the bill would provide for the designation of high intensity gang areas higas to identify target and eliminate violent gangs in areas where gang activity is particularly prevalent
the bill would also create a statute to prosecute criminal gangs similar to the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations statute rico that has proven so effective against organized crime and would provide more than 385 million over the next five years in grants to support federal state and local law enforcement efforts against violent gangs and to coordinate law enforcement agencies efforts to share intelligence and jointly prosecute violent gangs
finally under hr 1279 several categories of gangrelated offense would be subject to mandatory minimum sentences of at least 30 years in prison for cases of kidnapping aggravated sexual assault or maiming
if enacted this legislation will greatly assist state and local law enforcement in their efforts against gang expansion and violence
the bill aims to facilitate greater cooperation between law enforcement officers and prosecutors at every level of government by providing for the designation of certain locations as high intensity interstate gang activity areas this strategy modeled after the high intensity drug trafficking area hidta program will enable law enforcement in these designated areas to build successful multijurisdictional efforts targeting criminal street gangs using federal funds
law enforcement agencies in these designated areas will be able to call on federal resources to hire additional state and local prosecutors and purchase technology to increase their abliity to identify and prosecute violent offenders
the bill would also allow 16year olds to be charged as adults in federal court for crimes of violence
sincerely chuck canterbury april 18 2005 dear representative sensenbrenner as the house judiciary committee continues its work on gang violence in america on behalf of the national latino peace officers association nlpoa we support all of the provisions contained in hr 1279 and urge the committee to adopt all of the provisions to strengthen federal law enforcement s capabilities on combating the growing gang violence in america 18 usc
521 criminal street gang prosecutions increasing the penalty for such criminal acts on behalf of a criminal gang defining gang crime for federal prosecution increased penalties for racketeering crimes on behalf of the criminal gangs modification of the definition of a crime of violence and increasing resources and appropriations in the newly defined high intensity interstate gang activity areas
nlpoa members have dealt with gang crimes and gang violence for the last 32 years and are experts in this arena with respect to gang investigations deterrence and prevention
madam chairman i want to thank the gentleman from wisconsin chairman sensenbrenner for his leadership in this area and for bringing this bill to the floor
i rise today in support of this bipartisan bill hr 1279 the gang deterrence and community protection act of 2005
and in the limited time that i have i just want to raise three points
one world they will describe in gangs will be talking about antisocial behavior and fist fights
but the true world when you talk about gangs are that you are having a rise in gangs in the united states where today as we debate this bill there are between 750 000 and 850 000 gang members within our borders
if it was a foreign army it would be the sixth largest army in the world
and these are the acts in the real gang world machete attacks witness intimidation extortion murder of federal agents rape cutting off arms fingers and individuals heads
well this chart shows just one member of one gang and all of the activities that he had in traveling around the united states
today these gangs have become national and international in scope and if we want to truly deal with gangs there is only one way to do it you have got to bring down the gang networks and the gang leaders
and that works if it is just an individual committing a crime because once you get that person and put them in jail the crime stops
but when you are talking about gangs when you deal with just one crime from a lowertier person in that gang and you get that person and prosecute him 20 different acts were never caught
and when you get that one person from a gang and it is an organized effort 20 more spring up in their place
and i want to just say because you hear a lot of talk about people who met with a group of students here or maybe a group of people over here this is a list that the chairman read out earlier of virtually every major law enforcement organization in the united states who supports the provisions of this bill and realizes if we do not pass this bill and bring down the gang networks you might as well put a big billboard out that says coming soon to a neighborhood near you because that is what is going to happen with the rapid rise of these gangs
but i have not heard a whole lot about the cost of leaving them in our neighborhoods to create more crimes and leave repeated paths of victims
our whole purpose is to keep those acts from being committed in the first place by getting rid of the gang networks
they can either spend a long time in jail or they can help us bring down the networks that are praying on our communities
mr speaker i rise in opposition to the motion to recommit
i thought i had heard everything this morning mr speaker when in the debate we heard the opponents of this bill say that they felt that they could fight violent gang crime better by using arts and crafts than they could by locking up violent criminals but i am shocked now that they are even bringing in iraq
if you look mr speaker the department of justice i am sure is going to investigate the matters that are in this motion to recommit
there has not been a shred of evidence or testimony in any subcommittee or full committee about this bill related to anything in this motion to recommit
it provides that the amendment in the nature of a substitute recommended by the committee on the judiciary and now printed in the bill shall be considered as an original bill for the purpose of amendment and it makes in order only those amendments printed in the committee on rules report accompanying this resolution
it provides that the amendments printed in the report may be offered only in the order printed in the report may be offered only by a member designated in the report and shall be considered as read shall be debatable for the time specified in the report equally divided and controlled by the proponent and an opponent shall not be subject to amendment and shall not be subject to a demand for a division of the question in the house or in the committee of the whole
it waives all points of order against the amendment printed in the report and it provides one motion to recommit with or without instructions
best estimates indicate that there are at least 750 000 gang members in the united states
we need to enforce our laws in language gang members can understand you do the crime you do the time
in addition this legislation includes juvenile justice reform to ensure that adult crimes with adult motives are prosecuted with adult penalties
the gang deterrence and community protection act would give the attorney general discretion on whether or not to try a juvenile in federal court as an adult if they are 16 or 17 years old
for example in february the atlanta police united states drug enforcement the mcs drug task force and other law enforcement agencies discovered georgia s first superlab in my district in smyrna georgia the 11th
with 39 pounds of meth crystal and 250 gallons of the drug in liquid form one mistake could have destroyed an entire neighborhood
mr speaker gang activity is as important to the war on crime today as the battles against organized crime in the 1960s and 1970s
this legislation goes beyond national gangs like the bloods and the crips and would actually make progress in breaking down membership before these smaller gangs expand into a national nightmare
and even with 21 billion we have continued to see this dramatic rise in gang violence
but the point is this bill addresses the dismantling of the systems that support gangs and i think it is very important that we keep that in mind
like other forms of organized crime gangs are at the center of drug violence identity theft bank robberies and many of the deadly shootings we read about in the local papers
we need to act in one strong voice to indicate that our laws have a purpose that our prosecutors and law enforcement officers mean business
we can prevent the formation of gangs by strengthening our families and we can deter their crimes by breaking their organization and putting them in jail
gangs are no longer simply found in the largest cities but have made their way into our rural and suburban communities as well
gangs are a problem which need a resolution because the cost is in human lives
in fact minimal sentencing of much shorter time is often viewed by lowlevel 16 and 17yearold gang members as a badge of honor socalled earning mr speaker mandatory sentencing this is not a new concept
in fact the child abduction prevention act of 2002 contained 20year mandatory minimums for child abductions and earned the support of 178 democrats at final passage
madam chairman many headlines of late have reflected on growing gang problems in heavily populated areas
unfortunately gang violence is also on the rise in rural areas including my congressional district
in fact the fbi has recognized the existence of at least six separate gangs in the valley some of which are responsible for at least two gangrelated murders in the past 2 years
this legislation will allow us to meet the increase in gang activity with resources sufficient to combat this scourge in our communities and i urge my colleagues to support this important legislation
i rise to offer an amendment to crack down on gangs comprised of illegal aliens such as ms13 which newsweek recently called the most dangerous gang in america in my congressional district alone we have recently witnessed a disturbing rise in the level of gang activity as well as the number of illegal aliens participating in this gang activity
the fbi has recognized the existence of at least six separate gangs in the shenandoah valley with the largest being the notorious salvadoran gang mara salvatrucha or ms13
ms13 is known for such heinous crimes as shootings rapes and machete attacks among others and is estimated to have over 1 500 members in northern and northwestern virginia alone
recently at the immigration border security and claims subcommittee commonwealth s attorney marsha garst of rockingham county virginia testified that illegal aliens make up 50 percent of the membership of ms13 and 75 percent of the membership of another gang in that area surenos 13
according to the fbi ms13 is a highly sophisticated gang of illegal and previously deported aliens that is committed to national expansion in the united states and is built on a infrastructure which transports new members or previously deported members across our borders with the intention and plan to expand their activities into new communities and enrich themselves all at the expense of our communities and our lawabiding neighbors
if faced with a choice of putting these gang members in jail or deporting them and having them return the choice is clear we must incarcerate them and bring freedom back to our neighborhoods
the growth in illegal alien participation gangs is not limited to virginia or just to ms13
according to the testimony of heather macdonald of the manhattan institute a confidential california department of justice study reported in 1995 that 60 percent of the 20 000strong 18th street gang in southern california was illegal
immigration and customs enforcement conservatively puts the number of illegal aliens in ms13 as a majority
sixty percent of the leadership of the colombia lil cycos gang which uses murder and racketeering to control the drug market around los angeles macarthur park consisted of illegal aliens in 2002
and according to the los angeles times the los angeles department arrests about my amendment would help to stop the entry and reentry of gang members into the country by imposing strict penalties on illegal aliens who participate in gang activities and who have already shown they will commit violent crimes and drugtrafficking offenses
in addition the amendment would require the department of homeland security to send all the names of individuals who are subject to deportation orders or who have signed voluntary deportation orders to the national crime information center the ncic so that information on illegal alien gang members can be more easily accessed
this amendment will give law enforcement additional tools in the fight against some of the most vicious gangs in america and will help deter violent criminals from entering the country to join gangs
something needs to be done more than simple deportation when they come right back in and commit more crimes
when the word gets out that they come back into this country and they get arrested after they have been deported and they are going to do serious time in the slammer they are not as likely to come back
mr chairman i yield 2 12 minutes to the gentleman from virginia mr wolf xz4004350 a real leader in the war against gangs in america
here we have a los angeles times story four presidents seek help in gang battle
this is an important amendment that will give teeth to the message do not come back in the united states
if you do we are going to keep you in the slammer
in virginia recent gang victims have been hacked by machetes and had fingers cut off
in may 2004 a 16yearold boy in fairfax county had several fingers chopped off in an attack by a machetewielding assailant
a week later a 17yearold youth was shot dead in herndon by an assailant on a bicycle
in july 17 2003 in shenandoah county virginia ms13 gang members violently murdered a 17yearold pregnant federal witness brenda paz before she could testify in a pending federal trial in the eastern district of virginia against ms13
mr speaker i rise today to express my disappointment with the structured rule that has been set forth for debate on hr 1279 the gang deterrence and community protection act of 2005 this bill among other things could subject innocent people to the death penalty creates numerous discriminatory mandatory minimum sentences could result in wrongful convictions based on unreliable evidence and creates more serious juvenile offenders by incarcerating children in adult prisons
before concluding i feel it is important that i briefly mention my three amendments that were not ruled in order
as written in the bill a prosecutor could bring a capital case in a district that had only a limited connection with a crime
my amendment would have clarified that the defendant must have committed criminal activity related to the capital case in the jurisdiction where the prosecutor seeks to bring the charge
in essence it would have stopped forum shopping which is currently allowed under the bill
if this section is allowed to remain in the bill more children will become hardened criminals after being tried in federal court and incarcerated in adult prisons
currently under federal law when the government recommends trying a juvenile as an adult in federal court various factors must be considered by the court before deciding whether the criminal prosecution of a young person is in the interest of justice
this unreviewable process of transferring youth to adult federal court is particularly troubling when juveniles are not routinely prosecuted in the federal system and there are no resources or facilities to address the needs of youth
it would have closed the glaring loophole which currently exists in our federal gun laws by making it illegal to transfer a firearm to any individual that the federal government has designated as a suspected or known gang member or terrorist
as many of you know under current law neither suspected nor actual membership in a gang or terrorist organization is a sufficient ground in and of itself to prevent the purchase of a dangerous firearm
in fact according to a recently released gao report over the course of a ninemonth span last year a total of fiftysix 56 firearm purchase attempts were made by individuals designated as known or suspected gang members or terrorists by the federal government
in fortyseven 47 of those cases state and federal authorities were forced to permit such transactions to proceed because officials were unable to find any disqualifying information such as a prior felony conviction or courtdetermined mental defect
in closing these are all very important amendments and were aimed at fixing many of the problems associated with hr 1279
2 notwithstanding any other provision of this resolution the amendment specified in section 3 shall be in order as though printed after the amendment numbered 10 in the report of the committee on rules if offered by representative capuano of massachusetts or representative weiner of new york or a designee

i rise to acknowledge madam chairman that gang violence poses a problem in america
coming from the community that i come from in houston we have had some tough times with gang activities and we have been successful in eliminating or steering young people away from that gang violence
and i reached out to my community in houston to determine the influx of those gangs
those gangs are particularly focused in south and central america
many of the individuals are undocumented aliens that become engaged in that activity in california and places along the border
in fact the first term that i was here we did a national tour if you will national meetings of the subcommittee on crime
in fact out of that came a legislative initiative the aspect that i worked on was mental health intervention mental health treatment which we found to be very effective
in fact during that time my late colleague a very committed former senator paul wellstone who we tragically lost in an airplane crash came to my district and visited the juvenile detention centers
i had an amendment that was not made in order in particular that dealt specifically with the question of illegal transfer of a firearm to any individual the federal government had designated as a suspected or known gang member or a terrorist
and i have in fact written bills that have enhanced sentencing on particular notorious or vicious acts
madam chairman i rise today in opposition to the legislation before the house today hr 1279 the gang deterrence and community protection act of 2005
current law requires an indepth review of multiple considerations by a federal judge of whether such a transfer is in the interest of justice
presently in both federal and state courts juveniles who commit the most serious violent crimes are almost certain to be transferred to adult court through use of a judicial waiver
in effecting transfer to adult court judicial waivers as opposed to legislative or prosecutorial waivers are the most common type of waiver device used
as the judicial conference of the united states aptly suggests section 115 could result in the federal prosecution of juveniles for myriad offenses equally alarming the legislation removes the current prerequisite that the transferred child have a prior conviction for an offense that would be a serious violent felony if committed by an adult
instead of focusing on correctional and rehabilitative programs it attempts to throw more youth in crowded adult prisons where these programs are lacking
until hr 1279 the judiciary committee had made great progress toward putting aside the politics of crime in favor of sound policy in the area of juvenile justice
i believe in fighting terrorism but not without a thoughtful approach
i would like to thank the gentlemen from massachusetts mr mcgovern for his austere words in support of the amendments that i offered at the committee on rules yesterday but were not made in order
as written in the bill a prosecutor could bring a capital case in a district that had only the most tangential connection with the crime
this amendment clarifies that the defendant must have committed criminal activity related to the capital case in the jurisdiction where the prosecutor seeks to bring the charge
for example if a murder occurred in massachusetts with a gun stolen from mississippi the homicide case could be prosecuted in mississippi
studies of the federal death penalty show that a person prosecuted in texas is much more likely to be charged tried and sentenced to death in a capital case than a person who is prosecuted for the same crime in massachusetts
this bill will exacerbate these geographic inequities that exist in the federal death penalty system
the wide range of discretion in both what to charge and where to bring the charge will give prosecutors tremendous latitude to forum shop
this broad discretion will increase the racial and geographic disparities already at play in the federal death penalty
if this section is allowed to remain in the bill more children will become hardened criminals after being tried in federal court and incarcerated in adult prisons
currently under federal law when the government recommends trying a juvenile as an adult in federal court various factors must be considered by the court before deciding whether the criminal prosecution of a young person is in the interest of justice
this unreviewable process of transferring youth to adult federal court is particularly troubling when juveniles are not routinely prosecuted in the federal system and there are no resources or facilities to address the needs of youth
my third amendment would have closed a glaring loophole which currently exists in our federal gun laws by making it illegal to transfer a firearm to any individual that the federal government has designated as a suspected or known gang member or terrorist
as many of you know under current law neither suspected nor actual membership in a gang or terrorist organization is a sufficient ground in and of itself to prevent the purchase of a dangerous firearm
in fact according to a recently released gao report over the course of a ninemonth span last year a total of fiftysix 56 firearm purchase attempts were made by individuals designated as known or suspected gang members or terrorists by the federal government
in fortyseven 47 of those cases state and federal authorities were forced to permit such transactions to proceed because officials were unable to find any disqualifying information such as a prior felony conviction or courtdetermined mental defect
admittedly section 114 of the underlying bill offers increased criminal penalties for the use of a firearm in a gangrelated crime
and if we really want to curb this growing problem we have to do something to prevent these individuals from gaining access to these dangerous weapons in the first place
first of all in the passage of the patriot act if we are fearful of these gangs smuggling individuals over who do terrorist acts the patriot act enhances sentencing on those engaging in terrorist acts
that tragic incident in texas for example in houston the information suggests that the dad was involved in gang activity that caused the if you will rising of the level of violence but the good news is that the sheriff s department arrested those violent criminals
mr chairman i rise in support of the waters amendment
since the enactment of mandatory minimum sentencing for drug users the federal bureau of prisons budget increased by more than 2 016 percent from two hundred twenty million dollars in 1986 to about four billion four hundred thirty seven million dollars in 2004
in 1986 before the mandatory minimums for crack cocaine offenses became effective the average federal offense for african americans was 11 percent higher than whites
largely as a result of mandatory minimum sentencing statutes there are now more than 2 100 000 persons in prison and almost 70 percent of the people behind bars in america are persons of color
african americans made up 40 percent of the federal prison population in august 2003 up from 31 percent in 1986 before federal mandatory minimums were enacted
as a result of mandatory minimum sentencing statutes particularly with respect to drug crimes in 2001 the average federal drug trafficking conviction was 727 months while the average federal manslaughter sentence was 343 months the average assault sentence 377 months and the average sexual abuse sentence 652 months
in 1999 african americans constituted 13 percent of drug users
in that same year african americans constituted 35 percent of drug arrests 53 percent of drug convictions and 58 percent of those in prison for drug federal mandatory minimum sentences make african americans more likely to be incarcerated and for longer periods than their white counterparts
in the year 2000 847 percent of crack cocaine cases were brought against african americans even though in that year african americans comprised only about 266 percent of crack users
in the 20 years from 1981 to 2001 the sentenced portion of the federal prison population grew from about 20 000 in 1981 to about 115 000 prisoners
during that same period the percentage of drug offenders in federal prison grew from 25 percent to almost 60 percent
due to harsh sentencing guidelines such as the threestrikes you re out provision a disproportionate number of young black and hispanic men are likely to be imprisoned for life under scenarios in which they are guilty of little more than a history of untreated addiction and several prior drugrelated offenses states will absorb the staggering cost of not only constructing additional prisons to accommodate increasing numbers of prisoners who will never be released but also warehousing them into old age
we all know and are stunned by the staggering statistic cited in the september 2002 issue of the journal racial issues in higher education that at that time there were more african american males in prison than in college
mandatory minimums are driving this growth in federal prison populations
mandatory minimum drug sentences are also resulting in the disproportionate lengthy incarceration of young african american women
from 1986 the year mandatory sentencing was enacted to 1996 the number of women sentenced to state prison for drug crimes increased ten fold and has been the main element in the overall increase in the imprisonment of women
mr speaker i have worked with gangs at home in conjunction with our police department and there is a way to start prevention
and in dialoguing with these young people i first had to understand what they were saying
it is a lot cheaper to prevent all this crime and prevent them going to jail and for them to stay in school
of the 50 million appropriated in this bill not one penny goes toward prevention
in addition to developing a solid gang prevention strategy we must equip our law enforcement professionals with the tools to protect our communities
recently law enforcement in dallas spoke to me regarding their desire to track gang activity
i work closely with the law enforcement divisions in my area and they wanted a system that would allow them to easily access and share information on gang activity
in addition it will allow law enforcement to track the movement of gangs and members throughout the country coordinate police response to gang violence and enhance officer safety
this system is a fundamental step in combating future gang violence
madam chairman i thank the esteemed chairman for yielding time to me and madam chairman i ask for this opportunity to say a few words in support of the bill that is before us and in compliments to the work done by the gentleman from virginia who has announced to us that there is a number the best estimate at 750 000 to 850 000 gang members in the united states
when we think about the magnitude of that size number 750 000 to 850 000 75 to 100 percent and a lot believe the number is very close to 100 percent are illegal immigrants who have established a gang culture in the ethnic enclave that is a necessary result of illegal immigration
this ethnic enclave has created and fostered some of the worst gains we have ever seen in this country people that cut off hands and arms and heads people that have a network across this nation that from a prison in california can order an execution on the streets of virginia or from a prison in virginia order an execution in a prison in la
that is what this culture has fostered and that amount that 850 000 that is roughly out of the 10 million illegal immigrants that is about 8 12 percent of the illegal population ends up in a gang
one in 12 people that come across the border illegally and stay here end up in a gang
by these numbers it is an astonishing thing and if we have 11 million that come across the southern border these are the ones that stay here calculate the numbers that turn out into gangs the price to this society in hands and arms and heads
mr speaker let me begin by saying that every single member of this house is concerned about gang violence in our communities and throughout our country and every single member of this house is dedicated to trying to make our communities and our nation safer
so mr speaker i rise today in strong opposition to hr 1279 the socalled gang deterrence and community protection act
it is bad policy wrapped in a bad bill that will simply not do the job the sponsors claim it will do
mr speaker time magazine focused on the spike in gang activity in los angeles in the september 3 2001 edition
in that story father greg boyle a catholic priest who worked in a ganginfested area of east los angeles said that california s antigang strategy which has been copied across the country is bankrupt
after reading this legislation it is clear to me that this bill will do nothing to deter gang activity and instead will sentence american youth to lives of crime and violence instead of proactively intervening in our communities to prevent our children and our youngsters from joining gangs in the first place
inclusion of the death penalty in this bill is wrong and should be stripped out
this law which was approved overwhelmingly by this body improved the fallibility of the death penalty system by making dna technology available to our criminal justice system in order to improve its ability to exonerate the innocent as well as identify and convict the guilty
however the important provisions in the justice for all act that would improve the fallibility of the death penalty system are not even being funded
in effect mr speaker with this bill we are adding more death penalty cases to an alreadybroken system that is desperately in need of repair
mandatory minimums were originally created to decrease the disparity in sentencing of like offenders
however the judicial conference of the united states and the us sentencing commission has found mandatory minimums require sentencing courts to impose the same sentence on offenders when sound policy and common sense call for reasonable differences in punishment in other words judges are prevented from assessing what type of punishment fits the crime
in fact this is exactly what the us supreme court concluded in january when it ruled to allow federal judges to deviate from sentencing guidelines
i submit mr speaker that this bill s host of harsh mandatory sentences is directly in defiance of the supreme court ruling
mr speaker we know that intervention programs work in the majority of cases
but we have a real chance through prevention and intervention programs to make a difference in the lives of these young people
youth crime and gangs are an issue in many cities around the country
in my home city of worcester massachusetts i helped coordinate a communitywide forum this past fall to address the issue of gang violence
also participating in this event was the boston ten point coalition a nationally recognized leadership foundation whose mission is to reach out to atrisk youth and gang members in hopes of reducing violence in the community
one particular item the coalition discussed was the adoptagang program in which city churches keep their doors open and serve as a support center for troubled youth
mr speaker none of the provisions in this bill have proven to be effective ways of dealing with gangs and violent youth behavior
mr speaker for the past decade this house has worked in a bipartisan manner to effectively draft and pass comprehensive juvenile justice legislation
mr speaker finally let me just say that 16 democratic amendments were not made in order by the committee on rules last night
they brought them forward in the committee on rules last night
we can talk all we want about using all this harsh rhetoric but the bottom line is there are laws already on the books if you commit a violent crime in this country
that is not the only answer here but clearly the answer is not cutting the cops program which the republican majority in this house is doing and the president has suggested in his budget
he mentions that a handful of democratic amendments were made in order and i guess we all should be grateful on this side of the aisle because usually we get shut out totally
but the fact of the matter is 16 democratic amendments were not made in order
all of us have dealt with community leaders with our local police in trying to figure out how best to deal with this violence
we could have had a vote on the floor today on that amendment and a full debate and that was denied in the committee on rules
the gentleman from new york mr crowley xz4000870 had an amendment that would require that the purchase of firearms ammunition and explosives to be made in person and to require records to be kept on how the purchases were made
yet that was not even made in order
yet the committee on rules would not allow that amendment to be made in order on the floor today
and yet that was not made in order
that was deemed to not be made in order
and i do not understand why and nobody who has spoken on the other side has explained to me why those amendments were not made in order not even mr speaker i reserve the balance of my time
i also include for the record a statement that has been signed by the american bar association the american civil liberties union chamber of commerce of the united states the children s defense fund the commission on social action of reform judaism leadership conference on civil rights the national urban league murder victims families for human rights the naacp the national federation of independent business and the united states conference on catholic bishops all in opposition to this legislation
and i include for the record so that it is there the 16 amendments that the majority of the committee on rules decided to not make in order today on this important legislation
dear member of congress on behalf of the national council of la raza nclr the largest national latino civil rights organization in the us i urge you to oppose provisions contained in the gang deterrence and community protection act of 2005 hr 1279 which is on the suspension calendar this week
please be advised that nclr will recommend that votes relevant to the latino community and final passage of the bill be included in the national hispanic leadership agenda congressional scorecard
the latino community is directly affected by gang violence consequently nclr is committed to finding a solution to combat it however the approach in hr 1279 is ineffective irresponsible and simplistic given that it does nothing to get to the root causes of the problem and it further exacerbate youth violent behavior
the latest research shows that transferring youth to adult status is a failed public policy approach resulting in the opposite of what this bill is purporting to do
the research also shows that youth held in adult facilities compared to youth held in juvenile facilities are five times as likely to be sexually assaulted by other inmates twice as likely to be beaten by staff 50 more likely to be assaulted with a weapon and eight times as likely to commit suicide
with these kinds of risks it does not make sense for the house to pursue legislation that includes the power to prosecute juveniles as adults in federal court for activities that the states are already wellequipped indeed betterequipped to handle than the federal system
when judges are restricted by mandatory sentences they can not assess an individua1s culpability during the crime or other factors that have bearing on recidivism thus resulting in inappropriate sentences
although mandatory minimums were intended to reduce the racial disparities that were associated with indeterminate sentencing in practice they exacerbate and mask such disparities by shifting discretion from the judge to the prosecutor
studies have shown that this discretion results in a disparity in sentencing outcomes based largely on race and quality of defense attorney
according to testimony from the us sentencing commission in 1999 39 of those receiving mandatory sentences were hispanic 38 were african american and 23 were white
hipanics comprised 44 of those subject to fiveyear mandatory sentences in 1999 37 of the tenyear mandatory sentences 20 of the 20year mandatory sentences and 8 of the mandatory life sentences
these provisions will only exacerbate youth violent behavior at a time when data from the fbi s uniform crime reporting program that breaks down the age of people arrested for serious offenses in 2003 showed that the number of people under 18 arrested declined by 30
in many cases these violations are technical in nature including recordkeeping reporting training etc and have very low criminal intent standards
in addition conviction of any crime that is labeled a crime of violence under this proposed statute brings deportation without right of appeal for legal immigrants working for a company and potential federal money laundering charges which can result in substantial asset forfeiture
26 crowley the amendment requires that the purchase of firearms ammunition and explosives to be made in person and requires records to be kept on how the purchases were made
14 davis il the amendment strikes the provision in the bill that calls for a minimum mandatory 10 year jail term
12 davis il this amendment would strike section 110 and preserve language in current law regarding venue in capital cases
22 jackson lee the amendment clarifies that the defendant and not just a member of the gang must have committed criminal activity related to the capital case in the jurisdiction where the prosecutor seeks to bring the charge
16 eddie bernice johnson the amendment establishes funding for regional databases that track gang activity in high intensity gang areas
these databases contain critical information on gangs gang members firearms criminal activities and histories vehicles and other fields of information necessary to investigators in solving gang related crimes
10 scott the amendment uses the 575 million authorized in the bill for 94 new us attorneys to go instead to local law enforcement to prevent and reduce the formation or continuation of juvenile gangs and the use and sale of illegal drugs by juveniles
dear representative on behalf of the united states conference of catholic bishops and catholic charities usa we urge you to oppose provisions in hr 1279 gang deterrence and community protection act of 2005 the gang bill that would expand the use of the death penalty treat juveniles as adults and impose mandatory minimum sentences
first we strongly oppose any provision in the bill that would expand the use of the death penalty
catholic teaching on capital punishment is clear if bloodless means are sufficient to defend human lives against an aggressor and to protect public order and the safety of persons public authority should limit itself to such means because they better correspond to the concrete conditions of the common good and are more in conformity to the dignity of the human person catechism of the catholic church
secondly we urge you to eliminate any provisions in the legislation that would result in the expanded transfer or waiver of youth to the adult criminal system andor placing an additional number of youth in adult correctional facilities
as we stated in our 2000 pastoral statement on criminal justice we believe that placing juveniles in the adult court system is not a solution to reducing gang activity
but society must never respond to children who have committed crimes as though they are somehow equal to adults fully formed in conscience and fully aware of their actions
placing children in adult jails is a sign of failure not a solution
rather we believe the challenge as responsible adults is to create a fairer and finally we urge you to oppose language in the bill that includes and expands mandatory minimum sentences for a broad category of offenses that are deemed gang crime
in the gang bill the mandatory minimum sentences for gang related crimes range from five to thirty years
although the offenses are serious and individuals who are convicted ought to be properly held accountable rigid sentencing formulations could prevent judges from properly assessing an individual s culpability during the crime or other factors that have bearing on recidivism thus sometimes resulting in harsh and inappropriate sentences
should you have any questions or comments please do not hesitate to contact mr andrew rivas in our office of social development and world peace 2025413190 arivas usccborg or ms lucreda cobbs at catholic charities usa 7035491390 lcobbs catholiccharitiesusaorg
dear representative oppose the ineffective policies proposed in hr 1279 the gang deterrence and community protection act of 2005
the gang bill could subject innocent people to the death penalty creates numerous discriminatory mandatory minimum sentences could result in wrongfully convictions based on unreliable evidence and creates more serious juvenile offenders by incarcerating children in adult prisons
expansion of the federal death penalty undermines the very reforms that were enacted in last year s justice for all act pl
the death penalty is in need of reform not expansion
chronic problems including inadequate defense counsel and racial disparities plague the death penalty system in the united states
states continue to address the systemic problems with the administration of the death penalty by implementing reform and moratorium efforts while the federal government in hr 1279 is moving to expand the death penalty in lieu of enacting or implementing reforms on the federal level
in addition to expanding the number of federal death penalty crimes section 110 of the bill expands venue in capital cases to the point that any location even tangentially related to the crime could be the site of a trial
studies of the federal death penalty show that a person prosecuted in texas is much more likely to be charged tried and sentenced to death in a capital case than a person who is prosecuted for the same crime in massachusetts
this bill will exacerbate these geographic inequities that exist in the federal death penalty system
the wide range of discretion in both what to charge and where to bring the charge will give prosecutors tremendous latitude to forum shop
this broad discretion will increase the racial and geographic disparities already at play in the federal death penalty
even more disconcerting is that a person could receive the death penalty for the illegal participation in what would be considered a criminal street gang while having no idea or intention of being a part of a socalled gang hr 1279 revises the already broad definition of criminal street gang to an even more ambiguous standard of a formal or informal group or association of three 3 or more people who commit two 2 or more gang crimes
the number of people required to form a gang decreases from five 5 people in an ongoing group under current law to three 3 people who could just be associates or casual acquaintances under this proposed legislation
presently the government has to establish that criminal street gangs engaged within the past five 5 years in a continuing series of offenses the continuing series of offenses under current law is essential to preserving the concept of gang activity that the law is trying to target ie
this broader definition of gang crime in hr 1279 would result in people being convicted of gang crimes that are neither ongoing in nature nor connected to each other and could occur 10 15 or 20 years apart
this legislation further erodes the sentencing discretion of judges by imposing mandatory minimums that would result in unfair and discriminatory prison sentences
many of the enhanced gang penalties in this bill are mandatory minimum sentences or death
although in theory mandatory minimums were created to address disparate sentences that resulted from indeterminate sentencing systems in reality they shift discretion from the judge to the prosecutor
prosecutors hold all the power over whether a defendant gets a plea bargain in order hr 1279 jeopardizes a person s right to a fair trial and creates the possibility that innocent people would be held for long periods of time prior to a trial
innocent people could be convicted of crimes they did not commit if the statute of limitations is extended as proposed in this legislation
for example if a violent crime was committed in 2005 but a person was not indicted until 2020 that individual could be charged with a crime 15 years later
in 2020 15 years after the crime alibi witnesses could have disappeared or died other witnesses memories would have faded and evidence may be unreliable
shifting the burden of proof for pretrial detention in some cases involving guns could result in serious injustices and interfere with an accused person s defense
children would be put in federal prison with little opportunity for education or rehabilitation
under the gangs bill more children will become hardened criminals after being tried in federal court and incarcerated in adult prisons
currently under federal law when the government recommends trying a juvenile as an adult in federal court various factors must be considered by the court before deciding whether the criminal prosecution of a young person is in the interest of justice
hr 1279 would give the prosecutor the discretion to determine when to try a young person in federal court as an adult if the juvenile is 16 years of age or older and commits a crime of violence
this unreviewable process of transferring youth to adult federal court is particularly troubling when juveniles are not routinely prosecuted in the federal system and there are no resources or facilities to address the needs of youth
the federal government should continue to let states deal with juveniles in their family court systems that were created to address the needs and provide services to young people
furthermore a 1996 study showed that youth transferred to adult court in florida were a third more likely to reoffend than those sent to the juvenile justice system for the same crime and with similar prior records
of the youth in this study who committed new crimes those while efforts to address gang crime are very important to maintaining public safety this legislation proposes to confront crime at the expense of the right to a fair trial at the risk of convicting innocent people and unnecessary exposure to the death penalty
hr 1279 will not solve the problem of gang crime in this country thus members should oppose this bill when the house of representatives votes on wednesday may 11 2005
1279 the gang deterrence and community protection act ineffective and costly federal intrusion in state law enforcement hr 1279 would federalize all state felonies if related to a criminal street gang and a host of state violent offenses whether or not gangrelated thereby significantly expanding the current list of over 4 000 federal crimes according to a recent federalist society report
even the conservative heritage foundation in recent testimony to congress recommended enforcing existing laws rather than passing new ones
hr 1279 would result in more youth being prosecuted as adults in the federal system despite research showing that youth transferred to the adult criminal justice system are more likely to reoffend than similarly situated youth who remain in the juvenile justice system
this amendment was offered in the committee on rules last night but was defeated on a straight partyline vote
by earning the trust of members of their community and making those individuals invest in their own safety community policing makes law enforcement more efficient and makes america safer
mr speaker if we are really serious about stopping the growing gang problem that is occurring in this country we need to start at the local level and we need to include prevention as well as enforcement
members should be aware that a no vote will not prevent consideration of the gang deterrence bill and it will not affect any of the amendments that are in order under this rule
but a no vote will allow us to add this important amendment that is one of our most effective tools in the war against violence
mr speaker as i said at the beginning if we are truly interested in dealing with the gang problem in this country we need to do more than pass legislation that sounds tough
mr speaker i ask unanimous consent that the text of the amendment be printed in the record immediately prior to the vote on the previous question
all records in ncic are protected from unauthorized access
mr chairman i would say to my colleagues there should be no fear in using this database to get this vital information into the hands of law enforcement
under my amendment information on three types of aliens would be included in the national crime information center first those aliens with a final order of removal issued against them
recent estimates remember that word estimates recent estimates say that there are over 400 000 in our country today
this first category visa overstays is the difference between the language in my amendment and that of the previous one offered by my good friend the gentleman from virginia mr goodlatte xz4001540 who incorporated much of my language into his good amendment and i applaud him for that
mahmud abouhalima entered on a tourist visa in 1985 which expired in the spring of 1986
he was given permanent residence in 1988 as part of an amnesty for agriculture workers
he was implicated as a lead organizer in the 1993 plots to bomb new york landmarks
mohammed salameh entered on a 6month tourist visa issued in jordan in 1988
he rented the truck in the 1993 wto bombing
eyad ismoil entered on a student visa in 1989 left school after three semesters violating the terms of his visa and became an illegal alien
more facts about visa overstays that might startle folks a little bit at least 40 percent of the noncitizens who stay in the united states illegally and perhaps more than half did not sneak across the border
visa overstays were described as a disturbing and persistent problem in a report by the justice department s inspector general
this was all written on november 8 1998 in the dallas morning news nearly 3 years before the attacks of 911 and approximately 6 12 years ago
i appreciate so much his support in this as well as the support of the gentleman from virginia mr goodlatte xz4001540 and the gentleman from virginia mr wolf xz4004350 and all their good work
before the committee on the judiciary subcommittee on immigration marsha garst offered some statistics in relation to some problems in the shenandoah valley of virginia
she indicated that a confidential california department of justice study from 1995 said that 60 percent of the 20 000member 18th street gang in southern california are illegal
also that the leadership of the colombian lil cycos gang who control some markets in la was about 60 percent illegal in 2002
he indicated in his statement while there are an estimated 750 000 to 800 000 gang members in the nation there are no firm estimates on how many of these gang members are aliens and how many are citizens his point should not go unaddressed
this time it is crime sometimes deadly in our neighborhoods and streets
i hope that we will not take too long to seek that help and i would be happy to assist with a solution because it is an issue that i have worked on and been very interested in for a long time
i urge my colleagues to adopt this amendment and help us finally get the facts about the nationwide scope of what we are dealing with in terms of illegal aliens and gang membership
mr chairman in conclusion i will simply say to my friend the gentleman from virginia mr scott xz4003641 that this is not an amendment that justifies or does not justify the previous amendment
if you ride around at all you do not have to go very far to determine what the problem is in this country
mr chairman if the gentlewoman will yield i am interested in doing anything i know we can do to stop gang violence in this country
it is time we brought it to an end and of course i am interested in anything about that that might head that off
mr chairman the gang deterrence and community protection act hr 1279 is the latest example of congress disregarding its constitutional limitations in the name of getting tough on crime gang crime is certainly a serious issue in many parts of the country
however unless criminal gangs are engaging in counterfeiting treason or piracy the federal government has no jurisdiction over the criminal activities of gangs
in fact by creating new federal crimes related to gang activities but unrelated to one of the federal crimes enumerated in the constitution the new federal crimes and enhanced penalties in this bill usurp state and local authority
rehnquist has stated that t he trend to federalize crimes that traditionally have been handled in state courts
threatens to change entirely the nature of our federal system meese stated that congress s tendency in recent decades to make federal crimes out of offenses that have historically been state matters has dangerous implications both for the fair administration of justice and for the principle that states are something more than mere administrative districts of a nation governed mainly from washington
mandatory minimum sentences impose a onesizefitsall formula in place of the discretion of a judge or jury to weigh all the circumstances surrounding an individual s crime and decide on an appropriate punishment
i have long been critical of judicial usurpation of legislative functions and have introduced legislation using congress s constitutional powers to rein in the judiciary
reverend nicholas dimarzio chairman of the domestic policy committee of the united states conference of catholic bishops and reverend kerry snyder president of catholic charities usa summed it up well in a letter to congress opposing this bill
rigid sentencing formulations could prevent judges from properly assessing an individual s culpability during the crime of other factors that have bearing on recidivism thus sometimes resulting in harsh and inappropriate sentences i am also concerned that removing authority over the prevention and punishment of gang crimes from state and local jurisdictions will prevent states and localities from coming up with innovative ways to prevent gang crimes
however hr 1279 in no way reduces funding for ineffective prevention programs
while i recognize that nothing in the constitution forbids federal state or local governments from imposing a death penalty i have come to the conclusion that a consistent prolife position requires opposition to any legislation imposing a federal death penalty for unconstitutional federal crimes
i strongly believe in cooperation between federal and state law enforcement to deter gang activities
in chicago alone there are estimated to be 70 000 to 100 000 gang members compared with about 13 000 chicago police officers
nevertheless prevention and intervention is the key in deterring juvenile crime and gang activities not discriminatory mandatory sentencing or unfettered prosecutorial discretion
in addition a better approach as opposed to this illadvised approach would be to focus our energy on more programs for at risk youth such as head start job corps and family focused intervention programs
madam chairman i rise in opposition to hr 1279 the gang deterrence and community protection act because this bill fails to adequately deter youths from joining gangs and does not do enough to protect our communities
instead of offering funding for proven intervention and prevention programs that effectively keep youths from joining gangs in the first place this punitive bill simply imposes harsh and sweeping mandatory minimum sentences
in fact as many of my democratic colleagues have repeatedly stressed imposing mandatory minimums on youths often results in a greater likelihood of repeat and more violent offenses
prevention and intervention programs on the other hand have a proven track record of keeping kids out of gangs but at the committee on the judiciary markup of this bill and in the committee on rules last night amendments to include intervention and prevention programs in this bill were defeated along partyline votes
i joined my colleagues the gentleman from california mr schiff xz4003610 the gentleman from california mr cardoza xz4000650 and the gentlewoman from california ms watson xz4004230 in submitting an amendment to expand the project safe neighborhoods program to authorize the attorney general to make the fbi increase safe streets initiative efforts to reauthorize the gang resistance education and training projects program and more importantly to doublefunding for highintensity interstate gang activity areas and require half of those funds to go to communitybased antigang programs
i know from personal knowledge that our amendment would have reduced gang activity nationwide because i have seen communitybased programs work in my very own district
the gang resistance in paramount or grip program has been educating kids about the dangers of gang participation for years
i spent some time inside a fourth grade class inside of paramount last year to see the grip program in action
i saw firsthand how the program caught the attention of the students and it was amazing how the program engaged the students in learning and how quickly they saw the dangers in gangs
mr chairman i stand today in strong opposition to hr 1279 the socalled gang deterrence and community protection act
unfortunately this bill does nothing in the way of jobs or education for atrisk youth
instead this bill would lock up young people in adult prisons and take away judges discretion to review on a casebycase basis crimes committed by youth
locking young people up in adult prisons will actually compromise public safety
studies have shown that comprehensive locally tailored strategies are the most effective in preventing gang and youth violence
i urge my colleagues to reject hr 1279 because it would only exacerbate youth violence in the united states
madam chairman in february of this year i introduced bipartisan legislation with the gentlewoman from california mrs bono xz4000390 the gang prevention and effective deterrence act of 2005
the schiffbono bill represents a comprehensive effort to increase gang prosecution and prevention efforts in order to crack down on criminal street gangs
the bill is virtually identical to bipartisan legislation that was reported out of the senate judiciary committee in the 108th congress and has since been reintroduced by senators feinstein hatch kyl cornyn and grassley
first it created a ricolike statute specifically tailored to street gangs in order to bring these networks down in the same way we bring down organized crime through rico
second our legislation increased a host of gang and violent crime penalties in order to deter and punish illegal street gangs
and finally the schiffbono bill included important funding for prevention and intervention efforts in order to attack the gang problem at its roots
with all due respect to my colleague from virginia on the opposite side of the aisle the most significant difference between the bill i introduced prior to the bill that is now before us is that all of the prevention funding in the senate bill and in my own bipartisan bill has been stripped out of the antigang measure and all we are left with is the deterrence
unfortunately madam chairman the committee leadership rejected the opportunity to address this national problem in a bipartisan fashion
these prevention and intervention provisions are largely law enforcement in nature
and madam chairman i want to point out these provisions that have been stripped out of my bill that are in the present form in this bill have the support of law enforcement
they are also part of the bipartisan bill in the senate sponsored as i mentioned by senators hatch feinstein cornyn grassley and kyl
and unfortunately i think it is quite clear that this body is no longer in the business of legislating but rather of leveraging
it will not come back in this form and i intend to oppose it today in the hopes that we will get a better bill coming back from the senate as i am confident we will
madam chairman when i took office in the california state senate i introduced a host of anticrime measures as indeed i have done here
madam chairman in my home state of california when we incarcerate a juvenile it costs us 90 000 a year
investing a small amount on the front end in timetested and true programs that keep kids out of trouble makes infinite sense both in terms of dollars saved and in terms of lives saved
and my hope madam chairman because my amendment to restore this funding was not allowed by the rules committee we were not allowed to put it to my colleagues on the house floor for a vote i hope madam chairman it comes back from the senate in a form that we can both support on both sides of the aisle
yes it is true that the feinsteinhatch amendment that i offered in committee did not enjoy broad support on either side of the aisle
some on my side of the aisle thought the sentencing enhancements in this bipartisan legislation were too strong and could not support it
but the other amendment madam chairman that i offered that would simply reinstate all the preventive funding all of the proactive funding in the bill that was rejected by every republican member of the committee
not a single gop member of the committee on the judiciary would support the prevention funding in committee
it is my earnest hope however that in conference with the senate which i hope will insist that we not only have a backend strategy for dealing with the crime problem of gangs but that we have a frontend strategy as well and that we will have the chance to address this again in conference committee and that funding will be restored
mr speaker if you listen to the debate you might not think it is illegal to use a machete to chop somebody s hand off or to last night gangrape a handicapped child in the park murder for hire coldblooded murders
in most jurisdictions in the country certainly in the jurisdictions that i represent it is already illegal to take a machete and chop somebody s hand off and i have not heard complaints from the local police that they need a new federal law to help deal with those crimes
the rule of course does not allow us to address that issue where juveniles the marginal juveniles the ones not now tried as adults in state court would be tried as adults under this legislation
i have not seen any study that contradicts them but all of the studies i have seen show that that will actually increase the crime rate because when they are tried as adults they are also locked up with adult criminals and come out worse than they went in
no amendments in this rule are allowed to address the death penalty which has been shown to be racially discriminatory which has been shown to have no effect on crime and shown to be so inappropriate that the supreme court with seven republican appointees sitting on the court ruled that for juveniles the death penalty was unconstitutional
there is no amendment to allow the little money in the bill to go to local law enforcement
mr speaker we have not had the amendments to actually address the kinds of problems that are in the bill
i know one letter we received talked about the need for all of the money in the bill going to law enforcement and help get the money for law enforcement in the bill to the localities and you look in the bill and there is no money
in fact you are doing nothing
keep the kids out of trouble and if they get in trouble to begin with get them right back on track
there is no money in here for prevention
arts and crafts for gang members will do more to reduce juvenile crime and gang membership than the provisions in this bill and everybody knows it
we lead the world in incarceration already
they are in gangs now because they have nothing to do in the afternoon
madam chairman i rise in opposition to the bill and i yield myself such time as i may consume
this bill is in no way like the bill we developed a few years ago on a bipartisan basis to address youth crime and violence following the dark days following the columbine school shootings
and when they first get in trouble intervene early and provide sufficient sanctions and services to get them back on the straight and narrow
further if they do come back hit them with graduated so make no mistake about it the children affected by this bill will be those children whose roles in gang crimes are minor or fringe because we are already trying youth who commit serious violent offenses as adults and locking them up for long periods of time
it is the lesser offenders the children who get in fist fights committing misdemeanors who will be subject to the 10year mandatory minimum numbers in this bill
so the 10year mandatory minimums will be the friends who get in fights
madam chairman we already lock up more people than anywhere on earth 714 per 100 000 way above whatever is in second place way above the national average of 100 per 100 000
in fact whereas there is 1 out of 63 white youth 25 to 29years old in jail today we lock up one out of every 8 africanamerican youth in jail today
the coalition of juvenile justice study childhood on trial coincidentally released the same day as this bill was introduced covers thousands of cases over a long period of time and confirmed that adult treatment of more juveniles increases crime and violence and is discriminatory in its application
that is primarily because if the judge finds a person guilty in adult court his only possibilities are lock the child up with adults or let them walk on probation or parole
if they get locked up with adults they will obviously come out worse than they went in
but unfortunately despite all of our agreement and progress we have failed in the most important aspect of our prior work and that is to provide adequate funding for the initiatives that we passed
we are in fact cutting funding for these programs in our budget and also cutting money for local law enforcement
and this bill provides nothing for prevention nothing for early intervention and virtually nothing in the bill goes to local law enforcement
instead almost 400 million in the bill will go to the federal prosecutors and possibly billions to locking up people under the long mandatory minimum sentences
madam chairman we have a choice in crime policy
in fact a few weeks ago i met with some students at monument high school in south boston massachusetts and i told them about this upcoming hearing we were having on the gang bill and i asked them what did they think needed to be done to keep kids out of gangs
and what is needed to prevent them from joining gangs was ample recreation for boys as well as girls jobs and internships for training and money and assistance to allow their families to live in decent homes
recently i met with law enforcement officials in my district and they had similar advice
first of all madam chairman murder rape kidnapping are already illegal in every state
they will get time in jail
in fact as i indicated before for 15 to 19yearold african americans in this country one out of eight are already in jail today
this bill which will try more juveniles as adults will not only increase the number in jail but will also increase the crime rate
mr chairman i ask unanimous consent to seek the time in opposition although i am not opposed to the amendment
in fact since we are talking about immigrants one in 27 hispanic males 25 to 29 are in jail today already
mr chairman i claim the time in opposition
mr chairman i rise to claim the time in opposition and i yield myself such time as i may consume
having heard the distinguished views from my friend the gentlewoman from california ms waters xz4004220 and the gentleman from georgia mr norwood xz4002960 i am convinced that the amendment is well taken however misplaced in time
the mandatory minimums in the bill apply to secondoffense fist fights and i guess if you are an illegal immigrant you get an additional 5 years mandatory minimum
if that is not enough mr chairman we have already said that for those 25 to 29 in the africanamerican community 1 out of 8 are already in jail today
the sentencing commission has studied the impact of mandatory minimum sentences and have found that they not only violate the entire purpose of the sentencing commission but they are also applied in a racially discriminatory manner
they found that compared to a more intelligent scheme where the more serious criminals get more time and less serious get less time mandatory minimums are less effective in reducing crime
mandatory minimums undermine the sentencing guideline regime congress so carefully established in the sentencing reform act of 1984 by preventing the rational development of guidelines that reduce unwanted disparity and provide proportionality and fairness
mandatory minimums also destroy honesty in sentencing by encouraging charge and fact plea bargains
in fact the us sentencing commission has documented that mandatory minimums have the opposite of their intended effect
far from fostering certainty in punishment mandatory minimums result in unwarranted sentencing disparity
mandatory minimums also treat dissimilar offenders in a similar fashion although these offenders can be quite different with respect to the seriousness of their conduct or their danger to society
accordingly we respectfully request that the expansion of the federal criminal justice system over juvenile offenders be seriously reconsidered and that the mandatory minimum sentences provision in the bill be removed
if you make any murder in the federal system you are looking at life
madam chairman i rise in support of hr 1279 the gang deterrence and community protection act of 2005
this bill is a forwardlooking and comprehensive approach to a growing national threat violent and vicious criminal gangs in our communities
according to the last national youth gang survey there are now between 750 000 and 850 000 gang members in our country
every city in the country with a population of 250 000 or more has reported gang activity
there are over 25 000 gangs in more than 3 000 jurisdictions in the united states
in recent years gangs have become nationallyorganized criminal syndicates
they are disciplined criminal enterprises with leaders managers and employees with training and structured associations many of which are now international in scope
the lawabiding public and state and local law enforcement have sent us a strong message act now and stop the scourge of violence in our communities
fourth the bill adopts a limited measure to permit federal prosecutors to charge 16 and 17yearolds in federal court without going through a lengthy and outdated transfer procedure
current law has hindered law enforcement efforts to incapacitate violent 16 and 17yearold gang members in aggravated crimes of violence
for assaults resulting in serious bodily injury that is nearly killing or permanently disabling a person gang members will face a mandatory minimum of 20 years and for all other gang crimes gang members will face a 10year mandatory minimum penalty
the mandatory minimums contained in this legislation are carefully tailored to deter and disrupt violent gang activity as swiftly as possible
further prosecutors and law enforcement will tell you that in the absence of mandatory guidelines such penalties are the only way to secure the cooperation of lowerlevel gang members who have critical information about the tightlyknit gang structure and gang crimes to testify and cooperate against higherlevel gang members who typically insulate themselves from the daytoday criminal activity
madam chairman i wish to take a minute to underscore the support for this measure from law enforcement and by that i mean the brave men and women who are on the streets every day putting their lives on the line to fight the gang epidemic in our country
tough determinate sentencing policies have worked to reduce crime in the last 20 years and now we are facing a new challenge
he put forth his proposal in committee and it was defeated on a rollcall vote of 3 ayes to 22 noes
so the schiff proposal did not even carry a majority of the democratic members in the committee let alone the republican members
we can have a legitimate disagreement on mandatory minimum sentences but i think there are some crimes that are so severe and eat away so much at the roots of our society and the fabric of our society that those who are convicted of those crimes ought to be locked up and locked up for sure because only with a certain jail term are we going to be able to punish those who have killed people in the most brutal manner and deter those who might be thinking of doing it to others in our society
i have here an april 26 story from the associated press dateline houston violent gang linked to nine houston area killings i am not going to read the whole story on the floor but i am going to read one paragraph of this story to show that those who wish to delay this bill because it has a mandatory minimum or because it does not do enough social work are wrong harris county sheriff s investigators arrested five members of mara salvatrucha which is ms13 in connection with the shooting death of 18monthold alden naquin who was trapped in his car seat april 12 when a man opened fire on a car driven by his father ernest naquin i think if someone is convicted of murdering an 18monthold in that circumstance they ought to be locked away for sure and for a long time
mr chairman the opponents of this bill seem to zero in on two things
we have to incarcerate and incapacitate the violent criminals in our society
so let me say that if 33 billion over the last 6 years in intervention and prevention programs has not turned around this type of crime when other crime has gone down maybe the time to throw the book at those who are engaged in juvenile gang violence is at hand
second the amendment would add conspiracies as a criminal violation and increase criminal penalties for any such violation under section 1952 of title 18 interstate and foreign travel in aid of racketeering enterprises
mr chairman i am sure the president of honduras would have loved to have kept the person who killed the 26 people in his country there and tried him and punished him there but the fact of the matter is the borders are leaky
in addition the amendment would require the department of homeland security to provide the national crime information center with information on illegal aliens
mr chairman i rise in opposition to the amendment
mr chairman i rise in support of hr 1279 which will increase the prosecution of gangs and help prevent gangrelated crimes
a recent rash of gangrelated violence has left four injured and one person dead in the city of norwalk this year
the mentoring program in the norwalk public school system which will benefit from the recent department of education federal grant we secured plays a strong role in keeping kids off the streets
mentoring programs designed to reduce children s juvenile delinquency and involvement in gangs and provide positive relationships to help guide them during their school years are an invaluable way to break the cycle of gang membership before it begins
i am in its present form
it would amend the criminal code to prohibit defrauding the government in connection with the reconstruction efforts in iraq
every single dollar that is wasted because of corporate fraud or abuse in iraq is one less dollar that can go to protect our troops one less dollar for body armor one less dollar for protective equipment that can save lives
it is an unfortunate fact of life that today in iraq taxpayer funds are being routinely wasted by organized corporate criminals
this not only demeans and cheapens the sacrifices that our military and civilian personnel are making in iraq it endangers their lives
that may be just the tip of the iceberg as billions of dollars are being expended in iraq with precious little accountability
if we are going to do all of this it certainly is appropriate that we also amend the criminal laws to combat blatant contract fraud in iraq to protect our brave troops
then as now our government can not in good faith ask its people to sacrifice for reconstruction efforts that allow so many others to unfairly profit
mr chairman i rise in strong opposition to this bill which offers no solution to our nation s gang violence problem and in support of the watersscott amendment which strikes the mandatory sentences provisions
clearly in many neighborhoods throughout our country we have a gang violence problem
violence in gangs is a critical problem persistent among lowincome and minority communities
it seems to me that the only solution being offered by this legislation to our juveniles involved in gangs is locking them into a life path where there is no way out
mr chairman i rise in opposition to this amendment
and i am surprised that my friend would propose that we increase the amount of money that taxpayers are paying for incarceration to now expand it to illegal aliens who commit crimes leave the country and come back in
we have one of the highest incarceration rates of any nation in the entire world
i would submit to my colleagues that if they submit the name of everybody that they deport and they send them back and they say to the leaders of these countries if these people come back we are going to penalize you in one of several ways that we cooperate with you again we have so many ways that we provide assistance to other countries and we have got to make them responsible for keeping their criminals at home
do not end up in press conferences with this administration the head of our government s members of congress working out all kinds of arrangements with these governments to help them in so many ways whether it is trade foreign assistance or 909 other ways that we help them
mr chairman allow me to shock the members on the opposite side of the aisle and join with them in support of this amendment
i do think that we should have been involved in studies a long time ago
so i am hopeful that we will get the support of our colleagues in this congress so that we can study
so again even though this is a little late in coming i do support the amendment and i ask for an aye vote
would the gentleman be interested in that at some point in time
i rise in support of my amendment
mr chairman the gentleman from virginia mr scott xz4003641 and i have offered an amendment that would strike all of the mandatory minimum sentences in hr 1279 the gang deterrence and community protection act
the mandatory minimum sentencing requirements found in sections 102 103 104 105 106 and 107 are simply not the answer to gang deterrence
mandatory minimums are not even effective in deterring crime
their only proven result is in driving up our prison populations resulting in overcrowding and the need for the creation of more prisons
increasing prison populations is not the solution to the prevention of crime in our communities even communities infested with gang crime
we need to let judges be judges and ensure that they have the discretion to sentence criminal defendants in a manner that takes into account all of the facts and circumstances that are presented before them
clearly this must include an evaluation of any mitigating circumstances such as the defendant s childhood experience especially if the defendant is a juvenile the mental state of the defendant the role that the defendant played in the commission of the crime the mental capacity of the defendant the crime committed whether force or a firearm was used during the commission of the crime and whether a victim lost his or her life and was seriously maimed as a result of the crime
i urge all of my colleagues to please support my amendment and to strike all of the mandatory minimum sentences included in hr 1279
we can not sit here in the congress of the united states and continue to take away the ability of judges to make decisions
you do not know if there is a kid who happens to live in a neighborhood that is infested with gang members and they must pretend to be in the gang in order to survive
do you want that kid caught up in a situation where they are going to be given mandatory minimum sentencing when they did not have an opportunity to have a judge understand what the extenuating circumstances were
i am not going to allow my amendment to get caught up in the politics of the day
i know that there are people who are just salivating for this amendment to remain on the floor so they can catch democrats voting for something that they will use in their campaigns
california is three states in one and for a person like me who lives in south los angeles right in the middle of a gang area i would have a lot to tell about designating that gang area
rather it lets the communities and the people that represent them have a voice in the decisionmaking
addressing the gang problem in our communities is an issue that requires all levels of government working together
these communities know firsthand the damage gang violence does in their neighborhoods everyday
local officials know better than anyone else what is occurring on a day to day basis in their jurisdictions
this amendment would allow participation on all levels of government in this designation process
mr chairman i urge my colleagues to support this amendment and allow local elected officials in conjunction with federal and state officials to have input on how their communities are branded as high intensity gang areas
mr chairman i believe that we should make every effort to prevent gang members from obtaining their weapons of mass destruction i urge my colleagues to support this amendment and help the bureau of alcohol tobacco firearms and explosives continue the assault on crime in our communities while cutting off the flow of guns to gang members
march issue of newsweek they are a violent force in 33 states and counting
the most dangerous gang in america ms13 they killed 10 people in northern virginia
and i will tell the gentleman from los angeles they have killed a number of people out in your area too
they took brenda paz who was in the witness protection program down to the shenandoah valley and slashed her throat to where her neck was cut all the way almost through and stabbed her 16 times
they prey on the poor in the inner cities
they prey on the poor in culmore
i have said the people of culmore and the people of the inner city have just as much right to live in the upscale neighborhoods where they may not be
and when we protect the most vulnerable in our society we protect everybody
i have talked to the community in different areas of my district and in culmore through this region
they live in fear
and i say whether you have been in this country for 50 years and are wealthy or whether you have been here for 50 hours and you live in an area where you are trying to work your way out you deserve the right to be protected
and i hope and i pray on behalf of brenda paz who was stabbed 16 times and the families that live in culmore and the families that live out in la
and the families that live in houston and the families that live throughout the state of virginia that are suffering with this that this bill passes overwhelmingly and goes on to the senate and they pass it so we can finally get relief not for the wealthy but for those who live in culmore and the inner city who up until this time have been forgotten by this institution
mr chairman i rise in support of this amendment
let me read an article from the washington post in what officials suspect is the latest horror committed by gangs 28 people including six children were killed december 24 when gunmen opened fire on a bus full of passengers near the northern honduran city of san pedro sula twentyeight individuals six of them were children
another article said there was a request by the presidents of four central american countries for help in gang battles
that individual who was involved in the killing of 28 individuals in san pedro sula in honduras was arrested in mcallen texas coming back into the country after killing 28 people
there are many cases whereby they come back into the country and commit violent crimes after having committed violent crimes down in el salvador
but 28 people in that little village in that town of san pedro sula and then the man is arrested not in honduras but up here in texas
mr chairman addressing gang violence across this nation is absolutely an important step so that people can feel safe in their communities and so that our youth will grow up to be productive happy satisfied adults
while i commend my colleagues on the other side of the aisle for addressing this important issue i am deeply disappointed in their legislation
in fact i represented the sixth district of california which is north of the golden gate bridge from san francisco
in my district there is no exception
the largest city in my district santa rosa is increasingly faced with gang violence
with the help of new state of california funding through measure zero a sales tax that passed in the last goaround the city is providing diversion programs that appeal to youth such as afterschool programs and increased recreational activities
rather hr 1279 creates new death penalties mandatory minimum sentences and measures to prosecute children in adult court in other words applying adult punishment to young people
i urge my colleagues to join me in opposing hr 1279 and insisting that we go back and prepare legislation with real workable solutions and alternatives to gang violence
it relies in significant part on mandatory minimum sentences
people being aware of mandatory minimums will not in fact do the crime
in the instance of a 30year mandatory minimum sentence for murder for sexual assault for maiming this is designed to discourage people from engaging in this conduct
my amendment would simply authorize the attorney general to engage in a media campaign to let people know about these new mandatory minimums so that we can in fact have a deterrent effect
by having a media campaign we are in a position to let young people who may be either in a gang or contemplating joining a gang understand that if they engage in a maiming cutting off someone s arm if they engage in an aggravated sexual assault that they are facing a potential 30year mandatory minimum sentence the idea being that this mandatory minimum sentence would discourage the conduct
mr speaker i rise today to encourage my colleagues in this congress to continue fighting illegal immigration in our great country
as a freshman member of this house i am honored to have played a role in that process
immigration affects virtually every aspect of life in america
i was torn on voting for hr 1279 because of my concern for states rights but i was swayed in the end to vote for it because of the number of illegal aliens involved in gangs
with more than a million legal and illegal immigrants settling in the united states each year a level higher than at any other time in our nation s history immigration has an impact on education health care social security taxes employment the environment crime and countless other areas of american life
we have an immigration process in place that simply must be followed
i rise today in strong support of hr 1279 and i commend the gentleman from wisconsin chairman sensenbrenner for his leadership in bringing this bill to the floor for a vote today
however the majority of crime in my district takes place in a very small concentrated area
but the people of bristol bucks county are taking the lead in cleaning up their streets
however bristol is under threat from gangs migrating from cities just across the river in new jersey
well in bristol we have the money and we have financial resources through the weed and seed program but what we need are strong laws
hr 1279 is the bill that would dissuade gangs from taking up shop in my district
the house committee on the judiciary reports that over 631 gangrelated homicides occurred in 2001 perpetrated by an estimated 750 000 active gang members
organized crime madam chairman has been prosecuted in the same way with long and complex trials designed to take out a number of defendants in one single prosecution and they were successful in ending their spread
in this case however as i expressed in the committee on the judiciary i think there are three problems with the bill first it federalizes state crimes
i voted for mandatory minimums a number of times in my previous time in congress and then i had 6 years out six years out to talk with people in the community to talk with judges
like i say i voted for them in the past
let us not because of some political considerations rise and go after say crack cocaine as opposed to powdered cocaine and end up with perverse results which is somebody rotting in jail because they smoked the wrong kind of cocaine
it is something we should resolve in this body to avoid
madam chairman i spent 22 years as a judge in texas trying criminal cases felonies 22 000 felony cases came through my court
and the people in this country who believe and think that gangs are not a problem are sorely mistaken
it was the action operative of the gangs in the houston area to use juveniles to commit serious crimes violent crimes because those very juveniles and these gang leaders knew that juveniles would be treated differently as they were
this portion of the bill that treats juveniles in some cases the same as adults is a good idea because in our country victims continue to be discriminated against based on the age of offenders
we at this time are engaged in a war against international terrorists
we need to be concerned about the street terrorists who roam our neighborhoods and commit violent crimes in the name of some type of gang
mr chairman by helping law enforcement share information we will be giving our police on the streets a powerful tool in the fight against violence and help them better protect our citizens
in fact up until january 3 of this year i was a cop
gang violence in america is not a sudden problem
it has been a part of urban life for years offering an aggressive definition and identity to those seeking a place to belong in the chaos of a large metropolitan area
the gentleman from virginia mr forbes xz4001370 addresses this critical problem today in the gang deterrence and community protection act of 2005
my colleagues in the sheriff s office and i actively fought to curb the growth and influence of gangs
i know not only in my home state of washington but across the country law enforcement officers recognize gangs for the serious threat they are to our community
i believe in taking problems head on not running away
whether a gang currently has a presence in our hometowns or not we need to take a careful look at where this issue is headed and stop the influence of gangs before it spirals out of control and out of our hands
the united states department of justice cites that there are currently 25 000 active gangs in 3 000 jurisdictions across this country 25 000 gangs
if growth continues we could be looking at 1 million gang members across the country in only a few years
in fact street gangs are the primary distributor of illegal drugs in the united states
mr speaker i am a man of faith who believes deeply in family and responsibility
we can not afford to lose those talented youths in our community to a life on the street with drugs and a gang hierarchy whose form of discipline is violence
in the early 1990s gangs were a huge problem in this country and we worked hard and passed local tough laws to address the gang issue
the crackdown by cops across the nation in the early 1990s did break the backs of gang activity
a few years ago i lost a good friend an officer who worked in the seattle area
i absolutely believe in protecting our children and giving them a chance teaching them right from wrong and allowing them to make mistakes
i believe in doing that while they are young
and no one not you me not any of these youths in gangs are without responsibility
in order to be safe we need to stop this cycle before it begins
in may of 2001 des moines patrol officer steve underwood was shot to death and killed after approaching a car with four gang members on a latenight watch along pacific highway south
shot to death simply in approaching the car this is what we have progressed to
in the course of our conversation she raised mandatory minimums
mr speaker i rise in opposition to h j res 27 which withdraws approval of the united states from the agreement establishing the world trade organization
while there is great value in continuing multilateral trade regulations and mailltaining the general integrity of the wto this organization has consistently foundered in its role of impartial adjudicator and continues to undermine the domestic trade sovereignty of our nation
over the past decade we have witnessed a massive increase in the us trade deficit an alarming number of dislocated american workers and consistent threats to the autonomy of us domestic trade policy
the international community has seen the numerous shortcomings of the wto system including poorly enforced labor laws that afford many countries an unfortunate competitive advantage in the global marketplace
the premise of independent unionization and equitable development has not been realized in the past 10 years under the wto and continues to underscore the need for a reevaluation and modification of the institution
as a principal partner in the wto we must not disassociate ourselves from the organization or we will realize the regression of our global economy
it is in the best interests of our nation to continue our active involvement in the wto while reconsidering and reworking current international trade policies
will rogers once said in explaining the length of a political platform that it takes a lot of words to straddle an issue and i have every intention of using a lot of words here this morning
i think like many people like most of us we have no fear of free trade that the united states playing on a level playing field can easily compete in the world market and i do not ascribe to some of the statements that i think have been somewhat overzealous or vitriolic in describing policies here
i also agree that in some respects moving out of the policy we have right now without a substantial alternative would be chaotic
having said that this is where the but comes in
i intend on either giving a symbolic vote or maybe a symbolic speech in place of that vote with concerns of sovereignty issues that are dealt with here and that some of those voices that are concerned about sovereignty issues are not just simply those fearful of the dark but there are legitimate concerns which require a periodic reanalysis of what we are doing
i speak specifically about a case which has sent the attorney general from the state of utah to join 28 attorney generals from other states in protest of the situation in which the world trade organization has thrown state statutes in jeopardy
antigua with which we had a policy dating back to 1993 has complained that laws prohibiting internet gambling as well as gambling and betting paraphernalia which have been for about 100 years the social policy of utah violate trade organizations and the trade organization ruled in favor of antigua
it is inherently wrong for any adjudicative panel of any organization internationally or trade to put in jeopardy the kinds of state laws that we have in place especially when they deal with social policies that have been there for almost 100 years
whether this is simply a glitch in negotiations that can easily be worked out or whether this is a systemic problem or whether as the attorney generals are arguing that the states need a greater voice in the organization and the application of these trade policies especially if it is going to relate to state law that is the discussion that needs to take place
my state may have lucked out because a clerical error in this particular case did not refer specifically to the utah state law and therefore it may not be applicable
but the fear factor is still there that in the future state efforts state regulations and state policies may be put in jeopardy not only by our trade policies but also by federal regulations that affect those trade policies when they ought not to be
i recognize that this particular resolution is very narrow in its application
it may not be specifically on that point but it does at least give us the opportunity of saying not only is that an issue and a concern for the future but it is an issue that we should take seriously and we should discuss seriously and we should address seriously so that these particular problems especially as it deals with state issues and state rights will not be put in jeopardy with the future
the fact that appropriators in this body felt compelled to take this dramatic step points to a larger issue
congress should not have to police the us trade representative to make sure he or she is acting in the best interests of us consumers
congress should not have to fight the us trade representative in order to ensure jobs for our nation s workforce affordable medicine for our nation s consumers and manufacturing capacity for our nation s protection
the ustr should be acting in the interest of all americans
in fact our trade representative s office includes a position and i am not making this up our trade representative s office includes a position called us trade representative for asia pacific and pharmaceutical policies
in the cafta agreement as the gentleman from michigan mr levin xz4002380 said earlier in africa in asia the world s poorest people have to pay more for prescription drugs because the us has in our trade representative s office a us trade representative for asia pacific and pharmaceutical policy
look what has happened to our trade deficit in the last 12 years
i came to congress in 1992
in 2004 12 years later our trade deficit was 618 billion
look at our stagnating wages the fact that the top 10 percent of people in this society are doing very well
look at our crippling job loss in my state and especially in manufacturing
not only has our trade deficit gone from 38 billion to 618 billion in only a dozen years look at what has happened in manufacturing
the states in red have all lost 20 percent of their manufacturing in the last 5 years
when members think about this maybe in fact some people would say our trade agreements are working
when congress passed the legislation for us to join the wto bill clinton was president of the united states and newt gingrich congressman gingrich thought it was important to have a mechanism in place where the congress can exercise its independent authority over trade and that we should have an opportunity to carry out that responsibility by evaluating whether we want to stay in the world trade organization or not
mr speaker i must tell my colleagues that when that issue was before us i had mixed thoughts as to whether we should have a nuclear option of withdrawing from the wto or whether there are more effective ways for congress to exercise its constitutional responsibility in an independent way over trade
as the gentleman from california mr dreier xz4001150 pointed out and as the gentlewoman from california ms matsui xz4006631 pointed out it is in the united states interests to be in a rulesbased trading system and we need to make sure that we continue united states participation within the wto
however we also need to understand that we need to improve and make more effective the wto and we also need to strengthen the manner in which we review the operations of the wto
in twothirds of the cases that have gone to dispute resolution panels or appellate panels we have seen that they have overreached
senator dole had suggested that when he was in the united states senate
i think we should look at that and that would be a more effective way to have a continuing review in carrying out our responsibility as to whether the wto is acting effectively to open up markets to all producers and manufacturers and farmers
all this can be done and should be done and we should not wait every 5 years in order to review that
i urge us to look at ways in which we can help us manufacturers us producers and us farmers to gain greater access to the international markets
at that time mr speaker i must tell the members i had certain concerns as to why we would want to have basically a nuclear option in pulling out from the wto
today i am pleased that we can review the wto because i think it is important for us to have a debate as to where we are in the wto
we believe it is in the interest of the united states to be in a rulesbased trading system and to withdraw from a rulesbased trading system would be folly it would be wrong
it is generally agreed that in order to have a successful meeting of the ministers this december in hong kong the members of the wto will have to come to a significant level of agreement by july on three key areas
obviously mr lamy will have a special burden to demonstrate that he can make progress in this area where the european union has been so outrageous in its subsidies
we will wait to see whether in fact that can be accomplished
the second area is in manufactured goods
and in both of these areas much work remains to be done if we are going to have a successful doha round
this is a critical area for us manufacturing particularly in large markets such as japan korea and china
and finally in the area of services we are far behind where we should be in expanding opportunity for services by us companies in other markets
i hope that our negotiators will be able to make up for lost time in the next couple of months so that an ambitious services package will be approved in hong kong
there is one other area i want to mention mr speaker as we review our participation in the wto and that is the dispute settlement system
under the old gatt system silence in an agreement meant that a country could do what it deemed appropriate
in 33 cases brought against the united states since 1995 panels or the appellate body have overreached overreached in 22 of them
in 10 years the wto has not affirmed a single safeguard measure as applied by the united states or any other country
in trade remedy cases involving the united states antidumping duties countervailing duty measures and safeguard cases the wto has upheld the united states decision in two of 17 cases
a growing number of observers are coming to recognize that the extraordinary loss rate is because the wto panels and its appellate body do not respect the letter of the wto agreements and are filling in the gaps beyond what the us negotiators agreed to in the uruguay round
mr speaker i mention this because this is another area that we have to make up for lost ground in our negotiations under the wto
so make no mistake about it we should reject this resolution overwhelmingly because it is in the interest of the united states to participate in a rulesbased international trading system
but we have to do a better job in our negotiations within the wto and that is what we need to concentrate on
mr speaker first let me say that i agree with my colleague that we should be negotiating higher labor standards at least international labor standards but i would suggest the way to do that is engagement not to pull out of the wto and to do better in our bilateral agreements
it is important that we work within a rulesbased trading system in order to expand opportunities
if we were to pull out of the wto we would have no opportunity to raise at all the labor standards in other countries or the environmental standards
we need to work within the wto in order to accomplish those objectives
mr speaker i rise today in support of h j res 27 which would withdraw the united states from further participation in the world trade organization wto
i am voting yes today to voice my opposition to us trade policies that continue to augment the race to the bottom international trade culture that has sent goodpaying american jobs overseas in pursuit of everlower wages and lax labor and environmental standards
instead of pursuing policies that lift up and improve the lives of workers in this country and around the world we have crippled us communities while enabling the exploitation of foreign workforces
in light of our massive trade deficit loss of manufacturing jobs and the ongoing currency manipulation by foreign countries my vote today supports the hard working families in america
there are serious national security considerations inherent in our trade policy and i believe we ignore these ramifications at our own risk
what made the us the greatest country in the world is the ability of high school educated americans to make a good living in the manufacturing and industrial sectors
meanwhile i have tried twice in the last year to pass an amendment to simply study the issue of the outsourcing of american jobs and have twice been defeated on close votes
we can repeal the law or we can pay a fine to keep it a huge fine in many cases
next in their sights are buy america laws those referenced by the gentleman from the carolinas
the wto requires we can not discriminate in terms of who the vendors will be
in fact homeland security can be provided by the chinese or maybe even by iran under the rules of the wto
the us did just fine as the greatest trading nation in the world with bilateral agreements
mr speaker i rise in support of this rule and in very very strong opposition to what this resolution is attempting to do
the great economist milton friedman once said underlying most arguments against the free market is a lack of belief in freedom itself now mr speaker if we listen carefully to the reasons we commonly hear for abandoning our open trade agenda it becomes very clear that milton friedman was absolutely right
trade liberalization will weaken worker rights in developing countries
the underlying claim is that greater economic freedom will harm americans and our trading partners alike but this fear of freedom is not based in fact
through trade liberalization that the gatt and the wto have enabled with the existence of those have seen average tariffs in industrialized countries go from 40 percent down to 4 percent spurring a sixfold increase in global gdp
so we have seen by virtue of that 40 percent to 4 percent reduction a sixfold increase in gross domestic product growth
over this time period exports have come to support over 25 percent of the economic growth that we enjoy in the united states
remember we have a virtually almost 11 trillion economy here in the united states
25 percent of the growth in that economy is due to exports
open trade and investment has netted an extra 1 trillion in us income every year or about 10 000 per household as a result of those reductions that we have seen in tariff and nontariff barriers
by reducing tariffs strengthening intellectual property protection and increasing transparency in all of the 148 member countries the wto is our largest most comprehensive and most effective forum for expanding markets and creating new opportunities for americans
the wto has also been an important tool for the united states in ensuring that international trade commitments are honored
of the 47 wto cases brought by the united states that have been concluded 44 have been resolved in our favor
our wto membership has been absolutely critical in maintaining our global economic leadership
with 80 percent of the world s economy and 95 percent of the world s consumers outside of the united states our role in the wto remains essential to opening new markets and expanding existing ones for us producers service providers and investors
the free trade agreement negotiating process has long been highly successful in opening up new opportunities for americans
we are on the forefront of i hope passing the dominican republic central american free trade agreement which is critical to continuing on that path of prosperity that began with the gatt back in 1947 and has continued through the wto the north american free trade agreement and a wide range of bilateral agreements that we have put together over the past several years with israel jordan chile singapore australia and morocco among others
drcafta will make our trading relationship with the region reciprocal by granting us producers the same access to their markets that the dominican republiccentral american producers have long enjoyed in ours
all of the benefits of trade that i have described greater family incomes exportsupported growth transparent and fair trading rules for us companies that participate in the global marketplace these are all benefits these are all benefits that our neighbors in latin america deserve to enjoy along with us
they will in effect argue that the region is too poor to trade with us
so for the sake of the american people for the sake of those throughout the world who are seeking to get onto the first rung of the economic ladder it is absolutely imperative that the united states of america maintain its leadership role in the world trade organization
mr speaker today the house will undoubtedly vote down this resolution and signal strong support for remaining in the world trade organization
since the formation of the gatt average tariffs in industrialized countries have gone down from 40 to less than 4 percent since the creation of the wto in 1994 us exports have increased by 300 billion
mr speaker i believe the resolution on the floor today provides the ideal time to pause and reflect on the shortcomings of the current wto system and on ways both the congress and the administration can make changes to the wto structure so that it works better and rebuilds confidence in the system among our constituencies
where in a very limited manner wto rules permit limited transparency by allowing the assistance and resources of private parties who are supportive of the us government position the administration has chosen not to utilize this allowance
transparency is not the only problem contributing to the wto s failure to move rulesbased trade forward globally but it is the central factor allowing the wto and its bureaucrats to escape the scrutiny which would quickly eradicate other abuses in geneva
through the lack of transparency the wto dispute settlement and appellate bodies are emboldened to disregard the proper standard of review in disputes involving trade laws for example
in this way past wto panels have issued rogue decisions against the us with no basis or standing in the context of previously negotiated agreements
this commission composed of retired federal judges would report to congress after reviewing wto decisions adverse to the us in order to determine whether the relevant decision makers failed to follow the applicable standard of review or otherwise abused their mandate
yet absent a new entity to administer and advance rulesbased trade there is no question that we must remain committed to and engaged in the wto
the us must move swiftly to put an end to judicial activism in the wto and reorganize the structure and culture of both the appellate body and the dispute settlement body
additionally the ustr should deputize private parties with a direct and substantial interest in a case to appear and participate in wto proceedings and devote greater resources to litigation in wto disputes
mr speaker i rise today in opposition to house joint resolution 27
withdrawing from the world trade organization wto would be an abandonment of america s leadership in trade and an economic disaster for our nation
for decades the united states has been the leading voice in the world for the free market system and economic cooperation among nations because capitalism works for america
america has consistently pushed for a rational rulesbased approach in dealing with international trade because we know our unique competitive vibrant and innovative economy will allow most us economic sectors to compete successfully against any nation provided we have a fair playing field and open access to foreign markets
if we abandon the wto we abandon those years of leadership in trade
if we shut ourselves out of the process we put our farmers manufacturers businesses an workers at a strategic disadvantage compared to others in the world
north carolina s economy depends on exports and we need to break down barriers to overseas markets so that our technology agriculture manufacturing and other sectors can expand on our progress in international competition
studies show that one in five manufacturing jobs in north carolina depend on exports
every 1 billion in exports creates 20 000 jobs in the united states
mr speaker i rise today in support of this fair rule but in opposition to the underlying h j res 27 withdrawing the approval of the united states from the agreement establishing the world trade organization
in 1994 congress passed the uruguay round table agreements act establishing the world trade organization an independent body charged with monitoring and determining compliance with trade agreements
that law authorized the president to accept the united states membership in the wto and requires a report to be submitted to congress every 5 years on the united states participation in the wto
the law also offers congress the opportunity every 5 years to assess whether continued membership in this organization is in the best interest of the united states
i believe that members of the house should be afforded this opportunity to register their views on this question through a vote of the house which i urge my colleagues to vote on in support of this rule
our farmers and producers in my area in central washington and across the country are some of the most efficient in the world and are capable of competing and winning in world markets so long as they do not face foreign government policies like subsidies and dumping practices that stack the deck against them
the removal of artificial barriers to trade is of critical importance to apple growers and tree fruit farmers in the agriculturalbased economy in central washington that i represent
i am pleased that in 2003 the world trade organization stood up for the apple growers in central washington and across the nation by leveling the playing field in a dispute over japan s import restrictions on imported us apples
the world trade organization ruled that japan s restrictions were not justified and were in breach of their world trade organization obligations
this united states victory brought the hopes of meaningful access to japan s markets to the domestic apple industry and will help us fight similar trade barriers in markets throughout the world
withdrawing from the world trade organization would result in our farmers growers and producers being shut out of these export opportunities and the loss of millions of jobs depending on them
therefore i believe that we must support our nation s continued membership in the wto and must continue aggressive enforcement of the rules of international trade
however our success in selling these goods in a global marketplace and we have to admit that we are in a global market is dependent on fair and open markets
while i oppose the underlying bill members of the congress should have the opportunity today to examine the merits of the united states participation in the wto
h res 27 would withdrawal the united states from participation in the world trade organization
we live in a world today where more people can afford ever cheaper goods
we should not allow any others to dictate to us about what is in our national interest but we must recognize that we can not accomplish our national goals in isolation from the rest of the world
mr speaker i rise today to stress the importance of our country s participation in the world trade organization
the success of us participation in the wto should be measured by our ability to liberalize markets and set fair trade rules for all wto members
clearly the united states has benefited greatly from its wto membership and plays a leading role in shaping the way the world trades today
since the creation of the wto us exports and overall trade have expanded significantly with a 283 billion or 64 percent increase in us manufacturing exports a 139 billion or a 70 percent increase in us services exports and an 18 billion or 39 percent increase in us agricultural exports
here the us has several concerns such as china s failure to follow through with its commitments to ensure that domestic and foreign firms can distribute products within that country as of december 2004 many countries have failed to meet their trips commitments and have not effectively enforced intellectual property rights and the protection of data privacy there is concern regarding the establishment of standards licensing and customs barriers including the eu s customs procedures and its proposed new chemical regulations and there is concern about the continued proliferation of many agricultural barriers such as the unscientific barriers to many agricultural products in europe china and elsewhere
the united states should continue to insist that all wto members implement the wto agreements in a timely and comprehensive manner
however in the doha development round many developing countries expressed concerns regarding implementation of some commitments and they have sought extensions and delays
i will continue to work with my colleagues on the committee on ways and means and in the congress to ensure that the us provides technical support and capacity building measures to assist developing countries in meeting their wto commitments
if trade is to be a tool of development and growth for our developingcountry trading partners we must play a central role in helping the wto facilitate compliance with member obligations
mr speaker i concur with my ways and means democratic colleagues regarding the united states continued participation in the world trade organization wto
there is growing interdependence of countries resulting from the increasing integration of trade finance people and ideas in one global marketplace
there has to be better collaboration in understanding the relationship between trade and labor issues
we must ensure that core labor standards are enforced particularly in developing economies
we must have more meaningful dialogue about environmental issues in trade discussions
china s strategy of undervaluing their currency the yuan and dumping steel into our domestic market puts ohioans in danger of losing their jobs
ohio manufacturers produced 459 billion in valueadded steel production and processing last year
the steel industry generates over 110 000 jobs in the state of ohio
these wto panels have ruled in favor of the united states less than onethird of the time
they have ruled in favor of the united states less than onethird of the time
in fact the wto panel recently found a utah law prohibiting internet gambling to be illegal
we do not need to give control over to the chinese of social security accounts in america
on my right this chart shows on july 31 2003 in north carolina we lost 6 450 jobs
it says five north carolina plants close in the largest single job loss in the state s history just 3 weeks ago mr speaker a plant in my district announced that 445 jobs would be going overseas
mr speaker i close by asking my colleagues that care about the american workers and care about the sovereignty of america to please join us in this effort
this is a global economy that we live in
if we talk about intellectual property rights we need to enforce those that are in there
and the bush administration and our us administration regardless of who sits in that white house must make sure that those property rights are enforced internationally and that is what the wto should be about
in 1995 when the wto was established i thought then and i do hope now that dispute resolution procedures would be those where we could come to the table to resolve some of those disputes
the steel industries in my district too much dumping from some other countries into america
too many dislocated workers the only way to address this is to stay in the wto to work with the other countries
america is in crisis
i represent general motors and this week they announced the closing of more plants dislocating more workers and at the same time put 2 billion in china last year
so i say stay in the wto make it better
i would hope that as we move forward in this discussion and i know the vote will be overwhelming that we stay that we build it and that we make sure that the countries that are taking our jobs have a responsibility to the workers of this country
however members intend to vote on the resolution before us the issue of trade remedies under the rules established by the world trade organization wto is of paramount concern to the industries of my district in the years ahead
how we address this issue will be an important factor in determining whether we can retain support for open markets and the international trading system as we know it
countries like china japan and india that have most consistently dumped in this market and violated international rules are pushed hard to have those disciplines eviscerated
our trading partners in the name of free trade have been effective in putting forward a number of specific proposals that are designed to weaken us trade laws
if the administration comes back with an agreement that waters down our trade remedy laws even further i am confident we will see a strong backlash in congress and a major effect on support for any new trade agreements
support for the wto can not be taken for granted in congress or in this country if we can not maintain the assurance that unfair trade can and will be remedied
during my first term in congress i witnessed firsthand the breakdown in affairs at the world trade organization s trade negations in mexico
it is important that each participating country have a voice in negotiations but by banding together to divert trade talks underdeveloped countries ultimately hurt themselves
no one in europe or the united states will starve to death because of their efforts but the citizens in their own countries will be put at risk
what occurred puts the viability of the wto in question but it also allows the us to go forth with trade promotion authorization on its own
our farmers and producers in iowa and across the country are some of the most efficient in the world and are capable of competing and winning in world markets so long as they do not face unfair foreign government policies
mr speaker i rise in opposition to the resolution calling for the us withdrawal from the world trade organization
us membership and leadership in the world trade organization is essential
it is definitely in our national and our political and our economic interests to continue to be a member
our membership translates into real economic growth in this country as the gentleman from florida very correctly said
during the 10 years of us participation in the wto international trade and investment have been important forces driving our impressive economic growth
now let me take just one moment to rebut an alltoooften made allegation against us membership in the wto namely that membership is a violation of us sovereignty and the us constitution
however under trade agreement rules the united states retains complete sovereignty in its decision of how to respond to any panel decision against it
i urge my colleagues to vote against this resolution and to continue the us membership in the world trade organization
i have been all over this country and i have seen padlocks on gates and grass growing in parking lots where they used to make steel where they used to make cars where they used to washing machines where they used to make bicycles
yes it is time for us to get out of the wto because the wto has set the stage for a driving down of the quality of life in this country
everyone in this house knows that we can not write into our laws that workers rights must be regarded let us say in china
i want someone here to contradict that because if we put that china must have the right to organize in any of their conduct of commerce in their country that would be ruled wto illegal and the united states would be subject to a fine or sanctions by the wto just for standing up for workers rights
but it is also consistent with basic christian morality and may i quote from a papal encyclical leo xiii 1891 in rerum novarum said let the working man and the employer make free agreement and in particular let them agree freely as to wages
he is made a victim of force and injustice i maintain that the wto helps to keep in place a structure of force and injustice against workers because we in this country can not pass laws that would lift the yoke of this force and injustice off workers anywhere in the world because the wto does not permit does not permit any type of workers rights to be included or to be regarded
we can not pass workers rights and put them in our trade agreements
mr speaker i rise in opposition to the proposal that we withdraw from the wto
expanded trade has occurred in this country and in this world
there are losers as well as winners both individually and in nations
the question is to try to make the hands tick well and in the right direction
by definition tariff agreements require changes in laws here and everywhere else unless they are decreed by edict
there is not an openness that there should be and when it comes to our safeguard provisions that many of us worked hard to put into law the gentleman from maryland mr cardin xz4000640 who is the ranking member was part and parcel of that as well as the gentleman from new york mr rangel xz4003330 and those on the republican side we worked hard to put safeguards in
we have not known what went into the consideration of the decision fully we did not see all the briefs and we did not know the basis for the decisions in many cases
in some cases they went beyond the language of the wto agreements
part of the problem is with the wto in geneva part of the problem has been our administration that has not vigorously and the gentleman from maryland mr cardin xz4000640 has worked so hard to illustrate this the administration has not worked actively enough to get china to live up to its agreements
the argument was okay let us use bilateral agreements as building blocks in a number of areas including core labor standards
cafta is a vital agreement in terms of where globalization is going
in latin america there is growing unrest and changes in government in part because of the failure to have the large numbers of people the largest proportion of people share in the benefits of globalization
and the tragedy of it is that the laws in central america to some extent the dominican republic do not meet the basic standards giving people the freedom in the labor market
the experience in countries is that workers are a critical part of the evolution towards a strong middle class
jordan has reference in its agreement to the core labor standards that is not true of cafta
and the enforcement capability in jordan was left to each country to undertake
so i just wanted to comment on this because the bilateral agreements were supposed to be a building block where the wto did not address an issue and there is a failure at this critical point of globalization a critical missed opportunity in terms of helping the benefits of globilization being widely shared
i want to close and i will say more about this later today why it matters to the us it matters in terms of central america which as i say has such income disparities that are true of latin america generally
what it means is as to central america if workers are not going to be able to participate to have freedom to be able to associate to become a part of the workplace and are going to remain in poverty it is bad for those workers it is bad for those countries that desperately need a middle class it is bad for our workers who will not compete with countries where workers are suppressed and it is bad for our companies if there is no strong middle class to purchase our products
so in a word what we need is a trade policy built on a bipartisan foundation which is not true today
what we need is a trade policy that helps move globalization forward that makes sure that more and more people share in the benefits of globalization
instead we need to work together to make the wto more responsive in all respects and also to make sure that our bilateral agreements meet the challenges that the wto is not meeting today
when instituted correctly and fairly trade agreements open up foreign markets to us goods create new opportunities for companies and their employees and lift the standard of living for people in the country with whom we are trading
economists estimate that cutting trade barriers in agriculture manufacturing and services by onethird would boost the world economy by 613 billion equivalent to adding an economy the size of canada to the world economy
however in certain cases there is not a level playing field
airbus received approximately 30 billion in marketdistorting subsidies from the european governments including launch aid infrastructure support debt forgiveness equity infusions and research and development funding
these subsidies in particular launch aid have lowered airbus development costs and shifted the risk of aircraft development to european governments and thereby enabled airbus to develop aircraft at an accelerated pace and sell these aircraft at prices and on terms that would otherwise be unsustainable
these unfair actions put boeing at a major disadvantage and leads to a negative impact to workers and businesses in this country
mr speaker although i disagree with much of what the wto does i do not think it is in the best interest of our nation to withdraw from that organization at this time
withdrawal would put in jeopardy negotiations that are necessary to meet that goal
we have been the defendant in 19 of the last 36 cases decided by the appellate body
for example in recent years the wto has disapproved everything from our tax policies and trade laws to our sovereign right to regulate activity such as internet gambling and set tariffs against unfair pricing by foreign countries
free trade is in everyone s best interest and the wto negotiations are vital to securing new markets for american products and creating new jobs for american workers
the wto clearly is not operating always in the best interests of the united states of america
however it is the forum that exists and as such we need to remain partners with those that are vigilant and vigorous defenders of both free and fair trade in that forum for the benefit of our nation
mr speaker i rise in strong support of our position to remove ourselves from the wto
i happen to believe in minimum tariffs if any but i do not believe that the process of the wto and world government is a good way to do it
we could have no tariffs we could have a uniform tariff which the founders believed in and permitted or we could have protective tariffs which some of those individuals on our side defend and i am not that much interested in
now this always bewilders me when my conservative friends and those who believe in limited government are so anxious to deliver this to another giant international body
free trade if you are interested in free trade all you have to do is write a sentence or two and you can have free trade
it was done in order to be an upstanding member of the wto
one other issue that i think those who defend the wto and call themselves free traders ought to recognize is that when we concede the fact that there should be a tradeoff it means they really do not believe in free trade
if you believe in free trade and the people have the right to spend their money the way they want it would be as simple as that
in the 1990s when the wto was originally passed the former speaker of the house made a statement about this
this is adopting something which twice once in the 1940s and once in the 1950s the us congress rejected
i in fact lean toward it
in reality it was nothing but the resurrection of the old central planning fallacy that the world needs a central authority to manage it
the wto has ended up politicizing trade by putting the stamp of officialdom on some very bad policy so my message is to appeal to those who believe in limited government free markets free trade and the constitution
i appeal to those who want to use tariffs in a protective way because they defend the process
but i am really appealing to the conservatives who claim they believe in free trade because i do not believe what we have here is truly free trade
not too long ago utah repealed a ban on electronic gambling for fear the wto would come in and find that violated free trade
this means that some day the wto may well come to us and regulate the distribution of vitamins and nutritional supplements in this country something that i do not think we should even contemplate
our administration is not too interested in the kyoto protocol but that may well come down the road and the enforcement of the kyoto protocol many believe will be enforced by the wto
i can remember an ad put out in the 1990s when the wto was being promoted and they talked directly it was a full page ad i believe in the new york times
so if you are a believer in big government and world government and you believe in giving up the prerogatives of the congress and not assuming our responsibility i would say go with the wto
but if you believe in freedom if you believe in the constitution and if you really believe in free trade i would say we should vote to get out of the wto
mr speaker there are many reasons to question whether or not the united states should remain in the wto
among them the current trade deficit of 618 billion the disappointing enforcement efforts of the administration on past trade agreements and the lack of consensus in the wto on how to move forward with the doha round
the wto is essentially our only chance to address the major distortions in world agricultural markets
in its 2004 report on agriculture the oecd notes that the producer support estimate for the united states decreased in recent years and that this is a part of a long term trend in us agricultural policy
as the oecd points out support in the us to producers decreased from 25 in 198688 to 18 in 2003 and has remained below the oecd average
europe has increased support to 37 in 2003
the framework agreement provides for harmonization in all three major areas of negotiation
on domestic subsidies the framework states specifically higher levels of permitted tradedistorting domestic support will be subject to deeper cuts in the section of the wto framework agreement on export competition it is agreed that export subsidies will be eliminated
the eu remains the largest user of export subsidies in the world and the elimination of export subsidies will eventually apply additional pressure to its domestic subsidy programs
in the section of the wto framework agreement dealing with market access there is language calling for a tiered formula with deeper cuts in higher tariffs
average us tariffs on agricultural products is 12 versus 30 in europe and 50 in japan
in these negotiations we will depend on our us trade representative to achieve a result that upholds the principle of harmonization that was set out in the original us negotiating position in june of 2000
if that principle is upheld in the final agreement we will be glad we rejected this resolution today
mr speaker i rise in thoughtful support for h j res 27 and i say thoughtful because i believe we should take a good look at what we are doing and what has been proposed and try to figure out what is going to happen in the future and what are the ideas that these decisions are based upon
we are living in a time when a significant number of americans are rushing forward to support any effort to transfer sovereignty from elected officials in the united states to unelected officials elsewhere at a global level who will exercise power and control mandate policies and shape our lives yet they are not elected by the people of the united states of america as if we should expect them in the wto or even the united nations to watch out for our interests
transferring our sovereignty and decisionmaking power to the wto to the united nations or any other international body is not in the longterm interests of our people
the united states did this back in the 1950s or 1940s with the united nations and it too was a dream a dream for a better world a new order that would bring about prosperity and peace
what do we see now in the united nations corruption at the highest levels and arrogance
they themselves have participated in atrocities and yet we see coverup at the united nations and corruption
we will see the wto manipulated by special interests in the same way we have seen other bodies manipulated by special interests but the wto will be made up of organizations that are comprised of governments that do not believe in democracy and honesty and free press and free speech and the standards we believe in
mr speaker 10 years from now as the wto evolves and even today we will find our huge international corporations and international corporations in general going to these bodies and manipulating them and bribing them
so why are we transferring authority putting our faith in an organization even if today in the short run we can see some examples where it might be in our benefit
in the long run it is not to the benefit of the american people to give up this kind of decisionmaking
if we want more trade in the world we should establish bilateral trade agreements with other democratic countries
we should not be establishing superpowerful unelected bodies by the wto to control our destiny in the united states and determine what economic policies we will have in the long run
first of all how do we keep jobs in america
we can address the fact that we tax our businesses and our jobs more than any other country in the world save japan
we have to remember mr speaker that 97 percent of the world s consumers are not in this country
one in five manufacturing jobs are tied to exports
we can not put our head in the sand
since china joined the wto do my colleagues know how many laws we had to change and pass in america to go there
but because they are in the wto because we have the wto we finally have a forum a mechanism a system to bring these countries into compliance to play by the rules
we are the most transparent most honest most basic system in the world
we need other countries to play by the same rules too so we can all join together in growing economic growth here in america and across the world
since we have had china in the wto i have been critical of the administration s stance in its first 3 years
stay in it
mr speaker i rise in opposition to hj res 27 a resolution withdrawing the us approval of the wto
let s not overlook the fact that in the 10 years since the wto s inception we ve seen global tariff rates fall and us exports rise
in the ongoing doha round of trade negotiations the us and our global partners have the opportunity to substantially improve the wto by reaching agreements on service negotiations the reduction of tariffs and nontariff barriers and the authority of the wto dispute resolution system
and although i will be watching the doha round with keen interest i support us participation in the wto and therefore oppose this resolution
but i do think that this resolution that is coming up tomorrow which i strongly support is enormously important because it is high time for the united states congress to take a tough look at our trade policies our membership in the wto
i believe that any objective assessment will tell every member of this body and the american people that our trade policies have failed the american worker the american middle class in a disastrous way and that it is high time to rethink our trade policies so that they begin to work for the middle class of this country and not just the ceos of our major corporations
i find it amazing to hear the gentleman from california mr dreier xz4001150 give his portrayal of what is going on in america and the world
the average american worker is asking why with an explosion of technology with a huge increase in worker productivity why is the average american worker working longer hours for lower wages
why is it that real wages in the united states today are 7 percent lower than they were in 1973 for the bottom 90 percent of american workers
why is it that with all of this globalization and all of this free trade there are few middleclass families in america where women no longer have the option of staying home with their kids but they have got to go into the workforce where people in america are working two jobs and three jobs just to pay the bills
the reality of what is going on in america today is that globalization is not working for ordinary people
in the last 4 years alone in the united states we have lost 28 million goodpaying manufacturing jobs
it is not a good thing when it simply makes the ceos of large corporations even wealthier so that they can earn as much as 500 times what the average american worker in their company makes
and the singular question that we have got to address is does our trade policy work when american workers are being forced to compete against desperate people in countries like china who earn 30 cents an hour
well i think he is going to be disappointed because i think that the results are so clear in terms of what nafta has done for american workers what permanent normal trade relations with china have done for american workers that not only are the american people catching on that cafta will be a continuation of a failed policy i think the american people are demanding that it is time for congress to represent workers and not just the big money interests
the middle class in america will not survive unless we create goodpaying jobs here
the new jobs are going to be in walmart industry in the service industry where people are earning low wages with low benefits
mr speaker let me simply conclude by saying this all of the objective evidence in terms of job loss in terms of the loss of goodpaying jobs in terms of the growing gap between the rich and the poor in america which is now wider than in any other industrialized country on earth wider in the united states than it has been the 1920s all of that suggests that the economy is not working for the middle class
president george bush has not created one new job in the private sector since he has been in office he has lost jobs
all of the new jobs have been created in the government
the wto was signed in 1995 and our current support of unfettered free trade has gone on for some 30 years
in a period in which technology has exploded in a period in which worker productivity has significantly increased we would think that the middle class would be better off
mr speaker in 1995 when the wto was established our trade deficit was 96 billion
mr speaker while some of my colleagues are going to extol all of the wonderful virtues of unfettered free trade perhaps they can explain why in the last 4 years alone we have lost 28 million goodpaying manufacturing jobs one out of six in this country
one out of six in the last 4 years
in my own small state of vermont we have lost 20 percent of our manufacturing jobs in the last 5 years
gm is producing cars in china and there is some reason to fear that in 10 or 20 years detroit and automobile production in this country will be diminished as car manufacturing moves to china
when my friends come up here and they tell us how great free trade is for our economy i want them to explain why real inflation accounted for wages in the united states today is 7 percent lower than they were in 1973 for the bottom 90 percent of workers
and why is it that million of workers today in vermont and throughout this country are forced to work two or three jobs just to keep their heads above water if free trade and globalization are all so great
when my friends talk about the socalled robust economy that has been created perhaps they can explain to us why 4 million more americans now live in poverty than just 4 years ago 4 million more americans in poverty and why incredibly there are 24 000 fewer private sector jobs now than when george bush first took office
according to the institute for international economics 39 percent of the increase in income equality is due to unfettered free trade
further and most ominously if our present trade and economic policies continue the likelihood is that the next generation will be the first in the modern history of the united states to have a lower standard of living than we do
mr speaker the bottom line of this debate and i want my friends to answer this is that american workers should not be asked to compete against desperate people in china who make 30 cents an hour and who go to jail when they stand up for their political rights
that is not what we should be engaged in
mr speaker i yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from ohio mr brown xz4000501 who has been leading this congress in opposition to the disastrous cafta agreement
to begin with at a time when there is so much animosity and partisanship in this body i am very pleased that what we have brought forth together is a true tripartisan effort
if the united states congress said wait a second we are going to pass a law because we think it is unfair that slave labor in china is producing a product that is exported to the united states or that child labor around the world is competing against american workers we will be ruled incorrect by the wto
another issue that has not been touched on today a moral issue which is very important when i was mayor of the city of burlington in the 1980s we passed as did cities throughout the country as did the united states congress legislation which said to the apartheid regime which had then imprisoned nelson mandela we are going to impose trade restrictions against an apartheid regime
mr speaker if that occurred today if the city of burlington vermont the state of vermont the united states congress said we want to bring down economically some type of fascistic government running the country that country would go to the wto and the wto would say gee you are in violation of free trade agreements
yes they have talked about economic growth that is taking place in america but they forgot to tell you who was benefiting from that economic growth
they have forgotten to tell you that for the average american worker his or her wages have gone down significantly in the last 30 years
yes the wealthiest people in this country are making out like bandits
yes there has been a doubling in the gap between the rich and the poor
in my state in the last couple of months i had to talk to workers whose jobs are gone because those companies could not compete against imports coming in from china where workers are paid 30 cents an hour
but we have had this trade agreement we have been in the wto for 10 years
some of us who were here for nafta some of us here for the china agreement we know the millions and millions of dollars in campaign contributions and huge lobbying effort on the part of the large corporations
they are in fact doing very well
i strongly oppose this resolution and urge my members to join me in this opposition
our role in this global body is tremendously important not only for the future of the united states trade but for the continuation of global trade liberalization
continued membership in the world trade organization will allow the united states the opportunity to continue cooperating as we work towards free trade benefiting united states consumers farmers manufacturers and firms
it is tremendously importantly that we remain active in these negotiations and push for a completed doha
i look forward to working with him in the future
finally mr speaker it is my strong view that the united states greatly benefits from our continued participation in the world trade organization
a lot of astounding remarks have been made since i stood up here and introduced this resolution in the negative
how fast is the economy in europe growing
so i can say with all certainty that we have in terms of dollars the fastest growing economy in the world
and when we talk about the loss of jobs in the united states we are not talking about a net loss we are talking about yes there has been some loss of jobs and yes a lot of these jobs have been because of foreign competition yes
but our economy has grown in other areas so it has also created jobs
mr speaker just one moment i think to respond to the gentleman who was just in the well and that is in the 10 years that we have been members of the world trade organization our environmental laws have never been challenged have never been challenged nor will they
mr speaker i would remind the gentleman in the well that of the 50 cases we have brought before the world trade organization we have won 46 which is a 92 percent success rate
i would like to submit for printing in the record a letter dated june 8 2005 which was just yesterday from former president jimmy carter to mr bill thomas the chairman of the ways and means committee in support of cafta
in this letter he says if the united states congress were to turn its back on cafta it would undercut these fragile democracies compel them to retreat to protectionism and make it harder for them to cooperate with the united states
it is very clear to anyone any of the lawmakers in this congress that congress and the president make united states laws
the world trade organization can not change laws either today or in the future
the only sanction for a violation of the world trade organization is that affected world trade organization member and that member country may in some cases impose retaliatory measures on trade of the country that violates the rules
united states exports directly support one in every five manufacturing jobs
workers in most tradeengaged industries where combined exports and imports amount to at least 40 percent of their domestic industrial output earn an annual compensation package that is onethird more than the average compensation in the least tradeengaged sectors
so if you are interested in jobs vote against this resolution
if you are interested in the economy and the growth of our economy of this united states vote against this resolution
if you want chaos in world trade vote for it because that would exactly be what we would have
independent studies indicate that us incomes will rise by over 15 billion and those in central america by some 5 billion
new jobs will be created in central america and labor standards are likely to improve as a result of cafta
some improvements could be made in the trade bill particularly on the labor protection side but more importantly our own national security and hemispheric influence will be enhanced with improved stability democracy and development in our poor fragile neighbors in central america and the caribbean
during my presidency and now at the carter center i have been dedicated to the promotion of democracy and stability in the region
from the negotiation of the panama canal treaties and the championing of human rights at the time when the region suffered under military dictatorships to the monitoring of a number of free elections in the region central america has been a major focus of my attention
there now are democratically elected governments in each of the countries covered by cafta
in negotiating this agreement the president of each of the six nations had to content with their own companies that fear competition with us firms
if the us congress were to turn its back on cafta it would undercut these fragile democracies compel them to retreat to protectionism and make it harder for them to cooperate with the us for the first time ever we have a chance to reinforce democracies in the region
moreover strong economies in the region are the best antidote to illegal immigration from the region
in appreciate your consideration of my views and hope they will be helpful in your important deliberations
those who defend the wto live in a world of theory in which business and consumers will buy american goods if they are good values subject only to the written transparent regulations and tariff laws of their country
this theory is true in the united states where our businesses and consumers are happy to buy
in those countries their written laws are almost irrelevant and so we negotiate hard we open our markets in return for a change of china s written laws and then we are surprised when changing those laws does nothing to open their markets and the average person in china buys less than 3 cents i believe it is of goods and services from america every day
so when an airline in the united states goes to decide which airplane to buy it does so on economic factors
no wonder we have this huge trade deficit and the dollar is certainly in peril
mr speaker i thank the gentleman from florida mr shaw xz4003690 on that clarification because i find it kind of ironic the fact that we are on a fundamental question should the united states continue to belong to the world trade organization or not complaining about degrees of differences in various pieces of trade legislation
that is in fact how we got here in the first place
prior to world war ii in fact many historians argue the reason we got into the great depression as deeply as we did is because the united states chose to throw up significant tariffs and barriers to commercial interaction among nations
the united states was somewhat frustrated one in our dispute resolution mechanism and the problem was we were winning with no substantive result in those disputes
but what is good primarily i think for the united states and the world trade organization restructure from the general agreement on tariffs and trade is that agriculture became one of the points of discussion and importantly for the us services and financial instruments and in the protection of intellectual property rights
these were in essence new additions and we are continuing to try to expand those areas that countries sit down and discuss under a structure
that really is not a difficult decision for most members and overwhelmingly we will agree to stay in the world trade organization when we vote on this particular measure
but let me just select a couple of areas of trade action by the united states in the last several years
now how many trade agreements do you think we would reach if we went to a country and said come on in negotiate with the house and the senate wait until we go through a conference committee in deciding what that agreement is going to be and you ought to agree ahead of time before you see the final product
so one of the reasons we continue to use bilateral countrytocountry relationships and regional agreements in part so that we do not get bogged down by waiting for the wto but also to a certain extent since we believe in transparency since this country is the most open large country of trade import export of any in the world that open markets all over the world are good
normally we can say an opportunity to get into the us marketplace is a pretty good club in which we can get them to agree to various things we want them to agree to
not the case in central america
and when you negotiate freely one of the things you can not do is dictate to other people what it is that they are going to do internally in their country
you can set standards you can cajole you can create a mutual growth structure you can bring money to the table to assist them in moving forward
and the cafta agreement is good for the united states in terms of the economics of getting into the central american marketplace so that we have a little more of a level playing field with other countries around the world
but it also is a chance for these fledgling and growing democracies to have the input of knowledge training and financial assistance in growing their responsible labor structure as well
america needs the opening of markets around the world in voluntary structures whether they be bilateral regional or multinational as the wto is
for the united states to walk away unilaterally from what is the best historical example of nations dealing economically in a meaningful and useful way makes no sense whatsoever
does that resolve any of the ongoing difficulties we have in terms of our perception of the world how fair the world is how open markets in the world are what instruments we need to use to try to push a more transparent and open marketplace between countries among countries and in fact in all trading nations of the world
all of those issues will continue to be before us but they will be before us in a structure which allows us to measure allows us to judge and most importantly allows us to change as the key competitive component between nations of the world today and tomorrow will be the question of trade
and that is why overwhelmingly you will see support staying in the wto nurturing and growing the wto notwithstanding the fact that we have a whole lot of concerns about a whole lot of issues
the 1994 law that helped create the wto included an important provision that allows congress to reassess us participation in the organization every five years
the constantly shifting global trade landscape makes regular congressional review of us participation in the wto especially critical
but retaining us participation in the wto does nt mean we ca nt or should nt work to improve global trading system
if we were to withdraw from the wto other countries could impose unfair tariffs or other barriers to american goods or dump goods and we could only retaliate in return and risk getting into a potentially dangerous trade war
mr speaker in 1994 i supported the establishment of the wto
who is in charge
worse the wto struck down steel safeguards that were put in place after record levels of illegal steel dumping caused more than 40 steel companies into bankruptcy and more than 50 000 steel workers to lose their jobs
in 1994 the last full year before the wto came into existence the united states had a trade deficit unfortunately of about 150 billion
as we debate this resolution today we will borrow an additional 17 billion in these 24 hours for our children to pay off for the rest of their lives just to finance the trade deficit we are accumulating today under the wanted wto
other countries have also seen their domestic laws challenged in order to expand corporate power
wto rules support corporations to move their operations from one country to another in search of the cheapest labor and the least government regulation
if workers in that country organize a labor union the corporation can move the factory to a third country
many corporations prefer to operate in countries such as the people s republic of china which outlaw independent labor organizations
in the 10 years since the wto was established a wide variety of us and foreign laws have been challenged
but look what they did in south africa
in 42 out of the 48 completed cases brought against the united states the wto has labeled us laws illegal
and when the wto ruled in favor of the united states in a case on bananas it was to benefit who
we do not produce any bananas here in the united states
we protected chiquita who mistreats its workers in central america and we put small caribbean farmers out of work
mr chairman i am not opposed to the amendment and i ask unanimous consent to claim the time in opposition
this restriction will remain in place until iran allows full access to its nuclearrelated facilities by iaea inspectors has fully implemented iaea s additional protocol and has completely ended all nuclear enrichment programs
this not only puts israel the only democracy in the middle east in danger but can be used to attack us bases in the region
faced with the reality of a radical iran with nuclear weapons other countries in the region might feel compelled to develop their own nuclear capability to maintain an awful balance of power
in 2003 iran admitted that it had a laser uranium enrichment program not previously disclosed
in it iran admits to experimenting with and producing plutonium
because he is not on the floor at this point i am not going to take this opportunity i will have many more to express in some detail my affection my respect and my admiration for the chairman of our committee who sponsors this bill and who has announced his intent not to seek reelection to the next congress
but once in a while in the course of both of our tenures here i have had occasion to oppose an initiative and in this case i do so very strongly
on the surface this may look like a partisan conflict but in reality it is not
based on the failure to implement five reforms by the effective date of this bill the day after this bill is signed into law and those reforms are much needed i think they are on the way to happening i do not quarrel with any of them in fact i think they are compelling in their nature this bill mandates the president of the united states to instruct our ambassador to the united nations to veto any new or the expansion of any existing peacekeeping operation
in other words the congress steps in usurps the executive branch function of formulating foreign policy in exercising its discretion on what its appointee will do in the end without regard to us national interests and in direct violation of executive branch prerogatives
for the chairman of this committee to sponsor a bill that does something like that is i would suggest quite out of character because there is no one in this house who has made a stronger point in his career of trying to ensure that the president s power as commander in chief and implementer of foreign policy is maintained
peacekeeping operation the problems with china or russia in the context of darfur are overcome and there is a consensus for a new augmented operation there involving african countries involving european countries perhaps with no commitment whatsoever from the united states for such an operation
why would we want to mandate something that is fraught with constitutional problems and does a disservice to our national interest in such legislation
i just want to respond to what i think was an inadvertent misstatement by the gentleman from indiana on what i think is an overthetop provision of this bill requiring a veto of any new or expanded peacekeeping operations in the security council
the genocide in darfur continues no matter what the political will is of the body because we have only trained 60 000 of the 68 000 peacekeepers by the day this bill passes
this has to do with define our own national interests in the name of i do not know what
his amendment says that nothing in this title this title that the gentleman from illinois chairman hyde has brought to us should be construed to supersede the uniform code of military justice or surrender us officials to a foreign country or international tribunal
mr chairman would it be fair to say that in effect his effort is an effort to gild the lily
this resolution waives all points of order against consideration of the bill hr 2745 the henry j hyde united nations reform act of 2005 and provides a structured rule for consideration of 28 different amendments including an amendment in the nature of a substitute offered by the minority
the rule provides for the offering of the 28 specified amendments according to subject areas as designated in the text of the resolution and with a cumulative total of an hour and 40 minutes of general debate to be divided equally by the chairman and ranking minority member of the committee on international relations
madam speaker i am pleased to stand before the house today in strong support of this rule and the underlying legislation hr 2745 the henry j hyde united nations reform act of 2005
madam speaker with 28 amendments in order to poorly paraphrase winston churchill never will so much be said by so many about so little in this case just a single subject act
it is fitting though madam speaker that this bill be named after our esteemed colleague to my right the gentleman from illinois chairman hyde who has served and is serving with such distinction and integrity and has been a stalwart in these halls for the past 30 years
i commend also the gentleman from california mr lantos xz4002310 the ranking member as well for the longstanding cooperation and dedication to bipartisanship in the area of us policy and diplomacy which is evident in many important aspects of this legislation
in fact madam speaker when these two distinguished gentlemen were testifying before the committee on rules on this bill i was struck by the fact that the house and indeed the entire nation is the beneficiary of decades worth of their collective wisdom and firsthand experience
this bill is unusual in the bipartisan unity of the content
when it comes to the issue of united nations reform i was also impressed that both gentlemen the gentleman from illinois chairman hyde and the gentleman from california ranking member lantos seemed to be of one mind when it relates to the necessity for reforms in the wake of continued scandals within various united nations functions
there was also a unique bipartisan unity in supporting the need for a penalty to follow failure of reform
to put it in a nutshell madam speaker this legislation is long overdue
there are indeed precedents for what we are trying to do both in the 1980s and 1990s when actions by congress ensured change within the united nations
it is regrettable that the united nations would not undertake to clean up its own act in the wake of the oilforfood scandal irregularities in the accounting and uses of its funds misconduct by entrenched un
we all witnessed the appalling lack of resolve and consistency in the un
when i am at home in my district some of my constituents will say to me that we ought to pull out of the united nations entirely
in conclusion madam speaker this rule is a good and fair rule
it made every single amendment in order all 28 which were filed before the committee on rules
in short the only complaint that one may have with this rule is that is may be somewhat parsimonious in its general debate and we will provide in those 28 amendments a long and wideranging debate of all of these important issues
in fact this is not necessarily unprecedented
the kassebaumsolomon amendment in 1985 asked for change and meaningful change took place
in 1994 we insisted on an oversight committee and an oversight committee took place
this bill is keeping a tradition that is historical going back for at least 20 years in this body
once again i point out that in 1985 1994 and 1999 this house set precedent by doing the exact same concept that is there
and it is true that maybe i have heard a new concept here that i do not need to make all ten commandments to get to heaven but i also know that when i was in my classroom and i put high standards and high expectations my kids met those standards and if i wavered then they wavered at the same time
mr speaker i believe we will do those in the order that they appeared starting on tuesday
i would say in response that interestingly the discussion on that bill it is an important discussion is largely between the new director of national intelligence and the armed services chairman because of some commitments that seemed to have been made and i think were made during the adoption of the 911 bill of things that would be included in this bill
it involves military intelligence and some commitments and discussions that were conducted last year before we moved forward with what was called at that time the 911 bill that created the national intelligence director s job and did a number of other things to achieve those goals that the whip just mentioned in terms of securing our country in every way that we can
but also we are eager to be sure that whatever commitments were made and were reached between the administration and the chairman of a significant committee in the house are fully understood and fully complied with
you know there can be misunderstandings in these kind of discussions certainly but we want to be sure that any commitments made by the administration to the congress and the chairman of its significant committees are fulfilled and if there are misunderstandings to be sure that those misunderstandings are worked out before we move forward
i assure the gentleman that we will be encouraging in that discussion and facilitating it in every way that we can so that it moves forward at the quickest possible time
mr chairman i rise today in strong support and appreciation really of both of our leaders on this bill the gentleman from california mr lantos xz4002310 and i am particularly pleased to see this bill named in appreciation and recognition of the great leadership of our committee on international relations chairman the gentleman from illinois mr hyde xz4001920
certainly today united states troops are deployed around the world as they defend our freedoms and as they assist others in defending their freedom
in iraq and afghanistan they are working tirelessly to create a secure environment for fledgling democracies
in kosovo they observe an uneasy peace among old adversaries and in japan and europe they stand to react to any national crisis
in addition our naval personnel operate in dozens of bases worldwide to protect global trade routes prevent nuclear proliferation and many other important tasks
and even as they perform these actions in defense of liberty in other nations our troops serve the united states of america not the united nations or any other foreign power
their mission may send them abroad but we must never allow a foreign court to interfere in us military affairs
under no circumstances should our men and women in uniform fear retribution in the form of prosecution by a foreign court of justice
i appreciate his bringing this amendment to the floor and i am pleased to see it included in a bill that i hope is heartily responded to by support today
i rise today to offer an amendment that would give the united nations greater flexibility in the peacekeeping operations that they are involved in by allowing voluntary military personnel to serve at the department of peacekeeping operations in new york
they had expertise in mission planning logistics all of the things that are so important in these types of missions
as a member of the committee on international relations i frequently hear of the problems that we have with peacekeeping the atrocities in various parts of the world
this would be a mechanism where in fact i think we could save a great deal of money by being much more efficient
the other thing that is important is that in no way does this require our department of defense to assign any us military personnel
he showed pictures of these guys sneaking out at night to a village again to do their work and showed a picture of a guy riding around in a un
there has never been a finer member of congress in the history of the republic than the gentleman from illinois
he was one of the most eloquent speakers i have ever known in this house
we now are finding memos where he talked to the people in the oil industry saying that he would give them unqualified support
but the fact of the matter is they are not listening in many cases and the corruption goes on and on and on the mismanagement goes on and on and on and nothing changes
and the united states keeps pouring in 25 percent or almost that much of the funds out of the taxpayers pockets in this country for that body
mr speaker the gentleman from california mr lantos xz4002310 is one of my dearest friends in this place and the gentleman from massachusetts is not a bad friend either
there must be something in the water in massachusetts
it would authorize the state department s bureau of international narcotics and law enforcement to acquire and transfer to the colombian navy two tactical unpressurized dc3 maritime patrol aircraft to carry out drug interdiction operations in or near the coastal waters of colombia
we were down in colombia not too long ago and when we were done there our ambassador and the people who were working for the colombian military and the colombian national police indicated to us that they needed additional aircraft to be able to interdict drug trafficking that is starting in colombia and ending in the united states of america
these two aircraft i think will help in the fight against drug interdiction
mr chairman our government is being forced to give financial support to corporations we normally would exclude because of our membership in the united nations and where our dues are spent
the epls identifies those who are deemed corrupt or untrustworthy or even those involved in terrorist activities like the islamic jihad and hezbollah
the release this week of the oilforfood contractor cotecna calling into question kofi annan s claim that he was unaware of cotecna s bid for a contract in 1998 is just the latest in a long stream of ethical blunders
as a bipartisan report featured in yesterday s wall street journal stated until and unless it changes dramatically the united nations will remain an uncertain instrument both for the governments that comprise it and for those that look to it for salvation it is only logical that the same restrictions we place upon on our federal agencies be applied to the money we give to the un
mr chairman i rise today in support of this amendment to increase the ability of the united states to protect our world from the spread of nuclear weapons to dangerous governments
despite this obligation iran has continued to pursue the development of nuclear capability in the dark without transparency
he is an icon of this institution and i for one know i am joined by every member of this house in thanking him for his leadership on this bill and the number of other measures that he has worked on and done such a tremendous job with
i am proud to be here in support of the henry j hyde un
reform bill and i know my colleagues join me in thanking the gentleman from illinois chairman hyde for all that he does
in paraphrasing a wellknown phrase i would like to just say mr chairman i sleep better every night knowing that henry hyde is here fighting for america
madam chairman i want to bring up two provisions that are in this authorization bill that relate to the work of our helsinki commission
i work with him as the ranking democrat and over the last several years we have raised priorities for the organization for security and cooperation in europe through our helsinki commission and i am very pleased that this authorization bill carries out those priorities
first let me point out that the bill authorizes 225 000 annually for the organization for security and cooperation in europe s office of democratic institutions and human rights and 125 000 annually for general religious freedom programs that are administered by the osce office of democratic institutions and human rights
this carries out a commitment that our commission brought forward in fighting antisemitism and developing international meetings to deal with strategies to combat antisemitism
i must point out that although we have made progress there is a lot more that needs to be done and i am confident that by this authorization we will have the tools at least in our country to see to the implementation of these commitments
in the last congress i was pleased to join with the gentleman from california mr lantos xz4002310 and the gentleman from new jersey mr smith xz4003801 helsinki commission chairman in working to enact the global antisemitism review act of 2004
so i want to commend the chairman and the ranking member for authorizing resources in this bill to deal with that
the second point i would just mention very briefly is the fact of expressing concern about restitution of property taken during the nazi era in poland
i appreciate that also being included in this legislation
mr chairman i rise with great respect for both the gentleman from illinois mr hyde xz4001920 and the gentleman from california mr lantos xz4002310 in this
under the lantosshays substitute we can send the same message to the international community without undermining our efforts to promote democracy and protect those in need
mr chairman i rise in support of the lantosshays substitute
and hope this debate will trigger reforms in the functioning of this embattled yet wellmeaning organization
the lantosshays substitute reflects the significant reforms outlined in the chairman s bill
however it makes an all important distinction in rightly leaving the secretary of state with the discretion to decide when and if the ultimatums are a hindrance to our national interests
under the lantosshays substitute we can send the same message to the international community without undermining our efforts to promote democracy and protect those in need
i thank the gentleman for yielding me this time madam speaker and i rise in strong support of this rule
in fact if you take the top three countries they contribute over half the dues and yet everybody has the same vote on budgetary matters
and at the time to decide how to spend it the four kids get up and say this is what we want to do this is where we want to go on our vacation this is what hotel we want to stay in
one of the reforms in this act would say that when you vote on budgetary matters then you weight those votes
that would do two things number one it would mean that the countries that contribute the most money would have more leverage in making sure that the money gets spent where it is supposed to be spent and in making sure that they get the results they want to get
to put that in perspective a lot of multibillion dollar corporations do not have that many employees
there is no doubt in my mind that the time is now for reform at the un
amid charges of cronyism corruption and financial scandal in recent months the relevance and reputation of the united nations has deteriorated drastically
appears to engage in antiamerican sentiment for sport promoting it around the globe
this is a true slap in the face to the united states
the state department said the us paid nearly 39 billion in contributions to the un
system in 2004
let me put that in perspective 43 000 workers is more than five times more the total employed by ebay a company worth almost 52 billion
madam chairman i rise today in strong support of the foreign relations authorization act
i would also like to give my sincerest thanks to all the staff of the committee who have worked so hard to make sure that all the members of this committee had an opportunity to way in on the bill to make improvements that were important to us
the committee has worked with me and my staff to make sure that language was included which expresses the sense of congress that the president of the united states and the secretary of state should engage in an open dialogue with the government of poland to achieve a final and complete settlement for individuals and groups who had their private property seized by the nazis during world war ii or by the communist polish government after the war
this clause calls on the president of the united states and the secretary of state to engage in an open dialogue with the government of poland and work with them to ensure that restitution legislation is implemented
we are now in june of 2005 and limited action has been taken to resolve this situation
another initiative that was included was regarding language to create a report on what the united states is doing to assist our friend and ally israel in their efforts to establish diplomatic relations
as i m sure many of my colleagues in this committee are aware that a number of nations have not established full diplomatic relations with the state of israel
in order for israel to be a full member of the world community it must establish diplomatic relations
another issue i worked on was the inclusion of a sense of congress on the need for an additional consular post in southern india
these two organizations have a long history of successfully developing peopletopeople exchanges that encourage reconciliation and conflict resolution in northern ireland
for over a decade there has been a sustained bipartisan national policy to support ongoing efforts to end the civil conflict in the north of ireland
while the latest efforts to restore power sharing have fallen short and the political process is at a standstill i believe that the united states must remain engaged in northern ireland at all levels to encourage peace and reconciliation
by convening a new class of 500 women each year in a supportive nonsectarian intellectually rich and rigorous academic environment the university eventually will generate a network of women professionals who will drive the development and enrichment of their countries and the region
war is not the only way to fight terrorism the education of women is one way of stopping the breeding of hate in the children around the world
finally on the issue of iraq i was able to include by a bipartisan vote language calling on the president to put forth a plan for success in iraq
by accomplishing these tasks the united states would be taking a realistic and viable approach to longer term success in iraq
presumably they were in agreement with the eight former us ambassadors to the united nations both republican and democrat who stated yesterday in a letter to the congressional leadership and i would ask my colleagues to pay close attention to this particular excerpt withholding us dues to the united nations may sound like smart policy but would be counterproductive
it would place in jeopardy the reform initiatives most important to us interests remember these are americans who represented our nation at the united nations
yes madam speaker i am optimistic that reform will occur but it will not happen as a result of this bill it will happen in spite of this bill
if it were a thoughtful effort to effect change why did the committee proceed before the gingrichmitchell task force that we created and funded back in december even made its recommendations
i recognize that some a few on the other side honestly believe we should end any participation any us participation in the united nations
they prefer to go it alone but they forget that without the united nations it would fall on us to do much of what the united nations is doing on the planet today and that the united nations has supported the united states in some of our critical foreign policy needs
it was the united nations that organized and ran the elections in iraq and in afghanistan and played a critical role in forcing the syrian withdrawal from lebanon
in other words if you do not play the game according to our rules we will take our ball and go home
such antiamerican sentiments can increase foreign public support for terrorism directed against the united states impact the cost and effectiveness of military operations weaken the united states ability to align with other nations in pursuit of common policy objectives and dampen foreign publics enthusiasm for us business services and products that is a quote from our own gao
they run the daytoday affairs of the united nations but it is the member states that set policy that make decisions that are responsible for oversight in implementation of the united nations resolutions
in particular it is the function of the security council to carry out those responsibilities
the gingrichmitchell report put it this way and i am quoting too often the phrase the united nations failed should actually read members of the united nations blocked or undermined action by the united nations an excellent example of this concept is the sanctions against iraq in the oilforfood program
the united states advocated for the sanctions on iraq in the aftermath of the gulf war and then supported the oilforfood program advocated for it but it was the security council not some amorphous united nations somewhere up in new york that had the responsibility to oversee the oilforfood program and the sanction regime
but when jordan and turkey notified the security council that they intended to purchase oil from iraq in direct violation of the sanctions regime the security council simply took notice whatever that means
this chart next to me shows that the socalled trade protocols generated over 8 billion in revenue for saddam hussein
it is important to note it was the security council that approved all prices on oil exports from iraq and every contract needed their approval for humanitarian goods coming into iraq and yet when the secretariat brought 71 contracts to the attention of the security council because of concerns of pricing irregularities the security council did nothing did nothing and saddam profited and stayed in power as a result
because the security council including our own government and there was two administrations involved both the clinton and the bush administration reached a political decision that it was not in their interests to fully enforce the sanctions
what is ultimately required is improving the way member states work together and some level of transparency in the internal workings of the security council not unilaterally withholding dues
it would place in jeopardy the reform initiatives that we embrace
we have received information back that that cooperation is in fact occurring and he has publicly stated without equivocation that there will be no immunity for members of the united nations
while the united nations clearly needs our leadership we also need the united nations particularly in the area of peacekeeping
just imagine if you will the cost to the united states in terms of dollars and blood if americans were required to fill those roles
there are 6 700 united nations troops in haiti today along with 1 400 un
this is nationbuilding for real that hopefully will transpire in haiti
not only would we have to commit us troops to restore order we might have to deal with a humanitarian crisis that could very well compel us to use guantanamo for something significantly different from its current use much like we did in the early 1990s when it was a refugee center for haitians who were fleeing from their country in makeshift crafts and dying by the thousands
mr chairman i thank the gentleman for yielding and i support him in his opposition
i point out that the nation of colombia for whom we have provided billions of dollars in terms of dealing with the interdiction and eradication of drugs would fall because they vote against us 90 percent of the time
i rise in strong support of the kline amendment and thank the gentleman from minnesota for offering it today
no one in this body knows better than the gentleman from minnesota the paramount and absolute need to protect with every tool at our disposal our men and women in uniform
the gentleman from minnesota s amendment today does just that by expressly stating in this long overdue united nations reform package that all of the reforms we will pass augment and in no way change the federal law that exempts our troops from prosecution in the international criminal court
the icc would in effect disregard not only federal and state law but also the uniform code of military conduct thereby establishing a rogue court in which foreign judges can indict try and convict american troops for broadly defined and openly interpreted crimes all without any of the fundamental legal rights guaranteed by the united states constitution
we do not cooperate in any of its proceedings or pretenses and we do not recognize its authority over any action undertaken by a single citizen of this nation
the icc on the contrary could be an instrument of undemocratic scoresettling a shadowy kangaroo court in which despots and their diplomats can humiliate and even imprison the men and women who have the courage to do the work the un
no one has greater respect for him in this body than i do
but in this case mr chairman i think and i believe that the lantos substitute just falls a little short
six decades ago the united nations was formed to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights in the dignity and worth of the human person in the equal rights of men and women and of nations large and small and to establish conditions under which justice and respect for the obligations arising from treaties and other sources of international law can be maintained and to promote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom
far from reaffirming faith and fundamental rights and the dignity of the human person the united nations has overseen the degradation of human rights even of vulnerable human beings in its own care through routine abuses of power corruption and even horrific sexual exploitation of peoples at the hands of un
far from reaffirming faith in the equal rights of nations large and small the un
far from promoting justice and respect for international law the united nations has become one of the world s greatest apologists for tyranny and terror where justice is merely one point of view a place where sudan and syria and castro s cuba are given a soapbox on which to lecture the free world on human rights a place where international lawyers scheme to haul american soldiers before a rogue court irrespective of constitutional rights a place where an international humanitarian mission to feed and heal the iraqi people resulted in 10 billion in siphoned bribes and kickbacks
and far from promoting social progress and the better standards of life in larger freedom the united nations has become a hindrance to both progress and freedom
and as long as tyrants and terrorists get as much say in policymaking as democratically elected leaders the un
the un s corruption is so breathtaking in its scope as to be almost universal peacekeepers raping women that they are sent to protect sexual exploitation of children at the hands of their humanitarian relief workers institutional antisemitism so brazen that yasser arafat was considered a moderate 10 billion what further evidence could we possibly need
and in response to the overwhelming evidencing the democrat substitute says the reforms in the underlying bill should happen
the president leads foreign policy in this country not the secretary of state
and as he has so many times in his decades with us the gentleman from illinois has shown us the way
our government must be prepared to stabilize where we can and reconstruct what we must in order to prevent a devastating vacuum of lawlessness from developing which allows terrorists and rogue leaders to flourish
the president and congress have already taken a strong first step in addressing this challenge
the amendment also will expand the use of civilian volunteers from outside the government who have the right talents and are willing to serve in stabilization reconstruction missions overseas
i am gratified to have the support as i said of the chairman and ranking minority member of the committee and i ask my colleagues to join with us in support of this effort
he has helped us modify the language in the measure and he represents the navy postgraduate school very very well
and we look forward to seeing the success of this program due in large part to his efforts
plays in world affairs
hr 2745 will hamstring the us s ability to create positive reform within the un tarnish the image of the us abroad when public opinion of the us particularly in the arab countries where is at an all time low and defeat the administration s public diplomacy efforts before karen hughes even assumes her new responsibilities in september
in fact many of the peacekeeping reforms contained in the hyde bill are endorsed by the un
department of peacekeeping operations and in most cases are already underway to address recent concerns raised about sexual exploitation and abuse in peacekeeping missions
we do nt want to put ourselves in a position where the united states is withholding 50 percent of the american contributions to the un
if reform measures are nt implemented in a timely manner
the united states as the world leader must take an active positive role in helping reform the un
the lantosshays substitute is the step in the right direction for us reform efforts and i will vote in favor of this substitute and against the un
i too rise madam chairman in strong support of the dreier amendment
i as many of my colleagues know was a peace corps volunteer in south america and as a returned peace corps volunteer elected to congress i realized that what we needed was some activity in this country that would start educating people somewhere between the peace corps and the work corps
as the ranking member just mentioned we have countries where we have been in with the military but it is the ability to respond to the postconflict issues that we need a fematype a responsetype corps of people who are linguistically capable of speaking that language that know the country culture can work with the nongovernmental organizations that are abroad with military personnel that are still in the country with the host country governments with our united states usaid with our united states department of state
and where i am very pleased that the first one of these activities is going to take place at the naval postgraduate school on august 1 with ambassador pascual coming out to california where for the first time the military the civilians the state department and so on will all be together in developing this
before i begin let me just use this opportunity to extend my appreciation to the chairman for his work in so many different areas important and vital to the people of this country but right now at the issue at hand before us an area that is of utmost importance to the constituents in my district as well as the citizens of this nation and the world community as well
also let me take this opportunity to express my appreciation to the chairman s staff as well for their efficiency in bringing these matters to the floor and their cooperation in working with our offices in order to proceed along on these matters
buildings in geneva switzerland
in return the construction company mr wilson xz4004342 represented was to be awarded the construction contract for this renovation work
in fact mr wilson xz4004342 helped get kojo a job at cotecna a swissbased inspection firm
in fact the volcker commission appointed by kofi annan to investigate the oilforfood scandal in their second interim report that came out this spring came out and stated there is no evidence that the selection of cotecna in 1998 was subject to any affirmative or improper influence of the secretary general in the bidding or selection process however just this week a memo obtained from mr wilson xz4004342 around the time that the oilforfood inspection contract was being decided stated we had brief discussions with the secretarygeneral
we could count on their support now the volcker commission only now is hastily reevaluating its initial findings in light of this new evidence and kofi annan as suspected is dodging questions and hiding now behind the commission
in order to provide a full accounting of any illicit dealings to the american taxpayer the united states must continue its aggressive investigation and my amendment will further that goal
even real estate magnet donald trump states in speaking about the proposal in new york city about their planned expansion of their headquarters the united nations is a mess and they are spending hundreds of millions of dollars unnecessarily on this project if donald trump says they are wasting millions of dollars i can only imagine what the average american taxpayer s view must be on the un
this amendment is a bold step i believe in slicing away one more slice of the onion another layer to reveal the full account of any illicit dealings at the un
i gather that he would agree that it is bipartisan when nicholas burns and alcee hastings and other democrats and this administration join in opposing this measure
in my opinion this bill takes a shortsighted approach to reforming the united nations
there are decent necessary and desirable provisions in this legislation but madam speaker this bill takes wellthoughtout ideas and pushes them far into the realm of demagoguery demonstrating a contempt for the united nations that is entirely unfounded
the draconian requirements of the underlying legislation will affect everything from the promotion of human rights in the organization to the inclusion of mandatory sunset provisions for all new un
the most shortsighted of the bill s provisions would require a mandatory withholding of peacekeeping funds unless the requirements in this legislation are met
the secretary herself told a group here in the capitol day before yesterday that the bush administration is not supporting the mandatory withholdings contained in this bill
thanks to the bush administration the united states international reputation as a peaceloving nation is in tatters
everyone in this body realizes that the united nations is not a perfect organization but on balance the united nations has been and will continue to be good for america on a range of global issues
let us not forget the thousands of united nations personnel who risked their lives in iraq and afghanistan to bring about successful and free elections in those countries or the role of the un
in effecting the withdrawal of syrian military forces from lebanon
in march of 2005 secretarygeneral annan released a string of initiatives to combat terrorism proposals that the united states government has openly supported
and in the sudan the un
how many have been made better through development assistance cultural programs and advances in education
eleanor roosevelt our country s first representative to the united nations remarked do what you feel in your heart to be right for you will be criticized anyway it may be that the united states will still be criticized even if we adopt the substitute and these reforms are pushed through
it includes virtually all of the reforms in hr 2745 with one crucial difference
when i made my references i was referring to the bush administration and not to the distinguished chairman and other members in the body
mr speaker i want to join in wholehearted endorsement in echoing of all of the words of praise that have been directed toward the distinguished chairman of the committee on international relations
i have known the gentleman from illinois chairman hyde to not only be gentlemanly and eloquent but fairminded and bipartisan in a substantial number of efforts and i like all of our colleagues here deeply appreciate the work that he has done on behalf of this nation and indeed this world throughout the course of his career and i compliment him in that regard
i also accept the chastisement of the distinguished chair with reference to rhetoric but i would urge that some of the rhetoric that i may have used is rhetoric that i learned here in the house of representatives that has been used on both sides of the aisle much too often in my judgment
i further quote him in saying that it is more important to press for structural reforms
the gentleman from illinois chairman hyde the gentleman from california mr lantos xz4002310 my good friend the distinguished ranking member the gentleman from connecticut mr shays xz4003700 his colleague in filing this measure all of the members of the committee on international relations indeed all the members of this body recognize that the united nations has problems
but if we are in the business of using this as precedent then we would not want to establish a precedent where using the hammer as the gentleman from indiana referred to the monetary withholding as being the hammer to cause let me give the members the analogy by way of an exact example
i happen to be the president of the parliamentary assembly of the organization for security and cooperation in europe
it is the first time that an american has been the president and we are holding the assembly s conference here in washington dc and i thank the speaker of the house and the majority leader of the senate for the extraordinary effort that they have put in allowing that this assembly be undertaken in appropriate fashion in a bipartisan way
and we agree even today that transparency and accountability in that organization is critical
but russia said that unless the united states paid more dues interestingly enough in this particular instance and that they paid less dues and that reform measures that they were seeking were implemented that they would withhold their dues from the osce
it is not going to stop the assembly from taking place here in washington dc july 1 through july 5 but what it did was that threat caused turmoil inside the organization that is in need of reform and i think we run into the same kind of measure here in this particular proposal
thomas pickering and bill richardson and donald mchenry and andrew young all eight of these individuals were people that served as our ambassadors under republican and democratic administrations to the united nations and during that entire period of time each of them in their own way contributed to meaningful reform
mr speaker can the gentleman tell us with respect to the appropriations bills which day of the week tuesday and thereafter you might expect each of the individual bills to come up in particular
it may be helpful to know that i believe on our side of the aisle we believe that the gentleman from michigan mr hoekstra xz4001820 and the gentlewoman from california ms harman s agreement was appropriate in the sense that the flexibility be given to the national intelligence director to provide for the best possible personnel assignment with reference to maintaining our security and intelligence apparatus in the most effective mode would be correct if that is of any help to the whip as he considers the support that that proposition may have on the floor
i would hope that the majority would take steps to perhaps discuss in a bipartisan way the implementation of the existing rules which we believe as you know require a majority vote for the hiring of a staff director
i would hope that in the near term next week and the days thereafter that we would work together to try to get this moving forward
reclaiming my time i thank the gentleman and i have no doubt about his sincerity in that desire
both sides apparently believe that they are correct in their interpretation but hopefully both sides want a bipartisan and not a partisan staff to proceed with its work
but i think the gentleman is correct it would not resolve it any more than the vote on the rules in january resolved the changing of the rules and the feeling that they were not appropriate to provide the context in which we could proceed
none of those inflammatory terms in my judgment apply to this debate
is in desperate need of reform
peacekeepers have sexually abused children in bosnia the congo sierra leone and other places and the culture of concealment makes rudimentary oversight virtually impossible
a casual attitude towards conflictofinterest rules undermines trust in the un s basic governance
what leverage do we have to bring about change in how this institution operates
trust in gradual change has been interpreted as indifference a very expensive indifference
so the time has finally come when we must in good conscience say enough enough to allowing odious regimes such as cuba sudan and zimbabwe to masquerade as arbiters of human rights
very few are opposed to the un s role in facilitating diplomacy mediating disputes monitoring the peace and feeding the hungry
in the united states the recognition of need for change is widely shared and bipartisan
members on both sides of the aisle in congress agree that the time has come for farreaching reform
i have heard no arguments in favor of maintaining the status quo
the key difference the allimportant difference between their proposals and the one we have put forward lies in the methods to be used to accomplish that universally desired goal
in an effort to derail this legislation it has been proposed that we hand to the secretary of state the power to selectively withhold funds from the un
as a means of inspiring a cooperative attitude in the organization
i certainly mean no disrespect for the current secretary whom i hold in the highest esteem but the power of the purse belongs to congress and is not delegable no matter who holds that high office
for there can be no doubt that any proposal resting upon discretionary decisions concedes in advance that any reform will be fragmentary at best if there is any at all
we are in a peculiar situation
opponents of change cloak themselves in the robes of defenders of the un when it is in fact they who would condemn it to irrelevance
mr chairman i ask unanimous consent that i be allowed to claim the time in opposition
the spirit in which it is offered is exemplary and it is a very difficult thing to oppose it
but i congratulate him and the spirit in which his good amendment was offered but i hope it is not accepted in its present form
mr chairman i claim the time in opposition and i yield myself such time as i may consume
mr chairman i claim the time in opposition to the amendment
now this notion that we are obliged by the treaty to pay our dues and that it would be an international default if we did not that was argued before back in the 1980s
it is not only in our interest
the bill includes several requests from the administration which are oriented toward improving the operations of the department or the quality of life for those serving in our embassies in missions abroad
the bill states that us national interests would be advanced by a stronger international atomic energy agency including and ensuring that the delay in the us annual payment is corrected along with various other recommendations
public diplomacy activities are fully supported in this bill
while we support the traditional methods of reaching foreign audiences we strongly urge state to be creative in finding the most effective program mix for any given country
in closing this bill reflects contributions of the administration as well as the republican and democratic members of the committee on international relations
in the interest of permitting this committee to proceed expeditiously to the floor consideration of this bill i request your committee waive its right to sequential referral on this matter
i understand that such a waiver only applies to this language in this bill and not to the underlying subject matter
chairman in recognition of the importance of expediting the passage of hr 2061 authorizing appropriations for the department of state for fiscal year 2006 and 2007 the permanent select committee on intelligence hereby waives further consideration of the bill
the committee has jurisdictional interests in hr 2061 including intelligence and intelligencerelated authorizations and provisions contained in the bill in particular amendments relating to section 140 of the foreign relations authorization act for fiscal years 1988 and 1989
the committee takes this action only with the understanding that this procedural route should not be construed to prejudice the house permanent select committee on intelligence s jurisdictional interest over this bill or any similar bill and will not be considered as precedent for consideration of matters of jurisdictional interest to the committee in the future
in addition the permanent select committee on intelligence will seek conferees on any provisions of the bill that are within its jurisdiction during any housesenate conference that may be convened on this legislation
finally i would ask that you include a copy of our exchange of letters on this matter in the congressional record during the house debate on hr 2061
assistance for demobilization and disarmament of former irregular combatants in colombia and section 1125
stability and security in iraq
in the interest of permitting this committee to proceed expeditiously to floor consideration of this bill i request that the committee on armed services waive its right to sequential referral on this matter
i understand that such a waiver only applies to this language in this bill and not to the underlying subject matter
assistance for demobilization and disarmament of former irregular combatants in colombia and section 1125
stability and security in iraq
knowing of your interest in expediting this legislation i will waive consideration of hr 2601 by the committee on armed services
in addition in the event of a conference with the senate on this matter the committee on armed services reserves the right to seek the appointment of conferees
please include this letter in your committee s report on hr 2601 or introduce it into the congressional record during consideration of the measure on the house floor
thank you for the cooperative spirit in which you have worked regarding this matter and others between our respective committees
chairman thank you for your recent letter expressing the jurisdictional interest of the committee on homeland security in sections 712 732 and 1002 of hr 2601 the foreign relations authorization act for fiscal years 2006 and 2007 i appreciate your willingness to not seek a sequential referral in order to expedite proceedings on this legislation
in addition i agree to support your request for conferees during the housesenate conference to consider provisions within your committee s jurisdiction
dear chairman hyde i am writing to you concerning the jurisdictional interest of the committee on homeland security in hr 2601 the foreign relations authorization act for fiscal years 2006 and 2007 the bill contains provisions that fall within the jurisdiction of the committee on homeland security including section 712 which involves the participation of the secretary of the department of homeland security on a strategic export control board section 732 involving a report certifying exempt weapons imports along the northern border and section 1002 which provides for an interagency process for compilation of an annual report on patterns of global terrorism
recognizing your interest in bringing the legislation before the house without delay the committee on homeland security agrees not to request a sequential referral of the bill
the committee also reserves its right to seek conferees for any provisions within its jurisdiction considered in the housesenate conference and asks for your support in being accorded such conferees
in the interest of permitting this committee to proceed expeditiously to the floor consideration of this bill i request that the committee on the judiciary waive its right to sequential referral on this matter
i understand that such a waiver only applies to this language in this bill and not to the underlying subject matter
chairman thank you for your letter concerning hr 2601 to authorize appropriations for the department of state for fiscal years 2006 and 2007 and for other purposes as you state the language in title ii of the bill section 201 dealing with consolidation of law enforcement powers and creating a new title 18 criminal offense falls within the sole rule x jurisdiction of the committee on the judiciary
since you have consulted with this committee and in recognition of desire to proceed expeditiously to the floor i hereby waive consideration of this legislation by the committee
the committee takes this action with the understanding that the committee s jurisdiction over these and other provisions of hr 2601 is in no way altered or diminished
i would also appreciate your including this letter in your committee s report on this legislation and in the congressional record during consideration of the legislation on the house floor
it has worked in the past it will work again
in any event i hope that we will support the un
there are many instances in which the un
has been instrumental in furthering us foreign policy objectives
in the past year alone the un
helped organize parliamentary elections in iraq reconstruction efforts following the indian ocean tsunami and helped mediate the withdrawal of syrian armed forces from lebanon
could be even more complementary to us interests abroad but only if the us does not alienate other member states and create animosity in the process
reform promises to thwart the growing international consensus for reform which will be addressed by at least 174 nations at the september summit in new york
these reforms are in fact endorsed by the un
department of peacekeeping operations and in most cases these reforms are already underway to address recent concerns raised about sexual exploitation and abuse in peacekeeping missions
as well as by the 100plus troop contributing countries and in some cases will require additional un
the hyde bill claims to pursue a streamlined efficient and accountable regular assessed budget of the united nations yet in reality the approach taken by the bill will wreak havoc on the un
budget process and will result in the automatic withholding of us financial obligations to the un
to achieve these goals the bill mandates the withholding of up to 100 million in us dues to the un
oversight function the creation of a peacebuilding commission and reforms in un
this bill also calls for the creation of new positions in several departments including the office of internal oversight services and the department of peacekeeping operations without allowing resources to fund these positions
reform bill will only cause resentment against the united states in the international community
achieving reform by consensus in a body with 191 members is difficult but this is not in itself a reason to bypass the consensus building process
the more member states that are engaged in achieving reform the more legitimate and effective the changes will be
to be specific this bill authorizes 108 billion in 2006 and 10 billion in 2007 for the department of state international broadcasting activities international assistance programs and related agencies
the bill includes the following authorization levels 377 billion for fy06 and 389 billion for fy07 for diplomatic and consular programs 152 billion for fy06 and 155 billion for fy07 embassy security construction and maintenance and 689 million in fy06 and 710 million in fy07 for worldwide security upgrades 13 billion in fy06 and fy07 for contributions to international organizations 955 million in fy06 and 985 million in fy07 for migration and refugee assistance 661 million in fy06 for international broadcasting activities
i am heartened that this bill contains a number of democratic initiatives that were either included by chairman hyde or were added by amendment in committee
in addition this legislation includes provisions related to creating a more formal structure for the promotion of democracy at the department of state
it also requires a report on administration strategy and efforts to advance democracy around the world and it increases funding for the state department s human rights and democracy fund which currently faces a 20 percent decrease in the fy2006 budget request
i appreciate the fact that this authorization includes a sense of congress that the united states should render assistance to the efforts of the international criminal court to bring to justice persons accused of genocide war crimes or crimes against humanity in darfur sudan
however this nation must do more to stop the genocide in darfur
the genocidal regime in sudan has left 25 million people displaced and at least 380 000 people dead in the darfur
in addition water and food supplies have been completely destroyed making it impossible for many sudanese to survive
furthermore under the us refugee admission program for fy05 up to 20 000 refugees from parts of africa may be allowed to enter the us as of may 31 2005 there have been 10 326 the war in iraq continues unabated and yet this administration finds the need to hide the true cost of this war from the american people
i find it sad that this president has changed a long standing precedent of showing the flag draped coffins when they return to be buried here in the united states
i truly hope that president bush will change his policy and allow americans to once again pay proper tribute to our fallen soldiers who we hold dear in our hearts
i am disappointed that this authorization act does not address the deteriorating situation in haiti
i am also extremely disturbed by the role our own administration has played in suppressing the voice of the people of haiti
the bush administration has given tacit approval to the current haitian government in their efforts to impose their regime
it is time for our administration to play an active role in restoring real representative government in haiti
today they are faced with a new challenge of trying to hold their nation together in the face of an illegitimate and collapsing government
the united states must play the lead role in rebuilding the institutions and capabilities of the nation of haiti
i am pleased that this authorization contains support for famine relief in ethiopia up to 4 000 000 for fiscal year 2006
ethiopia is another nation in which we must support democracy and give the people reason to hope
the national election board said it was investigating allegations of fraud in up to 200 seats
i was heartened to see the effort made by prime minister singh and president musharraf in april when they managed to turn a small visit to india to watch a cricket match into a threeday summit that yielded a series of agreementstogether these two nations agreed to set up a joint business council to improve trade and open more meeting points and travel routes for divided families along the line of control which divides the region of kashmir between india and pakistan
both prime minister singh and president musharraf declared that the peace process is now irreversible in addition they agreed that they would continue talks on kashmir in i do have concerns about china and especially its bid to purchase unocal
in addition the chinese yuan continues to be undervalued in relation to the us dollarthe yuan has been pegged to the dollar at an exchange rate of about 828 yuan for 14 years a rate which gives china an unfair edge in the export market
i am not asking to close our relationship with china but only to have some reasonableness in our dealings with them
however i feel it does not go far enough on many vital international issues such as the genocide in darfur and the deteriorating situation in haiti
there are many instances in which the un
has been instrumental in furthering us foreign policy objectives
in the past year alone the un
helped organize parliamentary elections in iraq reconstruction efforts following the indian ocean tsunami and helped mediate the withdrawal of syrian armed forces from lebanon
could be even more complementary to us interests abroad but only if the us does not alienate other member states and create animosity in the process
reform promises to thwart the growing international consensus for reform which will be addressed by at least 174 nations at the september summit in new york
these reforms are in fact endorsed by the un
department of peacekeeping operations and in most cases these reforms are already underway to address recent concerns raised about sexual exploitation and abuse in peacekeeping missions
the hyde bill claims to pursue a streamline efficient and accountable regular assessed budget of the united nations yet in reality the approach taken by the bill will wreak havoc on the un
budget process and will result in the automatic withholding of us financial obligations to the un
to achieve these goals the bill mandates the withholding of up to 100 million in us dues to the un
and the us such as the strengthening of the un s oversight functions the creation of a peacebuilding commission and reforms in un
this bill also calls for the creation of new positions in several departments including the office of internal oversight services and the department of peacekeeping operations without allowing resources to fund these positions
reform bill will only cause resentment against the united states in the international community
achieving reform by consensus in a body with 191 members is difficult but this is not in itself a reason by bypass the consensus building process
the more member states that are engaged in achieving reform the more legitimate and effective the changes will be
so i rise in support of the gentleman s amendment
but i hope as well in listening to my colleague and friend the gentleman from massachusetts mr mcgovern xz4002630 that we also emphasize the impoverishment of that area
in addition to these resources they are if you will isolated by law enforcement to protect them against the drug cartels and violence
they are lacking in educational resources and health resources
we in the united states can give them the strength and also the backbone and pressure to ask colombia to provide them with more resources
mr chairman i rise in support of this amendment though not without reservation
fighting the war on drugs is an important part of creating a safe and stable hemisphere and mr burton xz4000550 must be thanked for his efforts to assist the colombian government in fighting drug trafficking
we must take every effort to root out this heinous activity in all corners of the world
our antidrug activities in the region must also take the shape of social development programs
we must insist that our actions in the war on drugs are not simply military programs but social and economic as well
in our course of action in the war on drugs we must be vigilant in maintaining support for the socially marginalized
the current situation in regions where these groups reside is unacceptable
in 2003 the region had the highest number of internally displaced persons in the country
with little or no government presence in the region its inhabitants have had virtually no means to halt this invasion of drug traffickers
those who have remained in choc are faced with little or no access to healthcare education or law enforcement
approximately 80 percent of afrocolombians live in extreme poverty
in the war on drugs afrocolombians have become the forgotten victims of the conflict
members of congress should take an active role in working with their colombian counterparts and must convince the colombian government that the united states is interested in the wellbeing of colombia s minority populations
during this time of conflict and distress for afrocolombians the united states must be vigilant in providing support and assistance
i support the burton amendment because it assists the colombian government in fighting the war on drugs
i thank also the chairman and the ranking member for their support and i encourage my colleagues to support this amendment to end the scourge that is providing a poison across our communities and drawing in our children and putting them towards a life that will lead them down a road they should not go
this is a very important step to deal with what is said to be up to 80 percent of the source of methamphetamines in our country
if you look at law enforcement they are doing a wonderful job fighting the crime in their local communities
it is only us in the federal government that can do that
we need to have the state department fully supportive having the resources they need to go after the methamphetamines coming in from other countries
at the outset mr chairman let me join with my other colleagues in commending the gentleman from illinois chairman hyde for the outstanding leadership he has demonstrated on this bill
it caps a tremendous career in this body and is just one further shining example of how much we owe him and how we are indebted to him for his years of service to the united states congress
to call upon the secretary general to waive immunity in those instances where un
to me it just makes elemental sense that the secretary general under section 20 exercise his discretion to waive immunity in those cases so that criminal action if necessary can be brought and it would be imperative upon our upcoming representative to the united nations to call upon him to do that
in my remarks i particularly did not direct my remarks to the secretary general and in fact the remarks are directed to our ambassador to the united nations that in the future he continue that policy
this is extremely wellcrafted legislation that the chairman has brought forward in close cooperation with many of his colleagues on the committee on international relations and i am in very strong support of this bill
there is language in section 4 which calls for a uniform code of conduct which i think is a very excellent idea
we want to be very certain that as this legislation goes forward it in no way can be misinterpreted to impinge upon the uniform code of military justice or the american servicemembers protection act
we are trying to avoid any confusion here and make sure that our men and women who are going to work in united nations peacekeeping operations and go around the world are in no way compromised
mr chairman we are trying to make sure that there is no possibility for misinterpretation as we bring forward this very important new legislation and that it can in no way subject the american armed forces or any other american personnel for that matter to foreign tribunals or the international criminal court
i want to be very clear that i am in strong support of this legislation that has come forward by the committee on international relations but there are things that raise my interest and my concern
a few weeks ago media outlets throughout the world proudly parroted amnesty international s unfounded charges of torture and ill treatment in the socalled america gulags instead of condemning the governmentinflicted famine in kim jongil s north korea or continued human rights abuses in castro s cuba the executive director of amnesty international usa revealed the true goal of organizations such as his when he called on foreign governments to arrest and prosecute us government officials and military personnel
we want to make sure that we have got language in here that would prevent that
the united states is a nation dedicated to justice and the rule of law and we can not allow these fundamental protections to be stripped from our servicemen and women performing peacekeeping missions and i think we in this body need to be ever vigilant to ensure that that does not happen
i believe the most important work of the ilo is in the social protection sector which is responsible for coming up with the tools instruments and policies to ensure that men and women have working conditions that are as safe as possible that respect human dignity take into account family and social values allow for adequate compensation in the case of lost or reduced income permit access to adequate social and medical services and respect the right to free time and rest
in a global economic context of sweatshops child labor exploitative labor practices and unfettered capitalism the work of the ilo social protection sector is vastly important
the hard evidence gathered by these inspectors is published in highly regarded indepth reports for consumption by policymakers decisionmakers journalists and various labor and human rights groups throughout the international community
the following are examples of recent reports in paper published by the ilo global report 2005 a global alliance against slave labor an economic study of the costs and benefits of eliminating child labor a report by the director general a fair globalization the role of the ilo towards a fair deal for migrant workers in a global economy eleventh synthesis report on the working condition situation in cambodia s garment sector
the ilo is responsible for gathering evidence for and disseminating the following facts that there are 48 000 children working in floriculture in cayambe and cotopaxi in ecuador
conditions in cotopaxi are worse than in cayambe
in cotopaxi all employees are involved in all stages of production including fumigation and younger children fumigate most frequently
in medical exams of 105 children between the ages of 9 and 18 27 percent had experienced migraines 50 percent blackouts 32 percent experienced shaking
it is estimated that in brazil as many as 25 000 persons are subjected to slave labor conditions mostly in the amazonian states of para and mato grosso
in a number of countries freer trade has replaced or undercut domestic industrial and agricultural industries displacing workers while structural adjustment programs have restricted government spending to cushion unemployment
job creation in some countries under structure adjustment programs has lagged behind the increased number of unemployed and the net result of these job losses due to trade and structural change has been a large number of people without opportunities for decent work in their homelands
it is essential that we know about preexisting labor and living conditions in different regions around the world as steps are taken towards a globalized economy
the gentleman from illinois mr hyde xz4001920 has been a giant in this body for many years
secretary of state rice will have absolutely no choice in the matter
the president of the united states will have no choice in this matter
the congress will have no choice in this matter
we are not alone madam speaker in our deep opposition to the united nations reform act in its current form
this provision makes the bill which has many good provisions in it a guillotine on autopilot
mr chairman i rise in strong opposition to this bill and i urge all of my colleagues across the aisle to do so
it is a derivative reality reflecting its lessthanperfect member states in a deeply flawed world
i would like to remind my colleagues that there will be no quick fix for an organization composed of 191 member states which in varying degrees have their own shortcomings their own injustices their own flaws their own hypocrisies of all types
reform benchmarks contained in the bill are achievable
while many of the reforms being sought in the hyde bill are worthy goals many require unanimous agreement by all 191 un
the state department is not alone in opposing the hyde bill
and the reform effort itself in short mr chairman while the hyde bill has the best of intentions it will cause our nation to go back into an arrears at the united nations without achieving the desired outcomes
given the important role the united nations is currently playing in afghanistan in iraq in darfur and scores of other places i fail to see how going into debt at the united nations will promote our national security interests
mr chairman i urge all of my colleagues to side with our nation s bipartisan foreign policy leaders in opposing this bill
and let me commend the gentleman from illinois chairman hyde for including in his bill extremely important measures that enhance accountability
we are in full accord on dramatically enhancing accountability at the united nations
mr chairman i claim time in opposition to the amendment although i am not in opposition
we have heard very disturbing reports about possible contracting scandals involving kickbacks at the world meteorological organization and the world intellectual property organization in recent years
we do not question the need for improving the peacekeeping process we are with you totally on that but we would like to have our secretary of state have the opportunity of exercising her judgment in a rapidly changing and evolving situation
for over 2 years now iaea investigators have refused to be intimidated by iran s crude threats and tactics and they keep confronting tehran with facts and inconsistencies in iran s feeble excuses and fabrications about its nuclear activities
we can not permit countries such as iran to profit from their exploitation of the nuclear nonproliferation regime to acquire nuclear equipment and technology that they then use to develop nuclear weapons capabilities in violation of their solemn commitments under the nuclear nonproliferation treaty
mr chairman i am delighted to join the gentleman from illinois mr hyde xz4001920 my distinguished chairman in opposing this amendment
i think the chairman as always shows great wisdom in opposing this amendment
but i am particularly thrilled that the chairman has embraced the principle of providing our secretary of state flexibility in dealing with this issue and i very much hope that during the course of the remaining few minutes of our debate the chairman will see the wisdom of providing secretary rice with flexibility on similar issues
does this flexibility extend to the bill as a whole in the gentleman s view
i refer to the hyde bill as a guillotine on autopilot and i think it is in the true american spirit that the gentleman now has a more effective fasterworking more suicidal guillotine which he is offering to this body
if in fact 38 12 of the 39 hyde commandments are fulfilled we should not automatically chop off 75 percent of our dues to the united nations
mr chairman i offer an amendment in the nature of a substitute
mr chairman i rise in strong support of hr 2601 the foreign relations authorization bill for fiscal years 2006 and 2007 as it was reported out of committee
despite our many successes at disrupting al qaeda and other violent and brutal islamic extremists our determination to defeat terror remains unshakable and we know we shall prevail in this struggle
we saw a tragic demonstration of terror this month in london s underground and on its famed doubledecker buses
in this security environment mr chairman legislation on foreign policy should be bipartisan
and our legislation passed unanimously by the committee on international relations by a vote of 44 to 0 is a tribute to my friend the gentleman from illinois mr hyde xz4001920 and his effort to work in a bipartisan fashion
mr chairman in 2003 when an extremist involved in attacks against the british consulate in istanbul and other british facilities was captured he said that he had explored the us consulate as a possible target but had decided to move elsewhere and i quote because even a bird can not fly into the us embassy this statement is a dramatic demonstration that our embassy security program begun after the east africa bombings in 1998 is bearing fruit
the nuclear black market elimination act which is included in our bill authorizes sanctions against individuals and companies that provide nuclear enrichment technology to countries which do not have it or have not signed the additional iaea international atomic energy agency protocols relating to verification
our bill contains provisions of the missile threat reduction act which i introduced in the last congress with the support of chairman hyde
this measure commits the united states to seeking a new international mechanism to restrict the trade in missiles and components
it strengthens us sanctions against those who trade in missiles and it provides assistance to countries that agree to destroy their missile arsenals
let me just say a word mr chairman about another important initiative in our bill the advance democracy act of 2005
mr chairman our bill also provides support for the next critical phase in afghanistan s transition from chaos civil war and disorder to an increasingly prosperous and democratic state by providing assistance for that country s upcoming parliamentary elections
in particular i am profoundly disappointed that a un
i will oppose this amendment and i ask all of my colleagues to join me in voting against it
mr chairman we are considering this important legislation at a pivotal moment in our nation s history
we are engaged in intense diplomacy on every continent
we are working to resolve longfestering disputes and crises in north korea in iran in iraq in afghanistan in congo in colombia and countless other places
and we are doing this in the midst of a critical conflict against the violent forces of nihilism and bloodthirsty islamic fanaticism
the changes entailed in this amendment are technical noncontroversial and fully acceptable to our side
madam chairman i rise in strong opposition to this amendment
but madam chairman the deluge of stories of scandal at the united nations has forced a long overdue recognition of a fundamental fact the united nations is a derivative reality reflecting its lessthanperfect member states in a deeply flawed world
i would like to remind all of my colleagues that there will be no quick fix for an organization composed of 191 member states that in varying degrees have their own shortcomings injustices flaws and hypocrisies of all types
given the important role the united nations is currently playing in afghanistan in darfur and elsewhere i fail to see how our going into arrears will promote american national security interests
the guillotine does not fall automatically it is put in the hands of a singularly intelligent secretary of state
the only difference is that the republican proposal looking years ahead into the future automatically mandates a 50 percent cut in funding if only one of 46 goals is not achieved
madam chairman i am not opposed to the amendment but i ask unanimous consent to claim the time in opposition
madam chairman i am not opposed to the amendment but i ask unanimous consent to claim the time in opposition
madam chairman i am not opposed to the amendment but i ask unanimous consent to claim the time in opposition
mr chairman i am not opposed to the amendment and i ask unanimous consent to claim the time in opposition
mr chairman i ask unanimous consent to claim the time in opposition although i do not oppose the amendment
mr chairman i ask unanimous consent to claim the time in opposition although i do not oppose the amendment
mr chairman i rise in support of the amendment
it is of critical importance that the united states not be outgunned or outmaneuvered by narcotics traffickers either in the streets of our towns or on the high seas
it is very disturbing to learn that drug traffickers are in fact developing their own navies with atsea refueling capabilities for their drug cargo vessels yet our own coast guard is not similarly equipped when it hunts and pursues these deep water vessels in the eastern pacific
this amendment will authorize 50 million for the next two fiscal years to the department of state international narcotics and law enforcement bureau to purchase or lease a maritime refueling support vessel to refuel us coast guard and other drug interdiction vessels in the eastern pacific
in the drug war unilateral disarmament is the worst position to be in
unfortunately the approach contained in the bill before us contravenes the united nations charter and undercuts the rule of law
one obvious issue especially for my republican colleagues is whether deference to the judgment of house leadership in matters of multilateral diplomacy is more compelling than deference to the president
the former represents a congressional directive that in all likelihood will require the us to declare financial war on the united nations
but i fear in this instance he may be wrong and i would suggest to my colleagues that the most appropriate way to show our esteem is through respectful dissent to the finest in our midst
the committee has done a quality job in assembling a panoply of united nations reform proposals
unfortunately in my judgment the underlying committee approach is thoroughly inappropriate
as a supporter of the principles that underlie the founding of the united nations i must confess to profound disappointment in the conflicts of interest that developed in the oilforfood program
bizarrely according to a federal indictment made public earlier this spring a south korean named tongsun park appears to be at the center point of one set of iraqi oil transfers in which as a middleman he may have used part of his commissions to influence several un
what is astonishingly dja 2 vu about these charges is that tongsun park had been indicted on bribery and conspiracy charges in the late 1970s for using his role as a rice agent for the us food for peace program to bestow money and gifts on members of congress who had legislated the guidelines that allowed commissions on those agricultural sales
the involvement of tongsun park in the iraqi oilforfood scandal may be a footnote to the abuses that developed but it symbolically underscores the urgent need for reform accountability and transparency in un
it appears that proceeds from some of these contracts may have benefited influential individuals and institutions in various countries including russia and france and thus had the effect of providing financial incentives for people in key foreign countries to oppose the policy perspectives of the united states
it may be that relative to the multibilliondollar size of the program the conflicts in new york may to some seem paltry
but it should be clear that a few thousand here and a few thousand there add up to a loss of confidence in institutions of governance
should be the one most sensitive in the world to the problem of the two c s corruption and conflicts of interest
it was expected to be an honest and implacably neutral broker to help settle international disputes and advance international law in areas as diverse as arms control trade human rights and the environment
in all these activities political differences were to be expected but integrity of purpose and deed was to be the un s hallmark
but tragically no institution can fulfill its mission if its programs are subverted or its representatives conduct themselves in ways that are not respectful of the law
corruption is the bitterest breach of trust especially for the un which in so many parts of the world represents the aspirations of people who live in desperate poverty and fear
in this regard in december 2004 congress directed the united states institute of peace to establish a task force on the united nations
the report recommends establishing a chief operating officer to be in charge of daily un
in addition the report suggests abolishing the current un
by background in the early 1990 s i cochaired the united states commission on improving the effectiveness of the united nations
the commission held six hearings in regional centers across the country receiving testimony from hundreds of witnesses representing a crosssection of philosophical perspectives
could play a constructive role in world affairs but explicitly recognized serious management problems and lack of adequate financial accountability in the un
with respect to political and security issues the commission like the gingrichmitchell commission recognized that means must be found to make the security council more representative of power balances in the world today accordingly it recommended the expansion of permanent membership of the security council
here we must understand precisely what the meaning of a 50 percent cut in us contributions to the un as envisioned in the bill before us implies
as the country in the world that most stands for the rule of law we are proposing to circumvent it
the committee approach represents a congressional directive that in all likelihood will require the us to declare financial war on the united nations
in 1962 the international court of justice held sustaining the position of the united states that apportionment of expenses by the general assembly creates the obligation of each member to bear that part of the expenses apportioned to it
the vienna convention on the law of treaties provides that every treaty in force is binding upon the parties to it and must be performed by them in good faith article 26
the wiser way to go is to take the group of reform ideas assembled in the committee bill many of which by the way have been derived from recommendations of various un
initiated panels and simply direct the executive to use its authority to seek to advance them in a way only it can
while it contains good ideas that many in the un
community support the coercive methodology implicit in the threat of withholding legally obligated resources will jeopardize rather than advance prospects for reform
we may be the greatest democracy in history but in a world where us leadership has for so many lost its luster good policy is far likelier to precipitate constructive results than big economic threats
corruption exists in all societies
it is rife indeed endemic in some
it is true that a few thousand dollars here and a few thousand dollars there pretty soon adds up to a loss of confidence in institutions of governance and we have that problem at the un
madam chairman let me first thank our ranking member for yielding me this time and i also thank him and the gentleman from illinois chairman hyde for their continuing bipartisan efforts reflected not only in this bill but in many of the bills which we work on in the committee on international relations
with regard to this bill together and i want to thank them for their efforts on this we were able to incorporate the provisions which i offered on minority recruiting hiring and contracting at the state department and also helping to support the development of predictive models on famine in subsaharan africa into the text of this bill
while this bill represents a very diligent effort a bipartisan effort i am deeply concerned that the committee on rules made in order many ideologically driven amendments
the republican leadership continues to stifle any debate on the most pressing issues of the day especially the quagmire in iraq
silencing critics of the administration policies in iraq is really an abuse of power and really is very devoid of the democratic values that many are trying to spread throughout the world
i offered four critical amendments to this bill one asking the administration to just present to congress a plan for withdrawal of troops from iraq another one stating that the united states should have a policy stating that we should have no permanent military bases in iraq
those amendments of course were not ruled in order again stifling debate
drugs are ravishing communities here in america and this would provide a way out of that in terms of ensuring that farmers had other types of crops to grow and had this alternative economic development
instead madam chairman unfortunately we will consider the dangerous divisive amendments like the ones with all due respect offered by the chair of our committee who wants to withhold funds from the united nations and also the one by the gentlewoman from florida i do not think anyone questions the effort in terms of the chairman with regard to un reform
but i think it is very dangerous as many have said to withhold dues toward this end in terms of this provision of this bill
mr chairman i rise in strong opposition to hr 2745
such a rigid approach weakens the bush administration s hand in negotiating the changes that we all agree are necessary there
these ambassadors served in republican and democratic administrations alike range broadly in their political persuasions and include president bush s most recent ambassador to the un john danforth as well as madeleine albright richard holbrooke jeane kirkpatrick donald mchenry thomas pickering bill richardson and andrew young
in their letter they write that withholding us dues to the un
mr chairman i thank the ranking member for yielding the time and i want to express my enormous respect for the gentleman from illinois mr hyde xz4001920 my dear friend with whom i agree on some things but not on this issue although the majority of the bill i know is consistent with the gentleman from california s mr lantos xz4002310 and my view although i do rise in strong support of the lantos substitute and in opposition to the underlying bill but it is with great respect and i appreciate the opportunity to work with my colleague on this and many other issues
as the nation most involved in the founding of the un the united states has an obligation to play a key role in this reform process
has dragged its feet in addressing some of our world s worst crises such as the darfur genocide and has been impotent on human rights issues and the record of the un
in many ways the un
is broken but we must remember that it remains and must remain a central actor in global affairs
unicef is the premier organization combating childhood disease in poor countries
so enacting the hyde bill which is more about punishment than reform simply does not serve in my judgment the best interests of this country
in requiring a mandatory 50 percent cut in the united states dues to the un unless 32 of 39 specific reforms are achieved the hyde bill provides no flexibility whatever to the state department to negotiate with other un
madam chairman last week i rose in opposition to bringing up the east asia security act of 2005 hr 3100 on the suspension calendar because it contained some provisions that created unintended consequences for our exports to china as well as some of our largest export markets in canada and europe
strengthening the weakest link europe in the arms embargo against china will serve the cause of peace and freedom in the pacific rim region
at the same time we must act diligently in pursuing this noble goal so we do not weaken our overall global competitiveness and give more reasons to foreign customers to avoid americanmade products
i am pleased to report that many of my initial concerns have been addressed in a subsequent modification of hr 3100 that will now be offered as the hydelantoshuntermanzullo amendment to the foreign relations reauthorization act fiscal years 2006 and 2007 hr 2601
in addition another similar section that was already incorporated into hr 2601 dealing with the comprehensive nature of us arms embargoes section 733 will also be amended as part of the manager s amendment to address certain unintended consequences of this section
at a minimum hr 3100 would have required an export license for every transaction and a notification to congress regardless of dollar value adding a costly new regulatory burden on us companies specializing in the defense trade
the bill as originally drafted threatened to disrupt numerous ongoing us defense projects in israel canada australia and among member nations of the north atlantic treaty organization nato
the compromise contained in this amendment permits the secretary of state with the concurrence of the secretary of defense to waive the export license requirement
some were concerned that because the language was not specific enough to just target military institutions inside china such as the people s liberation army pla and that there are still many stateowned enterprises in china including all of their airline companies which can be taken over by their military in case of national emergency this could have been an incentive for china to purchase nonus products
the compromise contained in this amendment eliminates this new licensing regime and replaces it with a reporting requirement to the commerce department by the us exporter 15 days after an item is exported
in addition hr 3100 originally contained a list of five possible foreign sanctions the president could apply to any foreign person including foreign governments who violated the terms of the bill
included in this list was a prohibition on the approval of dual use export licenses
in 2004 commerce approved 547 million in dual use exports to china
again this is a noble goal but must be achieved in a prudent manner
also section 733 as originally drafted did not recognize the commercial ties the pla has in enterprises throughout china
for example the pla is technically the prime contractor for the 2008 olympics in beijing
even many us multinational corporations have joint ventures with chinese partners in which the pla has some stake
mr chairman in the 35 years since the nuclear nonproliferation treaty has been in force much has changed around the world but what has not changed is the danger inherent in the spread of nuclear weapons
my amendment says that the president of the united states shall direct the united states permanent representative to the iaea to use their influence and their vote to secure an agreement within the iaea requiring that any member state of the npt that is in breach of the treaty or withdraws from the treaty must return any nuclear materials or technology acquired for peaceful purposes
well for the first time in the treaty s history one country has withdrawn from the treaty
in 2002 international inspectors were asked to leave north korea and in 2003 north korea withdrew from the nonproliferation treaty
so while considerable diplomatic activity has taken place to try to convince north korea to reverse its action there is actually no rule in place now at the iaea that would require north korea to return all of the nuclear materials it received
the one thing that president bush and john kerry agreed upon in their presidential debates is that this is the most important issue in the world
now interestingly in the atomic energy act of the united states in 1954 it is in fact a requirement under our law that if another nation is in violation of the agreement that the nuclear materials which we give to that country is not used for peaceful purposes that all of the materials that we have sent to that country must be returned to our country
what this amendment says is that as a member of the united nations and the iaea that we now will extend this not just to the united states but to all countries in the world that the iaea must enforce a requirement that if a country is in violation of its agreement to use materials only for peaceful purposes then the iaea must act immediately to begin the process of reclaiming all of the material that all of the countries of the world have sent to that country which is in violation of the law
we must put teeth in this law
it goes a long way in sending a message to the rest of the world that the united states intends on being the leader on the issue of nuclear nonproliferation regardless of which other country in the world is involved and regardless of which other country in the world was the supplier of those materials
the meth crisis is taken very seriously in minnesota and i am proud of the work our local law enforcement officials are doing
they know very well how difficult this problem is both the local production of methamphetamine and the explosion in trafficking
the meth epidemic as i said is poisoning and polluting minnesota where as much as 80 percent of the methamphetamine is produced in superlabs trafficked by mexican narcoterrorist gangs
banning pseudoephedrine will not stop the problem but banning meth in mexico could
it is an effort to add some commonsense reforms to the united nations in the area of employment in the area of what their employees may or may not do with the entity s monies while they are politicking in their own domestic elections and an attempt to make sure there is a record should they have outside unauthorized contact with individuals who are not members of government or the media
i would like to say that the rationale for bringing this forward is to provide a practical benefit to the reform effort at the united nations but i think it also is important that we recognize as martin luther king jr once said there can be no great sorrow where there is no great love we are engaged today to try to redeem the dream of franklin roosevelt that the united nations in the age of the nuclear bomb that in the age of a global war on terror at some point we could have something at night to get us to sleep and that is the belief that the united nations would be a force for good in the world that international disputes could be resolved there that the finest and most noble motives of humanity could find expression and implementation
mr chairman as the gentleman from california mr lantos xz4002310 has said in a wonderfully elegant phrase unfortunately the united nations at present is a derivative reality so i am trying to inject some practicality into that derivative reality
mr chairman i yield myself such time as i may consume and would like to thank the distinguished minority ranking member the chairman of our committee and everyone who is engaged in this debate
and more importantly it has been an honor to see the example they set and to set a bar for others in this institution to emulate their integrity
mr chairman i am not opposed to the amendment but i ask unanimous consent to claim the time in opposition
mr chairman i wanted to rise in strong support of the previous amendment by the gentleman from virginia mr cantor xz4000600 and the gentlewoman from nevada ms berkeley
it is an important initiative one that i have been working on in similar context for some time as a member of the committee on international relations
it is clearly in the national security interest of the united states that iran can not move forward with impunity and certainly that we do not through the iaea give it operational capacity to do so to be able to have the ability for example at the bushehr nuclear facility to be able to have operational capacity
i look forward to the state department authorization bill where language has been included that we hope moves us closer along with the security council to coming to understand the grave nature of the challenge that we face in iran and its nuclear energy
that is like kicking a child out of school who has moved from an f to a b because they did not get an a the bill also keeps the us from supporting any new peacekeeping missions until farreaching reforms have been implemented even in cases like a sudan and when innocent civilians are at risk
i rise to support hr 2601 in its present form and to comment on some of the positive elements of this bill
this bill also includes language i offered on the religious freedom and rights of the ecumenical patriarch in turkey
as was mentioned in the report language in the bill kean university in new jersey runs a model program which is specifically designed to increase the number of minorities in the foreign service
i am particularly concerned that the bill keeps the united states from supporting any new peacekeeping mission until farreaching reforms have been implemented even in extreme cases
as i said in the beginning this bill has many positive components but we should not attach the un
amendment to this bill that undermines that world body and undermines our ability to participate and have others participate with us in global security and other initiatives
mr chairman i rise in strong support of the provisions in this bill that address the unwillingness of mexico to extradite violent criminals back to the united states for prosecution
since 2001 mexico has become a fugitive paradise where people accused of heinous crimes in the united states can escape from american justice
in 2002 deputy david march a 7year veteran of the los angeles sheriff s department was brutally shot while performing a routine traffic stop at 10 30 in the morning
once in the united states he continued his life as a criminal plaguing our streets with drugs and engaging in other criminal activities including two attempted murders
garcia killed deputy march by shooting him execution style in the side of his chest where the bulletproof vest did not cover and in the head
now this monster who has demonstrated a total disregard for the laws of our country over and over again walks free in mexico
mexican officials have refused to extradite garcia because he could face the death penalty or life in prison for murdering deputy david march
to see the pain and anger in their faces knowing their son s killer is roaming free across our southern border is heartbreaking
i commend the gentleman from illinois mr hyde xz4001920 for including a provision in this bill to urge the mexican government to reconsider its faulty extradition policy and i hope my colleagues will support this and other legislative efforts to ensure that mexico respects the laws of the united states
mr chairman although i believe in the values and principles expressed in the united nations charter the organization has been hijacked by some member states who have betrayed those values
the use of blood libels by representatives of member states in official un
no nation has exercised as much restraint as israel yet no nation has been subjected to so much condemnation indeed vilification and demonization including those countries that practice slavery torture and genocide some of whom have been privileged to sit on the united nations commission on human rights a right denied to israel in the more than half a century it has been a member
is capable of good and important work in the eradication of disease in alleviating poverty in averting genocide in peacekeeping
yet some commands for change including several provisions in the hyde bill are counterproductive and unwise
specifically i can not support the hyde bill provision that mandates cutting in half us payments to the un
operations in darfur and haiti and ignoring the possibility of future crises that may demand international intervention is such places as iran or syria

the democratic substitute offered by my colleague and good friend from california mr lantos which authorizes the secretary of state to use her discretion in withholding funds to promote adoption of the reforms we seek is far preferable
mr chairman methamphetamine abuse has become the nation s leading drug problem according to a survey of 500 sheriff s departments in 45 states
this is where we were in 1990 in terms of drug labs and this is where we are currently in this country in 2004 where at least 20 or more clandestine drug labs have been shown in those counties
this drug has led to an increase in crime child abuse and prison and jail populations are soaring
sixty to 85 percent of the meth used in this country comes from the superlabs in mexico
it is manufactured as said earlier in six or seven locations around the world
the purpose and ideals of the united nations are to maintain international peace and security and to engage in collective action to preserve both
that is why i am here today in support of this overall legislation and offering this particular amendment
one of the most blatant examples of fraud corruption and abuse in the united nations is that of the united nations employees enriching themselves through personal deals with rogue governments
in 1991 the united nations placed sanctions on iraq for saddam hussein s persistent noncompliance with the provisions of the ceasefire that ended the first gulf war
in an effort to mitigate the sanctions impact on the iraqi population the oilforfood program was created in 1996 to allow the iraqis to sell oil in order to pay for humanitarian goods
while visiting iraq in the course of his official duties director of the oilforfood program mr benon sevan requested special allocations from the iraq oil ministry for african middle east petroleum company to help a friend
mr sevan was in a position of influence and could lift restrictions on various parts of the oilforfood program
because of these personal deals saddam was able to skirt around the restrictions of sanctions siphoning off as much as 10 billion in the form of illicit revenue while the iraqi people starved
saddam hussein used much of this money to purchase weapons many of which are being used to kill americans and iraqis today as the allied forces continue to fight terrorism in that country
we are seeing corruption at many different levels in the un and i would request that all members support this amendment which would limit the unauthorized contact between the united nation employees and the nations which have been sanctioned
reform act and i rise today in support of the rule and with a profound sense of gratitude for the leadership that my mentor and friend henry j hyde of illinois has provided on this bill and throughout an illustrious career in this congress
the united nations is desperately in need of fundamental reform and the henry j hyde un
in 1994 staffers at unicef s kenya office defrauded and squandered up to 10 million by some estimates
in the congo last year un
both sides agree it is time for reform in the wake of years of mismanagement and outright scandal
but the hyde bill also uses the leverage of withholding up to 50 percent of us assessed dues if certifications are not made in key areas
i rise for a few brief moments to speak on behalf of title vi of this bill which calls for farreaching reforms in the areas of planning management conduct and accountability of peacekeeping operations within the united nations
while title iv of the peacekeeping reforms of this bill do not cut peacekeeping funds they do withhold the expansion of any us involvement in peacekeeping operations if these reforms are not enacted
the congo in this last calendar year un
peacekeepers and civilian personnel stand accused of widespread sexual exploitation of refugees in the democratic republic of congo
in eritrea in 2005 un
in burundi in 2004 two un
in sierra leone in 2003 un
in fact the united nations special committee on peacekeeping operations has endorsed specifically all seven of the reforms that are included in this legislation
in fact those reforms have been endorsed by prince zeid of jordan the secretary general s special advisor on sexual exploitation and abuse and all but one the signature of an oath have already been adopted by the un
according to officials at the un most of these reforms are expected to be in place by the end of july 2005
believe that most of these reforms will be in place in a matter of weeks so it is difficult to understand how requiring these reforms before any additional us missions are approved under peacekeeping operations is a little hard to understand
reform act that we stand even with tough love for the idea that we use the power of the purse which is the power of the american people in this case the threat of withholding additional missions to the united nations under peacekeeping operations to demand that these necessary reforms are implemented
for instance the american people have no ability to force accountability in the billions stolen from the oilforfood program
mr speaker billions of dollars in coverups fraud investigations abuses of power calls for resignation shredded documents
sudan from its seats on the commission has vetoed efforts to condemn the genocide it is committing in darfur
peacekeepers were recently found to be raping the children the very people they were ordered to protect in the congo
plays a vital role in mediating disputes in caring for the poor and facilitating dialogue
they need to be made in the structure of the un
mr chairman i stand here with great pride next to my chairman the gentleman from illinois mr hyde xz4001920 and recall all the great and wonderful battles that he has fought in his career and i am so proud to be at his side at this not the last battle that we will fight but as we lead into the sunset of his career a battle that will be meaningful and remembered and for which the american people will be grateful that we had his leadership
this bill will reform the united nations in a meaningful and lasting way especially in the arena of accountability
reform is vital in this area
the oilforfood program was set up in order to make sure that the women and children and noncombatants of iraq did not die of lack of food and medicines because of an oil boycott that we had put the united nations had placed on iraq under saddam hussein s regime as a way of pressuring saddam hussein to give up his chemical and biological weapons weapons of mass destruction and to continue and to refrain from his hostile acts like the invasion of kuwait
let us note that our allies including france and russia who had demanded that we have an oilforfood program to help those poor and starving iraqi children that as we put the program in place instead of helping us they became hindrances to our making sure that the program was run in an honest way
business was the driving factor of course in their decision
but let us note that another driving factor was the fact that we have uncovered that as part of the oilforfood program bribes were being channeled to people in those very governments and perhaps that had something to do with the decisionmaking process of our socalled allies
of the estimated 65 billion in oil sales during the time of the oilforfood program perhaps as much as 10 billion was siphoned off by saddam hussein this mass murderer and this 10 billion which was supposed to be going to the iraqi people to alleviate their suffering
a united nationssanctioned inquiry led by federal reserve bank chairman paul volcker has unearthed these evidences of kickbacks paid for example to the former director of the oilforfood program in the united nations
the oversight of the oilforfood program at the united nations itself was undercut by the weak institutional oversight management structures in the united nations itself
if you want to find out what this program did and the power it gave saddam hussein and the corruption of this idea of saving innocent women and children as a program officiated over by the united nations let us recall a speech in this body not too long ago
we have seen situations where for example benon sevan sold his vouchers to a company in which his stepdaughter was hired which was in violation of un

in the hearings on the oilforfood program that i have held in the subcommittee on oversight and investigations in the international relations committee is that the un
mr chairman let me just note that what measures that we have been suggesting in the bill as you have just underscored are very reasonable and the fact that we have bipartisan support on the measures demanding accountability suggest that these are things that the united nations should not be opposing
so i appreciate the gentleman and also all those ladies and gentlemen on the other side of the aisle coming at these issues of accountability in a very bipartisan fashion
there is broad agreement on both sides as to the need for reform in the united nations
this is not in contention
the american people understand that in order to get an organization like the united nations to reform there must be consequences
do we think the united nations this entrenched bureaucracy will just say oh we re enlightened by the wonderful debate that we ve heard you ve appealed to our heart that they are going to make the changes that are necessary to prevent corruption in their organization that they have lived with for years because we have touched their hearts we have reached their intellect
i rise in strong support of this bill
on monday as we were preparing for the debate on reforming the united nations a constituent of mine was at one of the sessions of the economic and social council one of the many united nations bodies and he was immediately struck by the almost orwellian and secretive nature of the proceedings as well as by the vitriolic antiamerican attacks in which the chairman and other members of the committee were engaged
my constituent made several observations to me that reaffirmed that lives not just policies are at stake in our efforts to reform the un
however how can the united nations be considered a legitimate source of stability or an instrument for the protection of the most vulnerable populations or a tool for the promotion of human rights and good governance when it is plagued with graft and corruption when sexual predators and traffickers in human beings are part of the policing and peacekeeping mission and when the human rights commission is a country club of rogue states made up of dictators and tyrants and thugs
reform act of 2005 mandates spending cuts in specific programs redirects funds to priority areas and yes withholds 50 percent of usassessed dues if certifications are not made in critical areas
if we are serious about making the united nations relevant again and i think in a bipartisan way we are if we are serious about restoring it to reflect its core mission and i think in a bipartisan way we are if we are serious about saving the united nations from itself then we must render our overwhelming support for the henry hyde un
i would just like to close by saying that it is very fitting that this bill before us should have the name of our distinguished chairman of the committee on international relations the gentleman from illinois mr hyde xz4001920 who has been the conscience of the house the voice of the people for so many years has had such a distinguished public service career in the house and led us through some very difficult times as chairman of the committee on the judiciary as well as chairman of our committee on international relations
i rise in strong support of the henry j hyde united nations reform act and would like to provide some insight on the background and the impetus for title iii of the bill that relates as the chair pointed out to the international atomic energy agency
in 2004 the iaea reports enumerated more iranian breaches including work on an element that could be used for nuclear explosions
fast forward to this year and the news reports appearing in the last few months state that the iranian regime plans to install 54 000 advanced p2 model centrifuges at its facility in natanz
the director general of the iaea has called upon iran to allow its inspectors full access to the sites in lavizan and parchin
just yesterday at the board meeting in vienna of the iaea it was revealed that iran had conducted experiments to create plutonium for many more years beyond what it claimed
in fact iran recently served on the board of governors of the international atomic energy agency because under the current structure under its policies countries that are suspected of breaching their safeguards they are allowed to serve in leadership positions within the agency
reform bill to strengthen the international atomic energy agency in the areas of safeguard inspections and nuclear security also to effectively use us contributions to deny rogue states and state sponsors of terrorism such as iran such as syria the ability to pursue dangerous weapons with virtual impunity
it seeks the establishment of an office of compliance and enforcement within the secretariat of the agency to function as an independent body of technical experts that will assess the activities of member states and recommend specific penalties for those that are in breach or violation of their obligations
furthermore it seeks the suspension of privileges of member states that are under investigation or in breach or noncompliance of their obligations and the establishment of membership criteria that would keep such rogue states such as iran such as syria from serving on the board of governors
the section in this act reinforces our us priorities concerning the safety of nuclear materials and counterproliferation by calling for us voluntary contributions to the agency to primarily be used to fund activities related to nuclear security
as someone who appreciates the work performed by the international labor organization and efforts to bring about and secure labor rights for oppressed people in countries under dictatorial rule it is with difficulty that i rise in opposition of the gentleman s amendment but i must
member states policies such as social security schemes and employee benefits and these are issues that in the us for example we in the congress are working on and are responsible for
in short today we are focused on reforming how the us how the un
the gentleman from ohio would have been i believe better served by offering his amendment as others have by it having called upon the president to direct the us permanent representative to work to ensure enhanced funding for the international labor rights organization which i believe is a worthy goal and on that very issue in fact this is already being done
the amendment suggests that the ilo is not doing enough in the social protection sector
however the 20062007 budget that was agreed to shows a significant increase in the budget for the activities of this sector
the 20042005 budget for the protection sector was 727 million in 2006 and the 2007 budget is 91 million
overall the international labor organization budget increased 12 percent from 529 million during the 2004 and 2005 biennium to 594 million in 2006 and 2007
the amendment also requires an increase in the field presence by the ilo
we want to make sure that they help the oppressed people in all of these countries and do not abuse their people
the withholding provisions in the henry hyde un
i rise in support of this amendment offered by the gentleman from massachusetts mr markey xz4002530
we held a hearing in april on the nuclear nonproliferation treaty and one of the key issues that we looked at was how npt states should address the noncompliance or attempted withdrawal of a state from the treaty
this amendment takes a step forward in solving this challenge by calling upon the president to work with other international atomic energy agency member states to mandate that any state which is found to be in noncompliance with its npt obligations or attempts to withdraw from the npt will be compelled to return all the nuclear materials and technology it received as a consequence of being an npt member
i believe such a provision would be helpful in convincing states to adhere to their npt obligations
states such as north korea and iran have likely already used their status past status in the case of north korea as npt states to develop nuclear weapons programs and i believe it is vital that the united states play a leading role in multilateral efforts to close the loophole in the npt that allows states to receive nuclear energy assistance but not pay any penalty if they subsequently withdraw from the treaty as has north korea
if one member spoke for each year that the gentleman has served in this house that would entitle us to 32 accolade speeches during the next year and a half
i also want to express a personal thanks for the willingness of the chairman and the ranking member to include several of my amendments to this bill in the markup
two weeks ago terrorists struck in the heart of one of the world s great cities london
the amendments i offered in committee addressed three critical areas in the fight to prevent terrorists from acquiring weapons of mass destruction security of nuclear weapons and material expanding the proliferation security initiative and redirecting the efforts of scientists formerly employed as part of the soviet union s biological warfare establishment
while the united states has stringent controls on our nuclear weapons and weapons materials security in other countries is less exacting
while i believe that existing international law justifies the proliferation security initiative there are states that are reluctant to participate in the program without the expressed sanction
the third amendment requests a report by the secretary of state on the feasibility potential contributions and desirability of employing former soviet biological weapons scientists in developing biomedical countermeasures
diverting the expertise of weapons scientists in the former soviet union is crucial to preventing the proliferation of wmd
i thank the gentleman from california for supporting the president in the war against iraq and to go into afghanistan
we are in a war in afghanistan a war in iraq and we are telling the president of the united states and the secretary of state forget it
i can not believe when our men and women are fighting in iraq that we would move forward with legislation like this when we need to draw countries together
the problem is not all the reforms can physically happen and some of them will not happen and some in the un
i rise in strong support of the henry j hyde un
reform act of 2005 injects real and measurable accountability into the united nations and that is exceedingly important in a myriad of areas including the area of peacekeeping operations and in human rights
the savings could be in the millions of dollars for us taxpayers if other instances of building improprieties were found and by connection action taken to correct those improprieties
i think by getting all of the information on assessed voluntary and inkind contributions i think americans will be amazed as will international friends around the world in like manner will be amazed how much the us government does provide
so often inkind contributions like airlift for military operations in no way gets on the ledger so we do not have a thorough and a full accounting of the us contribution and how the money is spent
iran has already reportedly utilized much smaller quantities of uranium or plutonium in laboratory experiments with suspected links to nuclear arms programs
this amendment seeks to close the loophole from the inspections regime by number one calling for the iaea to rescind the small quantities protocol secondly to require that any nation that has signed the small quantities protocol to have implemented and be in compliance with the additional protocol providing for more stringent inspections and third to prohibit any iaea members from receiving any nuclearrelated material technology equipment or assistance and be subjected to penalties if they do not adhere to the higher inspection standards
clearly mr chairman the protocol is out of date in an era marked by secret nuclear programs that have been discovered in iran libya and north korea and where the bar is set much higher for suspicions of possible atomic activities
by rescinding the small quantities protocol the iaea will have additional access to evaluate the nuclear program of an iaea member state and to confirm that the state is in full compliance with its safeguards obligations
mr chairman i ask unanimous consent to claim the time in opposition to the amendment
mr chairman i rise in support of the amendment and i yield myself such time as i may consume
i would say very briefly that unless states which are in noncompliance with their nuclear nonproliferation treaty obligations or which seek to withdraw from the treaty are forced to give up their peaceful nuclear capabilities legally acquired under the treaty they can use these to illegally develop nuclear weapons
mr chairman i rise to oppose the lantosshays substitute and to direct members attention to a serious flaw in the peacekeeping section which i respectfully submit are reasons enough to vote against the substitute
peacekeepers as a mere public relations problem and thus an opportunity to dig in their heels and stall the reform process
in 2002 we knew about the exploitation of children by un
personnel in the congo
i have already chaired two hearings on it myself in my subcommittee
is moving in the right direction but there needs to be considerable pressure brought to bear to make this happen
has made every effort to ensure the formal adoption and implementation of mechanisms to suspend the membership of a member state if genocide ethnic cleansing or crimes against humanity are determined to be occurring in that member state regardless of whether the acts are being committed by the government or by a third party
there are countries like the congo and we have also seen it in uganda where there are thirdparty groups of terrorists and killers and maimers who the government would like to see done away with and are actively cooperating with the international community and the un
under this language which is very different than the language that the gentleman from nebraska mr fortenberry xz4006400 offered we would be in a strange and i think even bizarre situation where even where there has been an effort made by the state there could be an explusion and a cutoff of peacekeeping money 10 percent assessed contribution cutoff
i would echo the statements of the gentleman from california mr lantos xz4002310 in applauding chairman hyde for his extraordinary leadership on the committee on international relations
the cost of the bill is 108 billion for fiscal year 2006 10 billion for 2007 with some costs in the outyears totaling 19 billion for a total multiyear price tag of 223 billion and it is within budget
there were 10 amendments considered during markup in our subcommittee and another 52 amendments considered during the full committee
this funding continues the work begun after the devastating terrorist bombings in the late 1990s of our two us embassies in africa
under the capital security construction program eight new embassy compounds in eritrea zimbabwe pakistan ukraine rwanda zambia mozambique bosnia and for st
petersburg in russia and four usaid annexes in nigeria ghana nicaragua and georgia would be funded
it increases the ceiling on differential pay for hardship and danger at a time when we are operating new posts in extremely dangerous locations
it supports human rights efforts at the department through targeted funding for the office of democracy human rights and labor promotes programs to fight antisemitism protects religious freedom in osce countries provides a permanent authorization for radio free asia and funds scholarships for outstanding individuals from the southern sudan region to study in the united states
the bill also states that us national interests would be advanced by a stronger international atomic energy agency or the iaea including ensuring that a recurring delay in the us annual payment is corrected
mr chairman i am grateful the committee has included a number of provisions that i proposed including services for overseas children suffering from autism a global prevalence study on autism steps to promote human rights and democracy in vietnam belarus and zimbabwe support for a strengthened rule of law in northern ireland as well as assistance to maternal and child victims of chernobyl and the creation of a program to repair and prevent the tragic condition of obstetric fistula
human rights system and in its peacekeeping operations there has been little reform a lot of talk but very little actual reform
officials like kofi annan have said unless we remake our human rights machinery we may be unable to renew public confidence in the un
nowhere in their documents including the cedaw convention can that be found
we want to assure that the kind of abuses that we have seen in congo in other countries are stopped and hopefully this legislation will help to do that
we need to ensure accountability and transparency in the 12 billion in taxpayer money we spend on peacekeeping every year
as the chairman said a moment ago we have seen resolution upon resolution here as well as in new york at the un and what happens
peacekeepers in places like congo
this provision seeks to alleviate the plight of hundreds of thousands of burmese who have been forced to flee from their native villages by the repressive policies of the military dictatorship in rangoon the same dictatorship that represses nobel peace prize winner aung san suu kyi
it is critical that we take down and extradite to the united states those kingpins and warlords in the drug trade who are affecting our nation here at home and poisoning the new democracy in afghanistan and fueling terrorism at the same time
the souder amendment will let us know whether we are getting cooperation and support from the government of afghanistan on this critical part in the fight against illicit drugs extraditions
mr chairman i want to thank the gentleman from minnesota mr kennedy xz4002141 the gentlewoman from oregon ms hooley xz4001860 the gentleman from nebraska mr osborne xz4003030 and the others who have been working on this amendment and many others over the last few weeks on methamphetamines a scourge that is sweeping our country starting to hammer some of our major cities and is going to be something that we have not seen for a long time in america unless we can get control of this
starting in oklahoma many states including my home state of indiana have tried to regulate pseudoephedrine through drug stores and grocery stores by putting it behind the counter
these large trafficking organizations will bring it in
in mexico alone the mexican imports of pseudoephedrine and these are coming from just a few countries in the world with india having most of the plants china and one in europe they are estimating imports have risen from 100 tons to 224 tons and their demand is 70 tons
mr chairman i ask unanimous consent to claim the time in opposition though i am not opposed to the amendment
mr chairman i rise to ask my colleagues support for this amendment which seeks to obtain vital information necessary for congressional oversight of our policies in afghanistan
i first want to commend the gentleman from illinois mr hyde xz4001920 for his leadership in bringing this legislation before the house
chairman hyde has been a consistent champion in the fight against international drug trafficking and i thank him for his tireless efforts in that regard
mr chairman extradition is one of the most important tools in the struggle against international narcoterrorism
we need to be very sure that tool is functioning properly in afghanistan the epicenter of the world s heroin trade
as we vote to keep our troops still in afghanistan they are not being shot at by missiles and bullets and guns bought by making microcomputers or by sales from their local walmart
the men and women dying in afghanistan are dying because of illegal narcotics and the heroin trade which funded al qaeda and the taliban when they were in charge of afghanistan and continues to fund those who are shooting at us
to do that we need information here in congress
because of that although i know that the committee supports this i am going to ask for a rollcall vote because i believe it is important that we in a bipartisan way go on record and say we must pursue in afghanistan for the protection of our soldiers and families and workers all over the world as heroin pours out of afghanistan at three times the level of anything that ever happened under the taliban
the greatest flow of heroin in world history is occurring now and we have to get to the traffickers behind this
they have been yeomen in the fight against narcotics human trafficking terrorism and in defense of international human rights
i again want to commend the gentleman from illinois mr hyde xz4001920 for his assistance in getting this muchneeded help for drug interdiction throughout the world
the amendment i propose seeks to build on the efforts of the gentleman from illinois chairman hyde by authorizing the state department s bureau for international narcotics and law enforcement affairs inl to acquire a refueling vessel for the benefit of the us and allied drug interdiction activities such as the us coast guard and navy operating in the eastern pacific region
us vessels have no refueling capability in that area often coming from san diego and thus can not operate for any significant length of time
today we face an almost unique situation in drug interdiction history
we now have more intelligence about drug trafficking than assets to act on it meaning that we have to watch helplessly while some shipments of poisonous narcotics are brought to the us the testimony provided to the subcommittee by federal agencies has indicated that the acquisition of a refueling vessel would be of significant benefit in stopping this gaping hole
by allowing coast guard and other ships to carry out longer patrols in the eastern pacific region we will no longer be at such major logistical disadvantage visavis the drug kingpins
again i thank the gentleman from illinois mr hyde xz4001920 for his leadership and support in the fight against drug trafficking and i urge my colleagues to support this amendment
mr chairman i yield myself such time as i may consume to engage in a colloquy with the gentleman from new jersey mr smith
mr chairman i would like to seek the support of the chairman in acquiring three cables from the state department one cable from the us embassy in kabul describing the lack of assistance from the afghan government on heroin trade and two cables from the us embassy in bogota regarding lack of us support thus far for the demobilization program
it is important that we have a bipartisan effort to send a message whether it is to methamphetamine traffickers pseudoephedrine cocaine traffickers around the world or heroin traffickers in afghan
i thank the leadership of the committee for their support on these important amendments so we can in a bipartisan way make a dent in this terrible scourge drug use
is obviously in need of serious reform
unless they make real and substantial reforms in the way they operate
i think you can think over it in terms of a glass half full half empty his 50 percent
i think the american people understandably have sort of lost faith in the united nations
i think in real dollars and real impact this will be more important to move it to 75 percent
in this dream he was puzzling how much to withhold from the un
until they enact the necessary reform so in his great wisdom
as he sat in his chair in my dream he set in a magnificent chair and there were clouds and harps all around him and he was deliberating very carefully whether to do 50 percent or 75 percent
but i could tell in this dream that in his heart of hearts he wanted to have 75 percent
so mr chairman the dream i had of you convinced me that i should come down to the house floor today and offer 75 percent as a humble way to extend your feelings that were in my dream
mr chairman i yield myself the balance of my time and i would say to the gentleman from california mr lantos xz4002310 that tonight i will try to get more sleep because i have spent so much more time dreaming and perhaps tonight he will be in my dreams
my colleagues when you come down to the house floor to vote on the amendment i want you to vote yes for the stearns amendment because in your heart of hearts in fact in the heart of hearts of chairman hyde in my dream he wanted 75 percent
mr chairman i rise in strong support of hr 2745 the henry j hyde united nations reform act of 2005
over the past few years we have witnessed a united nations mired in scandal
oilforfood program was a glaring failure that served only to benefit a tyrant and keep the iraqi people in a state of despondency and despair
as a result the oilforfood program has become the biggest scandal in the history of the un
in congo and bosnia un
in sierra leone peacekeepers were accused of systematically raping women
these actions are reprehensible in any society and unbecoming to an organization whose founding charter is dedicated to the promotion and respect for human rights and maintaining international peace and security
in recent years the un
mr chairman i rise in support of the kennedyhooley amendment to hr 2601
the us department of justice estimates that 90 percent of the meth available in nebraska is trafficked from superlabs operated by drug cartels in mexico california and the southwestern states
it requires the us state department to report and certify that countries heavily involved in the import or export of pseudoephedrine a key meth ingredient are cooperating with local law enforcement agencies to prevent its misuse and diversion
in omaha nebraska seven of nine law enforcement jurisdictions identify meth as the drug that most contributes to violent crime
omaha policemen tell me that meth is now the drug of choice for gangs in north omaha replacing crack cocaine and heroin
sixty percent of inmates in nebraska jails have problems with meth and the toll on families in nebraska is incalculable
i urge my colleagues to join me in voting for the kennedyhooley amendment to help stop meth smuggling for mexican drug cartels and support our law enforcement officers
mr chairman i rise in support of the hooleysouder amendment to hr 2601
this amendment will authorize 4 million in 2006 and 2007 to help prevent the smuggling of methamphetamine from mexico to the united states
the us department of justice estimates that 90 percent of the meth available in my home state of nebraska is trafficked from mexico california and the southwestern states
during a routine traffic stop last january the douglas county sheriff s office in nebraska seized five pounds of meth from two mexican nationals who had concealed the drug inside a spare tire in the trunk
in march an 8month investigation culminated in the arrest of five mexican and hispanic drug cartel members
although 90 percent of the meth problem in nebraska stems from international and intrastate drug trafficking local law enforcement officers must spend the majority of their resources fighting homebased meth labs
the hooleysouder amendment is critical to support our police officers on the front lines in the battle against meth
i urge my colleagues to join me in voting for the hooleysouder amendment today
i am not opposed to the ostensible purpose of the bill in fact i share the view that the united nations needs to be improved so it can better carry out its indispensable role
helped with elections in afghanistan and iraq and helped negotiate the withdrawal of syrian forces from lebanon
in the areas of budgeting oversight and accountability peacekeeping and human rights
but if the secretary of state can not certify that the reforms have been achieved starting in 2007 the secretary would be required to withhold 50 percent of the us assessed contributions to the un s regular budget
peacekeeping missions including involvement in a crisis like the one taking place in darfur until the peacekeeping reforms called for by the bill have been completed
in short the bill as it stands would simultaneously demand reform and make it impossible to achieve
the substitute included benchmarks very much like those in the base bill but it gave flexibility to the secretary of state to mandate the 50 percent cuts to our un
similarly the substitute did not link the change from assessed to voluntary contributions to withholding a portion of our dues and it would have allowed the secretary of state to waive the peacekeeping reform requirements if it is determined that a new mission is in the us national interest
the difference between the bill now before us and the lantosshays substitute is that while the substitute was realistic in the way it set out a path toward reform the majority s bill if fully implemented would effectively destroy the chances of achieving an effective and improved un
member countries in the process of reform and provide the un
i do not often agree with them but i do in this instance and i therefore must vote against the bill
mr chairman i rise in support of the lantos substitute
mr chairman i rise to speak in support of the substitute legislation offered by the ranking member of the house international relations committee mr tom lantos
it is the only international body that allows those countries that support the united states and those that do not to sit down in peaceful dialogue to address issues of concern and to work together
we should not tie the hands of our secretary of state nor should we give those who do not support the united states an issue in which to embarrass us
again the flexibility contained in the substitute is preferable to hr 2745
mr chairman the united states is the world leader and we should be a leader in all areas including serving as a model country in its relationships to the world community
this means pushing for reforms in the united nations when such reforms are necessary but it also means being a good citizen and doing our part to fulfill our responsibilities and to be a good world citizen
mr chairman i rise to commend the gentleman from illinois mr hyde xz4001920 and the gentleman from california mr lantos xz4002310 and the gentleman from new jersey mr smith xz4003801 and the members of the committee on international relations for their work in bringing this legislation to the floor today
through the cooperation and work of the gentleman from illinois mr hyde xz4001920 and the gentleman from california mr lantos xz4002310 and the gentleman from new jersey mr smith xz4003801 much of that legislation has been included in the state department authorization bill
the secretary of state is also directed to prepare an annual report on democracy which will designate countries as nondemocratic or democratic transition countries there is so much else in this bill but before i run out of time i want to thank the gentleman from illinois mr hyde xz4001920 again and the gentleman from california mr lantos xz4002310 and the gentleman from new jersey mr smith xz4003801 and i want to give my special thanks to the gentleman from illinois mr hyde xz4001920 not just for his work on this legislation and for his support for our advance democracy effort but i want to thank him for his dedication to preserving freedom and protecting the innocent throughout his many years in public service
mr chairman i can remember being on the floor late at night during the situation with regard to the contras down in nicaragua and following the leadership of the gentleman from illinois mr hyde xz4001920 on all of these issues
cedaw is a united nations treaty that supports international standards to discourage sexbased discrimination and encourages equality in education health care employment and all other arenas of public life for all women around the world
the impact of cedaw can be seen in countries like australia where the government cited its treaty obligations in passing national legislation against sexual harassment in the workplace based on cedaw or in pakistan where education for young women was introduced in primary schools after treaty ratification in pakistan causing sharp increases in female enrollment in their schools
sadly the united states continues to be the only industrialized nation that has not ratified leaving us in the company of afghanistan north korea and iran
was established in order to promote international cooperation and peace between nations
is in desperate need of reform
peacekeepers in africa including accusations of sexual abuse of the very people they are there to protect

in closing mr chairman i urge my colleagues to support this bill
mr speaker i rise today in support of the rule and the bill
women do better here than anyplace in the world
oilforfood program to its lack of action with respect to the genocide in darfur to the horrendous human rights abuses by un
peacekeeping staff during their mission in the congo what did they care about cedaw
counts some of the world s leading human rights violators and state sponsors of terrorism among its membership and even taps many of them to be in leadership positions on its subcommittees
mr speaker i rise today in support of this rule and bill and thank mr hyde xz4001920 for his service and this bill
has failed miserably to put these ideals into practice especially in recent years
oil for food program to its lack of action with respect to the genocide in darfur sudan to the horrendous human rights abuses by un

counts some of the world s leading human rights violators and state sponsors of terrorism among its membership and even taps many of them to be in leadership positions on its subcommittees
mr speaker i am proud to rise in support of the rule and the henry j hyde un
reform act and just as proud to rise in tribute to the gentleman from illinois mr hyde xz4001920
we need an organization of nations that cares about human rights but we need a united group of nations that believes more in the rights of individuals than it believes that the right of individuals is to plunder others
the united nations at its inception was one of the most noble undertakings in modern human history
its vision was of world governments working in concert to ameliorate if not eradicate world problems
it is counterintuitive to financially reward countries whose motivation is in opposition to american efforts
in order to correct this problem of incongruity i propose a simple solution
my amendment would cause the united states to end all financial assistance to those countries who vote against us more than 50 percent of the time in the united nations
is currently an inefficient bureaucratic organization badly in need of reform and too often it has become a forum for radical antiamerican rhetoric and policies that would violate many of our nation s most cherished freedoms laws customs and recognized human rights
my constituents in east texas have told me i have heard it around the country time and time again they are fed up with this antiamerican rhetoric coming out of the un
accordingly and in conclusion we do not have to pay these countries to hate us
in response and of course i have nothing but utmost respect for the gentleman from illinois mr hyde xz4001920 and it is a pleasure for me to support your amendment and all three of the distinguished gentlemen that spoke bring up a good point
the secretary of state does need flexibility and that is why in this amendment i provided flexibility
if the secretary of state certifies that there has been such a change in the regime attitudewise personnelwise that he or she firmly believes that the next session they will be voting with us more than half the time then that makes an exception and they will get funding
it extends in whole if they are going to vote with us more than 50 percent of the time
as a former judge i believe in consequences for bad conduct and of course when improper behavior takes place i do not believe in saying to the perpetrator no matter who it is try to do a little better
thanks to the leadership of the gentleman from illinois mr hyde xz4001920 and the gentleman from california mr lantos xz4002310 and others in congress the united states has begun the tough task of investigating the scandals which the united nations is ridden with
but in my opinion the united states will never be able to hold the united nations accountable if we do not know where our aid our money is going once we hand it over to the united nations
it would be my hope that other committees would work so well in getting the job done
a brutal campaign of village burnings destruction of rice supplies and killings by burma s military regime has resulted in the forcible displacement of between 500 000 and 1 million innocent civilians in eastern burma
hundreds of thousands of these internal refugees that are called internally displaced peoples or idps they are persecuted for their strong commitment to democracy and their fervent belief in human rights
secretary of state rice has rightfully called burma one of the six outposts of tyranny in the world
with all this said virtually no humanitarian aid reaches those who have been driven from their homes in eastern burma
shockingly as a result of attacks and blocking this aid child mortality and malnutrition rates are comparable to those recorded among the internally displaced population in the horn of africa
acute respiratory infections diarrhea malaria anemia are serious problems in this region
this is a bona fide humanitarian crisis which we in the united states need to address
mr speaker today i rise in support of the rule and this important piece of legislation
world leaders gathered in 1945 to implement a vision that began with president woodrow wilson s league of nations was conceived by president franklin roosevelt and brought into existence by harry truman now known as the united nations
madam speaker the second secretarygeneral of the united nations dag hammarskjold commented during his tenure that the united nations was not created to take humanity to heaven but save it from hell a keen observation on the fundamental tensions present in such a massive and massively important institution
and each of them in addition to the bill we are debating today is circling around the same group of reforms
but hr 2745 would stir up exactly that resentment in its current form resentment that will kill any hope for change
in closing madam speaker the united nations has a genuine opportunity to reform and with our leadership the potential for great success
mr chairman i speak in rabid opposition to this amendment not because i oppose the total intent of it but because it is legislating on an appropriations bill
if it were to pass and remain in the bill it would make the committee on energy and commerce much more difficult on reconciliation
mr chairman i rise in as strong as possible opposition to the hinchey amendment
but whereas yesterday the pbs station in the local market was maybe the third or fourth station today it may be one of dozens of stations and if you count cable it may be one of hundreds
having said that i think there is a role for public television in the marketplace
in last year s presidential debates i am told that many many viewers who watched not the debates but the campaigns seemed to think that npr was simply for the bushhaters
in fact i had a constituent come up to me and say well we have now heard from the bushhaters after listening to an npr news commentary
what we really have here in my opinion is to some extent perhaps a personal vendetta against the current head of cpb a gentleman named mr tomlinson
he apparently in trying to be balanced is to some of my friends on the other side of the aisle indicating that he is maybe going too far
mr chairman i rise in strong opposition to the hayworth amendment
my hometown of las vegas looked to gaming many years ago and now it has the one of the most vibrant economies in the country
and the people working in indian gaming on the reservations have the right and are entitled to the protections of the nlrb
i encourage the indian tribes and the tribal workers and the labor unions to work together to protect workers like they have done in las vegas
mr chairman today i rise to express my deep concerns about how this bill falls 16 billion short in funding our nation s most critically important domestic priorities particularly education
in that time i came to fully understand how difficult it is for students and their families to afford college
but for the fourth straight year congress has shortchanged students by cutting billions of dollars from the authorized level under law 132 billion short of what is authorized for fy 06 and over 40 billion short since its enactment in 2001
while in the past year alone tuition has increased an average of 105 percent at 4year public universities this bill provides only a modest 50 increase in the maximum pell grant a full 1 000 short of what the president promised in 2001
and ironically at a time when this administration and republican congress talk about morality and family values in public affairs this bill cuts local public tv and radio funds for childrens shows like sesame street and reading rainbow
today an affluent student in the bottom percentile of their class is more likely to go to college than an economically disadvantaged student at the top of their class
the lack of a significant increase in the pell grant comes at a time when changes to the tax allowance formula used to calculate the department of education s expected family contribution eliminated pell grant awards for over 90 000 students and reduced scholarships for an additional 13 million students
for the second year in a row this bill also freezes funding for supplemental education opportunity grants seog and college work study
this is the second year in a row that seog and workstudy have received flat funding
i am astonished to see that the department of education will see its smallest increase in a decade which comes at a time when school districts across the nation are struggling to come up with adequate funding to address the unfunded mandates of president bush s no child left behind
this vote signaled the bipartisan support that can be rallied to overrule the ideologically driven agenda of some in congress
millions of people across the country contacted congress this week in support of cpb and the overwhelming vote in favor of the amendment to restore funding 284140 87 republican and every democrat in support is an indication of the more reasonable approach the country expects from congress
i will not support a bill that falls so short in meeting america s needs in fact creates more disparities
mr chairman the arts motivate and inspire people of all ages to engage in learning and that is what this is all about
students that attend arts courses are shown to have better attendance lower dropout rates participate in more community service and have a higher selfesteem
that sounds to me like a pretty darn good investment in the youth of america
mr chairman i agree with the gentleman from florida mr keller xz4002120 that the pell grant program plays an essential role in helping disadvantaged students pursue a college education
i further applaud my colleague and a member of our committee from florida mr keller xz4002120 for his strong leadership in supporting the pell grant program and as chairman of the pell grant caucus and for his sharing with us his personal experiences as a former pell grant recipient
funding for pell grants doubled in the last 10 years and today we are proposing to add more than 1 billion in additional funding
he has been a strong advocate on behalf of education programs and it has been a privilege to work with him in support of our priorities
mr chairman i rise in opposition to the gentleman from california s mr honda xz4001850 amendment
the gentleman talks about two distinct and particular points in his amendment
and the agreement that we came to on the floor of this house in a very broad bipartisan way was that to the extent that a school sells or shares student data they must treat military recruiters in a nondiscriminatory way or in other words treat all people who would want access to this data to have access to it in the same way
it has been a wonderful career for tens of millions of americans and the fact is that the practice is going on in far too many schools discriminates against the needs of our military
we have dealt with this issue in a comprehensive way in no child left behind and we did it in a broad bipartisan way
mr chairman i rise in opposition to the amendment
that led to the taxpayerteacher protection act which was crafted to immediately halt the practice while ensuring that this issue would ultimately and permanently be addressed in the higher education reauthorization act
and we do expect that we will look at this in a comprehensive way
and while i share some of the concerns of my colleague from maryland mr van hollen xz4004150 we have got to be very careful as to how we proceed in this area
but as the committee deals with the higher education reauthorization next month in both the subcommittee and full subcommittee there is no question that this issue will be dealt with in its entirety
i would really like to ask him to withdraw the amendment and allow the regular process the regular order to occur in the committee
but here is the problem some of these nonprofits student loan lenders around the country have these bonds in place for the next 5 10 some even 15 years
and secondly the committee is in fact going to deal with this
if you want to do something about the increase in medicaid spending do something about rising health care costs do something about inflated prescription drug costs do something about health care infomercials and glossy drug advertising do something about medical errors come up with a responsible medical malpractice reform plan
it may be more difficult to confront health care costs directly than to make a scapegoat of the medicaid program but we are not in office to take the easy path
we are in office to take the right path
so in that vein i ask members of this body to support the brown amendment on medicaid
mr chairman many americans seeking disability benefits under the social security disability insurance program more commonly know as ssdi face intolerable delays in the processing of their claims
these delays have hit home in my ohio district
one constituent bobbi from sheffield ohio a single mom injured in an auto accident in 2001 exhausted her life savings and was forced onto welfare while she waited
another constituent ronald from elyria ohio has a heart condition that left him disabled in 2001 but he had to wait 3 years for benefits
this bill provides a badlyneeded increase in administrative funding for the social security administration
i support the ssa administrative funding provision in this bill
i urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the ssa administrative funding level in this bill
mr chairman unfortunately in the uc agreement that we have before us the wrong amendment is listed
it was supposed to be on the reading is fundamental program which is much more appropriate to this title and i have asked the chairman if he would engage in a colloquy
my amendment which could not be introduced because of the error specified that 25 296 000 in the school improvements program be dedicated specifically to the reading is fundamental program
i seek assurances from the chairman that this program will receive adequate funding when the final numbers are decided in the conference with the senate
additionally 55 percent of all fourth graders eligible for free or reduced lunch score below what is called the basic this sad state of affairs is perpetuated as 40 million adults in the us can not even read a simple child s story
it provides new books to children in many communities and last year alone reading is fundamental provided 17 million new free books to close to 5 million kids across the country
i would like to learn more from the chairman about his views on this program and if he will assist in making sure that funding is appropriated
mr chairman i rise to express my strong support for the chairman regula s amendment and urge my colleagues to vote in favor of increased funding for programs aimed at getting veterans into jobs
their mission is to train disabled veteran outreach program specialists and local veterans employment representatives dvops and lvers how to place veterans who are seeking employment in goodpaying jobs
that means that more dvops and lvers will get basic and advanced training in such skills as case management compliance investigation job coaching promoting partnerships presentation skills and transition assistance for those being discharged
for a program cost of a little over 2 200 per job placement averaging about 925 per hour an hvrp client potentially returns about 2 800 in taxes per year to the federal government
i call that a good investment in human capital
mr chairman this is a good amendment that every member can take pride in and i urge my colleagues to vote yes
mr chairman i rise in strong support of the brown amendment
they are the indispensable link in ensuring that these 55 million people medicaid serves get the health care they need
the challenges we face in medicaid are not caused by medicaid
it will just pass the buck to those around us those in society who have the least and who are the neediest
in indianapolis indiana we have over 100 000 medicare recipients and in indiana we have over 877 000
people in nursing homes die unexpectedly and workers not all of them of course steal social security numbers and abuse them before the social security administration has an opportunity to close down that particular number
and i would again commend the gentleman from california mr filner xz4001330 for his insight and foresight in bringing this very vital issue to the congress
mr chairman i am a strong supporter of tribal sovereignty but rise in reluctant opposition to this amendment because it has not been subject to full debate in committee or the house
congress s intent in preserving sovereignty has been recognized even recently in 1991 in oklahoma tax common v potawatomi tribe the supreme court reaffirmed the longstanding existence and importance of tribal sovereignty in light of this court s reaffirmation in a number of cases of its longstanding doctrine of tribal sovereign immunity and congress consistent reiteration of its approval of the doctrine in order to promote indian selfgovernment selfsufficiency and economic development the court is not disposed to modify or abandon the doctrine of sovereign immunity
tribal sovereignty is and should remain one of the fundamental principles of the united states and we should not define its parameters in a ten minute debate
mr chairman i rise in strong support of the millerschakowskycrowley amendment and urge all our members here in the house to support it
the carrier has warned in the past that its growing obligation poses a threat to restructure and avoid a bankruptcy filing
it plays well on some radio and television stations but in reality it will have no effect
in the state of new york our constitution requires that every child be afforded an education whether that child is a legal citizen and resident or an undocumented alien or their parents are
it will just be a chilling effect on all people who question their status in this country and they will then not go and get the care that they need to protect the rest of our children
mr chairman i rise today in opposition to the proposed cuts of more than 100 million to the corporation for public broadcasting
i support the mission of the corporation for public broadcasting in its goal of providing the public with education and informative media sources
in a time when much furor exists over the decency of much of what is broadcast on our televisions and radios it is only logical that congress support an organization that has held traditional values to a high standard which is reflected in its programming
i have been in the highway conference and i am sorry i was not here earlier but i understand the chairman may have represented that aarp is opposed
we are saying one small section buried in this huge bill that no member here wants to take credit for that says we are taking away the privacy of seniors to profit private insurance companies and make it easier for them
they can find these seniors in other ways
they are at risk in this whole process and they do not want those telemarketing phone calls
this is plain and simple something that i do not believe a majority of this house knew was in that bill when it was passed
mr chairman i rise to express my concern that funding for title vii programs have been cut in this bill
the house showed great leadership last year by providing 300 million in funding and i believe that any decrease could hamper the programs ability to train health professionals to care for the neediest populations
the president s budget proposes for the fifth year in a row to eliminate many of the programs that educate and train a variety of health care providers such as pharmacists dentists and pediatricians
for a number of years now i have organized members to express support for this important program and urged the appropriators to fully fund it in the laborhealth and human serviceseducation bill
the title vii health professions programs are also the only federal programs designed to train providers in interdisciplinary settings to respond to the needs of special and underserved populations
the programs have shown to increase minority representation in the health care workforce which i believe is absolutely essential for our health system
on january 6 the department of labor entered into an agreement with walmart to settle violations of child labor laws in 3 states connecticut new hampshire and arkansas
perhaps the most egregious part of the agreement is the provision 6b that grants walmart 15 days advance notice before the government investigates any wageandhour law complaints notice that applies not just to child labor complaints in the three cited states but all walmart stores nationwide
in 2000 walmart was found to have 1 436 violations in 20 maine stores
and if we need any proof of that i would point my colleagues to the weekend papers in connecticut which cite a state investigation that found 11 more violations of child labor laws at three of our walmart stores
in fact the governor of connecticut has ordered periodic unannounced visits by state inspectors at walmart stores to ensure that any future violations are promptly revealed and addressed
our society long ago stopped tolerating the kind of sweatshop conditions that my mother worked in when i was growing up
nor did they provide for a 10day window for the company to come into compliance in the event of child labor violations
mr speaker i ask unanimous consent that the minimum time for electronic voting on any motion to recommit may be 5 minutes notwithstanding that it would be the first vote in a series
mr chairman i rise in strongest opposition to the miller amendment
five unions have been involved in the negotiation process here to ensure that over 60 000 people are able to keep their jobs and a very very important company continues to remain alive
mr chairman the fact that there is a funding crisis in va hospitals this year to the tune of 1 billion should be a surprise to no one
on march 23 2004 the legislative directors of the disabled american veterans the paralyzed veterans of america and the veterans of foreign wars said that passage of the budget resolution as presented would be a disservice to those men and women who serve this country and who are currently serving in iraq afghanistan and around the world in the fight against terrorism
veterans groups knew it democrats in this body knew it democrats in the other body knew it
in fact i made a specific effort in the emergency appropriation bill for iraq to get additional funding for va hospitals this year but was rebuffed by the house leadership that said that money was not necessary
now just 60 days later they admit there is a 1 billion crisis in funding
i would welcome a bipartisan effort in trying to address the funding needs for veterans
for that reason this amendment was not in the unanimous consent order
mr chairman i rise today in support of the markeyemanuel amendment which is part of the en bloc amendment proposed by chairman regula
it requires patients to be notified if their medical records contained in the new national health information network are lost stolen or used for unauthorized purposes
in the 108th congress i introduced legislation to protect credit consumers sensitive medical information
mr chairman major data security breaches are occurring on a daily basis and identity theft is the fastestgrowing white collar crime in the country
today over 1 million individuals in the united states are infected with hiv including about 406 000 with aids
over 30 percent of those infected in new york city are women and 75 percent are from minority groups
like many of our colleagues i was deeply disappointed that the critical aids drug assistance programs known as adaps only received a 10 million increase in this year s laborhhs appropriations bill
they have become a cornerstone of the ryan white care act since advances in drug treatments like antiretroviral therapies have had a profound effect on extending the quality and length of life of those infected with hivaids
appropriate and consistent treatment results in near complete suppression of hiv as well as preventing the emergence of drug resistance
even with this emergency measure as of may 12 of this year almost 1 900 individuals were on adap waiting lists in 10 states
now mr chairman it has come to my attention that many states have ryan white care act funds appropriated to them in previous legislative years that are at risk for expiration
the unspent funds typically result in delays in notice of grant awards from the federal government timing issues relating to subcontracting of services payroll savings due to state hiring delays or freezes expenditure of other grant funds for similar services or other unanticipated fluctuations in spending at the state level
in the meantime it is unfortunate that cbo scored my amendment as a new appropriation as preserving these expiring previously appropriated funds would have given states a new window of opportunity to help more people
mr chairman for the balance of my time i would like my friend the gentleman from ohio mr regula xz4003340 the chairman of the subcommittee to engage me in a brief colloquy
i would ask the chairman if he would work with me in this regard
mr chairman i rise today to urge that full funding for title vii health professions programs be restored in the fy 2006 laborhhs bill
the elimination of funding for valuable programs such as the area health education center ahec and the health education and training center hetc would have an immediate damaging impact on medical education care and research especially in the state of new york
title vii authorizes grants for important programs designed to address problems such as recruitment and retention of providers for health centers shortages in nursing and allied health and the underrepresentation of minorities in the health care professions
these healthcare training programs are the only federal programs designed to increase the supply of primary medical care providers and public health professionals in underserved areas such as inner cities and rural regions throughout the country
in addition these programs seek to train more health professionals in fields experiencing shortages improve the geographic distribution of health care personnel and enhance minority representation in the pool of practicing health professionals
in fy 2005 new york institutions received over 20 million in title vii programs
however continual annual budget cuts pose a great risk to health care in the state of new york
without federal funding the ahec system will be greatly hindered in its ability to address the problems of access to health care diversity of the health care workforce and recruitment and retention of health care professionals in medically underserved areas
mr chairman i rise in opposition to hr 3010 the departments of labor health and human services and education fiscal year 2006 appropriations act
as the only former state schools chief serving in congress i know firsthand the devastating effects that these education cuts will have
in rural communities it is often hard to find a doctor and emergency rooms can be dangerously far away
activities that would be terminated include initiatives designed to encourage new medical and dental school graduates to choose primary care specialties and to practice in rural and urban underserved areas
mr chairman everyone in this house and everyone in this country knows that identity theft is one of the fastest growing crimes of our decade and creates a nightmare for those who become victims
part of that peril is in fact contributed to by the federal government
i find it strange that the distinguished chairman and the distinguished chairwoman both of whom are well known for their support of medicare social security and seniors in this nation would object to what is really just a bureaucratic change a change that can be done through computers in a very quick fashion
i introduced a similar bill to stop the irs from putting social security numbers on its mailings and the irs found a way in short time to stop the practice that could lead to identity theft
it is about time this congress said to a bureaucracy cut the fooling around break through the red tape and protect our seniors and all our families in america from identity theft
this ruling did just come out and in arizona we have i think the largest number of charter schools in the nation
in this case that is who they are serving and the ruling simply came out and said if they are structured as a forprofit they can not receive funds anymore
keep in mind these are title i funds
and for a school to be told all right you are not going to receive them anymore these are disadvantaged kids in most respects that are going to be held at a loss
what we are saying is simply if the department of education needs clarification we can do that with reauthorization but do not in the middle of a process say to these schools we are going to treat you differently just because of how you are structured although we did not think it before now we think it is different
our federal government says to hospitals you have to treat whoever comes in your door
it is not just the border hospitals in arizona
it is hospitals in tucson
it is hospitals in phoenix
it is just eating us alive in arizona not just health care costs but education costs criminal justice costs across the board
they simply are doing what the federal government tells them to do in terms of admitting patients and under this they would simply say sorry we ca nt fund it
but let us not bury our heads in the sand
mr chairman i have been concerned about a program known as youth build which i know many members are familiar with which is a very good program which gets young people in urban areas and elsewhere to learn how to build houses
the president in his budget proposed i think 50 million for it but proposed that instead of being funded out of the hud budget it be transferred to the labor department s budget
that led to i guess it falling between the cracks of the two appropriate subcommittees so that while i understand there is support for the program and the gentleman from new york mr walsh xz4004200 a former chairman of the hud subcommittee tells me that he strongly supports it and i understand there was a very close vote in the appropriations committee on an amendment to put it back into the bill both bills now come to the floor so i would ask the chairman of the subcommittee given the i believe support it was in the president s budget there was virtually a tie vote in the appropriations committee could the gentleman tell me is there some hope that we can give to these young people that this important program will survive
could we get it in the bill next week
mr chairman if the gentleman would yield further does that mean and maybe we can discuss this again in the transportation hud bill but that since it is not a large sum of money the president supports it it has a lot of support here that we can expect at some point in the process before we finish the appropriations this program could be funded
mr chairman i rise in support of this bipartisan amendment because it is important not only to the state of arizona but to the entire nation
my good friend a member of the committee on appropriations pointed out that charter schools are public schools that charter schools in fact offer services to children with special needs
and we can not stand by and allow the department of education by bureaucratic fiat to decide to cut off these funds to deserving children in what are public schools as set forth by state standards
and just as arizona has taken the lead in terms of formation and the flourishing of charter schools we want to see the funds there for the children who deserve them
mr chairman in may 2004 the national labor relations board overturned 30 years of its own precedent and ruled that it has jurisdiction over tribal government enterprises located on tribes own sovereign lands
where tribal law has governed relations between tribes and their employees the nlrb seeks to replace that law with its authority in this area
ironically the nlrb specifically ruled against the san manuel band of mission indians a tribe based in southern california that has enacted into its tribal law a tribal labor relations ordinance with greater labor union rights than the national labor relations act
in fact the tribe has a collective bargaining agreement with the communication workers of america
the heavyhanded activist nlrb overlaid an incompatible legal regime where a tribal one agreed to on a governmenttogovernment basis with the state of california was in place and was working
mr chairman my colleagues we would do well to heed the marketing advice what happens in vegas stays in vegas
he admits that in a governmenttogovernment relationship as the san manuel band has done already they actually put together an agreement with greater union rights than the nlra
tribes should have the sovereign ability to decide that if they want to bring in those expansion of rights yes
yet what we are hearing here is that somehow the very worst in human nature would come out
it is not situational no matter what some leaders in the aflcio may say
during the course of my previous presentation was the extracurricular activity outburst included in my time when others sought control of the microphone
mr chairman the choice is simple either you support the premises of sovereignty as reflected in article i section 8 of the constitution or you equivocate or you try to give the national labor relations board preeminence over the constitution of the united states
this is a mechanism where we can actually correct the wrong and put in place what had stood 30 years previously respecting sovereignty
i thank both sides for their cooperation on this and though we may have sincere differences in the challenges of the day i do appreciate everyone s constructive attitude on this amendment
what i am rising to do is to cut the level of funding in this appropriation bill by 1 percent
by voting for my amendment you are stating to the american taxpayers that they should not have to pay higher taxes in the future because we can control our spending today
as hard as the chairman and ranking member have worked on this bill there are still many wonderful things in the bill very meritorious things in the bill but things that do not have to be done some of them
this fiscal year s 2006 laborhhs appropriations bill provides over 1425 billion in total discretionary resources
and we have seen discretionary spending increase in this bill by an average of more than 5 percent a year over the last 5 years even though it is less this year than it was last year
mr chairman congress created the corporation for public broadcasting in 1967 to encourage the development of a public broadcasting system and just as importantly to shield public broadcasting from any political interference
despite this clear directive kenneth tomlinson the chairman of the corporation has engaged in a deliberate campaign to politicize public broadcasting and interfere with the content of public television and radio stations across the country
this is political intimidation in the truest and worst sense of the term and we must stamp it out today with this amendment
the united states of america is already suffering from a shortage of independent voices in the media
at the rate tomlinson is going it is only a matter of time before he changes pbs name to fox2 and starts forcing big bird and elmo to talk about the merits of the war in iraq or the value of privatizing social security
months later however congress passed legislation that will put millions of people s personal information and privacy in jeopardy
in light of the number of significant breaches of personal information recently and the widespread reports of identity theft this amendment would prevent the government from distributing the personal information of millions of americans to the many companies that may be providing prescription drug plans when the socalled medicaid modernization act goes into effect
during the 108th congress over 400 members voted in favor of creating the do not call registry
i appreciate the sentiments expressed by the gentleman from ohio my good friend and i understand that he is interested in the best interests of the people in this country particularly the medicare and medicaid beneficiaries
but the fact of the matter is we have experience in this regard
mr chairman i rise in opposition to this amendment because if passed this measure will place extreme financial and legal hardships on border and urban hospitals
because this measure addresses emergency medical care our hospitals and our doctors are bound by law and their medical oath to treat individuals who are in desperate need of medical attention
either way this measure results in a dramatic cut in access to health care facilities for all residents
this measure is irresponsible impractical and will destroy healthcare in american communities especially in border states
therefore i respectfully ask my colleagues to vote no on this amendment and yes to safeguarding access to health care in all cities
mr chairman i rise in support of parents and students within my own silicon district and from parents and students across this country
parents in my district complain to me that their children were being persistently contacted at home by military recruiters
ideally this decision should be made in consultation with people who love and care for the child not with a government official however well intentioned whose very job is to recruit for the military
as a policymaker and former high school teacher and principal i am concerned with the increasing pressure faced by schools and school districts due to cuts in the federal dollars of education
schools should not be in a position to choose between students and federal funding
what they will not tell you is that in the past 2 years before the passage of this provision the military exceeded recruiting goals
our nation has the best trained and most powerful armed forces in the world and maintaining our military superiority depends upon effective recruiting
students have neither the ability to confirm nor correct information in its data base
in the transition back to civilian life they are encountering problems ranging from difficulties finding employment to being passed over for promotions to getting laid off under suspicious circumstances
mr chairman those who believe in privacy and not being dictated to by the us congress in their most private intimate decisions should vote against this amendment
two friends of mine my age recently went in for prostate treatment
when you go in for prostate cancer they tell you you have a choice of various alternatives
we all have native americans in our states and we have gaming
and sovereignty is not inconsistent with international treaties which ensure that that happens in nations around the world
let me just say that my colleagues need to understand that the administration believes in this structured agreement a totalization agreement because they understand that when americans are overseas working and getting benefits that they would like those americans to ensure that their benefits go with them
if the language does not do that i would say to my colleagues that if this is a good resolution we certainly will join in with it
social security is a contract you put money in you get money out
this amendment would denigrate the hard work of thousands of workers who have spent their lives working hard in this great nation
i believe in an american in which you get what you put in
in 1988 1989 when the ryan white care act was initially authorized texas was number 13 on the list of hivinfected persons
in addition we have seen it increasing in other populations hispanics and asians
in particular in my community the donald watkins foundation brentwood st
mr speaker i rise today to speak in support of mr engel s amendment to the hr 3010 the labor hhs appropriations bill
mr engel s amendment would grant states an extension to use their expiring unexpended ryan white care act funds appropriated in previous years through fiscal year 2006
these amounts typically ranging from five or ten percent of overall awards may be requested in the subsequent fiscal year to provide services during that fiscal year
the unspent funds typically result from delays in notice of grant awards from the federal government timing issues related to subcontracting of services payroll savings due to state hiring delays or freezes expenditure of other grant funds for similar services or other unanticipated fluctuations in spending at the state level
in closing it is important for me to say a few words about ryan white
having found relative peace in cicero ryan white began a nationwide campign to help educate communities about hivaids
his inscesant work landed him in washington dc to testify before the president s commission on aids
his words works and wills were enshrined in the ryan white care comprehensive aids resource emergency act signed 4 months after his death april 8 1990
mr chairman i rise in support of the proposals that seek to prohibit the use of funds in the bill to distribute the personal information of medicare and medicaid beneficiaries to private companies for marketing purposes
according to data more people were covered by medicare and medicaid in 2003 than in 2002 while the percentage and number of people covered by their employers fell from 613 percent 1753 million people to 604 percent 174 million people
the medicaid and medicare databases were not created for the purpose of business development therefore the information contained in these databases should be protected unless consent is obtained from the person described therein
mr chairman i rise today in support of the motion to recommit offered by ranking member obey to increase funding for priority education health care human services and job training programs by 118 billion
in terms of education programs the bill eliminates 24 education programs funded at 526 million in 2005
in addition the bill cuts no child left behind below the current level
as it relates to health care issue the bill continues to make cuts across the board which either eliminates important programs or at least cuts there funding in half
for example the bill cuts rural health outreach grants from 39 million in fy05 to 11 million in fy06
these grants support rural hospitals clinics health departments and other providers to help improve primary health cares services in rural areas including dental care mental health treatment and hospice care
specifically the bill produces a 5 million 5 percent cut in the healthy start initiative which makes targeted grants to improve prenatal and infant care in areas with high infant mortality rates
this funding level will allow renewal or replacement of only about half the 12 healthy start grants up for recompetition in fy06
i would also like to take a moment to express my concerns with some of the many funding cuts for title vii programs in this year s appropriations bill
these programs have been addressing the needs of medically underserved communities in texas since 1991 by playing a key role in providing health services and health care professionals for our most vulnerable populations
in regards to job training hr 3010 makes cuts to training employment and unemployment services
although the economy has not fully recovered from the last recession and 76 million americans unemployed in may 2005 the bill cuts 346 million 36 percent from critical services to unemployed displaced and incumbent workers
in light of the above stated cuts i strongly support the amendment by mr obey
on behalf of the educators administrators and students in dallas texas i would like to express my strong opposition to the education appropriations outlined in this measure
the inadequate overall funding in hr 3010 completely undermines the public prioritization of education as a paramount concern
as passed the budget resolution provides 56 billion in discretionary funding for the department of education
this is the first time in over a decade that total education funding has been cut
although our children have no legislative voice they represent our nation s future and deserve our investment in their education today
the bill freezes after school centers virtually for the fourth year in a row at 991 million even though only 38 percent of all after school applications nationwide could be funded last year
one in four states have no other dedicated technology funds to track nclb student achievement data improve teachers use of technology and close the achievement gap through online learning
rigorous independent evaluations have shown that comprehensive school reform models such as success for all america s choice high schools that work first things first and talent development are making a significant difference in helping schools implement integrated schoolwide reform strategies
the bill cuts investments in teachers
it freezes the main nclb program to put a qualified teacher in every classroom teacher quality state grants at 29 billion for the 3rd consecutive year of a freeze or cut
the bill denies 80 percent of the administration s 500 million request to provide an incentive for the best teachers to teach in the most challenging highpoverty schools
it even cuts teacher training in american history by 69 million 58 percent
some of these programs have been frozen for four years in a row
although the republican majority promised lowincome students a 100 increase in the maximum pell grant in the 2006 budget resolution this bill provides only half that
the 50 increase would offset only 2 percent of the additional 2 300 in fouryear public college costs since 2001
for these reasons and more i oppose the unsatisfactory education funding levels in this appropriations bill
the bill disinvests in job training and help for the unemployed cutting these programs by 346 million below the current level while 76 million americans remain out of work
finally this legislation lacks appropriate funding levels for in the human services area the committee cuts in half the community services block grant a program aimed at helping the poorest people in our communities who often have no other place to turn
in its current form this legislation is nothing less than an insult to the american people
i rise in strong opposition to this amendment although i appreciate the concern of the gentleman from california mr filner xz4001330
this amendment would actually interfere with the operation of the current system before a new system could be put in place causing serious disruption in the medicare program in the enrollment process for new beneficiaries
that much said cms does share the gentleman s concern and is in the process of examining this issue
that project is currently in the informationgathering phase focusing on identifying all of the systems and entities and understanding the nature of the transactions that rely on a beneficiary identifier
i would tell the members that in the new drug plan they do not use the social security identifier
so i would urge the gentleman to maintain his interest in this subject to work with the committee as we oversee cms s gathering of this material and evaluation of this problem and the fact that they have managed to develop the drug plan without using a social security identifier indicates to us that they will take the time and invest the resources to change the base underlying system
mr chairman i do rise in strong opposition to this amendment
they are not sold over the counter they are prescription must be prescribed by a physician and they are so important in the cases where they are medically needed that it would be in my mind a gross disservice to our seniors to automatically deny them access under our prescription drug program to these drugs
yet diet and exercise could eliminate the need for taxpayerfunded drugs in many categories but we do not require that
secondly we are very interested in and increasingly interested in early identification and prevention of serious illness and sexual dysfunction is often an early sign of other very serious conditions
so it interferes with early diagnosis and prevention in certain diseases
it is also extremely important to consider this issue in the context of mental health and the costs of mental health in our elderly population
certainly in a longterm marriage a healthy sexual relationship is important to the strength of that relationship and important to the mental health of the people involved
i would urge my colleagues to oppose eliminating them from the medicare formulas because they are often medically appropriate and they are important to the longterm health and wellbeing and early identification of disease in our seniors
these tradespeople built america and i can not think of a citizen in our country that does not respect their prowess
well the worst construction accident in federal transportation history in the city of toledo took place on february 16 last year effecting serious loss of life and injuries among these modern soldiers of the sky
i tried at the full committee level to place simple report language in this bill merely asking the department of labor s occupational health and safety administration to gather all records relating to inspections or the lack thereof on this job and to also provide any communications that have occurred with the us justice department related to this accident
i along with the gentleman from new york mr owens xz4003060 the ranking member of the subcommittee on workforce protections were prepared to offer an amendment right here today to ask the department of labor to assist our county prosecutor in the investigation of this tragedy
so as the individual court cases move forth locally somehow civil litigation will be affected by that change in words
where was the state of ohio on this the largest federal transportation project in ohio history
these men died in my view because of the apparent willful negligence of the us department of labor and osha and their allies here in the congress who have been cutting back on worker safety laws and who have abdicated their responsibility to conduct aggressive oversight
instead today i am left with a personal appeal to the secretary of labor to use her existing authority to provide assistance to the lucas county prosecutor for the full prosecution of this case wherever it may lead and i ask that we all push for the swift implementation of construction crane safety standards so that no other family or community need endure the great tragedy that has befallen us in northwest ohio on the largest federal transportation project in our state s history
i want to thank the ranking member for yielding me this time and to state also i will place in the record at this point as part of my remarks today a letter we are sending to us secretary of labor elaine chao
dear secretary chao the city of toledo s police department and the lucas county ohio prosecutor s office are attempting to carry out an exhaustive investigation into whether criminal charges should be filed regarding safety violations resulting in the deaths of four ironworkers on construction of the i280 maumee river crossing in toledo ohio
madame secretary i ask that you use the authority you have to assist the lucas county prosecutor s office in their investigation
on february 16 2004 our community was shocked by tragedy when a two millionpound construction crane collapsed at the i280 maumee river crossing construction site in toledo ohio
the collapse resulted in the deaths of four ironworkers
i believe that the department of labor can be of immeasurable assistance to the local entities in this pursuit
mr chairman i would like to engage in a colloquy with chairman regula and chairman boehner regarding this amendment and i would consider not offering this amendment if i can hear their comments regarding the possibility of ultimately seeking a maximum higher pell grant award through goodfaith negotiations with the senate during the conference process
mr chairman let me begin by just putting this issue in a bit of a historical perspective
and you can see 10 years ago in 1986 the maximum pell award was 2 100
the yellow reflects the period of time that the democrats were in control of congress the red reflects the time when republicans took over congress
and you can see the relative spikes in the pell grant funding
now when i got here to congress elected in 2000 we were spending 76 billion a year in pell grants
that is an increase of 76 percent in overall total pell grant funding
in addition to the 134 billion we have in the bill this year for pell grants the bill also lists a very important addition of 43 billion to retire the pell grant shortfall that has accumulated in the program over the past several years because of higherthanexpected student participation
that is a grand total of 177 billion for pell grants the largest investment in pell grants in the history of the united states
i want to commend and thank both the gentleman from ohio chairman regula and the gentleman from ohio chairman boehner for their strong leadership in increasing pell grants which has resulted in an additional 15 million young people being able to go to college since the year 2000
on january 14 2005 president bush gave a speech in florida where he said we want to increase the pell grants by 100 per year over the next 5 years
this bill does in fact increase the overall award but only by 50 not the 100 requested by president bush
mr chairman i would like to engage in a colloquy with the gentleman from ohio mr regula xz4003340 at this time to see if he would be willing to work with the senate during the conference to see if it is possible to increase the pell grant funding to an amount sufficient to fully fund this 4 150 request by president bush
mr chairman in light of the comments by the gentleman from ohio mr regula xz4003340 and the comments of the gentleman from ohio mr boehner xz4000360 to at least make a goodfaith effort to try to increase the maximum pell grant award during the conference process i will not offer my amendment at this time
using taxpayer dollars to bribe journalists to bias their news coverage in favor of legislation is a waste of taxpayer money it is a black eye on the independence of our free press and it undermines the integrity of our democracy
in january of this year media reports revealed that the us department of education entered into a 1 million contract with a private contractor known as the ketchum public relations firm
this pr firm then turned around and paid 240 000 in a subcontract to newspaper columnist and tv commentator armstrong williams to promote the no child left behind act
for example the gao noted that the clinton administration s health and human services department used actors in october of 1999 to portray reporters in fake news segments that were distributed to tv stations without disclosing that the government had actually funded and produced the supposed news segments
medical information is so critically important as we start to put together a national infrastructure of information technology that is interoperable and that is transparent and that will allow providers to adequately provide the care that they need to with all of the knowledge of the patient s background that they need to have in order to make the right decisions at the point of care
mr chairman in politics there are show horses and there are work horses
instead of addressing this issue in a substantive manner in committee we are once again addressing it in a political way on the floor of the house simply for political gain
mr chairman the danger in our society now is basing policy on old stereotypes that somehow mental health and mental science is not real science
i have here a board that shows that there is a different metabolizing in people s brains for those who have mental illness versus those who do not
the notion in this amendment that somehow mental illness is not a real illness that mental health is not real health and that is why in this country we continue to discriminate against these illnesses by having them pay higher copays higher premiums and higher deductibles than other health care costs
what is the difference between treating an organ in the brain and diabetes and kidneys
what is the difference between treating an organ in the brain or the lungs or the heart
the fact of the matter is in our schools we ought to be looking at this
mr chairman in the next year we are going to lose 1 400 young people in our colleges and universities because of suicide
for every homicide in this country there are two suicides
mr chairman i claim time in opposition
mr chairman i rise in opposition to this amendment
i had hoped that in a year s time the gentleman from arizona mr hayworth xz4001730 and the gentleman from ohio mr boehner xz4000360 would work together to address this issue in the committee of jurisdiction
the gentleman from ohio mr boehner xz4000360 and i have had discussions on scheduling hearings in the committee of jurisdiction the committee on education and the workforce
i have often led the fight to defeat legislative riders on appropriation bills because of my confidence in the regular procedures guiding us through the legislative process
mr chairman i have been involved in defending indian sovereignty for 40 years when i began my tenure in the michigan legislature
i think it is extremely important that this congress on an issue so delicate and so important to two groups for whom we have great affection be done in the appropriate committee the committee of jurisdiction
the gentleman from ohio mr boehner xz4000360 and i have discussed having hearings in that committee
mr chairman i rise in opposition to this bill
let me begin by thanking chairman regula ranking member obey and their staff for their hard work in bringing this bill to the house floor
this republican led congress and the administration has put the 140 000 tax cuts for people who make 1 million or more a year and spending 250 billion fighting the war in iraq and afghanistan ahead of the need to invest in our children our education system our health care system and job training programs that will help american families
also the bill provides the smallest increase for the national institutes of health in 36 years
this bill provides only a 50 increase in pell grants despite hundreds of dollars of increases in college tuitions and costs
the community college initiative is cut in half by 125 million
it freezes afterschool centers for the fourth year in a row
these programs help ease the shortage of doctors dentists and other health professionals in underserved areas
mr chairman hr 3010 does not invest in our future our families or our country
what the new rule that is moving forward would do is in essence to strip these hospitals from critical access designation along with the funding that follows if they decide to modernize and relocate their facilities further than 250 yards away from their present location
obviously many of us in the rural health coalition in this congress feel is a very restrictive rule a draconian attempt to try to accomplish something that is laudable trying to keep these facilities servicing these highneed areas and the people that they are currently servicing but a 250yard rule seems overly restrictive to accomplish that purpose
this would affect the modernization of new facilities that may occur across the street or down the road or a few blocks away or perhaps in a different location in the community in which they are servicing or perhaps even affecting a hospital that was recently impacted by the earthquakes in california and are now forced to have to locate in a different place because of the damage that has been done
i have recently had conversations with the chair of the committee on ways and means and the chairwoman of the subcommittee of the committee on ways and means who are interested in working with many of us to try to resolve this issue with cms
based on their assurances in those conversations we feel very confident that we should be able to work this out with cms so that we do not go forward on this very restrictive and narrow rule
i do want to thank however the gentleman from michigan mr stupak xz4003910 the gentleman from kansas mr moran xz4002831 and also the gentleman from nebraska mr terry xz4004000 for their assistance with this amendment and helping to elevate the education in this house in regards to what is taking place
and let me just conclude that based on assurances that we received from the appropriate people on the committee on ways and means the chair the subcommittee chairwoman and also the fact that we still have time in which to cut this rule off before it is fully implemented it is my intent today to ask unanimous consent to withdraw the amendment and hope that we can get this resolved without further legislative action being taken
mr chairman first i would like to state my appreciation for the work done by the gentleman from ohio mr regula xz4003340 committee chairman on this overall bill and his work and cooperation at all levels and the flexibility that he has demonstrated in the interests across this broad country
and that is that government has a role in promoting the general welfare in the united states but we have gone past that role and now with our medicaid and medicare funding we are opposed to be purchasing sexual impotence drugs with taxpayers dollars all across this country
that will be implemented in january simply 6 months from now and if we are not able to put a stop to this bureaucratic decision then we will be down the slippery slope of millions of people who believe the entitlement is taxpayerfunded recreational sex drugs
so my amendment simply prohibits any use of any of the resources or funds provided in this act from being used for the administration or funding of viagra levitra and cialis
i recognize that the amendment of the gentleman from california mr doolittle xz4001130 in the bill addresses some of the abuse and that is the abuse of these prescriptions going into the hands of sexual predators rapists and child molesters
that is why i need to bring this amendment here in the only fashion that i can with the leverage i have in this congress
we will spend over the next 10 years over 2 billion our cbo score runs it up over 2 billion and 105 million in this next year
mr chairman i offer an amendment to prohibit any funds from being spent by the department of education in violation of current federal law
section 505 of the illegal immigration reform and responsibility act of 1996 clearly states that notwithstanding any other provision of law an alien who is not lawfully present in the united states shall not be eligible on the basis of residence within a state or a political subdivision for any postsecondary education benefit unless a citizen or national of the united states is eligible for such a benefit in no less an amount duration and scope without regard to whether the citizen or national is such a resident my amendment simply seeks to enforce existing law
approximately 126 000 illegal aliens under 21 were enrolled in college in the year 2000
this will also result in greater expense to the state taxpayers
please join me in supporting this amendment to enforce existing law and avoid rewarding lawbreakers
the amendment that i would have offered would have helped restore funding for the gifted education program under the javitz program that funds programs in over 20 states and universities
not only did this program help the gifted students for example in that school district but it improved math and science scores a 20 percent improvement for the entire school not just gifted students
the javitz program has supported programs in 125 state and local education districts since 1989 reaching two million students nationwide
in my attempt to earmark the program other programs under this title would have been seen as a potential cut and my colleagues from hawaii were very concerned about one program there
mr chairman given the fact that we are breaking this agreement and given the fact that i am not able to offer my amendment my normal course of action would be to object but i hold the gentleman from new york in high regard as the gentleman from iowa and so i am not going to be partisan and i am not going to do tit for tat and i am not going to object even though objection has been heard from the other side
i rise in opposition to this amendment because it seeks to overturn two court decisions and what judge wedoff said was the least of the bad alternative choices here has got to be the one that keeps the airline functioning that keeps employees being paid we have to look out for the interests of all people especially the 62 000 employees of united airlines right now just crawling out of bankruptcy on whom the future of the entire western chicagoland region ohare airport and many of the related businesses depend
we will also jeopardize the crown jewel of the economic development i think we should make sure that this process moves forward we should make sure that this airline continues to function and we should make sure that the 62 000 current employees of united are allowed to find their way back into profitability so they can put food on their table especially in my district and other illinois districts
mr chairman i rise today urging the conference when it meets to restore funding to the javits gifted and talented program which was unfortunately zeroed out in this bill
in fact they are low income but have extraordinary abilities
in my home state of illinois education for gifted kids has been cut completely out of the state s budget
in response i developed my own tenth district laureates program as a way to challenge gifted students in my own district
the program has become a huge success providing these students with behindthescenes access to top academic and cultural institutions in chicago and surrounding suburbs
as the only federally funded national gifted program grants provided through javits have provided 125 state and local education districts since its inception in 1989 reaching 2 million gifted students nationwide
positions in the field of science and engineering are growing at a rapid rate yet the united states is facing a critical shortage in these areas
just one demonstration program funded by this grant the project creating urban excellence in the bronx resulted in a 20 percent improvement in math and science scores for all students of the entire school
i think we must invest in the future of our children and i urge the conferees to restore funding for the javits gifted and talented program
mr chairman while the men and women of our armed forces serve bravely throughout the world the ability of our us military to recruit highly qualified candidates is being put in jeopardy
while only a select few individuals choose to devote themselves to a career in military service the defense of america is not their exclusive responsibility
mr chairman i rise in support of the amendment which is offered by the entire arizona delegation
all we do is suspend that funding until there is an attempt to deal with this in the legislation
mr chairman i appreciate what the gentleman has said and obviously the committee always reserves the right in conference to make a change to something as this and if indeed information came out that demonstrated that it should be changed i would certainly concur with that
mr chairman i do rise in the strongest possible opposition to this amendment
if hospitals are not reimbursed for this treatment their very existence is in danger
the tucson medical center in my home state of arizona a crucial level 1 trauma facility shut its doors on its trauma facility because of uncompensated care
again the federal government mandates that hospitals treat anyone in need of emergency care
so let there be no mistake about this amendment it will close hospitals it will close health clinics for americans who live along the border and it will result in an unfunded mandate
and the gentleman also knows that according to the congressionally chartered research advisory committee on gulf war veterans illnesses there has never been a better time to invest in this research
would the gentleman agree to work with the agency and me to encourage nih to establish its research portfolio in this area
mrchairman i rise today to join my colleagues in urging full funding of the national children s study
the result has been a major change in the way we view treat and prevent heart diseases
it too has resulted in unprecedented leaps forward in public health
similar to the framingham study and the nurse s study it could yield giant steps forward in our efforts to solve some of the most complex and pervasive health problems of our time obesity asthma and autism are just a few
yet the study has been left in a holding pattern
in order to begin recruiting participants in the study 69 million dollars is required for this year
only 12 million dollars is provided in the fy 06 labor hhs bill
i hope that the conference committee allocates 69 million dollars in the conference report for the fy 06 labor hhs appropriations bill to the national children s study
i would only stress of all the learning disciplines the arts tap and expand the human imagination the most and in a world of exploding options for individuals and families it is imperative when there is no experience to serve as a guide that the imagination be stimulated and perspectives be applied and that values be brought to bear
it appears that the children of 20th century america lost something when they became captives to passive education offered by advances in media particularly television
if we can learn from our mistakes an emphasis on handson efforts particularly in the creative arts should become a focal point of 21st century education
in an interview he said i am blind and i ca nt walk but i do nt let it stop me
vsa arts which are part of the arts in education programming eliminated in this bill provides opportunities for children and adults with disabilities and stimulates millions of people like patrick hughes helping to transform their otherwise frustrating world into one that is more beautiful and purposeful
there is one amendment in that en bloc circumstance the neugebauer amendment that i think the house should be alerted to
it could put us down a slippery slope of reviewing peer review scientific approaches and since it is targeted at a program in a university in my district i am particularly sensitive to it
but unrelated to the fact that it is in my district this subject is something that i hope in the conference will get the attention of members in terms of the overriding principle of whether we ought to be political seers overriding scientific peers
secondly in the statement i will submit for the record i have outlined a reason for this particular grant that is in my view again very compelling which makes a political attack on it quite again in my view uncompelling
mr chairman i recognize that sometimes committees decide to accept a series of amendments to bills en bloc on the house floor and then review them further in conference
in this circumstances i rise to express a great disappointment that the committee has agreed to accept for the time being the neugebauer amendment which represents a philosophical assault on the peer review process that serves as a hallowed barrier to scientific censorship
mr chairman the neugebauer amendment is about exasperation with nih research on nonhumans ie animals and birds and targets a grant given a respected research institution in my district the university of iowa
it is no accident that the remarkable results that have been obtained in developing miracle drugs and intervention approaches in so many diseases begins with research on animals and birds
secondly let me stress that nih and nimh operate in a more nonpoliticized manner than other governmental entities
we in congress authorize the appropriations for nih and nimh but scientists rather than politicians determine which research applications should be funded
science in this sense by congressional directive has largely been depoliticized
the knowledge garnered is designed to be of particular use in the treatment of mental illnesses and disorders like autism and schizophrenia
knowledge of the operation of advanced cognitive processes in the absence of language can also provide important clues to possible remedial methods that could be effective with language impaired human patients
accordingly i urge the committee as it reviews this en bloc amendment in conference to give particular attention to whether it wants to establish a precedent of political seers overriding scientific peers
i rise in opposition to this bill and to the rule
this is money these men and women were promised by this congress and by the president in 2001
but now in an era of misdirected priorities the president and this congress are snatching the money back
in fact this bill is full of misdirected priorities when we consider that the republican leadership will spend more on tax cuts this week 70 billion than they will on education and labor programs for the entire coming year 68 billion
i hear daily from members of congress that we will never forget 911 but when we turn a cold shoulder to the men and women who were there for us in our greatest hour of need i can not in good conscience vote for this bill
many have had their claims denied or wrapped up in red tape for months or years
then when not all of the money was spent in new york state we are told this is justification for taking it back even though the need is still great
he has been an absolute champion for this issue in the committee
i speak for all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle certainly in the new york delegation that we are not going to stop until we meet the needs of the heroes of 911 and this promised money of 125 million is restored to the budget
now it will stand for corporation for political boondoggles as this republican administration seeks to politicize something that in all national polling is the most respected news outlet in the united states of america
mr chairman i rise in support of the manager s amendment
everyday seems to bring new examples of gaping holes in databases being exploited by criminals choicepoint lexisnexis and cardsystems solutions
this new health information network will be in effect the mother of all databases this network when it is completed will provide unprecedented access to the most private personal health records of tens of millions of americans
in february 2005 president bush s information technology advisory committee reported that the information technology infrastructure of the united states
in may 2005 gao reported that t he federal government is limited in its ability to identify and respond to emerging cybersecurity threats including sophisticated and coordinated attacks that target multiple federal entities
there are things in medical records that people do nt even tell members of their own families
our amendment will ensure that patients victimized when their health information in the database is stolen or misused are simply notified so they can take the necessary steps to protect themselves
in fact the following 13 states already have enacted similar notification requirements for patients whose personal information has been stolen from electronic databases arkansas connecticut florida georgia illinois indiana maine minnesota montana nevada north dakota texas and washington
mr chairman i rise today to oppose the massive cuts to the title vii health professions training programs which play a critical role in addressing the shortage of doctors nurses dentists and other health professionals in underserved areas and have proven to increase the diversity of the health care workforce
the republicans fiscal year 2006 budget gives away 106 billion in tax cuts to the wealthiest in our society
now in order to pay for those cuts they are making huge cuts to critical programs for the poor and the most vulnerable in our country
in order to pay for tax cuts to the wealthy this bill slashes funding for the title vii programs by 84 percent cutting the programs from 300 million to 47 million
these programs are a vital component of the health education system in our country and are necessary to maintain the high quality health care that we expect
i urge you to oppose these cuts and i am hopeful that the committee will work to increase funding for these programs in conference
unfortunately united airlines has become a poster child for what is wrong with the private pension in this country
it dragged on the negotiations with its employees and then in the middle of the night got up from those negotiations and dumped those retirement plans into the pbgc causing those employees to lose somewhere from 30 to 60 percent of their retirement nest egg of their retirement assets of their future standard of living
they simply decided they would terminate these plans in the pbgc
just 18 days before united dumped its pension plans into the pbgc the pbgc wrote and said that it would be in the best interest of the participants and the pension plan insurance program would be best served by the continuance of the flight attendants pension plan
united got up in the middle of the night unilaterally threw this in
we may very well be looking at the opening night act of a new savings and loan scandal because we let these people come in because they unilaterally decided termination was their first choice going to the taxpayer was their first choice
mr chairman i believe under the traditions of the house the chair is the speaker of the whole house and the chair has an obligation to call the vote in the manner in which the vote was arrived at under the voice vote
in this instance the yeas prevailed and the chair said the noes prevailed
so i would ask the chair in the future and future chairs to recognize that the chair is calling the event that takes place in front of the chair on the floor not what the chair perceives to be and may be correctly so the outcome of the vote later on in the day when the recorded vote is taken
what this amendment does is suggest that somehow that those workers on a reservation working in a casino who are not enrolled members of that tribe have no rights have no rights
in california they do under a compromise that was worked out
it just kicks the can down the road and people are still in limbo if they are seeking to work out an arrangement for those tribal lands and for labor relations on those tribal lands
we were engaged in those historic conversations when the gentleman offered this amendment last year
but right here in the middle of the united states under this amendment a tribe can grant to their workers no rights
this amendment is not helpful in working that out
this is like the situation you had in the northern mariana islands where you had people who could not get a minimum wage who could not get protection of immigration laws
this is an outrageous practice that the government entered into in secret with walmart so that those employees who were concerned and want to file a labor grievance or a child labor protection law grievance with walmart who thought they were talking to the department of labor now find that they are talking directly to the walmart corporation
so where do they get the protection in filing these complaints
mr chairman i rise today in opposition to the funding levels in hr 3010 the fy 2006 laborhhseducation appropriations act for the no child left behind nclb act the individuals with disabilities education act idea and title vii health professionals programs
i voted for nclb because i believe in increased accountability for our nation s public schools to ensure that the promise of a highquality public education can be realized for each student in our nation
in hr 3010 congress and the administration cut nclb overall funding by 806 million 33 percent below the current level
in addition hr 3010 cuts the 603 million increase the administration proposed for title i to help lowincome children improve their reading and math skills to only an 100 million increase
hr 3010 provides 39 billion less than congress promised in the idea improvement act of 2004
in addition this bill even cuts the 508 million increase proposed by the administration to only 150 million
in the 20042005 school year 10 states and 7 194 school districts saw cuts in title i funding including my state of kansas
i would also like to express my concerns about the cuts to title vii health professions programs included in hr 3010
title vii programs are unique in that they are the only federal investment in interdisciplinary training which is vitally important as care is often provided in several different settings
the programs are also designed to enhance minority representation in the health care workforce and reduce shortages of health professionals in underserved areas such as inner cities and the many rural regions throughout the country
funding for these important programs must be restored in the final fy 2006 laborhhs bill
these cuts account for almost 6 million in kansas and 5 million for the ku
mr chairman i support this amendment not just for the compelling reasons of the gentleman from california mr george miller xz4002780 but because if it is allowed to stand as a precedent it will cost the american taxpayer tens of billions of dollars in additional pension costs
they are spending approximately a half a billion dollars a year on television advertising saturating the airwaves during family viewing hours when they know the parents and the kids are sitting in front of the television and now the taxpayer is going to be paying for this cost of advertising
while i understand that we do not want to go down a slippery slope bear in mind that when we start including these lifestyle drugs in medicare that is money that could be spent against cancer and heart disease and alzheimer s and all the higher priorities that we ought to be using medicare trust funds for
but the larger issue is should the taxpayers be required to pay for tv advertising much of which is inappropriate in its message
573 i was caught in traffic returning from the virginia polls
with over 75 percent of all prescriptions for antidepressants prescribed by nonpsychiatrists including pediatricians obgyns and primary care practitioners with little or no training in psychiatry the answer is to do screening the right way with parental consent and by qualified mental health professionals not to take away the ability to do it at all
mr chairman let me begin by expressing my appreciation to the gentleman from illinois for his magnanimity and largeness of thought in this matter
mr chairman i rise in support of this amendment to restore the funding for arts in education programs to 356 million
this year 106 of our colleagues from both sides of the aisle include my friends the gentleman from new york mr boehlert xz4000350 and the gentleman from iowa mr leach xz4002360 joined me in writing to the committee asking for 53 million in arts in education funding
given the funding constraints in the bill the amendment instead asked that we simply level fund the program the number passed after conference last year
the program also supports the ongoing national arts education initiatives of the john f kennedy center for the performing arts and vsa arts which ensure that people with disabilities can learn through participate in and enjoy the arts
time and again parents educators and community leaders tell us that arts education is critical for preparing our nation s children to succeed in school work and life
some of the most vocal proponents of arts in education include republican governor mike huckabee and former education secretary rod paige
i know the gentleman from ohio chairman regula also is supportive of arts in education programs
i would like to thank the gentleman for working with the senate each year to increase funding in conference and thank the gentleman from wisconsin mr obey xz4003000 for his leadership on this issue
i understand that this is a tight bill in a tight funding year generally but it is important that the house voice its support for this program
so i ask the distinguished chairman and the ranking member to work with me and the gentleman from new york mr boehlert xz4000350 and the gentleman from iowa mr leach xz4002360 to assure that funds for these beneficial wellliked programs are maintained if not increased in conference this year
if we get an appropriate assurance that we will work in conference from the chairman we may not have to do that
mr chairman i appreciate the comments of the distinguished chairman from ohio as to the fact that there will be efforts made in conference to try to retain this program
mr chairman i rise also in opposition to the paul amendment that is not cognizant of the fact that suicide is the third leading cause of death amongst youngsters
hr 3010 provides 1425 billion in discretionary budget authority and 1437 billion in new outlays for programs within the departments of labor health and human services education and related agencies
this level represents a slight reduction from 2005 329 million in budget authority
that is because the appropriations committee in response to a white house request included about 890 million for the 2003 medicare prescription drug law s startup costs
other programs in this bill had to make up the difference
regarding this last point the fy 2006 budget resolution places a total limit for advance appropriations in fy 2006 at 23158 billion
the bill before us today will consume most of those funds by providing 18885 billion in advance appropriations for fy 2007
all of the accounts for which advances are made in the bill are listed as eligible within the budget resolution
in addition to that figure the bill includes 43 billion to make up the pell grant backlog
i commend the committee on appropriations for bringing us a bill that funds many priority programs members care about while living within our means in an era requiring tougher fiscal discipline
i would ask members in the future if they are offering amendments to any appropriations bill to please be attentive enough to what is going on on the floor so that we do not pass their amendment in the reading of the bill
the subcommittee did not pick up the money in this bill
in my view it should have
the gentleman from illinois mr kirk xz4002220 and the gentleman from new york mr nadler xz4002890 both missed their opportunity to offer their amendments in regular order because the reading went fast and neither of them was on the floor
and since your amendment takes money out of a program in his state he felt required to object
secondly it is what happens when we do not include matters like that in the uc agreement
but in my view no one on the floor is breaking his word
the situation that the gentleman from ohio finds himself in on this issue is a very difficult one because he is trying to balance between two legitimate claims on the federal treasury
we have seen as was observed in the washington post article this morning a parade of members come down to the floor yesterday and today trying to wiggle out from the consequences of the budget resolution which was imposed on the entire house by the passage of that resolution
now i do not like to be in that position
this issue simply demonstrates that when the money that you provide for education is inadequate when it is inadequate to the needs of the nation then we are going to be eating each other s favorite programs then you are going to have all kinds of interest groups in this country chewing on each other and each trying to get out from under at the expense of everybody else
so i can actually understand why the gentleman opposes this amendment because he needs some flexibility in conference to deal with some of the legitimate concerns that members have
i had a son in the gifted and talented program
yet i would have a great deal of difficulty voting to add money for that program at the expense of programs that went to help less gifted and less advantaged children in this society
but the problem is all of these amendments taken together will limit the chairman s ability to provide any flexibility at all in conference to fix these problems
mr chairman i rise in strong support of this amendment
where were you on the schiavo case when you brought the congress back in order to stick your nose into the very painful endoflife decisions that were made by a family in agony
what i would say is this and i hope the house remembers this when the treasury bill is on the floor next week because i got added to that bill a requirement that the general accounting office do a study to determine whether or not we need to reregulate the airlines and treat them as a necessary public utility providing service to every community in this country in order to save our pension system for airline employees
there will be a race to the bottom in terms of costs and the first people who are going to get run over in that race are going to be the workers who thought they had a private pension system
this congress needs to start talking about matters that affect the people back home rather than continuing to focus on matters that deal with the welfare of people inside the system and inside the beltway in washington
mr chairman i rise to claim the time in opposition of the amendment
mr chairman i claim the time in opposition not because i am necessarily opposed but because i might be if i understood this correctly
as i understand it the ig and what i understand is on the basis of a 2minute briefing what i understand is that the inspector general ruled that a number of these schools were in fact private and not public and also questioned the way that at least two of the schools had spent taxpayers money
mr chairman in that case i somewhat dubiously will withdraw any objection to this amendment for the moment and hope that we can clarify it further as we go to conference
mr chairman i would also say that i note in the letter in the final audit report that there is a sentence which says additionally two of the charter schools that we audited did not expend title i funds entirely in accordance with applicable law and regulations
i do not know what the facts are with respect to that sentence but i would simply say that i would not in any way want the acceptance of this amendment to be an indication that the congress is carte blanche accepting the fact that funds ought to continue for those two schools because it seems to me we have an obligation to make certain that even if we are trying to deal with the temporary problem we do not want an improper expenditure of taxpayers money
if you are out in the woods with a rifle and you are hunting and you shoot at something it would be nice if you are shooting at the right target
if we have illegal immigrants in this country it is because of a failure of the federal government to effectively enforce its immigration laws
i have a similar situation in my district
mr chairman i simply want to say that i rise in support of the gentleman s amendment
i would fully grant that i think there is a problem with the timetable associated with the amendment because of its immediacy but the fact is that under the rules of the house the gentleman had no choice but to draw the amendment that way in order for it to be eligible to be offered as an amendment
the committee if it so chooses can easily fix this problem in conference
i think the social security administration i think the federal government i think the pentagon i think our banks and other financial institutions have been incredibly reckless in protecting the privacy of american citizens
and if there are technical problems this committee if it is worth its salt can easily have them fixed before the bill is reported back in conference
so what i would suggest in the interest of time unless we want to stay here until midnight is to simply accept a number of these amendments which we know have significant technical flaws but which can be corrected in conference
otherwise we are going to have a lot of meaningless debates and they will simply consume a lot of time and we will wind up in the same place
so what i would simply urge is that the committee accept the amendment recognizing that it needs to be fixed substantially in conference and deal with some of the very practical problems just laid out by the gentlewoman
mr tomlinson is the follow who said that public radio stations should get in line with the republican election victory
mr tomlinson is the person who appointed a consultant in order to try to measure the number of instances when people on pbs programs were quote antibush or quote antidelay
the other side would be screaming in outrage and passing out motions of impeachment they have had a lot of practice at that
it is also mr tomlinson who was reported to have worked to raise money in order to put the wall street journal editorial board on public broadcasting
and we have seen evidence of it in a number of places
we saw it in the schiavo case where the republican majority tried to tell every american family how they had to handle an endoflife decision
then we saw it in the efforts of the majority leader the gentleman from texas mr delay xz4001040 who fired a shot at every judge in the country who had the temerity to think for themselves warning them if they did not toe the line he would go after their jurisdiction
the fact is that every public opinion poll shows that the american people have more confidence in the objectivity of public television and public radio than they do any other news outlet and certainly more confidence in their objectivity than they have in us as a body
we have hit a new low recently in terms of public approval of the way this congress is operating i would say with good reason because this congress spends so much time worrying about things that affect itself rather than worry about things that affect the american people
mr chairman i would simply say that while i am dubious about the content of several of these amendments in the interest of moving the bill forward i would also urge that we accept the en bloc amendments and move on to the others
and so i had to endure an effort in recall because of my fierce support for tribal sovereignty
but having said that i want to say that the gentleman s amendment goes far too far in that regard
in my state we had an experience in which one of the tribes contracted out to a private party to run their casino
and under that defect they made quite clear to female employees of the casino that it was their obligation in blunt language to either put out or get out
you think this amendment represents family values in that situation
and with the gentleman s amendment you will be opening a loophole in the law as big as a 65foot truck
it ought to be buried in a box and we ought to pretend it never was presented
mr chairman as the gentleman from ohio mr regula xz4003340 said there are no plans for anyone in the federal government to conduct universal screening and there are no funds in this bill for any such purpose
having said that let me simply say i do not think our problem in this country is that we do too much screening for mental health problems with young people
so i do not think the problem in this country is that we know too much about mental health problems for young people
as recently as april 5 mr nicholson the head of the va told the senate in an effort to defeat a democratic amendment i can assure you that the va does not need emergency supplemental funding in fiscal 2005 to continue to provide timely quality service that is always our goal we were again told this year when we tried to add money to the va for veterans health care that it was not needed that we were simply pandering to veterans
at a time when we are having trouble with recruiting it makes no sense to be sending messages to our veterans that okay you can go over and fight in iraq but we are not so sure about what services you are going to get when you get home
mr chairman i insert at this point in the record the text of the amendment that the gentleman from texas would like to offer to correct this egregious situation
the text of the amendment is as follows at the end of the bill before the short title insert the following new title veterans health administration for an additional amount in fiscal year 2005 for necessary expenses for furnishing as authorized by law inpatient and outpatient care and treatment to beneficiaries of the department of veterans affairs and veterans described in section 1705 a of title 38 united states code including care and treatment in facilities not under the jurisdiction of the department of veterans affairs and including medical supplies and equipment and salaries and expenses of healthcare employees hired under title 38 united states code and aid to state homes as authorized by section 1741 of title 38 united states code 1 000 000 000 provided that the amount provided under this heading is designated as an emergency pursuant to section 402 of h con
but let us understand this bill in my view is still an assault on the country s future
this bill is just the start of cuts planned over a 5year period to implement the republican budget resolution that is placing the importance of 140 000 tax cuts for those making 1 million a year ahead of our longterm investments in education of our children the health care of our people and the security of american workers
this is the most important bill that we will consider this year in terms of meeting the needs of the average american family and in building the longterm strength of our society
it is the bill that determines how well we meet our obligations to those in society who have not been among the most fortunate
this bill fails to meet those tests in some dramatic ways and i would like to point out just a few of them
the number of grants at nih for research in all kinds of diseases will be cut by 500 from just 2 years ago
the community services block grant the program where the poorest people in this country turn when they have nowhere else to go is cut by half in this bill and the no child left behind bill is cut by some 800 million below last year
we want this bill to go back to the committee so that the committee can also do what it should have done in the first place which is to add 1 billion on an emergency basis to take care of the shortfall in va health care that the white house and omb have been hiding from the american people and hiding from veterans for months
mr speaker this is a simple straight motion to recommit so that the committee can repair the shortcomings in the education health care and worker protection programs in the bill and so that the committee can respond to the announcement of the veterans administration yesterday by adding a billion dollars to veterans health care programs
for the last 2 weeks the attention of the house has been focused on the efforts of the majority party to pass its reconciliation bill which includes significant cuts in food stamps in child support enforcement in disability payments in order to pay for the tax cuts which this congress has already largely passed
the problem that we have with that is that this bill in effect hits those same poor people a second time with cuts in education health worker protection programs that are in the bill
the senate appeared to give the persons interested in this bill some hope that those cuts could be avoided by adding a 3 billion financing gimmick to their proposal
that means that the only way that we can avoid that hit is to reduce the size of the tax cuts being provided to make room in the budget for some of these crucial items
so this motion simply attempts to instruct the conferees to accept the harkin amendment which would add 8 billion in order to pay fully for the flu pandemic work that needs to be done
it would instruct the conferees to add 3 billion to the lowincome heating assistance program to take into account the huge increase in home energy prices that consumers will face this year especially lowincome consumers
it would provide an additional 15 billion in programs that are meant to discourage abortion programs such as a maternal and child health block grant head start domestic violence and numerous others onehalf billion dollars to restore health professions training and 3 billion to put title i on a 5year track to full funding under no child left behind 16 billion in additional funding for disabled and handicapped children trying to put that program on the same 5year glide path and onehalf billion dollars in restoration for worker training and job training programs
mr speaker in essence that is what the motion to instruct would provide
we are offering it because this is the last chance that this body has to reach a different set of judgments concerning budget priorities that affect the poorest and most defenseless people in this society
in fact the congress is being prevented from doing that and the congress is being shielded from facing those explicit tradeoffs unless amendments such as this are offered and debated fully in the house
we recognize that funding for these programs under the budget resolution is being cut back in order to make room in that same budget resolution for the tax cuts that have been provided and to make room for further tax cuts which the majority party is talking about offering this week
mr speaker 2 weeks ago the labor health appropriation bill was defeated on this floor largely because it contained inadequate investments in education and health
today the bill is back and what this motion would do is to say to the majority that if they do not want to recognize the need for additional education and health funding that they at least recognize that an emergency situation exists with respect to the rapidly rising home heating costs with natural gas for instance expected to be 50 percent higher than it was last year and with only 15 percent of persons in the country who are eligible getting help from liheap as it is
i would simply ask the majority to withdraw the point of order in order to allow us to simply proceed to at least debate and vote on the question of rearranging priorities so that we can add 2 billion to the low income heating assistance program and fully pay for that by cutting back the scheduled tax cut for persons who make over 1 million to 131 000
mr chairman my amendment is straightforward none of the funds made available in this a may be used to create or implement any universal mental health screening program this does not deny any funds for any testing of those individuals who may show signs of mental illness
there is 26 million in this bill for these programs
this has been going on for a lot of years and there are a lot of bad results and once we talk about universal testing of everybody and there is no age limit matter of fact in the recommendation by the new freedom commission there is a tendency for overdiagnosis and overuse of medication
there is no evidence now on the books to show that the use of this medication actually in children reduces suicide
take for instance in texas 60 percent of the foster children are on medication
in massachusetts it is close to 65 percent
in florida 55 percent of the children in foster home care are receiving these kinds of medication
let me tell members people in this country have been well informed about this and they do not like this program
also from the freedom commission it should be for consumers of all ages screen for mental disorders in primary health care across the life span
these are the guidelines of the new freedom commission as well as saying the schools must be partners in the mental health care of our children
why do they not say the parents should be partners in the health care of our children
mr chairman as a physician having practiced medicine for well over 30 years let me tell members there is a crisis in this country
there is a crisis with illegal drugs but there is a crisis in this country with an overuse of all drugs especially in the area of psychiatry
all it does is say universal testing of everybody of all ages in this country is not the direction that we want to go
i was in west virginia with chairman anthony princippi and over west virginia delegation to discuss brac recommendations
had i been present i would have voted in the following manner rollcall vote 308 nay rollcall vote 309 yea rollcall vote 310 yea rollcall vote 311 yea rollcall vote 312 yea rollcall vote 313 nay and rollcall vote 314 yea
mr speaker i ask unanimous consent that during further consideration in the committee of the whole of hr 3010 pursuant to house resolution 337 notwithstanding clause 11 of rule xviii no further amendment to the bill as amended may be offered except pro forma amendments offered at any point in the reading by the chairman or ranking minority member of the committee on appropriations or their designees for the purpose of debate the additional amendments specified in this order and amendments en bloc specified in this order it shall be in order at any time for the chairman of the committee on appropriations or a designee after consultation with the ranking minority member of the committee on appropriations to offer amendments en bloc as follows amendments en bloc shall consist of amendments that may be offered under this order or germane modifications of any such amendment such amendments en bloc shall be considered as read except that modifications shall be reported shall be debatable for 10 minutes equally the additional amendments specified in this order are as follows amendments printed in the lt em gt lt em gt congressional record and numbered 1 2 4 5 8 10 11 14 15 16 17 and 24 an amendment by the gentleman from iowa mr king xz4002202 regarding coverage of certain drugs an amendment by the gentlewoman from connecticut ms delauro xz4001030 regarding enforcement of certain compliance agreements an amendment by the gentleman from new york mr engel xz4001220 regarding grants under the public health service act an amendment by the gentleman from wisconsin mr kind xz4002180 regarding designations of critical access hospitals an amendment by the gentleman from california mr waxman xz4004250 regarding certain appointments to federal advisory committees an amendment by the gentleman from california mr george miller xz4002780 regarding united airline pension plans an amendment by the gentleman from new york mr hinchey xz4001780 regarding the content or distribution of public telecommunications programs and services under the communications act of 1934 an amendment by the gentleman from california mr honda xz4001850 regarding military recruiters an amendment by the gentleman from wisconsin mr obey xz4003000 regarding funding levels and income tax rates an amendment by the gentleman from maryland mr van hollen xz4004150 regarding special allowances under the higher education act an amendment by the gentleman from massachusetts mr markey xz4002530 regarding interoperable information technology an amendment by the gentleman from ohio mr brown xz4000482 regarding funding for the medicaid commission amendments by the gentleman from ohio mr regula xz4003340 regarding veterans programs of the department of labor liheap section 503 of hr 3010 or a limitation on the use of certain education funds and an amendment by the gentleman from georgia mr price xz4003262 regarding funding for certain education programs

unfortunately it is in no man s land
the way the omb budget came up the president s budget it put it in labor which is this bill
but there is no authorization which means it is still in the transportation treasury and there is no money either place
and we have had real success in my district with it and i think it is something we would want to retain as a national program
it ought to be funded and kept in place
i know when we get to conference with the other body that this probably will be one that has support but it all depends on what is available in funding
it has a tradeoff that is the problem at this juncture in your amendment and that is it would cause the layoff of many employees
mr chairman i claim the time in opposition to the amendment
mr chairman i am responding to the question from the gentleman from new york and that is yes we will certainly take this under consideration in the conference
mr chairman i rise in opposition to this amendment
mr chairman i do not think the gentleman is a big fan of americorps and the attempt really here is to reduce americorps more than to enhance the other program because we have already added 100 million in new money in the teacher innovation program
you have volunteers who are working in a community on education public safety probably doing mentoring for students which is extremely important
he has a goal of getting 75 000 americorps members as volunteers and this would in part stifle the president s goal of getting these people
so i would hope the gentleman would withdraw his amendment or at least not go to a vote on it because i think the innovative program is good but americorps is good and in limited budgets we need to keep that program going
mr chairman reclaiming my time i would just point out that the americorps members that would be reduced and perhaps eliminated serve 2 million children and youth in educationrelated programs as i mentioned earlier as mentors
so it has a very powerful ripple effect throughout the community to have these americorps most like young people volunteers seeking other people and training them to engage in service as mentors and so on
here you have two good programs but on balance we have to at this juncture and with the limited resources we have go with the americorps as opposed to adding more in addition to the 100 million we already put in the program for innovative education programs
in balancing the equities between the two inasmuch as we put the 100 million in the innovative program and that is yet to be developed as to how it will be accomplished
but we know with americorps that they work in the communities do a lot of great work in getting people involved in mentoring and all kinds of other activities and on balance i think we have to make a choice here
so i would urge members to stay with the numbers that are in the bill to stay with what we put in for americorps and not approve this amendment
von eschenbach and what we are trying to do and he is doing the gentleman would be interested in he is trying to coordinate the various research centers
mr chairman i ask unanimous consent that the remainder of the bill through page 98 line 18 be considered as read printed in the record and open to amendment at any point
i just would point out this has been carried in this particular bill since 1997 without being objected to
mr chairman i rise in opposition to the amendment and i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from illinois mr kirk xz4002220
and we are inserting ourselves or would be inserting ourselves into something that has been worked out among all the parties in a way that is in the best interest of both active employees and retirees and this is not the appropriate forum to deal with this subject
we have legislation moving through the committee on education and the workforce dealing with pensions and this would set a precedent i think for our body the us house to interject itself in something that should be handled by the parties and i think what they are trying to do is to work it out in a way that is in the best interest of both the active employees and retirees
other airlines are going to be faced with this and i think the gentleman from wisconsin mr obey xz4003000 is right we need to take a look at this in the long term but this is not the place to do it
i might add at this point that i think one of the reasons for the excessive amount of dropouts in high school is because there is a lack of ability to read
it is a disgrace in the united states that 32 percent on average nationwide do not finish high school
providing books for children to read in their own homes is obviously an integral part of this effort
although the program does not receive a separate line item in our report we have assumed funding for it within the totals already provided and will work with the other body in conference to ensure that it receives sufficient resources
mr chairman i rise in opposition to this amendment and i yield myself such time as i may consume
mr chairman this amendment would prohibit funds in this bill from being used to operate the medicaid commission
i think we want to know what the facts are because it is pretty much a consensus of opinion in this country that medicaid and medicare are going to be even greater costs than social security down the road
therefore this commission is tasked with producing recommendations to have a 10 billion saving in medicaid
they are tasked with producing recommendations to achieve 10 billion in medicaid savings
we are going to be confronted with some very difficult choices in the future as we found out on the social security issue
and i think the medicaidmedicare issue will be even more challenging in the years ahead
mr chairman i am pleased to engage in a colloquy with the gentlemen from florida mr keller xz4002120 and the gentleman from ohio mr boehner xz4000360
i am particularly pleased that in this bill we will erase the 43 billion shortfall that had existed within the program and put the program on a solid financial footing
we are also increasing the pell grant maximum award to 4 100 the highest level in the history of the program and it is very evident from the chart there
and i would point out that if you take a look at that chart where we became the majority party in 1994 and you can see the rapid ascendency of the pell grant program
i thank the gentleman for engaging in this colloquy and i look forward to working with him in the future to continue to support this important program
mr chairman maintaining my reservation of a point of order i rise in opposition to the amendment and i yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from ohio mr boehner xz4000360
mr chairman i think the gentleman makes the point that this is legislation and therefore mr chairman i make a point of order against the amendment because it proposes to change existing law and constitutes legislation in an appropriations bill
the rule states in pertinent part an amendment to a general appropriations bill shall not be in order if it changes existing law
mr chairman in light of that i do not oppose it
the cost of converting the system for 43 million medicare beneficiaries would be substantial both in beneficiary education system reprogramming and related costs
while cms may well convert to some type of an electronic identification system over time and i think that will happen in the meantime to try to make a change at this point would be wrong
i think it is just the wrong time to start tampering with a system that has been in place for a long time
but in the meantime there are 43 million people who are on medicare
we add 200 000 every month and i would like to get more information from cms as to just what impact this would have in terms of cost and their ability to manage the system
so i would hope the gentleman would withdraw his amendment and i would work with the gentleman from wisconsin mr obey xz4003000 in conference to see if there is some way we can refine this language and i would like to discuss it with the medicare people with cms to see what the impact would be or whether a workable system that would ensure privacy could be put in place
mr chairman i appreciate the gentleman calling to our attention the recent report of the department of veterans affairs about the research opportunities in gulf war illness research
nih has conducted research in this area in the past largely through the national institute of environmental health sciences
the gentleman describes opportunities in neuroscience research that might most appropriately reside in the national institute for neurological disorders and stroke
in our hearings next year we will conduct a line of questioning to learn more about nih s commitment to this area of research
mr chairman i claim the time in opposition to the amendment
there are many great programs in this bill
i would hope my colleagues would agree in voting against this if it were brought up on a roll call vote
mr chairman i rise in opposition to the amendment
mr chairman i think mr barton xz4000180 made the case in opposition to this
there is already language in the public broadcasting act of 1967 that prevents the corporation for public broadcasting from controlling the content of public broadcasting services
i think this amendment is unnecessary in light of current law
this amendment would negatively impact on cpb s ability to assist in the production of quality educational programming
the amendment would alter public broadcasting s authorization that is presently in the law and i think it would cripple the abilities of cpb to do what our colleagues on the other side of the aisle want it to do and that is to be an objective medium to present all sides of every issue and not attempt to politicize the message
while we are trying to get some of the mechanics here of the en bloc amendment worked out i would just like to comment that this bill does some really good things in education and i think this is something that we are all interested in
i do not know if any of my colleagues have read tom friedman s book in which he points out the flat earth how important education is to the nation s future
i mentioned yesterday dave broder s column in which they polled americans who said that they thought that the most significant thing in the success of the united states was our educational system
so it was a great thing and i believe thomas jefferson was the person who and i am not sure of that who developed the idea of a free public education which was pioneering at the time because there was not anything like it in the rest of the world
one was to get a good teacher in every classroom and with that a good principal in every building and a good superintendent
i believe that the dropout rate is a result in part of the fact that people do not learn to read early in their educational experience
mr chairman i rise in opposition to this amendment and i would point out to my colleagues we had the identical amendment last year and it failed by a vote of 315 to 95
let me point out there is no universal mental health screening funded in the underlying bill
during our hearings secretary leavitt from health and human services told the committee that the administration does not support and has no plans to implement universal mental health screening and then they made it very clear that in all programming involving kids there is a requirement that parents participate and give their informed consent and that would be in a different program
we have never proposed in appropriations any program of universal mental screening and all it does really this amendment is to stigmatize the issue of mental health
the sponsor mentions 26 million and let me point out that the funds provided in this bill that respond to recommendations put forward in the final report of the president s new freedom commission on mental health achieving the promise transforming mental health care in america go toward state incentive grants for transformation to support the development of comprehensive state mental health plans and has absolutely no funding included for universal mental health screening
so i think it is clear that the president s commission did not feel this was in any way necessary and for this reason i oppose the amendment
mr chairman we are in opposition to the amendment
there is no universal mental health screening in this bill
the 15 days is a common practice in this type of thing
i think whether you disagree or agree with the settlement that was made between the department of labor and walmart let us not get into the business of secondguessing it and in the process create a lot of additional problems and in fact it would be detrimental to the employees in terms of what has been agreed to in the settlement of this issue
in fact it is almost a standard procedure
i say to my colleagues we do not belong in involving ourselves or this body in trying to secondguess the judgment that has been made by the department of labor
i am sure they acted in good faith to protect the rights of children to protect the rights of people that work at not only walmart but other similar types of employment
and i do agree that funding gifted and talented education in this country is an important mission
we must continue to provide support for our brightest students to succeed especially in the areas of math and science
i will work with the gentleman from illinois to address this issue in conference
this enrollment starts in less than 5 months and i think this would be a poor time to take away the ability to give seniors information about the new drug benefit
we have a lot of a considerable amount of money in this bill to provide the necessary employees to disseminate information take phone calls from seniors who want to find out about the medicare modernization act and to deprive the cms of the ability to meet this need would be a serious problem for seniors
let us not in any way limit the availability of information and the access that seniors should have to information about this possible benefit
mr chairman i make a point of order against the amendment because it proposes to change existing law and constitutes legislation in an appropriation bill and therefore violates clause 2 of rule xxi which states in part an amendment to a general appropriation bill shall not be in order if changing existing law this amendment addresses funds in other acts
mr chairman in response to the gentleman s comments i would point out that we do have a modest increase in this program and we will be sensitive to the gentleman s concerns in conference as we try to balance out all of the challenges that we have in this bill in terms of the resources available
mr speaker i claim the time in opposition to the motion to recommit
we do a lot of important things in education health research and in the department of labor
i think they have described in many ways the strength of this bill
and as has been pointed out by both speakers it touches the lives of 280 million americans in so many different ways their education health research to improve the quality of their lives perhaps illustrated by the fact as dr
zerhouni testified in front of our committee that every 5 years life expectancy goes up 1 year in the united states
tom friedman the writer for the new york times in his book the world is flat points out that we will be enormously challenged as a nation in the years ahead by other countries that are spending a lot of money a lot of energy and a lot of human resources on education because they too recognize that the winner of the future will be determined by the way in which they can educate their people
in the general debate we will mention some of those things
i would hope all of my colleagues who are going to be voting on this bill in the next couple or 3 hours would take a look at what is in there and how important many of these programs are to the americans
there are 500 programs covered in this bill and each one of them in some way or another touches the quality of life of the people of this nation so that every american in one way or another as pointed out by the gentlewoman from california has a stake on this bill and what it does in their lives
obviously it may not have enough to suit everybody in terms of commitment of resources
and what we tried to do on a bipartisan basis in the subcommittee and we have a great group of members that serve on this subcommittee from both sides is to make those very difficult priority judgments on behalf of the american people
mr chairman i rise in reluctant opposition to the laborhhseducation appropriations bill
chairman regula and the staff of the subcommittee have been extremely patient with my many requests and chairman regula has been extremely generous within his tight budget allocation in trying to make progress on several important priorities of mine
although the subcommittee has provided project funds for this important effort in the past for the first time the chairman has included this funding as a programmatic priority in the office of the secretary of health and human services
representative frank wolf and i were joined by 44 of our colleagues in requesting the funds to carry out a multimedia campaign directed at parents and i am grateful to chairman regula who understands the terrible impact of underage drinking on our youth and the importance of an effective national media campaign to address it
in addition chairman regula has provided increases in two areas to help infants and their families
second the committee has increased funds for the health resources and services administration s newborn screening program for early identification of infants affected by certain genetic metabolic i appreciate chairman regula s generosity in providing funds for these priorities
it makes it doubly difficult for me to cast a vote in opposition to the bill because i know he has worked hard to distribute the limited resources he has been given in a fair and conscientious way
my no vote on this bill should therefore in no way be seen as a lack of respect or lack of appreciation for ralph regula and his efforts on behalf of those who depend on the resources provided in this bill
however this bill more than any other appropriations bill we act on by providing the funds for health and education programs of importance to our constituents i goes to the heart of what we democrats in the house stand for and for what i stand for as a member of congress representing the people and communities of the 34th district of california
these programs are just too important and the cuts and terminations in this bill are just too severe for me to vote for this bill at this time
too frightened to seek out medical attention in the beginning he lets this condition persist
he finds himself in the emergency room of the local hospital
the first order of business for the emergency physician or nurse is not to ask them where it hurts and do a physical exam to see if their life is in imminent danger but to ask their immigration status and get a sworn statement to that effect
i ask you in this universe what kind of choice is that
there is no choice in asking a person to choose life or death
our doctors and nurses do everything they can to help these individuals regardless of their status in order to save lives and to nurse them back to health
our amendment would stop the pension benefit guaranty corporation from taking over united s four pension plans in one fell swoop
the takeover of the plans will result in pension benefit cuts averaging 25 to 50 percent a loss of 32 billion for men and women who have worked for years with the promise of a secure pension
and it is on top of the we are on the cusp of a pension crisis in this country
the pbgc without united has a 23 billion deficit and other companies are waiting in line to dump their pension benefits
mr chairman i thank the gentleman for yielding me time and i rise in strong support of the amendment
these schools have in fact been funded for years and the only point that has not been made on this floor yet today i do not believe is that if the ruling is allowed to stand funding will be cut off in less than 30 days
it will be cut off in about 12 days on july 1 my colleagues can say what they will about the impact upon the school
in arizona schools begin the school year as early as august 1 my wife who is a teacher will be going back to school on august 1 parents need to plan where their children are going to go to school this fall and were this ruling to be allowed to stand it would mean children would have less than a month to try to find a new school
the ruling i think ought to be discussed on the merits and i think the congress should do that but we appreciate the opportunity to at least temporarily suspend its impact for the sake of the children in arizona who want to continue to be educated at these schools many of which are in lowincome areas and these moneys in particular go to lowincome needs
mr chairman as the gentleman knows he and i have discussed on several occasions now my interest in funding the nci national cancer institute for more money to expedite finding a cure for cancer or finding that cancer becomes a manageable disease
twentyfive percent of the deaths in this country are caused by cancer
i realize picking up on what the gentleman from wisconsin mr obey xz4003000 has just said that this is a very tightly crafted bill but i would ask the gentleman as chairman and this is coming from one who has suffered from lung cancer that the gentleman find that money or look for the money in the conference so that we can increase the funding for nci so that we can expand those centers
mr chairman however well intended this amendment may be it goes to the heart of what is very important in this country and that is getting our young people to want to participate and be part of our society and it employs a lot of young people from our urban areas
it proposes to change existing law and therefore constitutes legislation on an appropriation bill in violation of house rules
mr chairman i was regrettably delayed in my return to washington dc from an official visit to norfolk naval station virginia and was unable to be on the house floor for rollcall votes 308 to 314
mr chairman i rise in strong opposition to the laborhhseducation appropriations bill today
this bill grossly underfunds key domestic priorities in education health human services job training public broadcasting and the list goes on and on
appropriations bills typically include at least a slight increase in spending from the following year to make up for inflation if nothing else
president bush and the republicans in congress proudly proclaimed their support for improving our nation s education system when they passed the bipartisan no child left behind law
head start a program welldocumented in its effectiveness fails to obtain the resources necessary for it to give a step up for millions of eligible children
this bill eliminates funding to the global fund to fight hivaids and freezes almost all funds in the ryan white aids programs which provide services to people suffering from hiv and aids here at home
this bill eliminates funding for hhs health professions training programs slashes funding for public health efforts to increase preventive care eliminates the healthy families communities access program aimed at helping local advocates and governments develop solutions to cover the uninsured and provides the smallest increase in 36 years for the nih
for the 4th year in a row it freezes federal funding for the child care block grant even though millions of lowincome families can not afford adequate safe child care for their children
the provision in this bill that has received the most public attention is the provision to gut 100 million in funding for public education
i urge my colleagues to join with me in voting no on the wrongheaded priorities of the republican majority
according to the federal trade commission 273 million americans have been victims of identity theft in the last five years and the social security number is one of the primary tools
se 000 mr chairman my amendment i intended to offer yesterday would reduce 10 million of proposed funding from corporation for national and community service s cncs americorps grants and increase two worthwhile veterans programs in the department of labor
this wellregarded program assists finding homeless veterans a meaningful place in the workforce
formerly homeless veterans engage in counseling peer coaching and followup services
the program coordinates with various veterans services programs and organizations such as the disabled veterans outreach program and local veterans employment representatives stationed in the local employment service offices of the state workforce agencies
impressively while the appropriators have funded the program at the president s request and fy05 amount 19 million the nvti does such an efficient job that they forecast with the nearly 50 percent increase my amendment would deliver they could increase their throughput nearly 23 processing many more veterans through again mostly via employees in your state
nvti also offers courses in veterans reemployment rights case investigation and grants management to address the training needs of the us department of labor veterans employment and training service vets staff
as an unexpected benefit cbo has scored my amendment to be budget authorityneutral but to save 1 000 000 in fy06 outlays
now 1 million dollars sounds like chump change up here to us but to americans voting back home and to the veterans who are on the streets and in despair it would pay for quite a lot
and this year the committee s report has language directing the inspector general to levy sanctions in accordance with standard inspector general audit resolution procedures which include but are not limited to debarment of any grantee found to be in violation of americorps program requirements including using grant or program funds to lobby the congress
it should nt the program on which it was modeled did nt according to americorps website it is based upon franklin d roosevelt s vision of the civilian conservation corps ccc in 1933 a program created by president roosevelt to provide relief for the unemployed during the great depression and to implement conservation projects
in contrast veterans are our federal responsibility and these two worthwhile programs provide needed help
the committee recommendation includes a number of administrative provisions carried previous years 1 language regarding qualified student loans eligible for education awards 2 language regarding the availability of funds for the placement of volunteers with disabilities 3 language directing the inspector general to levy sanctions in accordance with standard inspector general audit resolution procedures which include but are not limited to debarment of any grantee found to be in violation of americorps program requirements including using grant or program funds to lobby the congress 4 language which requires the corporation to ensure that significant changes to program requirements or policy are made only through public notice and comment rulemaking and
we have had a number of debates already on this issue on the issue of how much money is in this bill and whether it is enough money to fund all of the worthy programs that are out there
in many cases they have taken steps to make themselves magnets for illegal immigration
these health care costs are now burdened by permitting them to obtain driver s license enroll in institutions and luckily we stopped the driver s license part enroll in institutions of higher education at instate rates and obtain public services through the use of consular id cards
in 2002 as i recall as i have been told there were already 5 million of these border crossing cards that had been issued
five million people mostly in fact i think entirely mexican nationals are now also eligible for reimbursement under this act under this section if they come across the border and choose to access the hospitals in those border states
to the best of my knowledge there is nothing in the emtala act that requires states and localities to actually pass laws and regulations creating sanctuary states creating sanctuary cities becoming magnets for illegal aliens themselves
but what i am saying is you pass a law like this and then you pass regulations that make it completely and totally irrelevant in a way to determine
by the way even if you are nt here illegally if you are one of the 5 million people who live in mexico mexican nationals who have a border crossing card we ll treat you also
they are a significant problem that only exacerbates the underlying problem of massive costs being incurred by these hospitals in these states
my hope is that if in fact we have to put money into a program like this we do so only after we have passed meaningful and purposeful regulations regulations that at least make these hospitals accountable
mr speaker i rise in opposition to hr 3010 which provides federal funding for health education and worker programs
this bill contains 16 billion less than the current year and fails miserably to make important basic investments in education healthcare job training and job protection programs
on healthcare the bill takes a huge step backward in efforts to maintain basic health care services for the people in this country who are uninsured or underinsured
the bill cuts rural health care program funding almost in half and it wipes out almost all of the title vii health profession training programs that institutions like the cu health sciences center need in order to provide critical training and education for medical students and residents who aim to practice in rural lowincome and underserved areas
the national institutes of health which works to find cures for many diseases gets a paltry 5 percent increase in funding the smallest percentage increase in 36 years which is not even enough to keep up with inflation in research costs
state and local health departments will be hobbled in protecting the public against infectious and other diseases because the bill cuts the preventive health block grant by 24 percent
on the education front the republican majority has imposed the first freeze on education funding in a decade while requiring local school districts to implement federal mandates under the no child left behind act
though i am pleased to see some of the programs that were cut in the president s budget were restored in this bill such as vocational programs i am concerned by the low levels of funding for several education programs
our nation has seen a decreased number of students studying the science technology engineering and mathematics stem disciplines and in turn fewer americans are seeking careers in stem fields
this program coupled with its counterpart at the national science foundation works to improve the quality of teaching in math and sciences that will excite students to study these disciplines
unless we invest in these programs we will continue to see the decline in the number of stem majors and those seeking these careers
this budget is 39 billion below the fy2006 level authorized in the idea improvement act
in an effort to maintain independence the corporation for public broadcasting receives funding two years in advance
i am proud that the house acted to protect this excellent programming and reject the cuts originally included in this bill
mr chairman this amendment is designed to stop what is an ongoing scam in the college student loan program whereby a small handful of lenders are receiving a guaranteed 95 governmentpaid return on certain student loans
as a result of this 95 percent loan scheme the government accountability office has found that certain lenders are pocketing billions of dollars in taxpayer money that would otherwise go to students
first of all it only lasted a year so we could come back this year to fix the problem but the other part of the problem was it left a big part of the loophole still in place what is called recycling so that the lenders can continue to receive this windfall of 95 percent guarantee on those loans
but what it prevents from happening is future recycling future abuse in this program
in fact what this will do is free up additional funds that can be used to make sure more students have the opportunity to go to college because what is happening right now through this recycling scheme is that the lenders the makers of the loan are getting a 95 percent essentially guaranteed payment when we could in fact be using those monies instead to provide lowercost loans to more students and to provide pell grants
i know that we will be dealing with it in the committee on education and the workforce but in the budget that passed this house we did not deal with this issue
the president 2 years ago submitted a budget that did envision closing the recycling loophole but a bunch of lenders with interest in this a lot of lenders who are making a ton of money obviously built up the pressure and it was heard
let me say in closing mr chairman the issue of the 95 percent loans is costing the american taxpayer and the american students billions of dollars a year
i can not think of any better place to deal with this issue than in the bill that provides funding for higher education
mr chairman i rise to offer an amendment to prohibit the department of health and human services from using political litmus tests in making appointments to scientific advisory committees
advisory committees play a crucial role in the development of policy
in order to develop the best policy our government needs to hear the facts from the most qualified experts regardless of their political affiliation
this common sense principle is widely accepted in the scientific community
it has repeatedly applied political litmus tests in making appointments to advisory committees
an expert in marine ecology was asked if she supported the president s economic and foreign policy agenda
according to a senior nih official he was not picked because he had signed too many full page letters in the times the administration s use of political litmus tests has generated outrage in the scientific community
mr chairman i rise in support of the scientific peer review process at the national institutes of health and in opposition to the neugebauer amendment
for the third year in a row the house is considering an attempt to score cheap political points at the expense of nih research
in the first scientists from leading institutions around the country make independent evaluations of each proposal
in the second stage advisory councils with broad representation set priorities and approve the studies
in their view apparently nih should not be funding research in animal models that can expand our understanding of brain disorders
marriage is a key institution in our society and we should use science to understand how it can be strengthened
research in animal models has provided important insights into brain disorders
i fail to see any justification in eliminating the funding these grants
more fundamentally it is inappropriate for us to be debating the merit of these grants in the us house of representatives
universities and researchers want to know if they can do their jobs without wondering whether congress will step in at the last moment to slander their research and sabotage their careers
to paraphrase the editors of the new england journal of medicine let us not rub the gem of worldwide biomedical research in political dirt
i urge you to join me in rejecting this illadvised amendment
mr chairman i rise in support of the miller amendment
she continued i am a homeowner in marin county since 1972 but i still have mortgage payments
i am assisting my family financially as my mother is in a nursing home in canada and my younger sister has been on welfare
mr chairman i respect those who choose to serve our country in the military
more than ever this highlights the administration s gall in believing they have the right to personal information about student rights above parents
for these reasons i encourage my colleagues to join me in supporting parents and children and their privacy
in fact i have actively participated in one for 35 years
according to a 2003 study done by a group of mental health professionals and entitled a federal failure in psychiatric research only 1 out of every 17 2002 research grants is reasonably likely to improve the treatment and quality of life for individuals presently affected by serious mental health illness
i understand the difficult times that we are in and the decisions that are difficult that we need to make
as a budget is a demonstration of our priorities i offer a positive amendment in an effort to further highlight those priorities
currently in the bill the teacher incentive fund earmark has 100 million and the americorps earmark has 270 million
president bush asked in his budget for 500 million for the teacher incentive fund in the fy 2006 budget
the teacher incentive fund will carry out two goals one rewarding effective teachers teaching in schools most in need and two rewarding effective teachers in schools that are top performers in closing the achievement gap and meeting the annual targets in no child left behind
ask yourself who made a real difference in your education
most of us will remember one or two teachers who affected us in a very remarkable way
one of the tenants of no child left behind is putting a qualified teacher in every single classroom
the americorps program is a program that was conceived under thenpresident clinton and in short the federal government is paying participants paying participants to participate in a volunteer capacity sometimes up to 21 000 year
i urge my colleagues to support this amendment to improve education and our competitiveness in the world
the president had requested 500 million for the teacher incentive fund and i believe that moving toward a budget that greater aligns our priorities in the area of education is important
200 million would be left in americorps 200 million
in addition the cbo has stated that this 70 million shift would in fact save 33 million
i believe moving toward the teacher incentive fund which would again provide incentives for high quality teachers in our schools that would ultimately result in changing lives in a very positive way is a positive amendment and a positive thing to do
i think this is a positive move to realign our budget priorities in a more positive way for education and i urge my colleagues to support the amendment
mr chairman just by way of clarification i appreciate the gentleman s comments and budgets are difficult there is no doubt about it and they say where we are in the priorities
this fund is to find high quality teachers and reward high quality teachers who increase achievement in schools and increase achievement in closing that gap
in my home state of california two thirds of all basic research at the university of california system is from federal dollars
why is it that as of this morning this very morning we are scheduled to consider and vote upon this legislation that no one in the house of representatives with exception of a very few in the republican leadership has even laid eyes on much less read or analyzed
the original version of this bill passed the house months ago and i might remind my fellow americans that it was in this bill that the republican leadership of this body tried to quietly eliminate funding for the public broadcasting system and sesame street
and since then this bill and its senate companion have been locked away in conference
a handful of appointees of this republican leadership have had months to meet in smokey back rooms
this select group decided for all of us here today and for every american family what should and should not be in the final version of the bill
i want everyone in america to understand exactly why these programs are being cut
because in the face of gross fiscal mismanagement on the part of this majority they want to pass a 56 billion tax cut for wealthy americans this coming week
mr speaker in closing we are facing an increasingly costly war in iraq significant and necessary hurricane relief needs and a looming crisis over avian flu
mr speaker this country is at a critical crossroads in terms of deciding what it stands for what its priorities are
mr speaker i rise in strong support of this resolution and i am proud to be one of the original cosponsors
number one if unocal was trying to buy the chinese national offshore oil company they could not do it because chinese law does not allow a foreign company to have a controlling interest in a company in china
seventy percent of the equity in the company is owned by the communist chinese government
the money that is going to be used to buy unocal comes from the communist government in the form of a loan
this loan almost doubles the total amount of debt in fact it overdoubles the total amount of debt that the company currently has
number three if we wanted to sell our products in china under current law that probably would not be allowed
so i am in strong support of this resolution
i chair the committee that has jurisdiction over the committee on foreign investment of the united states cfius and i plan to hold a hearing on this when we get back sometime in the very near future after the july fourth recess
there is no reason that we can not find a buyer for unocal that meets all of the tests that a company in the united states would have to meet
so i am in strong support of this resolution and i hope all members of the house of representatives will support it
mr speaker i appreciate the gentlewoman s courtesy in permitting me to speak on this bill
there are a number of things in here that i have no objection to that i think we should do in terms of preserving our national security
the problem that we have now is first we have a reckless fiscal policy in this country aided and abetted by this congress
nothing in this resolution talks about getting our fiscal house in order
what would happen if instead of using their money that we have given them to purchase this oil company what if they purchased something in another area or if they start dumping our bonds
what would happen to interest rates and the problems in this country
it is also interesting that the resolution talks about the chinese oil supply being stagnant in terms of their domestic production
our supply in the us is not just stagnant it is going down
even if you suck the entire oil supply out of the arctic wildlife refuge and threaten our offshore areas with drilling we are still in decline
in fact the republican majority s energy bill according to the department of energy is going to increase our dependence on foreign imported oil by 75 percent
we have gone from a onethird in the 70s 56 percent imported today it will be 68 percent in 2025 yet the best that my friends in the majority can do is bash china a little bit and not do anything about our oil addiction not do anything about diversifying our sources of energy not do anything about the reckless fiscal policy that puts us at their mercy
our addiction to things from walmart means that it is going to be more the case in the future
they are increasing the energy efficiency of their cars something that sadly the republican energy bill does not allow in any meaningful way
however what we are not talking about is the elephant in the room where right now as of today after 4 12 years of this administration we currently owe china 277 billion
in that 40 minutes on average over the last 4 12 years america will have borrowed 3 million from china
in the last 4 12 years 84 percent of all debt sold all private debt sold by the united states government has been sold to foreign governments and foreign corporations of which china is only the second largest
mr speaker i rise in strong support of the resolution
china is the second largest consumer of energy in the world behind the us china s only desire to purchase this energy company is to meet the demands of their evergrowing population and economy
why in the world would we expect them to do so now
rather than succumb to the temptation of snappy rejoinders in the field of domestic political debate rather than use this time as a pretext for a campaign screed that would criticize the opposing party instead of deal with the resolution at hand rather than rephrase history about troubling campaign donations that emanated from the people s republic of china perhaps it is best mr speaker to deal with the resolution at hand and find some common agreement apart from the grandstanding and campaigning that is so easily enjoined
fact number one just as dwight eisenhower warned america about the growing influence of a military industrial complex the fact is there is a political business military complex in the martial markets of communist china
american investment is kept in minority status and every application from the most innocuous widget to the fried chicken drumstick eventually brings proceeds to the chinese red army
early in the 21st century though we may look to new technological advantages the fact is this a nation that surrenders its energy concerns its energy technology is a nation inviting vulnerability
our policy for the last many years has been to deter the chinese government in beijing from ever coming into the position where they thought they had enough leverage over the us to cross the straits of taiwan
if there is ever a time to speak about investing in america i think the time is now
on the shadow of celebrating the freedom day july 4 our day of independence it is a time now to stand up for investing in america
and i guess in discussing this purchase of unocal by china i think we should make the point that china has been and hopefully will continue to be our friend
we engage in cultural exchange and educational exchange
but in this instance i think any purchase of unocal by china at this time would be a disservice and a detriment to our homeland security
and one of the reasons it has deep reserves is because it is one of the few companies that has developed the kind of technology that has allowed it to project into the future and be able to keep and find the amount of reserves that keep it with a sizable amount of reserves in place
then of course china is dropping cool cash 18 billion which puts at a disadvantage a number of american companies in particular who are interested in purchasing unocal
now of course this is a private purchase and shareholders rights have to be taken into consideration but i think this congress although we are a capitalist society should look at the government money that communist china is going up to buy not only in america but in south and central america in the caribbean in africa more and more in the middle east and elsewhere
we need to begin to put together a package that suggests that we will be able to help some of our companies who are trying to invest in america companies and purchasing them
because we have not kept our eye on the prize and we have not reminded not only our individuals but our large corporate sector of investing in america
we need oversight and it should not go forward unless we pass the litmus test of national security homeland security investing in america and allowing american companies to purchase unocal
mr speaker i will enter into the record a letter that a number of us in this house wrote to the secretary of the treasury with respect to this transaction
i am one who has supported free trade since i have been in the congress and i support it today
this is unheard of in the oil and gas commodities market
no one ever thinks that one explores for oil and then uses the oil only in the place where they have their own demand and not make it available to the rest of the world
i think the warning signs that are going up from this house about the chinese government s interest in cornering the market on a strategic asset such as petroleum today is a dire warning indeed and one we should take heed of
in particular we are very concerned about china s ongoing and proposed acquisition of energy assets around the world including assets of usbased energy and oil companies
china is now the second largest consumer of energy in the world right behind the united states
in order to fulfill the energy consumption requirements of its growing population china has developed an aggressive strategy to acquire offshore assets to supplement its limited domestice supply of resources
as you are aware the committee on foreign investment in the united states cfius was established to monitor the impact of foreign investment in the united states and to coordinate the implementation of us policy on foreign investment
in 1988 cfius was given additional authority under section 721 of the defense production act of 1950 the exonflorio amendment to authorize the president to conduct investigations to determine the impact of foreign acquisitions of us companies on national security
specifically the cfius should review the following issues among others whether and to what extent the chinese government is involved in financing any potential acquisitions by cnooc whether such investments by cnooc are marketbased and free of subsidies whether there are technology transfer implications of these investments that present national security concerns and how cnooc investments in the us energy sector and acquisitions of usbased energy and oil companies advance china s energy agenda to the detriment of us national security objectives
mr speaker i thank the gentlewoman from michigan ms kilpatrick xz4002170 for yielding 3 minutes to me and wish to rise in support of the resolution but also to compliment the gentlewoman from michigan for successfully passing an amendment this afternoon that stopped this merger by claim with unocal from going through
that is in the base bill that we were debating for the entire day
they are trying to trump our strategic edge over in afghanistan now because the unocal pipeline running through afghanistan has all that natural gas just ready to flow but it is right on the border of china
she is buying pieces of us or what some claim to be us companies but in actuality they have their assets spread all over the world
it s no secret we have pumped ourselves dry except for what is left up in alaska
we need new biofuels new energy from fuel cells from hydrogen from solar from renewables from all kinds of new energy sources that should be tapped and built in this country
we should not have to kneel down in front of the chinese the communist chinese vegetarians as mr watt xz4004240 referenced or anyone else
this resolution points us in the only direction open to us now
the gentlewoman from michigan s amendment earlier in the day hit a real home run in blocking the merger
i rise in support of the resolution
the house went on record earlier today in a strong bipartisan way to support that we would first of all make sure that cfius which is the committee on investments in the united states chaired by the secretary of the treasury snow that we go on record making sure that we not spend money at this time for a chinese company that is communistowned by the communist government to take over our ninth largest oil company
the congress has spoken and we are happy that we did so in a loud strong voice
this is an international global community that we live in
as the gentleman from louisiana mr jefferson xz4002010 spoke it is getting the corner of the market because you can pay 185 billion in cash at a time when our country has 160 billion trade deficit and then you turn some of that money back and want to buy our company
we call on cfius the committee on foreign investment in the united states secretary snowe and his 12member committee to look closely at what is before them to do the proper investigation and then not to recommend to the president that we go forward with this sale
mr speaker both the wall street journal and the new york times agree a rare event that we should not interfere with free markets in this way
i remember when japanese investors moved to buy rockefeller center at inflated prices and many in this body wanted to stop that deal
if we take this action china could rightfully cancel american investments in china now totaling 25 billion
walmart conoco motorola united air lines all bought companies in china and should be allowed to do so
we should recover the conviction of our own convictions especially in our republican party to make sure we let the market work and let efficiency and fair play rule the day
mr speaker i rise today in support of h res 344 which expresses the sense of the house of representatives that a chinese government acquisition of a critical united states energy company could impair our national security and therefore justifies a comprehensive review
the bid by the china national offshore oil corporation cnooc whose majority owner is the chinese government to acquire unocal corporation is china s first attempt to secure energy resources in the united states and must be thoroughly evaluated
in addition this acquisition could mean less energy for the united states
in a free market economy mergers and acquisitions are a common way to enter foreign markets
as is evidenced by passage of the energy policy act in the house and the senate i know that all members of congress understand the critical need to secure the future availability of energy resources for american consumers
the fastestgrowing component of that foreign ownership is in china and it is a darn good thing for us that they are buying it because if they were not our interest rates would be much higher than they are today
the fact is if we say that they can not use that money legally to purchase assets to give 16 billion to american shareholders in return for a corporate asset what are they likely to do
they are going to say this currency is not as valuable to us as it is to other people in other countries so we are going to have to dump this and imagine what that would mean
they desperately need energy to keep their economy sustained but if we do not let them invest in western firms what are they going to do
they are going to invest more capital in iran in sudan they are going to make those governments even stronger than they are today and a much greater threat to us
also bear in mind though that american oil companies have a whole lot of drilling rights and oil reserves off the coast of china
their ceo was educated in the united states
ultimately what they are proposing is much more in our interests than the alternatives also available to them
mr speaker i rise today in support of house resolution 344 introduced by the gentleman from california mr pombo xz4003220 and urge its immediate adoption
it is imperative that the united states protect its access to unocal s energy resources in order to protect our economy and our national security
just as importantly mr speaker i and many members are extremely skeptical of assurances that the chinese oil company executives have sought to offer that they would dedicate any oil production from this region to consumption in the united states
especially in this purchase the chinese company and the chinese government are not playing fair
mr speaker american companies who are interested in buying unocal can not get funding deals like that
they borrow on the open nonsubsidized credit market or they would be able to offer a few billion dollars more in an instance like this
in my view a purchase of unocal by a company that the communist government of china controls a government that is one of our major trading partners but also one of our major trade competitors threatens the national security of this country by holding out the prospect that every drop of oil every unit of natural gas produced by that company could end up being shipped to china
you only need 2 numbers to understand how serious this problem potentially could become the global excess capacity of oil production right now is estimated to be just 15 to 2 million barrels of oil a day the lowest in the past several decades
compare that to this last year china s increase in demand for crude oil is said to have been 850 000 barrels a day with the demand expected to grow another 75 percent this year alone
never in a million years would china let us do this type of deal over there and do not fool yourselves about that
mr speaker i rise in strong support of the resolution authored by the gentleman from california concerning the bid by cnooc ltd
this resolution would encourage immediate review of a merger agreement which is authorized by the statute already rather than waiting for bureaucratic processes to kick in
mr speaker a review of any unocal merger agreement with cnooc would be done by the committee on foreign investment in the united states known as cfius which was created pursuant to language inserted into the defense production act dpa nearly two decades ago
the dpa is solely in the jurisdiction of the committee on financial services because it seeks to identify stop or mitigate negative effects on the economy from our efforts to protect the nation s security
world production of oil exceeds capacity by the smallest margin in decades
china s need for energy is so great that electricity has been rationed to some factories and the chinese are reported to be investing in technology to cook lowquality coal into gasoline
geopolitically this could soon bring the united states and chinese energy interests into conflict the united states in contrast has a free market strategy based on global market supply and pricing the same report indicates that china plans to expand its strategic reserve to fifty to fiftyfive days worth of oil imports by 2005 and sixtyeight to seventy days by 2010 so as today s washington post points out it makes perfect sense that a majorityowned chinese oil company seeks to acquire control of oil and gas production and reserves
i absolutely agree with a spokesman for china s foreign ministry who is quoted in the post article as saying we think that these commercial activities should not be interfered in or disturbed by political elements by that i mean without a chinese government subsidy
mr speaker i would like to add that i doubt whether the cnooc proposal will result in a deal which would trigger cfius review
the cnooc offer comes late in the process and has not received any regulatory approvals to date
why is the federal government involving itself in the sale of a private american company
if in the united states a private company does not have the right to be sold on the free market should we really be criticizing the lack of freedom in china
many conservatives who have decried the recent supreme court decision that severely undermines the principle of private property in the united states are now on the other side cheering this blatant congressional attempt to do something that may be even worse than kelo vs
but i also do not support the us congress involving itself in the private economic transactions of us companies
increased economic relationships between the united states and china make military conflict much less likely as it becomes in neither country s interest to allow tensions to get out of hand
mr speaker we should not criticize a lack of economic freedom in china when congress as evidenced in this legislation attempts to restrict the economic freedom of american citizens
first of all i want to thank the gentleman from louisiana mr jefferson xz4002010 for the work he has put in to this issue and for the tone that he used in this debate
in the world today in the world market today we are near an energy crisis
we are almost equal in terms of supply and demand and that is why the price of oil has gone up dramatically
this is a wakeup call to all of us to america and to us here the chinese have figured out that in order for their economy to grow they need a safe dependable supply of energy primarily oil coming into their market in order for their economy to continue to grow
we can not in my opinion we can not afford to have a major us energy supplier controlled by the communist chinese
but what we are asking for in this resolution is for the president for the administration to convene the commission on foreign investment into the united states and investigate this possible sale to look at it and determine whether or not this is in the best economic and national security interests of the united states
we are asking them to step forward and look at this and report whether or not this is in our best interest
that is in it
but it also has the realistic view that in the short term we are dependent on fossil fuels which are oil gas and coal
part of it is increasing domestic production of our fossil fuels and making that competitive in this market
mr speaker i rise in opposition to h res 344 which blames china for our dependence on foreign oil
china in turn is happy to prop up the dollar and finance the debt because it gives them great leverage over the us for years to come
so why are we talking about china now when they have been stocking oil supplies and us currency for years with no change in course from this administration
it s very simple cheap chinese imports and labor enrich the pockets of the people who really matter in the republican party but a chinese company owning unocal does nothing for the base
this nonbinding resolution is a talking point for july 4th barbecues just the way the republicans will tell their constituents that they re making them safer by throwing billions more into the quagmire in iraq
mr speaker pursuant to house resolution 351 i call up the bill hr 741 to amend the occupational safety and health act of 1970 to provide for judicial deference to conclusions of law determined by the occupational safety and health review commission with respect to an order issued by the commission and ask for its immediate consideration in the house
mr speaker i ask unanimous consent that all members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks on hr 741 the bill now under consideration
mr speaker the third bill we will debate today is another narrowly crafted bill that addresses a specific problem we found in the osha law
in 1970 when it created osha congress also created the occupational safety and health review commission to independently review all osha citations
the commission was intended to hold osha in check and ensure that it did not abuse its authority
now let me try to put this in simpler terms
since 1970 the separation of power between osha and the review commission has become increasingly clouded because of legal interpretations mostly argued by osha in efforts to expand its own authority
small businesses are the real engine of job growth in this country and we should be helping them not hindering their progress
we want to make sure that onerous government regulations do not hamstring small businesses ability to continue to hire workers and compete in our economy
the measure before us is a narrowly crafted commonsense bill that address a specific problem in the osha law
my colleague from toledo clearly laid out what was a tragedy in her community with regard to the four gentlemen who lost their lives in this accident
and when this picture becomes clearer we can then take a course of action that in fact may be appropriate
but the point here is that the bill that we are debating would actually i think assist in making the determination about who is guilty because by making it clear that the review commission should hear these cases and can adjudicate these cases you can make a determination about who was right and who was wrong by an independent commission not by osha itself
mr speaker having been an employer i realized early on that the greatest asset in my business were the people who work for me
and having worked every job known to man growing up i know that the people i worked for realized that the greatest asset they had in their business were their workers
when it comes to the protection of workers i believe that all employers are interested in trying to protect their employees
congress in 1970 passed the osha act putting in statute a set of laws rules and regulations about the protection of american workers
and over the last really the last 7 or 8 years we have made great progress in reducing workplace accidents illnesses and deaths because osha at the prodding of many of us began to work more cooperatively with employers around the country
i have been to many work sites in my own district where voluntary protection programs have been instituted and have been signed off by osha that allow employers and their employees to work cooperatively in order to have a safer workplace
and we believe that when congress created osha in 1970 they believed and it is clear in the legislative language and in their intent that they believed that there would be an independent review commission making these decisions
all we do in this bill is to make clear that it is congress s intent and that osha will in fact abide by the law as it was written
mr speaker i rise today speak in opposition to hr 741 a bill to amend the occupational safety and health act of 1970 by requiring judges in osha appeals cases to give more weight to the commission s decisions than to labor department regulators
however i would argue that the measure would violate a 1991 supreme court ruling that gave the labor department priority in interpreting osha regulations
nearly every working man and woman in the nation comes under osha s jurisdiction with some exceptions such as miners transportation workers many public employees and the selfemployed
mr speaker i thank the gentleman for yielding me this opportunity and take great privilege in coming to the floor today to place into the public realm a concern that is deepseated in the city of toledo and the state of ohio which i am so honored to represent
it in fact deals with corporate manslaughter
for in fact if those protections had been in place the men i am going to tell members about today would not be dead
our community would not be in mourning
their families would not be in mourning
i can not think of a citizen in our country that does not respect their prowess and their skill
well the worst construction accident in the history of the state of ohio occurred in our city on february 16 of last year
i said this is going to be a federal project which is going to be built without one death and we worked for almost 2 12 years to sign a safety agreement with each of the trades involved in this project and with the major company and the state of ohio
but yes there were people in this city people in our capital of columbus people in that company who did not care who simply did not care
joe blaze the president of the local ironworkers observed what happened will affect our community for generations the local paper the toledo blade reported workers told investigators the crane s rear legs this is the crane that fell were held up with 14 inches of shims and no anchors in the footers while each front leg had shims in only one of only two anchors the workers were literally crushed when this millionton crane moved and it just could not hold itself
and it fell crushing them to death in the process
people in the company knew that
but though the accident occurred over a year ago the state of ohio that i view as an accomplice in this willful manslaughter will not release inspection records
another major wrinkle is that this particular crane and there were two of them was made in italy not the united states
yet the state of ohio assured the workers that it was of equal measure to any crane built in the united states
but there seems to be a little stickler in the osha regulations that osha may not equally regulate foreign imported cranes to the same standards expected of us made cranes
i tried last month during the markup of the labor health and human services appropriations bill to include simple report language in that bill which is never denied to a member of this house merely asking the department of labor s occupational safety and health administration to gather all records relating to the inspections that should have been done on the job or lack thereof prior to the accident and to provide them to the public record as well as to provide any communications that have occurred with the us department of justice related to this accident
i have asked the majority to hold oversight hearings regarding osha s action or inaction in this i280 federal interstate highway accident
surely the congress has an oversight responsibility in a matter as serious as this one
they went to work in 32 degrees below zero
well in my opinion in cases of such gross negligence and criminal manslaughter there should be more than civil damages and osha fines
did osha not inspect nor require equal standards on a foreign made crane similar to one that is made in the united states of america
the state of ohio has got their head in the sand
those in charge are hiding in columbus somewhere under the sidewalk
here we have the largest transportation project in ohio history with criminal manslaughter and they are all taking the duck
they have been responsible for five deaths in the last year at two different project sites
on whose hands does the blood of these men lie in this house
we were always taught in school there are sins of commission and there are sins of omission
both sides of the ledger you are accountable these men died in my view because of the apparent willful negligence of our us department of labor and the office of safety and health within it that was supposed to be set up to protect their lives as well as their allies here in the congress who are completely undermining worker safety laws they have abdicated their responsibility not just as lawmakers but as human beings to their fellow men and women to conduct aggressive oversight
i have appealed already to our committee on education and the workforce to hold hearings into this tragedy in ohio
the hearings ought to be held in ohio
it is my hope that in spite of the actions being taken today there might be some accountability some conscience out there that asks no that demands that this congress act on behalf of the mothers and the fathers and the wives and the children and every single person in our community that goes under that bridge every day or looks at that construction project all the people that still lay wreaths at the site they are numerous all the prayers all the offerings all the memories that are there forever
we value the lives of your members and the faith that they put in us to protect them
part of the problem is that this 34yearold bill has been changed by activist judges it has not been reviewed or looked at in 34 years in any sense and these simply bring fairness back into the equation
as you can imagine 34 years ago we had an osha bill that was drawn up by a democratic house and a democratic senate that was very fair just a little tilted in one direction and we are trying to undo that tilt just a little bit so finally finally maybe we can get osha to work with the small business community to benefit the workers
it is exactly what happened in the seventies
it is clear in the legislative language of the osh act that congress empowered the commission to interpret ambiguities under the act
i would think all of us would want them to consider what we in congress did
but they should not sit in judgment of their own rules
the congress in 1970 understood that and we are going to fix that in osha sometime very soon
in my view this must be corrected and as long as i am in this town and in this body i am going to try to correct it
hr 741 simply states that deference shall be given to the reasonable findings of the commission in accordance with the governing court precedents as congress originally intended
in the 108th congress most of us understood this was important 224 voted for it 204 against
i know that the union bosses are against anything we do anything that might possibly help the majority of citizens in this country who are in small business
mr speaker i would like to turn my attention to an issue that should be of great concern to all members of this body in relation to this particular subject and that is worker deaths and serious injuries
why can we not have hearings when there is a major accident with four men being killed under the circumstances they were killed in ohio
why can we not call in osha and demand that there be an expedited investigation
why can we not consider my bill hr 2004 the protecting america s workers act which will call for penalties for corporations who are guilty of the kind of neglect that led to the deaths of the four workers in ohio
even by conservative estimates 15 workers in this country will be killed on the job today july 12
why are we wasting our time playing around with the adjustment of a commission when these workers deaths are still going on in america
i spoke earlier about the fiery explosion some 3 months ago at the bp plant in texas city that killed 15 workers and injured more than 100 others
why has this committee with jurisdiction not examined that explosion more closely here in washington
i had also previously mentioned the bridge collapse in toledo which the gentlewoman from ohio ms kaptur xz4002110 discussed in greater detail
and they go on in different parts of the country because we are not aware of the seriousness of the situation
the fact is that much of what happens in one area can be prevented from happening in another area if we would just address those serious issues
every year in new york city for example a number of unprotected construction workers are killed by freefalls from buildings and collapses of faulty scaffolds and concrete walls
almost 8 months ago in walnut creek california a gas pipeline explosion killed five workers and badly injured four others
in the words of a new york state supreme court justice these worker deaths in new york were not simply random accidents but rather and i am quoting the judge here tragic certainties tragic certainties the workers died as the direct result of some employer s willful safety violations or serious negligence
what is even more reprehensible is that too often and in the specific worker death cases i just referred to the employers responsible for these fatalities are repeat safety offenders
in a forum i held last year entitled jobs to die for inadequate enforcement of us safety standards i heard from the grieving parents of 22yearold patrick walters
patrick was buried alive on june 14 2002 working on a sewer pipe in a 10foot trench
unclassified just as they did in the case of ohio
it s only a matter of time patrick s parents who still live in the cincinnati area continue to see moeves employees working inside trenches without any cavein protections
as patrick s father told a reporter in march of 2005 march of this year about the owner of moeves plumbing she s killed two people now and she ll probably kill two people again
it s obvious she s not listening to what osha is telling her under the current osha act the maximum penalty any employer can receive for causing the death of a worker considered a misdemeanor is 6 months in prison and a 10 000 fine
six months in prison and a 10 000 fine
they even lack a voice in any osha investigations of their loved ones deaths
they also lack any voice in osha s subsequent negotiations with culpable employees over the downgrading of initial citations and fines tied to the worker fatalities
by stiffening criminal penalties for those found guilty of blatant safety violations that result in worker deaths the protecting america s workers act will make other employers think twice about ignoring basic health and safety rules that risk workers lives
hr 2004 incorporates in its entirety the provisions of a bill i introduced last year and that was called the workplace wrongful death accountability act
both bills would make it a felony offense to kill a worker and provide for a term of no more than 10 years in prison
a felony offense to kill a worker and there will be a term of no more than 10 years in prison
for a second offense the maximum term for a culpable employer would be 20 years in prison
fines would be set in accordance with title 18 of the us code which is standard practice for all other criminal matters
in other legislative matters everyone agrees that holding people accountable by such means as stiffened penalties serves a critically important deterrent purpose
the opposition to holding such bad actors accountable does not even waver in instances where a number of workers are killed by the same safety violations over a 5 or 10year period
i believe senator enzi would prefer to see a maximum prison sentence for a first offense set at 18 months whereas my bill would set the maximum at 10 years in accordance with standard criminal law
among others these include public employees in a number of states and localities certain transportation workers such as flight attendants and a number of federal workers as well as those in publicprivate entities such as the nuclear regulatory commission
this bill requires osha to investigate any workplace incident that results in the death of a worker or the hospitalization of two or more workers
at the same time it gives surviving family members of workers who are killed greater participation rights in osha s workplace investigation and penalty negotiation process with the respective employers responsible for these fatalities
moreover it prohibits osha from downgrading willful citations in worker fatalities downgrading them to this unclassified category
mr speaker i want to commend the new york committee on the safety and health nycosh joined by cosh committees in other states for launching a national campaign against corporate killing
although we have been making progress and making the american workplace safer in prior administrations that progress has stalled and we need to act immediately in a serious manner and stop the kinds of adjustments that are taking place in the bills that are on the floor today
i thank the gentleman from ohio for yielding me this time and i appreciate the leadership that he has presented to this congress on making america more competitive in the world economy
mr speaker this week congress embarks on an important agenda to make america more competitive in the global marketplace
as thomas friedman says in his book the world is flat globalization is a reality of our world today
america s businesses and workers have the skills and talent to compete and succeed in the global economy when given the opportunity to succeed
the gentleman from georgia mr norwood xz4002960 has been a leader in the fight to keep american businesses competitive without sacrificing workplace safety and health protections
in 1971 osha was created to ensure a safe and healthy workplace for workers throughout the nation
in order to successfully create a safe work environment osha must be cooperative not confrontational or punitive
this is particularly true in the residential construction industry where osha seemed to unfairly target small homebuilders in sedgwick county kansas
in june of 2003 i was contacted by a group of homebuilders in wichita who were frightened by the prospect of having to stop working in order to avoid fines from osha
while seemingly minor issues to most of us these fines which some in the community claimed could be as high as 50 000 would effectively put small businesses out of business
in the case of these small construction companies osha chose surprise visits illconceived compliance guidelines and an adversarial demeanor to achieve everyone s goal of a safer more secure workplace
the results were that many small contractors in my area of the country were forced to stop working in order to avoid unfair fines which could have been as high as 7 000 per infraction no matter how insignificant
mr speaker i rise in opposition to hr 741
it is unnecessary and not in the best interests of the employer or the employee
if the administration was really interested in helping workers it would nt be focusing on these unnecessary semantics in the law
i urge my colleagues to join me in supporting real worker reforms not legislation promoting the erosion of worker protections
mr speaker the administration s priorities are wrong and i urge my colleagues to join me in opposing hr 741
mr speaker once again i want to commend the chairman of the committee for his wonderful work in this area and commend the gentleman from georgia mr norwood xz4002960 for keeping this issue alive as he has tried to enact these appropriate reforms
we are not interested in dismantling osha
we are interested in improving workers safety
small business 997 percent of all business is small business and 75 percent of all new jobs are hired in the small business sector
madam speaker i rise in opposition to this bill
what sounds like a very small change in the rules could have very large and unwelcome consequences
the way the law works now if an osha inspector noticed the trench that the gentleman from new york just made reference to and gave that employer a notice that the trench needed to be properly put together so it would not cave in under present law the employer has more than 2 weeks 15 days to decide whether to contest that citation
in the law he or she who has the burden of proof loses
mr speaker i would be remiss if i did not tribute my friend from new york mr owens xz4003060 for his years of advocacy for working people generally and in worker safety specifically
year after year month after month the gentleman from new york mr owens xz4003060 has come to this floor and raised these issues with great clarity and passion and we very much appreciate his contribution in this area
there are many positions in the federal administrative service that are very complex that are adjudicatory in nature that do not require formal legal training and i do not believe that these positions should either
i would note for the record that none of the nonlawyers appointed to this commission in its history have been appointed by democratic administrations
i do not know of really any other decisionmaking body in the federal structure where a minority of the members can make an affirmative decision
i know of institutions where a minority can veto a decision bit i am not familiar with a situation where two members out of five could in fact act on behalf of the commission
mr speaker i rise in opposition to this bill
if the principle in this bill were applied to us attorneys across the country we would have a crime wave like you would not believe
and that is the flaw in this bill
the second is the mixed result where osha wins some and loses some where some of the charges that they make are downgraded others are dismissed and others are upheld in their entirety
as i read this legislation mr speaker in that case it is indeed possible perhaps likely that osha would be held responsible for paying the attorneys fees of the defendant or accused party in that case
well in that case it is obvious under this bill that osha would be responsible for the counsel fees of the accused party
i believe they said there are three cases in recent years in a long time where this has been invoked
it could draw the conclusion that in the vast majority of the cases even when they lose their claims are reasonable and the adjudicator and finder of fact in law has found that although osha is wrong they were not acting in a vindictive or unreasonable way
this is a consistent principle across the board in federal law
if a federal agency brings a case that is vindictive or unreasonable or patently unfair then they are in fact responsible to pay the attorneys fees of the accused party
i am glad that the securities and exchange commission is not going to be held to this standard because if every time someone on wall street were accused of stock fraud the sec had to say well are we sure we are going to win before we bring this case the cases of stock fraud that we have seen would be far more rampant than we have seen in recent years
mr speaker i rise in opposition to hr 740 and the three other osha bills under consideration today
we have got to keep them here in the united states
we should put the blame for losses in california and across the country where it belongs and i state where it belongs
weakening american labor standards and allowing american workers to be exploited as they are in third world countries is not the solution
therefore employers have nothing to lose by challenging those violations in court
the real losers under this legislation are the american taxpayers american workers american families in this country american people who work to make our country great
we need to keep them here and we need to protect them here in the united states
mr speaker i rise in opposition to hr 740 and the other three osha bills under consideration today
we should put the blame for job losses in california and across the country where it belongs the failed policies of this administration
weakening america s labor standards and allowing workers here to be exploited as they are in third world countries is not the solution
therefore employers have nothing to lose by challenging most violations in court
mr speaker i rise today in support of all four of the osha reforms bills on the floor
these bills contain reforms that will encourage a more collaborative environment in which small business owners and the occupational safety and health administration can work together and in doing so improve workplace safety
in particular i rise to support hr 742 the small employer access to justice act
it would amend the osha act of 1970 to reimburse small employers for attorneys fees and costs when they are successful in challenging an osha citation
now it is true that the equal access to justice act already allows small business owners to recover attorneys fees when a ruling is in the employers favor
but small business owners that have not broken any laws should not be drained by large attorneys fees that they have accrued in order to contest the citation
i ask members to support the osha reform and in particular hr 742 so that a fair legal environment can be created for small businesses owners
we could have taken this opportunity to help hardworking americans feel a little safer in the workplace or we could have made today s priority giving some relief to middleclass families who are struggling to keep up with recordbreaking gas prices tuition increases and health care costs
instead this administration has once again chosen in favor of the corporate sector and the special interests
their reward in this bill comes at the expense of hardworking employees who depend on osha to keep an eye on their working conditions
but when former executives win appointments to regulate the same industries in which they used to work sound science and smart public policy usually tack a back seat to political favoritism and ideology
meanwhile hardworking americans are increasingly faced with workplace conditions in which critically important safeguards are watered down emerging problems are ignored and enforcement is scaled back
if osha already has the authority to review missed deadlines on a casebycase basis why would we need a bill that changes this process in a onesided way that could further disadvantage workers encourage litigation and undermine health and safety protections
madam speaker pursuant to house resolution 351 i call up the bill hr 739 to amend the occupational safety and health act of 1970 to provide for adjudicative flexibility with regard to the filing of a notice of contest by an employer following the issuance of a citation or proposed assessment of a penalty by the occupational safety and health administration and ask for its immediate consideration in the house
madam speaker i ask unanimous consent that all members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks on hr 739 the bill now under consideration
employers are subject to fierce competition both at home and abroad and must compete in the face of high taxes skyrocketing health costs escalating litigation and burdensome government regulations
these osha reform bills are designed to improve worker safety and enhance the competitiveness of small businesses that are the real engine of job growth in our country
but we need to make sure that onerous government regulations do not hamstring small businesses ability to continue to hire new workers and compete in our economy
we stopped one of the most overreaching attempts at regulation in our nation s history by repealing an irresponsible and unworkable ergonomics regulation that would have cost employers billions of dollars and killed millions of jobs
i am pleased to report these voluntary programs have proven successful in reducing workplace injuries and illnesses
in fact if we look at this chart workplace injuries and fatalities have declined significantly during the bush administration
and as this chart shows workplace injuries and illnesses have declined significantly under the bush administration to their lowest point in history to a rate of just five injuries or illnesses per 100 workers
there has been a 58 percent reduction in workplace fatalities since the bush administration took office and that is significant progress
the reform measures we will consider today are proposals that while fairly modest in substance are important to small business owners who struggle every day to comply with the complex osha laws and provide a safe working environment for their workers while facing an increasingly competitive worldwide economy
employers who make good faith efforts to comply with osha standards deserve to be treated fairly and have their day in court and these commonsense bills will help ensure that they receive that opportunity
the first bill on tap today the occupational safety and health small business day in court act gives the occupational safety and health review commission additional flexibility to make exceptions to the arbitrary 15day deadline for employers to file responses to osha citations when a small business misses the deadline by a mistake or for good reason
it says to the secretary of labor and to osha that the arbitrary 15day deadline that is in the statute for complying with an osha citation or to respond to osha can in fact be waived under special circumstances if osha believes that the employer missed it by accident or had other extenuating circumstances they have the option of extending the 15day deadline
the ability of the commission to waive a deadline on a casebycase basis when circumstances warrant it have been drawn into increased legal uncertainty by the recent decision of the us circuit court of appeals for the second circuit in chao v lefrois builder incorporated and indeed as recently as 2003 osha has argued that oshrc does not have the authority to apply this rule
so we think that voluntary cooperation between osha and the employer community will in fact lead to a safer workplace
and as the chart showed that i displayed earlier workplace injuries and fatalities have continued to decrease in each year of the bush administration
mr speaker the second bill we will debate is another narrowlycrafted bill that addresses a specific problem we found in the osha law
now because a quorum of two out of the three total commissioners is needed for timely decisionmaking the commission has in the past been unable to act simply because a quorum was not present
the occupational safety and health review commission efficiency act increases the membership of the commission from three to five members to ensure that cases are reviewed in a timely fashion
increasing membership to five commissioners will help ensure that cases are reviewed in a more timely fashion improving the current system of judicial inactivity that only results in government waste
in short it will allow the commission to complete its job by reducing the case backlogs that are as much as 8 years old
now the commission s sister agency the federal mine safety and health review commission has 5 panelists and we have found has worked well in reviewing cases more efficiently
this bill simply ensures that osha cases are resolved in a timely and efficient manner a goal that we all should support
employers who make goodfaith efforts to comply with osha standards deserve to be treated fairly and have their day in court and this measure will help ensure that they receive that opportunity
mr speaker pursuant to house resolution 351 i call up the bill hr 742 to amend the occupational safety and health act of 1970 to provide for the award of attorneys fees and costs to small employers when such employers prevail in litigation prompted by the issuance of a citation by the occupational safety and health administration and ask for its immediate consideration in the house
in short we strongly believe that small businesses that face meritless osha enforcement actions should not be prevented from defending themselves simply because they can not afford it
however if osha can establish that its enforcement action was substantially justified or the result of special circumstances small businesses can be refused attorneys fees even if osha loses the case in court
in 2004 osha cited 86 708 violations based on its nearly 40 000 workplace inspections
yet how many applications were filed for attorneys fees against osha in 2004
we heard testimony in our committee on this issue and what we found is that the law s substantially justified and special circumstances standards have made it easy for osha to deny small businesses the ability to recover attorneys fees
employers face relentless competition every day in the face of high taxes rising health care costs and burdensome government regulations
we want to make sure that onerous government regulations do not hamstring small businesses ability to continue to hire new workers and compete in our economy
the measure before us is again narrowly crafted and a commonsense bill that addresses a specific problem in the osha law
mr speaker i congratulate the gentleman from georgia mr norwood xz4002960 who has spent a lot of years trying to make osha work better for those in the workplace and those who employ them in the workplace
he has done a great job in bringing these four bills out of the subcommittee and to the floor today
in so doing we have the opportunity to enhance business competitiveness and further job creation
thirdly no small business wants to go up against an osha that is the prosecutor judge and jury all in one
these osha reform bills can make a real difference in the lives of small businesses that face fierce competition at home and abroad
mr speaker i thank my colleague from georgia for yielding me this time and i am here in support not only of hr 742 but of all four of these osha reform bills
during the 2004 elections what we heard constantly from the other side was the concern about outsourcing of jobs of losing jobs in this country
well there is no way we can compete with other countries with these burdensome rules and regulations like osha puts on our small businessmen and women in this country who create most of the jobs
we just need a level playing field and i am proud to stand in support of these four bills and i am proud of my colleague from georgia mr norwood xz4002960
he has been a leader all these years in regard to issues like the patients bill of rights
yes protect our workers but also protect our small employers so they can continue to create these jobs and compete in the world market
madam speaker i rise today in opposition to these measures
this legislation moves in the wrong direction for worker safety
it does nt matter in which facility these accidents occurred
in march fifteen people were killed in a refinery accident in texas city
mr speaker as a former small businessman i rise today in support of hr 742 and republican efforts to reduce the regulatory burden on small businesses the job engine in this country
the federal regulatory burden is strangling small business in america
the estimated total regulatory burden in america is now approaching 1 trillion a year
furthermore according to the sba small businesses that employ fewer than 20 workers pay almost 7 000 each year in regulatory cost for every employee
hr 742 will make a difference in a small way in helping level the playing field for small businesses
i urge all of my colleagues to support small business owners and the millions of americans they employ by voting in favor of hr 742
madam speaker i rise in opposition to hr 739
the short deadline was enacted to encourage expeditious handling of cases and to ensure that the workplace hazards are corrected in a timely manner
the commission already has the ability to review specific cases of missed deadlines in a manner that protects the lt center gt lt pre gt page h5685 lt pre gt lt center gt it is clear that hr 739 is designed to ease the burden on employers at the expense of the health and safety of workers
this is the dramatic change in policy
my colleague from georgia said the dramatic change in policy is somehow osha has gained regulatory authority
the real change is this dramatic change in policy that would delay the employers responsiveness to the health hazards and increase the time that workers have to work in unsafe conditions
i know there are those who think that it would be better if the federal government had never gotten involved in this
madam speaker i rise today to speak in opposition to hr 739 a bill to amend the occupational safety and health act of 1970 to provide for adjudication flexibility with regard to the filing of a notice of contest by an employer following the issuance of a citation or proposed assessment of a penalty by the occupational safety and health administration
in essence this bill would amend current law to authorize the occupational safety and health review commission oshrc to make exceptions to the 15day deadline for employers to challenge osha citations if the employer s failure to meet this deadline is due to a mistake inadvertence surprise or excusable neglect this would weaken the ability of the occupational safety and health review commission to enforce the current deadline and would encourage increased litigation and disrupt osha s ability to address workplace hazards in a timely manner
osha is already astonishingly ineffectual in protecting workers lives
in the past 20 years osha has failed to seek criminal prosecutions in 93 percent of the cases where employers willful and flagrant safety violations ended up killing workers
the us lags behind other western nations in protecting workers lives
a us construction worker is 4 times more likely to be killed on the job than one in denmark
mr speaker i rise today to speak in opposition to hr 740 a bill to amend the occupational safety and health act of 1970 by expanding the size of the commission that hears osha appeals from three to five members
voting in favor of hr 740 could potentially erode a basic respect for human life
mr speaker i rise today to speak in opposition to hr 742 a bill to amend the occupational safety and health act of 1970 by making it easier for small businesses to recover attorneys fees from osha if the agency brought unjustified enforcement action
small businesses under the bill are defined as those with no more than 100 employees and a maximum 7 million in net worth
osha as is almost every other federal agency is already required by law to pay attorneys fees and costs in any proceeding in which the agency s charge is not substantially justified
hr 742 singles out osha alone among all federal agencies to require it to pay attorneys fees and costs in any proceeding in which it does not win regardless of why it lost and notwithstanding the fact that the position of the agency was substantially justified
in effect unless the agency can guarantee that it will win every case it brings hr 742 punishes the osha for trying to enforce the law
in summary this bill as would all the other osha bills considered today would impede the enforcement of worksite safety and health provisions at the very time when more and more americans have identified safety as one of their foremost concerns
according to a poll conducted in april by nbc and the wall street journal 84 percent of americans want congress to pass legislation that ensures greater workplace safety and health
supporting this bill would take us in exactly the opposite direction
current law already does allow small business owners to recover attorneys fees if they successfully challenge a citation but in the real world of osha it simply does not work for small businesses
case in point in the last 24 years small business owners have been able to recover costs from osha only 38 times
in 2004 only three employers were awarded attorneys fees despite more than 86 000 citations issued by osha
hr 742 also limits its scope to small businesses with less than 100 employees or less than 7 million in net worth
as chairman of the subcommittee on employeremployee relations i have seen these bills through the committee and the full house in the past and i look forward to their passing again today
mr speaker i rise today in support of the occupational safety and health small employer access to justice act
and i read it that way in the quotes for a purpose
the purpose of the legislation that we are talking about today is to in fact help create and keep jobs here in america
loopholes in the current law make it possible for small businesses to be denied attorneys fees and as my friends said therefore not even take the case to court because they simply can not afford to defend themselves against a case brought against them by osha
by closing this loophole we ensure it is in everyone s best interest
i rise in strong opposition to hr 742 and to any bill that seeks to weaken osha at a time when we should be strengthening it
it also occurs to me that there is a question of the constitutional rights of workers here that since osha is given rather exclusive jurisdiction to protect the rights of workers and to enforce workplace safety standards that working people would in effect be deprived of due process of law and equal protection of the law
it will alter osha s ability to enforce and it will leave workers in danger
the latest numbers from the bureau of labor statistics show a rise in deaths of american workers on the job
in 2002 5 524 workers were killed due to injuries on the job
in 2003 44 million 44 million nonfatal workplace injuries were also reported
hr 742 would require osha to pay attorneys fees in any case which it does not prevail
this would discourage settlements which save both time and money and in effect leave businesses with little or no reason to not contest charges
why support hr 742 which in effect does this same thing
this bill was designed to weaken enforcement of workplace safety laws and to in effect steal from exploited americans the protection from injury and the justice they deserve
they work in factories in shops in hospitals
they work in nursing homes and in schools
in the year 2000 977 percent of all private establishments had less than seven employees and such establishments have a higher rate of occupational fatalities than establishments of more than 100 workers
does a breadwinner have the right to be protected in the workplace
we should not give up on workplace safety because of some odd notion that osha should pay if it brings a proceeding that is not upheld in a higher jurisdiction
we as members of this house will pay a price if we fail to uphold workers rights if we fail to uphold the rights of a safe workplace if we fail to uphold the right to fair compensation if someone is injured on the job if we fail in our moral obligation to assure that corporations have a responsibility to their workers
and because of that i urge my colleagues to vote to defeat hr 742 and to work in a bipartisan way to assure that the american workplace is going to be safe for all those who toil for a living
despite this progress too many americans continue to be sick or injured or killed in workplace accidents that could or should have been avoided
two major workplace tragedies one in texas this year and the other in ohio last year underscore the need to strengthen not weaken the health and safety laws of this country
although bp initially blamed contract workers for the explosion it now appears that faulty equipment played a major role in this catastrophic blast
as it turns out the bp amoco refinery in texas city has been a repeat safety violator
repeat safety violations also played a key role in the deaths of four iron workers when a massive bridge crane collapsed near toledo ohio in 2004
the commission already has the authority to review any missed deadlines on a casebycase basis in a manner that protects both employers and workers
we are starting out with hr 739 the occupational safety and health small business day in court act of 2005
at the outset i would like to stress that this legislation in no way diminishes the worker safety protections of the occupational safety and health act
the occupational safety and health small business day in court act amends the osh act to resolve a conflict between section 10 of the act and the federal rule of civil procedure 60 b
the bill is designed to make sure that an employer who fails to respond to an osha citation in a timely fashion is allowed to do so and have his or her day in court and how reasonable of us to allow that if the reason for missing the deadline was excusable neglect a mistake or inadvertence
until recently if an employer filed a late notice of contest to an osha citation osha had limited flexibility in accepting the notice because of a conflict in the law that was written 34 years ago
on december 13 2004 the solicitor of labor issued a memorandum to regional solicitors announcing a change in the department s legal interpretation
this is the right policy in my view and i include for the record the aforementioned memorandum
this memorandum announces a change in the department s legal interpretation of section 10 a of the occupational safety and health act of 1970 29 usc
the department previously interpreted that provision to preclude the occupational safety and health review commission from considering an employer s contest of an osha citation that is filed after expiration of the statutory fifteen workingday contest period except in the unusual situation in which the limitations period has been equitably tolled
the commission s position has long been that it can consider late contests if the employer establishes that its failure to meet the deadline was due to excusable neglect as that phrase is used in fed
although the second circuit agreed with our view in chao v russell p lefrois builder inc 291 f3d 219 2d cir
2002 the commission has repeatedly rejected it and this past june the third circuit ruled against us in two cases
after studying the statute and relevant case law the department has concluded that late filed notices of contest may be considered under the conditions specified in rule 60 b
this change is not only consistent with the commission s interpretation but it is also consistent with msha s and the federal mine safety and health review commission s interpretation of identical language in the mine act
moreover the previous interpretation had a disproportionate impact on small businesses in that these entities are more likely than larger companies to file untimely notices of contest
however the regions should continue to argue aggressively as they have previously and usually successfully done in the alternative that rule 60 b relief can only be granted to employers that establish all elements of the excusable neglect standard
in this way we can focus our limited resources on protecting worker safety and health rather than on litigating a collateral procedural issue
if there are additional questions please contact daniel mick counsel for regional trial litigation in the osh division
no attorney in the office of the solicitor shall argue on behalf of the secretary that the commission lacks the authority to apply rule 60 b s excusable neglect standard to consider late notices of contest
attorneys handling osha cases arising in new york connecticut or vermont or when otherwise appropriate shall note that the second circuit court of appeals has held to the contrary but point out that the le frois decision made clear that the secretary s reasonable interpretations of the osh act are entitled to judicial deference and was rendered before osha adopted its current view
consistent with existing law sol attorneys shall argue that in addition to the employer establishing that the neglect was excusable relief can not be granted unless the employer also asserts a meritorious defense to the citation
in addition because rule 60 b relief is only available upon such terms as are just in appropriate cases such as where the employer contests only the penalty or madam speaker all hr 739 would do is simply codify the solicitors new directive permanently cementing this change in the osh act and ending the conflict between the osh act and rule 60 b
i tell members what if you are a mom and pop in this country running a small business with three or four employees i promise this is important to them
the 12 percent of the labor union members in this country i guarantee it is important to many of them because many of them are also in small businesses
many of them who have spouses are in small businesses
if you have a small business in your district you certainly should vote yes for this one bill
maybe we can concentrate just on this bill now for this hour and understand that this is a badlyneeded change in osha unless you do not believe osha ought to work unless you do not believe that the osha commission should be in place
in april the occupational safety and health review commission s term expired placing the commission in the same position it has been in for almost twothirds of its existence now listen to me almost twothirds of its existence for the last 34 years undermanned and unable to function properly
we are actually going to change this commission like most commissions in the federal government and change it to five members so it finally can do the job that the congress in 1970 wrote into the law they wanted it to do
the bill changes the quorum requirements from two members to three members and allows the president to consider legal training in addition to education and experience as criteria in selecting an individual to serve on the board
finally hr 740 allows a confirmed member of the commission to continue to serve for up to 365 days to prevent the breaks in service that occur when a senate confirmation is not concluded in a timely manner
the committee heard testimony in the 108th congress that because of the vacancies the commission has been nonfunctioning for twothirds of 30plus years of its existence
why in the world would you want to protect the presentday system
given that the creation of the commission was the catalyst for the passage of the osh act in 1970 there never would have been an osha had not this particular provision been in this review commission
i believe it is important to prevent the commission from being stalled and unable to rule on cases when there is a gap in appointees
nothing in this bill suggests or requires that every member of the commission be a lawyer
the simple fact of the matter is this when the commission is unable to rule on cases resolution does not occur in a timely manner
in the 108th congress this bill passed the full house with bipartisan support by 228 to 199
and i will say if you live in a district where there are no small businesses in that district then i would vote no on this
but if i had any small businesses in my district i would give it some serious consideration
if you want to be against making osha actually work and the review commission doing the job that the democratic congress wrote in the bill in 1970 then vote no mr speaker i yield 3 minutes to my good friend the gentleman from georgia mr price xz4006261
this review commission was written into the law in 1970 written into the law by a democrat house and senate that simply said osha did not get to be the judge and jury
twothirds of the time in 34 years this commission has been unable to act
because most working families in this country are in small business
well this is simple what we want in this bill we want a review commission at osha that works
this is a small tweak in a 34yearold bill that is not working and it does not help anybody
in hearings before my subcommittee in the last congress we heard testimony from several witnesses about settling citations with osha rather than contesting citations even though the employer felt the citation was dead wrong
i do not even have to be in congress to hear this
i know about this kind of thing going on in my area all of the time
does this remind any of you that have been in business about hearing from any of your friends with the irs
but that is better than not ever allowing a small businessman to be able to defend himself in court
this legislation is needed because the equal access to justice act has not been effective in redressing unfair citations for small business owners
in fiscal year 2004 small businesses were awarded only 11 585 by oshrc
i would like to point out that in 180 other areas congress has provided feeshifting statutory arrangements for attorneys fees
hr 742 simply levels the playing field for small employers by encouraging osha to better assess the merits of the case before bringing the full force and power of the united states government in their litigation against a small business
this measure passed the house thank goodness last year in the congress with bipartisan support 223 to 194
i urge my colleagues in particular my democratic friends who have small businesses in their district i urge them to vote for all four of these bills
but these are four simple commonsense fair bills that small business in this country need
mr speaker it gives me absolute pleasure to yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from south carolina mr wilson xz4004331 my friend and neighbor who lives right up the road from me in columbia
these four bills are very important i believe for the small business community in the country
i realize that the labor union kingpins do not like these four bills but i promise labor union workers who are out there in small businesses will like these bills
if you believe they are a bunch of police over there we never will get anywhere with osha because until we get this federal agency working with people in small businesses who want to have a safer workplace rather than a bunch of cops who come around and beat people up this is never going to work
i had this happen just yesterday in my own district where this female came in and her badge was bigger than her brain
they are important but in the reverse way
they are not important to protect the health and safety of working families in america
in this case the house republican leadership is backing four bills to weaken osha at the very time that the american public is demanding the exact opposite be done
according to a recent poll sponsored by the wall street journal eight out of every ten americans believe congress should be passing legislation to ensure greater health and safety in the workplace
let me repeat that the wall street journal which is hardly a liberal publication they sponsored a poll in april 2005 revealing that 84 percent of those surveyed want lawmakers to pass bills ensuring safer workplaces in america
an article published in the april 10 issue of parade magazine assessed our national priorities based on 2005 dollar allocations for government programs
the amount dedicated to business parade magazine concludes is close to 1 billion more than that dedicated to safety in this simple comparison
the osha bills being voted on today will only serve to exacerbate this huge divide between federal investments in business versus safety
in a hearing last month the us chemical safety board underscored the fact that chemical dust explosions represent a serious industrial hazard in this country
since 1980 200plus explosions and dust fires in us plants caused the deaths of 100 workers and significant injuries to 600 others
even though the chemical safety board chair stresses that these lt center gt lt pre gt page h5679 lt pre gt lt center gt as recent headlines about worker deaths in texas new york and ohio have revealed american workers are far too often killed or severely injured as a result of safety violations by employers who have lengthy histories of similar offenses
in march 2005 15 workers were killed and more than a hundred injured in a massive british petroleum refinery blast
a preliminary chemical safety board investigation indicates that faulty equipment was a key factor in this terrible explosion which also destroyed buildings and cars
yet osha had already fined the same british petroleum plant 100 000 in september 2004 for safety violations that at that time had killed two workers
in fact osha had previously cited and issued a fine of 63 000 in march 2004 to that british petroleum plant for 14 safety violations
they are going to voluntarily comply one day but in the meantime many more workers will be killed
nearly twothirds of all violations in 2003 involved faulty scaffoldings andor the failure to provide fall protection equipment
under its current staffing it would take osha 108 years to inspect all of the workplaces in the united states
moreover osha has yet to release a standard an advisory committee drafted a year ago to govern inspection of cranes manufactured in europe as the crane in the ohio fatalities had been
in closing the american people are watching us
they want safer workplaces in america
i urge my colleagues to join me in voting no on these bills
madam speaker i include for the record letters from the aflcio the teamsters the uaw afscme as well the united steelworkers in opposition to these bills
occupational safety and health small employer access to justice act this bill requires taxpayers to pay the legal costs of small employers who prevail in any administrative or enforcement case brought by osha regardless of whether the action was substantially justified
osha will be hesitant to cite employers for violations of the oshact unless there is absolute certainty that the enforcement action will not be challenged will be upheld or there will be no modification in the terms of action
no rational public policy would be furthered by discouraging osha from issuing citations that are substantially justified but as to which the across all industries establishments with fewer than 100 employees which in 2000 made up 977 percent of all private sector establishments have a higher rate of fatal occupational injury than do establishments with 100 or more workers
effectively hampering osha s enforcement ability in these establishments would be devastating to workers resulting in even higher rates of worker fatalities injury and illness
in contrast the commission only reviews the application of standards in those few cases that are contested and come before the commission
it also seeks to allow members whose terms have expired to continue serving on the commission for an additional 365 days in cases where no successor has been confirmed by the senate
the review commission has operated with three commissioners since it was first formed in 1970
occupational safety and health small business day in court act this bill seeks to excuse employers who miss the fifteenday timeframe to contest citations and failure to abate notices
its practical effect would be to make numerous excuses into legal reasons for missing the fifteenday timeframe in which employers currently must respond to osha citations
the idea of the fifteenday requirement is to give all parties a reasonable timeframe in which to take action and to ensure that the case is moved along as quickly as possible so the hazards cited will be addressed in as timely a manner as is possible
the taxpayer pay the legal costs when it loses a case against a small business that prevails in administrative or judicial proceedings regardless of whether the governments position was substantially justified
in effect hr 742 says that unless the agency is absolutely certain that it can prevail that it is absolutely certain that its enforcement action will not be challenged will be upheld or no modification will occur in terms of action it will be penalized budgetarily for fulfilling its statutory obligation to protect the safety and health of all workers union and nonunion and to provide an avenue for redress
hr 739 the occupational safety and health small business day in court act seeks to excuse employers who miss the current fifteenday time frame to contest citations and failure to abate notices
we believe this proposal does nothing more than create artificial legal reason for failing to respond in a timely fashion
it is an about face from ensuring that an osha case is moved along as expeditiously as possible to ensure that workplace hazards are addressed in as timely a manner as possible thus improving worker safety and health
further the current system helps ensure that all parties work together to select qualified people to serve and to do so in a timely manner
the bill would take away the authority held by the secretary in bringing cases to the court of appeals and the supreme court an important avenue of redress to protect workers from dangerous and unhealthy workplaces
each of these bills will undermine subtly in some instances and egregiously in the case of hr 742 workplace protections and the protection that the osh act was designed to provide workers
in addition this bill would reverse the timehonored rule of american jurisprudence that requires litigants to bear their own cost and fees
there is no need for such legislation because the equal access to justice act already protects parties from administrative overreaching by compensating them in cases where the government is not substantially justified in bringing a law enforcement action or under other special circumstances the other three bills hr 739 hr 740 and hr 741 all relate to the occupational safety and health review commission commission or oshrc
in considering these bills the uaw urges the house to bear in mind that oshrc functions as an intermediate appeal for employers between decisions of the occupational safety and health administration osha and the us courts of appeal
hr 739 despite being mislabeled the occupational safety and health small business day in court act is not limited to small businesses
the purpose of the fifteenday requirement is to give all parties a reasonable amount of time to take action and to move cases along as quickly as possible so that hazards can be abated in a timely manner
the bill excuses employers from missing their fifteenday deadline but does not extend the same provisions to an employee who challenges the period for abatement in a citation
otherwise it is wasteful and unnecessary to expand oshrc which has been composed of three members since it was established in 1970
in other words hr 741 would give unprecedented and unwarranted authority to the oshrc to take away workers workplace health and safety protections
such a change would result in a delay in correcting dangerous work place hazards in a timely manner
dear representative the united steelworkers usw a union which represents industrial workers in virtually every sector of the economy strongly opposes the four bills amending the occupational safety and health act osha which the house is scheduled to take up tomorrow
perhaps most onerous is hr 742 the occupational safety and health small employer access to justice act which requires taxpayers to cover the legal costs of small employers who prevail or partially prevail in any administrative or enforcement case by osha or in any challenge to an osha standard regardless of whether the action was substantially justified
in other words this bill will go beyond the protection already provided to litigating parties in the equal access to justice act which currently protects a party in cases where the government is not substantially justified in bringing about a law enforcement action
hr 741 would order judges in cases appealed to the courts to give deference to the oshrc giving the commission unprecedented authority to interpret osha standards
finally hr 739 or the occupational safety and health small business day in court act would excuse all employers not just small employers that miss the fifteenday deadline for contesting osha citations
in other words this bill will effectively eliminate the 15day deadline further delaying the timeframe for moving a case through the process and further delaying actions to correct the possible hazard
the usw opposes this bill as redundant since employers already have recourse for missed deadlines in the federal courts under rule 60 b of the federal rules of civil procedure if the failure to contest meets certain requirements
in march 2003 osha began an inspection of strack incorporated a pipeline company in atlanta georgia
osha inspectors had seen strack employees working in a trench that was up to 12 feet deep
in may 2003 osha issued strack inc
fortunately in this case the hazards were corrected before anyone was killed
when it comes to trenching failure to correct hazards in the 15day required period can have fatal consequences
as jeffrey walters of cincinnati ohio testified before me last year his only son patrick died in a cavein on june 14 2002 only weeks after osha cited the firm patrick worked for which is moeves plumbing for willful trenching violations
in fact moeves plumbing had been inspected by osha 13 times before patrick s death
moreover another worker had died while digging trenches for the same plumbing company several years before patrick died in the same way
madam speaker i would like to just say that when we say the republican majority is trying to trivialize the role of osha and the role of safety in the workplace there is good foundation for this
when this administration took power the present administration in the white house one of the first acts that they perpetrated was the repeal of ergonomic standards at the urging of of course republican members of congress
they repealed the ergonomic standards that had been in process with a lot of bipartisan development and support over a long period of years
the current bush administration s first act was to repeal ergonomic standards to toss them aside and to send a message that workers in the workplace are not that important working families are really not important working conditions in america are not important
the construction industry is still one of the most unsafe industries but it has made tremendous strides in terms of saving lives as a result of being forced to follow certain kinds of standards by osha
i think we need more light thrown on this subject and for that reason we have prepared some information for each member of the committee by district and they can get familiar with the problem in their district with this information that we have compiled
for example according to the bureau of labor statistics in 2003 there were 200 worker deaths in the state of illinois
but in the 13th congressional district of illinois 695 percent of all the state s deaths took place
i think the member of congress from the 13th district ought to know that and take a look at what has happened in that district
the chart also lists the worker deaths according to the industry the person worked in and also the type of incident that was responsible for their death was it a fall contact with equipment et cetera
the information is also broken down between government workers and those working in the private industry
we will prepare this for each member to just let them know how serious a matter this is in terms of their own immediate districts
we think working families in america should not be treated as if they lived in a third world country and a lot of third world countries mores are being attempted by certain us industries
illegal immigrants are employed in large numbers in the construction industry
yet there is a tremendous amount of construction going on and if we go around the construction sites we will find that the workers doing the manual labor unskilled labor are immigrants and in many cases there are tremendous accidents and these people are shuffled off and frightened and intimidated to the point where they never even report it
a review of more than 2 500 osha construction site inspection records in new york state from the year 2003 found that nearly one third of all osha construction violations in the state were of scaffolding or fall protection requirement violations more than any other standard
the organizations involved in the analysis also said the results of this study as well as a separate review reveal troubling data about the plight of immigrant workers in the construction industry
their analysis titled lives in the balance immigrants and workers at elevated heights at greatest risk in construction was prepared by the new york state trial lawyers association and issued by the new york committee for occupational safety and health and the association of community organizations for reform now called acorn
the study reviewed all construction site osha inspections conducted in the state during 2003
now personally i know and i have related on this floor the total accidents that have taken place since then in new york city
five immigrant workers lost their lives in a trench that was being constructed without proper safeguards
i want to repeat that there is a class problem developing in america
those in power are insensitive to the needs of those who are out there working on the front lines whether it is in domestic service or in dangerous jobs like construction trucking and a number of chemical plants
our industries can not survive without people who work in those dangerous jobs
just as the soldiers on the front lines in iraq afghanistan or anywhere else always deserve the best that we can give them
every soldier is automatically a hero when he goes out to fight for his country because for every one who goes out to fight there are a few hundred thousand left behind who will what we have found in this present war in iraq is that people on the top with their classconscious sentiments at work did not provide at first the kind of protection that should have been provided to the soldiers on the front lines out there
i can not stress enough the need for all americans to recognize that we are all in this together
we have a governor of new york state now whose son was in the national guard in a program that required that once he came out he had certain duties and obligations
what kind of a message is that sending to all of the mothers and fathers of young men and women who have gone off to fight in iraq in terms of our society
they have been functioning with three members since the creation in 1970
given the enormous deficit spending promoted by this republican majority there is no real purpose in adding members and swelling the ranks
osha is far smaller and far less effective than it was when the republican majority took power in the house
so osha is under attack in a way which produces less work for such a commission
it is part of the pattern to chip away in every little way and trivialize what osha is all about
the same kind of zeal needs to be expressed in the way that osha is staffed and manned to provide the basic necessities to keep our workplace safe for our workers
let us just discuss for a moment the 2 578 osha violations in georgia in 2002
the occupational safety and health administration in 2002 issued an average of seven citations a day to georgia businesses that year
osha found 2 578 violations of its rules during 1 481 inspections of companies operating in georgia and documented more than 50 workplace deaths in that year
in 2001 osha issued 2 962 citations more than eight a day and 1 596 inspections in georgia
but i think it would be good if members got in touch with what is happening in their states and in their districts
the atlanta business chronicle documented this information in an article published march 23 2003
at that time the atlanta business chronicle had documented safety concerns in three of georgia s largest companies the home depot incorporated the georgia pacific corporation and united parcel service incorporated
included in osha s list were 563 workplaces in georgia and more than 200 of them were in the atlanta metropolitan area
of the companies based in georgia united parcel service had the most facilities on the list with 174 nationwide
out of all the georgia companies during 2003 durangogeorgia paper company in st
in addition to the safety violations that contributed to that explosion osha cited the company for allowing employees to work at heights of up to 50 feet without fall protection and for requiring employees to stand on a conveyor belt to remove jammed logs without adequate protection against being caught in a machine
osha fined the company 157 000 after an accident had resulted in the double amputation of a worker
in 2000 the company had paid 220 250 for 12 citations
the workers in small constructin firms deserve protection
small contractors are also the ones who are most likely to disobey immigration laws and have large numbers of people who are illegal immigrants working in their facilities
and therefore i have noted before we have a noticeable large number of deaths of immigrants in the construction industry
we have come to the point where our economy is compared to other economies in our global partnerships around the world
all of the unions in china are collapsing to the government
china produces a large part of its consumer goods in prisons
they produce a large part of their consumer goods in factories where workers are paid less than a dollar a day
so given the fact that we are on the floor for the second time in 2 years with these four bills it is an opportunity for us to educate our colleagues as to the seriousness of the current situation in the american workplace today
we need to come to the rescue of private enterprise in terms of their pension funds collapsing
more than 306 706 workers can now say their lives have been saved since the passage of the osha act in 1970
according to the bureau of labor statistics there were 5 559 workplace deaths due to traumatic injuries in 2003 which was a slight increase from the number of deaths in 2002 when 5 534 workplace deaths were reported
the lowest state for the fatality rate was 15 per 100 000 which was reported in delaware
the construction sector had the largest as i said before the construction sector had the largest number of fatal work injuries 1 126 in 2003 followed by transportation and warehousing which had 805 injuries and agriculture forestry fishing and hunting which had 707 injuries
industry sectors with the highest fatality rates were agriculture forestry fishing and hunting 312 per 100 000 in hunting
so you can see we are not here just to talk in support of the blue states the urban states the rust belt states but the rural areas are suffering quite a bit also
the workers there the rural areas suffer in terms of the large number of fatalities in the workplace
very interesting that simple guys out there fishers and logging workers are in the same category as aircraft test pilots and flight engineers in terms of deaths and injuries
the reallife example of an employer by the name of eric ho in houston illustrates the problem here
ho then directed the workers to tap into what would prove to be a gas line and there was an explosion which resulted in one contractor and two workers being seriously injured
in the end osha cited eric ho for ten serious violations and 29 willful violations
in turn eric ho challenged osha and a divided osha review commission eventually downgraded eric ho s citations
although eric ho was sentenced to prison in a prosecution led by the under the equal access to justice act when a federal agency is not substantially justified and cites an employer and the employer prevails in judicial proceedings the employer is reimbursed for his attorneys fees and expenses by the us treasury funds
under this bill hr 742 osha would be required to reimburse from its own budget an employer who prevails in judicial or administrative proceedings even when osha was substantially justified in issuing its initial citations
osha s inspectors will be forced to perform many mental gymnastics trying to predict whether a citation no matter how justified might have the slightest chance of being adjusted or overturned on a technicality in review proceedings
mr speaker members of both sides of the aisle agree that under its current budget and staffing configuration it would take osha 108 years 108 years to inspect all of the workplaces in america
now hr 742 would have the effect of tying the hands of osha inspectors behind their own backs causing them to analyze each and every citation in the most serious minute detail
in a sense this bill calls for osha inspectors and supervisory staff to become forecasters
they will be required to predict any and all possible scenarios in which a specific citation might be reversed on a technicality
in the meantime the founding purpose of osha to assure quote every working man and woman in the united states safe and healthful working conditions that would be more or lose forgotten
mr speaker there are members on the other side of the aisle who would have us believe that every osha inspector is like police inspector javert in victor hugo s famous novel les miserables these members compare every business owner to hugo s noble character jean valjean hounded by osha s javertian inspector for having innocently slipped up on one point one miniscule point of an obscure and archaic osha safety rule
in turn those members refuse to acknowledge the relevance of another great novelist charles dickens who captured bleak scenarios in which greed led the owners of blacking factories to subject child workers to inhumane and lifethreatening conditions
in reality we do not have to turn to 19th century novels to enlighten us on workplace safety conditions in this country
reporter barstow reminded us all that someone harassing a wild burro on federal lands in 2004 would get a stiffer penalty that is up to a year in prison than an unscrupulous employer whose willful safety violations resulted in the death of a worker
as i have repeated several times during today s debate that employer s malfeasance could result in a sentence of no more than 6 months in jail
rather it is because a provision in the omnibus appropriations act enacted at the end of the 108th congress repealed the protection of wild burros and horses on federal lands
the humane treatment of american workers stands in the way of profits and competition with the people who are in the developing countries and china
according to the bureau of labor statistics in 1998 there were more than 65 million private sector firms with 99 or fewer employees
again osha inspectors in reality are hardly like the draconian police inspector javert from the famous novel les miserable it is important mr speaker to realize that there is a need for both parties to come together and for the republican majority to yield on its strategy to destroy labor unions
there is a strategy that has been pursued relentlessly to destroy labor unions and in the process working families of course get hurt because working families are represented by labor unions
in the effort to destroy labor unions everything related to them it gives them some kind of power has to be destroyed among them including osha
it has been brought back because it is a part of a master plan and that master plan is to sort of distract our attention from the real issues related to safety in the workplace distract our attention from the fact that it is really an employer protection act that we are concerned with
the constituency of the republican majority party demands it all destroy the kind of environment and atmosphere that working families have been used to for years in this nation
we are in the process drawn into the trap of class warfare
we hate to hear the term class warfare anywhere in america
at one end of the spectrum in terms of economic systems you have communism at the other end you have reckless capitalism
we are going to destroy the consumers by destroying the conditions in the workplace which allow our workers to work productively and get paid appropriately
people are making big profits off china in this country
we would not be dealing with china if somebody was not making big profits in this country but it is skewed
it is out of balance because in order to make big profits at the upper levels by producing products in a lowcost economy and getting the lowcost product bringing them back into another economy with a different standard of living and selling those products at that standard we are having consumers in america pay high prices for the lowestpriced goods that come from china
there is more walmart in china than there is in the us and more all of the time
we should be paying something like 8 an hour in order to keep minimum wage competitive with when minimum wage was first instituted
congress has gotten huge increases in their own salaries and refuse to consider a minimum wage increase for the workers at the very bottom
that is class hatred to stamp on those at the very bottom and refuse to use the authority invested in us by the american people
we have the authority to raise wages but the same people who are being protected by these bills as far as osha is concerned by minimizing their expenses and minimizing any trouble they have to encounter in making the workplace safe they are being protected by refusing to raise the minimum wage
working families are the people who go out and defend the existence of this country in times of war
working families are going to determine that we do not have domestic terrorism spreading in america because working families are going to save america by rising up to throw out people who insist on stamping on them and have contempt for them
mr speaker in closing i urge a no vote on all four of these bills today
there is no economic benefit for employers or those who keep and create jobs in america to want injured workers
what we would like to see is a cooperative effort between the osha folks and people who keep and create jobs in america working together for a safe work environment
it does more to keep and create jobs in america than anything i have heard from the opposition both today and for the balance of this year
i want to make the point that it is a proworker agenda that we are moving forward here because it will help us keep and create jobs in america
and since coming to congress 3 years ago i have worked consistently to make it easier for small businesses to grow and succeed in our country
small businesses provide in the district i represent 99 percent of businesses creating 85 percent of jobs for working people and congress should act now to help them succeed
madam speaker i rise in opposition to hr 739 because it appears to be just another way for this administration to distract from the real priorities of our nation s workers fair wages open labor negotiations secure pensions us jobs over the outsourcing of our jobs and of course a safe working environment that protects workers from harm and allows their families peace of mind
this bill would allow a company to receive a filing extension no matter why the paperwork was lost whether they lost track of it in the first place or if they even put it aside because of their very own negligence
why should any worker be forced to suffer in unhealthy or unsafe working conditions or worse lose their life or be maimed for their life because of inefficiencies within a company s system
that is why i encourage my colleagues to join me and join the gentleman from new york mr owens xz4003060 in opposing hr 739
mr speaker i rise in opposition to hr 740 because workers deserve to know that their interests will be heard without biased judgment by the occupational safety and health review commission
the size of the osha review commission has no meaning in the face of employee health and safety in the face of death and injury
their grievances must be taken more seriously than these little fixes here and there in the osha review
mr speaker i rise in opposition to hr 742 because workers deserve to know their interests will be represented fairly by osha not weighed by how much money it will cost to bring the claim forward
we all have small businesses in our districts and we all know that it saves money to provide for a safe workplace in the first place and preventing accidents
these actions would let our workers know that someone is worrying about the costs in their lives as well
mr speaker i urge my colleagues to join me in opposing hr 742 which is an unnecessary attack on worker protections
i want to commend the chairman for his work in this area and commend the gentleman from georgia mr norwood xz4002960 who has labored long and hard on these issues
i think it is important for people to appreciate that no one no one is interested in trivializing the issue of safety in the workplace
we are interested in improving workplace safety and in holding businesses accountable when they are at fault not just because
no one is interested in trivializing this issue
no one is putting a price tag on life here and no one is interested in giving employers a pass
what this does is simply put faith in small business and it shifts the burden of proof to the accuser where it should be
i rise in support of hr 739
in talking about this before and in researching this i went back and looked at the original osha act
the original osha act in 1970 said that it was to assure safe and healthful working conditions for working men and women by authorizing enforcement of the standards developed under the act
it simply means that small business has an opportunity to get its fair day in court
so in closing madam speaker i want to commend once again the gentleman from georgia mr norwood xz4002960 for the hard work he has done and the gentleman from ohio chairman boehner for bringing this issue to the floor
i urge all of my colleagues to support hr 739 and do it for small business and for the employees and jobs in our nation
mr speaker i once again want to commend the gentleman from georgia mr norwood xz4002960 for his wonderful and excellent work in the area of worker safety and his real concern for making certain that the rules under which we ask businesses and employees to work are workable
we are all interested in workplace safety
we are all interested in workplace safety
well if you add two people to the commission to the review commission then it makes all of the sense in the world that you have made it easier to reach a quorum
mr speaker i think it is also important that we keep in mind the magnitude of the discussion that we are talking about and why these things need to be fixed 997 percent of all business is small business 997 percent
and 75 percent of all new jobs in this nation have been created in small businesses
in this instance regarding 740 i rise in support of hr 740 because if those small business owners are not working they are not producing
once cited by osha an employer deserves his or her expeditious day in court
again the magnitude of this issue 997 percent of all businesses are small businesses 75 percent of all new jobs are in the area of small business
hr 742 would allow a small businessman or woman to recover attorneys fees if they contest and they win they win an allegation in a citation by osha
less money in your business means fewer jobs
madam speaker i want to thank the gentleman from ohio mr boehner xz4000360 for his leadership in the committee on education and the workforce and the fact that he has been able to pass reasonable legislation that not only helps the employee but the employer and gives us a better business atmosphere in this country
i would also like to thank my friend and fellow georgian mr norwood xz4002960 for his leadership in finetuning our occupational safety and health laws
no one wants to regress to the days when workers had few rights and worked in ridiculously dangerous situations with little or no regard for their safety
in the end good precautions are good for workers good for businesses and good for the economy as a whole
in the construction business i worked closely with subcontractors who were small business owners themselves
one of them a good friend of mine ran into trouble with osha over this very rule that we are debating today in the small business day in court act
the walls of the hole caved in killing the employee
not only are our small businesses increasingly faced with greater competition from the bigger competitors in the us but also are they faced with greater competition from across the globe
according to a study discussed in the office of management and budget s draft report to congress on the costs and benefits of federal regulations for 2005 it is estimated that the quote total cost of federal regulation environmental workplace economic and tax compliance regulation was 60 percent greater per employee for firms with under 20 employees compared to firms with over 500 employees
in another recent study these costs translate to approximately 7 000 in regulatory costs per employee per year
we need to aid our small businesses in being more competitive not help force them out of business
but oftentimes good intentions do not result in the best practices
many of our small businesses unintentionally and innocently miss this arbitrary deadline and can be denied their day in court as a result
many small businesses that have unintentionally missed this deadline are simply not able to navigate the complex regulations in order to appeal the osha citation
in january of this year even the department of labor agreed that this deadline is too burdensome and decided it would allow the occupational safety and health review commission to have discretion over the 15day deadline for filing appeals
expanding the review board for appeals cases to osha from three to five commissioners would speed up the appeals process so small businesses will have their cases reviewed in a timely manner
in past years each of these four bills has passed the house by good margins
jobs are at stake and a vital economy lies in the balance
mr speaker i rise today in support of hr 525 the small business health fairness act of 2005
in 2003 there were an estimated 45 million americans without health insurance
too often i hear from small businesses owners back in my district in missouri that the affordability of health insurance is their number one concern
this problem has been deepened in recent years as the overall cost of health care has risen
while large employersponsored health plans have seen an average 12percent increase in health insurance premiums small businesses have been lt center gt lt pre gt page h6495 lt pre gt lt center gt by allowing small firms to join an association health plan as hr 525 would do small employers would enjoy greater bargaining power because they would become part of a larger bargaining force enabling them to offer their employees the same advantages and benefits that are currently available to larger companies
i doubt that many of my colleagues here would deny the fact that small businesses are leaders in innovation
i hear the phrase burdensome state mandates a woman has a c section and gets to stay in the hospital for at least 48 hours
that heavy hand of government in this case is evidently shared by republican governors around the country because the national governors association opposes this bill
mr speaker i rise in opposition to the bill and i yield myself 4 minutes
i do not think there is a member of this body that does not favor finding an intelligent and effective way to reduce health care costs for small business so they can continue to insure the people they do insure and expand and insure more people in the future
there is a better way to solve this problem and the gentleman from wisconsin mr kind xz4002180 will address that issue when our substitute is brought to the floor in a little while
the second reason is that this bill will not result in a reduction of the number of uninsured
to the contrary it will result in an increase in the number of uninsured people and here is how
it is estimated by the experts in this field that 8 million people will be shifted from conventional health care policies and plans to association health plans
these 8 million people will in fact probably have a lower premium than they do right now for a little while
but when those 8 million people are shifted out of conventional health care plans and they will tend to be younger and healthier people the people remaining in the conventional health care plans will have to bear more of the costs and premiums will go up by an estimate of 23 percent
when the premiums go up on the rest of those in the pool fewer of them will be insured
the experts estimate that while 8 million people will be shifted from regular plans to ahps 9 million people approximately will lose their coverage altogether and the results will be a net loss in the number of insured of 1 million people
we have seen this happen before in multiemployer welfare associations
the third reason that we should oppose this bill the final reason is that the coverage that people have fought for over the years so that women have a minimum stay in the hospital after they have a c section so that women have the right to an annual mammogram so that people with diabetes have the right to insulin or diabetic care so that people struggling with mental health problems or with substance abuse have the right to have those services covered those protections which have been supported by republicans and democrats in state legislatures around this country are effectively repealed by the underlying bill a judgment being made in washington that contravenes the good judgment of republicans and democrats around the country
mr speaker i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from new jersey mr holt xz4001840 a member who does not want to see a 23percent increase in premiums for his constituents
the net impact of this bill will be to increase the number of uninsured people by nearly 1 million people because the increases in premiums for small business that will occur in businesses that stay in conventional plans will chase more people out of these plans
the experts estimate that these increases will be in excess of 20 percent
i urge our colleagues on both sides of the aisle to protect the benefits that our constituents earned and deserve and to prevent the increase in the number of uninsured and the increase in health insurance benefit premiums and vote no on this bill
in my state the cost of insuring a family is about 14 000 a year
under the majority s bill if we give the majority every benefit of the doubt if we assume that the majority s bill will work exactly as they say that it will the most optimistic forecast is the majority s bill will save 13 percent in premiums for that employer
it says that in a case of a small business like the one i am hypothesizing here where you have about 10 employees and where those employees make less than 200 percent of the poverty level which in my state for a family of four would be about 40 000 so just about anybody making less than 20 an hour or so would be eligible for this kind of subsidy that is most people
companies that are sending their jobs overseas would lose a tax break companies here in america would gain health insurance
mr speaker i rise in opposition of hr 525 and the association health plans it creates
there are 44 million americans who are uninsured in this country and this bill will not even affect 1 percent of them
this bill in fact hurts those who enroll in the plans and will even cause healthcare costs to go up for many other americans
this will leave consumers who enroll in these plans without protection or a right to appeal if their cancer or diabetes treatment or medicines are denied
this resolution provides for a structured rule and provides for 1 hour of debate equally divided between the chairman and ranking minority member of committee on education and the workforce waives all points of order against consideration of the bill and makes in order an amendment in the nature of a substitute offered by the minority
it allows the house to focus the debate and the vote upon two different approaches aimed at helping america s small businesses to offer health coverage to its employees and to debate and examine the proper role of the federal government in the health care arena
amendments not made in order were offered and discussed by the committee so it is appropriate i think not to duplicate that committee action here on the floor
hr 525 is the small business health fairness act of 2005 sponsored by the distinguished gentleman from texas mr sam johnson and is virtually identical to legislation passed in the 108th congress then hr 660 which passed this house by a 90vote margin of 252 to 162
it does not seek to address every aspect of health care in america
to the chagrin of some of my friends on both sides of the aisle it does not move our country in the direction of government control and taxpayerfunded universal health care
hr 525 if enacted will result in more americans and more american families being covered by private health insurance and that is a worthy goal that we should all be working to achieve
the small guy will have nothing the large guy does not already have with specific regulations placed in the bill to ensure against unfair pooling practices
in the course of this debate mr speaker there will be many who will be giving facts and figures
we do that a lot because it is a very dramatic phrase and it makes us seem more important because we are in the middle of it
but i do believe in the issue of health care and insurance we are as a nation in the crossroads
indeed i think the substitute that will be ordered is illustrative not in topic but in spirit of this where there is greater government control greater regulations being put in there so that one wonders if the issue is really health insurance or if the issue is control
the other approach that we are in the crossroads of and could take would be an approach to try and add market forces into the system to try and move some type of reforms along the way
there were requirements in health care which i thought were good at the time which i also knew were costly at the time and i also realize in hindsight in helping one group of very vulnerable people we actually hurt a different group of very vulnerable people
for example in my state family health care is covered for everyone until the age of 25
i still have two sons who are out there in that risky group with no health insurance whatsoever
i clearly realized from personal experience that all the mandates of coverage of health care systems are useless to those who can not get or can not afford insurance in the first place
i was very relieved that now he has insurance until a couple of weeks ago when he came and talked to me about joining a friend in an entrepreneurial enterprise in which case they would start their own business
we make decisions here that have farreaching effects in creating a society of limitations instead of visions as they should be
people who are not now covered have a chance to be covered in some way with insurance
regardless of how one votes on this issue in the past or in the future this is a fair rule
and i appreciate the gentlewoman from california and her wonderful and kind way in which she handled the rule on the minority side
just as a means of criteria of what we are going through as far as the rule itself every amendment that was proposed for this particular rule was discussed thoroughly and voted upon in the committee with the exception of obviously the motion to recommit
with the debate we have had in previous years every element of this bill has been thoroughly debated both on the floor and in committee this year as well as in years past
i have to admit mr speaker my favorite senator even though i am not supposed to have one is the junior senator from kentucky who is the only one to have won 100 games in both the american and the national league
i hope he does very well over there because if they continue to rise in value that may be the only way i pay for my health care in the future
fastball whistle he hit what would have been extra bases into right field except the second baseman caught the ball in selfdefense
the next pitch is a slider which hits mantle right in the legs
every time i go to a town hall meeting i face people who want some kind of relief in the ability of getting insurance
but my nextdoor neighbor who is trying to make a living in a shop down on main street that does not have insurance could under the provisions of this bill
mr speaker increasingly one of the things i hear from small business owners back in tennessee is they want congress to open the way just to open the way and set the stage for more affordable health care choices
over 90 percent of the jobs in tennessee are small business jobs
it is the largest employer in my district
every small business owner knows that providing quality health care is one of the most costly items in running a business
mr speaker it is unfortunate that while we are in the midst of a healthcare crisis for the uninsured for small businesses and for practitioners congress is recycling the same flawed legislation
even worse the adverse selection process will mean that the insurance pool will be narrower and sicker resulting in more expensive insurance for most families
our primary goal here in congress mr speaker should be creating affordable options to help the uninsured
employerbased health insurance premiums rose by 11 percent last year following a 15 percent increase in 2003
in the last year we have seen how large corporations are now starting to band together to provide health care to their parttime workers
senator enzi who chairs the senate committee on health education labor and pensions has expressed a strong interest in working on this proposal and i am more optimistic than ever that the senate will address this problem
mr speaker the most pressing crisis we face in health care today is the number of americans who lack basic health insurance
employerbased health insurance premiums jumped by 11 percent last year following a 15 percent increase in 2003
president bush addressed this point directly last year during his speech at the united states chamber of commerce where he said ahps would provide small businesses the same opportunity that big businesses get and that is the economies of scale the economies of purchase the abilities to share risk in larger pools which drives down the costs of health care for small businesses the president is right and we should help level the playing field so small businesses can offer quality coverage to their workers
importantly the bill gives ahps the freedom from costly state mandates because small businesses deserve to be treated in the same fashion as large corporations and unions who receive the same exemptions today
clearly these mandates are useless to families who have no health coverage in the first place
in addition ahps can not charge higher rates for employers with sicker individuals within the plan except to the extent already allowed by state law where the employer is located
we in congress have a responsibility to deal with a problem of small businesses who can not afford to provide health insurance because of skyrocketing health care costs
it is very clear in the bill as i read it not the way the gentleman from georgia mr norwood xz4002960 reads it and this is where the source of the disagreement comes in terms of how plans can choose groups of employees
maybe you have a plant located in one part of the state another plant in another part of the state
but what happens to those small employers in most of these state risk pools
they are in the small group coverage area and guess what happens
they are stuck in a small pool and they pay the highest rates of any group that is out there unless unless one happens to be selfemployed
let us say that they were a realtor and as a realtor they are selfemployed they are not an employee of a company and they try to buy health insurance for themselves out in the open market again in these small state risk pools
everybody in america wants to work for a big company or a union
because they make sense to find out early in the illness
but companies that offer a lot of these benefits they do so with as an example a breast cancer benefit that covers the whole country one size not 50 different states done in 50 different ways that they have to find out exactly how it is going to be covered in each of those 50 states
i have no doubt that the policies that will be offered by these association health plans will in fact be highquality policies at very competitive prices
now if we think that having states regulate insurance in a small group market is a problem with statemandated benefits this is the mother of all complicated programs to offer health insurance because what are we going to do
now none of us really believes that the federal government ought to be in the business of running bigrisk pools and offering plans to small businesses
one of the most damaging parts though is that each employer who would take part in this plan that is being offered would still be subjected to the state mandates on health insurance in their particular state
in most cases i would imagine the employer would pay far more than that of the premium but maybe it is a small company maybe it is five or six employees and maybe together they decide we want to qualify for this but we will each pick up our own share of the cost
why would we want to prohibit them from including themselves in this by this type of a requirement
that seems like a very short period of time especially in some industries where you have an awful lot of turnover where they would typically require that you wait 6 months before you would qualify
there are a lot of mechanisms in the private market for this association health plan program to work
the underlying bill that we have will in fact work
mr speaker i rise in opposition to the gentleman s motion
all we are trying to do in the underlying bill is to give small employers the same opportunity to provide highquality health insurance to their employees at competitive prices
you can have all the mandates in the world but if you do not have health insurance you get no coverage at all
mr speaker i thank my friend and colleague on the committee on rules the gentleman from utah mr bishop xz4000291 for yielding me this time and i rise today in support of the rule and the underlying legislation the small business health fairness act
this house has acted on four separate occasions in a bipartisan way to pass reforms that will allow small business owners to provide their employees with affordable health insurance options yet our efforts to help reduce the ranks of the uninsured has not gone forward
fundamentally it violates the concept of federalism that is embodied in our constitution respect for our states and the ability of our states to be able to regulate public safety issues and health issues for the people of our states
people who work for companies that are between two and 50 employees have the opportunity to purchase insurance affordable health insurance in maryland as a result of our small market reform
the passage of this legislation will mean the end of the small market reform and the opportunity to purchase insurance by small employers in my state
we are going to be moving in the wrong direction with making affordable health insurance available for the people of this nation
mr speaker as a member who is dedicated to protecting the rights of americans who have health insurance and to ensuring that opportunities to secure affordable health insurance can be expanded i rise in opposition to hr 525
since coming to congress i have heard frequently from individuals who work in small business
they have spoken to me about the difficulties that result from a lack of health insurance coverage skyrocketing premiums and reductions in benefits
under this misguided bill unregulated outofstate ahps could operate in maryland without being required to comply with health care safeguards enacted by our state legislature such as appropriate access to emergency care
not only would this bill be harmful to potential subscribers it would destroy the small group market reforms already in place in maryland
insurers have the option of offering additional benefits but they must due to these reforms more maryland small businesses offer health care coverage to their employees than in any surrounding states or in the nation as a whole
maryland s system is one in which healthy subscribers subsidize those who are less healthy
association health plans have been outlawed in our state
businesses with older sicker employees would remain in the state system driving up premiums
hr 525 would in effect lead to the collapse of maryland s system
passage of this legislation would be a disservice to every worker every family and every small business in maryland
hr 525 would allow ahps to form and operate in maryland outside the authority of my office and beyond the reach of proven state consumer safeguards and solvency laws
even more troubling is the harm the legislation would do to consumers hr 525 would 1 permit risk selection thereby creating opportunities for cherrypicking among healthier groups 2 allow inadequate capital standards and solvency requirements both of which are inferior to existing state standards 3 eliminate proven state consumer protection laws including those designed to allow consumer appeals of adverse plan decisions and those aimed at preventing and fighting fraud and i remain committed to improving access to affordable insurance for small business owners and workers in maryland
together we can find solutions that will be effective and not lead to greater problems in the future
but under the federal employee approach such as the one that we enjoy in this house of representatives they could have 10 or 20 or more plans to choose from and the likelihood that their physician their caregiver would be part of one or more of those plans increases substantially
the tax credit approach that my friend has mentioned has had to be adjusted for purposes of this substitute but we need to acknowledge as my friend from new jersey mr andrews xz4000080 mentioned health care is already seriously subsidized in this country
by completely overturning all state regulation as ahps would do that is a truly radical approach and while my friends on the other side may be radicals in this regard i think they are going further than they realize
let me admit mr speaker in closing our approach is less famous
because we do not have every pac and trade association in washington dc
you will see skyscrapers full of these folks all over town and they would love to make money as insurance salesmen to all the small businesses in america
the question is not who recognizes that there is a health care crisis in this country and who does not
this is not a contest to see who among us truly understands that small businesses are finding themselves in an increasingly difficult predicament when it comes to providing health care insurance for their employees
this bill has been hailed as the answer to covering many of the 45 million americans who are currently uninsured but in truth a very small percentage of the population would be helped in any way
i am the cochair of the bipartisan diabetes caucus in congress
one little vial of strips test strips costs 50 and insurance companies simply were not giving that benefit in the past
that is not only wrong for those beneficiaries who are diabetic it is shortsighted in the long run for the cost of our health care system
in addition we expect to consider hr 3045 the dominican republiccentral american free trade agreement sometime later in the week
i feel very confident by monday we will have a better feel for what the week should look like and in consultation with the minority we would have a better idea when the central american free trade agreement can be considered
we will try our best in consultation with you to give you some idea of when we could possibly bring that bill and if it is going to be considered next week and we can fit into the schedule then certainly we would let you know by probably the end of business monday
it is a very ambitious goal i must say to take a bill of this magnitude and in a matter of 2 weeks get all the differences worked out between the house and the senate and bring it to the floor
other bills will be considered during the august district work period and we will be able to make a more firm announcement to the members as to what we anticipate having the first week back and in addition to that the second week also
it is quite possible that we could address those issues in september
i have every expectation that the committee on ways and means will put out a retirement security bill for us to consider in september or the first of october
we could have a reconciliation bill in that time period
so those are some of the major issues that we will be facing in september and october
congress should not be in the business of promoting the reduction of healthcare benefits and coverage and that is exactly what this bill does
proponents of hr 525 argue that health insurance will be cheaper under this bill but the devil is in the details
those who are sicker would remain in nonassociation health plans and would have to pay higher premiums to compensate for those individuals who are siphoned off into the association health plans
we should reject this anticonsumer proposal in favor of the kindandrews substitute
this substitute very clearly commits federal funds to aid small businesses in offering insurance to employees
mr speaker i rise today in strong support of h res 379 and the underlying bill hr 525 the small business health fairness act of 2005
my good friend the gentleman from new jersey just spoke about some mandates regarding ob care and of course there are mandates that have been passed in the several states all 50 in fact that are very compassionate sounding
in fact in the state of georgia there was a mandate because of managed care intrusion and the requirement that everybody go through a gatekeeper and not to a specialist that women in the state of georgia if any health insurance policy was written they would have direct access to their obgyn
in fact i think i voted for that one
i want to tell you about a couple of other mandates in the state of georgia
another mandate in the state of georgia says that every baby born in a hospital in the state of georgia has to be screened for sickle cell anemia even when they are a part of an ethnic group where the percentage of sickle cell anemia is zero
these mandates just go and on and you have got them in all 50 states
we need to give people the opportunity to join their other employees in trade associations
mr speaker i rise in opposition to hr 525 the small business health fairness act
with costs in the private health insurance growing 128 percent each year no one would disagree that our small businesses are struggling to provide coverage for their employees
but this legislation is not the answer to the rising cost of health insurance in this country
for decades state legislatures in each of our states have enacted state coverage mandates and consumer protections to ensure that residents of those states purchase a quality health insurance policy
in my home state of texas health plans must provide access to emergency services immunizations for children direct access to obgyns and coverage of diabetes supplies and education just to name a few guaranteed benefits
the amendment offered by our colleagues mr kind and mr andrews would correct many of the flaws in this legislation
the kindandrews amendment would ensure that the quality of health plans is protected that low income employees have assistance in purchasing policies and that the smallest of small businesses get the additional assistance they need
as a former small business employee charged with choosing my company s health plan i am all too aware of the need for the assistance outlined in the kindandrews amendment
mr speaker today i rise in strong support of the rule for hr 525 the small business health fairness act of 2005 offered by the gentleman from texas mr sam johnson
we are talking about the small businesses in new jersey and elsewhere around the country that face the high cost of health insurance
the concept of companies working together to control costs has worked in some states and it is certainly something i support
mr speaker i rise today in strong opposition to the small business health fairness act hr 525
this provision is essentially meaningless because it permits ahps to accomplish the same goal by varying premiums based on age sex race national origin or any other factor in the employers workforce including claims experience
realizing that next week is a busy week and there are a number of very important items on the agenda how likely mr leader do you think it is that we will be in on friday
this week of course the patriot act which we thought was going to start thursday and go through today in fact was accelerated and nasa was taken today clearly to ensure full consideration of the patriot act
might it be possible with some assurance to let the members know when the cafta bill will be on the floor in effect adopting a similar procedure
mr speaker reclaiming my time the postal accountability bill you seem to indicate that that might be considered earlier in the week rather than later
in terms of motions to go to conference do you anticipate motions to go to conference on any appropriations bills next week
reclaiming my time mr leader i take it that in light of the fact you have not mentioned it at this point in time it is not on the schedule
because there is so much interest in that bill on our side mr leader would it be fair to say that that decision would be made prior to the close of business on monday so that we would have some notice of that in time to fairly consider it
it is probably as significant a jobs creation bill as we will pass in this congress and it has been delayed for a very long period of time
mr speaker reclaiming my time in light of the fact mr leader i will simply observe that if we get all of those things moving we are going to have a lot of work to do next week and i presume our members ought to be prepared for long days and clearly if we get all of that done it will be friday late before we get out of here
in light of the fact we will not have a colloquy next week because we will be going on recess for the summer work period can the gentleman tell us what he anticipates might be on the agenda when we come back on september 6 what might be on the agenda early in the september weeks
can the gentleman give me his thoughts on where they stand and when they might come on the agenda if in fact they will be coming on the agenda
mr speaker i rise today in support of hr 525
premium contribution rates for any particular small employer can not be based on the health status or claims experience of plan participants or beneficiaries or on the type of business or industry in which the employer is engaged
in addition the substitute offers coverage to all small employers and their employees
in essence all employers with fewer than 100 employees during the previous calendar year shall be eligible to apply for coverage under sehb
our small businesses share a large part of that burden because they are forced to shop for health insurance in the costly small group market
small businesses would be able to group together in bona fide trade associations
it is especially important to me because in my home state of texas one in four workers are uninsured
small businesses have it especially tough because there is an inherent problem in a small number of people
to make matters worse there is a lack of competition in the small group health insurance market allowing a few insurers to charge whatever they want
however pooling risk and buying in bulk is not enough
if your association had members all across the united states you would have to abide by 50 different sets of mandated benefits in order to offer your insurance
the ahp bill in both the house and the senate has tough safeguards to protect small businesses and their employees
a bona fide trade organization must have been in existence for 3 years before enactment of the law in order to offer an ahp
the department of labor has testified in hearings that they are up to the task and support the legislation
mr speaker ahps are a big step in the right direction for our hardworking families who need health insurance now
this bill addresses the two most important issues in the health care reform debate cost and access
small businesses in most states are stuck with disproportionately higher costs because they have to choose from fewer than five providers
this bill has had unwavering support in the house for nearly a decade now
the other body is taking a serious look at the legislation this year and it is a priority in the president s health care agenda
mr speaker i rise in opposition to the amendment in the nature of a substitute
the proponents of the plan claim that the new small employer health benefits plan is modeled after ours here in the federal government
in contrast ahps utilize the strengths of the employerbased system the private market competition economy of scale enjoyed by large union and employer plans and erisa s preemption of state mandates to lower costs
i hope my colleagues will join me in offering assistance to our nation s small businesses and their workers by supporting ahps and opposing the democrat substitute
in addition the funds are subject to appropriations
i live in the city of cleveland
we have a great organization representing many of our smaller enterprises called cose and cose has come together in an attempt to provide health care coverage to small businesses
so by presenting this amendment the gentleman from wisconsin mr kind xz4002180 and the gentleman from new jersey mr andrews xz4000080 have offered me an opportunity to say to the small businesses in my community i support you and i want to make sure you can provide health care coverage to your employees
mr speaker the other thing that we have to look at is and the prior speaker said something about subsidies and you give them to people and they do not get anything in return
we gave subsidies to the drug companies in the medicare prescription drug bill and they got money that they did not even have to use towards a prescription benefit
i met with many small business people in my hometown of orlando florida and they told me they need association health plans
he asked me what if anything he could do to help small businesses in my area
i also authored a small business bill of rights that passed this house back in april
as we all know we are in a health care crisis and many propose many solutions
they love to insure them because if they have low risk every dollar that they pay in terms of premium is another dollar down on their bottom line of profit
however if you are unfortunate enough to be born with a congenital defect in your organs if you are unfortunate to be run over by a car if you are struck by some ailment that is out of any control that you have whatsoever under the insurance system you are known as a risk
it says no state mandates which means all the provisions for example for pregnant women to be able to have at least 72 hours after giving birth all those provisions that states have put in for consumer protection are no longer there under this legislation because this obviates all those state requirements that the people want in their insurance coverage
because it could be any one of us that is the person that is in great need
thank you to my good friends mr kind xz4002180 and mr andrews for yielding me this time to speak in support of this substitute the small employer health benefits program which will provide a real solution for many of the fortyfive million americans without health insurance
to live in a country as great and as wealthy as ours and to have millions of hard working employed americans who can not afford quality health insurance is inexcusable
mr speaker i rise in opposition to the rule even though it has made in order a substitute that the gentleman from new jersey mr andrews xz4000080 and i will be offering
the reason i rise in opposition is because this is such an important issue that we really should have an open and fair and reasonable debate on the floor of the house of representatives
i think we can all stipulate that when we go home this is clearly the overriding issue we hear from our constituents the rising cost of health care and the inability especially in small businesses to be able to afford and access quality health care which is crucial to a growing and vibrant economy
in fact a recent mercer study indicates that adoption of this ahp legislation could raise the ranks of the uninsured by over 1 million people
this is consistent with what the congressional budget office has shown in their study that shows that adoption of this bill would leave 20 million of the workers with higher premium payments overall
the gao in a study showed that there are 144 illegal ahps operating affecting every state in the union with unpaid claims affecting over 200 000 workers today
the underlying bill is going to take oversight and accountability away from the states where it has traditionally resided with oversight powers and audit responsibilities put it in the department of labor with insufficient resources and no accountability and no oversight at all
because of that the state attorneys general in a letter stated the elimination of the state role and replacement with weak federal oversight is a bad deal for small businesses and consumers finally as the gentlewoman from new york mrs mccarthy xz4002570 has indicated it does preempt consumer protection which has been traditionally guaranteed by the states if they found that necessary
year after year after year it seems we continue to rise in this chamber to debate the same issue
one of the reasons we have to do this year after year is because bad policy is tough to sell and especially tough to sell in the senate right now which has refused to take this up and move it forward because it has been bad policy
that is why mr speaker especially under these conditions it is more incumbent upon us here in this chamber to be extra careful in regard to the policy proposals that we are proposing so we do not violate the hippocratic oath and that is first do no harm to the current health care system
mr speaker i quote from this letter from the national small business association in which they state the biggest loser from the passage of ahps would be small businesses
more and more small businesses are realizing that despite the bumper sticker pitch in its favor ahps are simply put bad public policy they go on to cite the mercer study saying that premiums for those outside the ahp market would increase an additional 23 percent and an additional 1 million people would become uninsured as this policy plays out they go on to state that the minimal price savings realized by some businesses through ahps would come from attracting healthier participants and depleting benefits that are currently required by states
furthermore the cbo found most of the enrollment in ahps would come from businesses switching coverage
only 1 in 14 would be newly insured
ahps do nothing to solve the problem in rising health care costs to small businesses and their employees and they conclude by saying they simply shift the cost from the overall market to a more concentrated group of people
this is hardly a longterm solution there is a better proposal one that we will talk about in more detail when our substitute is offered
there is a way for us i believe to come together in a bipartisan fashion to address one of the most pressing issues of the day and that is affordability and access to quality health care
businesses large and small family farmers individual employees are all suffering alike and that is why it is important for us to come together and do something meaningful to relieve the health care pressures in this economy
mr speaker i offer an amendment in the nature of a substitute
it is a crisis that has been building through a number of years and there is nothing more heartwrenching or gutwrenching than to speak to young parents who have a young child in desperate need of emergency medical attention having to take that child to the hospital knowing that they do not have adequate health care coverage to provide for their sick child
when we think about who comprises these 45 million to 48 million uninsured the vast majority of them are working americans working in small businesses who can not afford to provide coverage
again it is something we all recognize because we hear about it daily when we are back home traveling in our congressional districts
so yes action is needed but there is a right way and a wrong way in taking action
a wrong way would be doing more harm than good in passing legislation and for the previous hour we have had a discussion in regard to the deficiencies and the shortfalls of the underlying associated health plans bill
that is why over 1 400 organizations around the country have come out in opposition to it
what it does in essence mr speaker is it builds upon the successful framework that the federal employees health benefits program has offered to countless federal employees throughout the country
it is a purchasing pool concept that they can enter into with the competition of the marketplace and different insurance plans competing for that business that has proven to be extremely cost effective in not only extending coverage to millions of federal employees but also by guaranteeing the state protections and consumer protections that have been passed by state legislatures throughout the country
and the reason those state laws have been passed throughout the years is because the free marketplace and the insurance companies competing for the business were not offering this type of coverage and that is why the state legislatures in working with the governors had to pass legislation requiring certain minimal safeguards of health care coverage
so if a state legislature has felt in the past that it is necessary to require prenatal care for instance or to prohibit drivethrough deliveries or to require screening for diabetes autism cancer they have chosen to do so and it has made sense for those states that have
but instead this onesizefitsall approach comes in and tries to preempt what the states have been doing for many many years
mr speaker at this time i yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from colorado ms degette xz4001010 a person who certainly appreciates the role of states and consumer protection in this health care debate
mr speaker i have all of the respect and admiration for the chair of our committee but a closer reading of the substitute bill would not in fact require a federalrun program rather the department of labor would contract out the statelicensed health insurance plans in order to administer these programs
mr speaker i yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from rhode island mr kennedy xz4002151 someone who understands the importance of maintaining consumer protections as we have in our substitute bill
we are waiting to get a cost estimate back but based on two previous debates on this issue it was comparable to the amount of money set aside for the health savings account that has been a part of this bill in the past but is not this year
i think it is one of the main reasons why we have experienced such anemic job growth in this country in recent years because of the hesitancy of so many businesses especially small businesses to hire additional workers because of the associated rising health care costs
it is something that we must address in order to deal with an expanding economy at a rate that we would all like to see but also to get a grip on the stagnant wages right now that are holding so many of our workers back
i think there is a direct cause and effect whereas the typical worker s wages have been frozen in effect in recent years because of the additional costs coming out of their pockets to afford health care
that is why again we have had an important debate today but it is one we should be working on in a bipartisan fashion to address the underlying causes
and unfortunately the verdict is in and that verdict is this is just bad public policy
that is why so many of the governors and so many of the attorneys general and the commissioners of insurance the association of state legislatures in a bipartisan fashion have roundly criticized and condemned the underlying associated health plan because they feel as we do on this side that it will do more harm than good
the wheels are stuck in the mud and it is just spinning because it is not getting any traction
and that is because the senate in their analysis of the underlying bill has found that it too is bad public policy
perhaps there may be some deficiencies in what we are offering in our substitute just as we believe there are deficiencies in theirs
both the gao in a study and a recent georgetown university study that came out this summer indicated that the underlying ahp bill as it is written with the weak provisions that would go to the department of labor would lead to an explosion of fraud and abuse with these types of plans throughout the country
it is another reason why the underlying bill does not make sense why the federal preemption over state jurisdiction which has been the history of health care regulation in this country is another bad idea
mr speaker i rise today in opposition to hr 525 the small business health fairness act of 2005
the number of uninsured has risen in almost every year since 1989 and is expected to continue its rise in the near term
most people in the us who have health insurance obtain it through their employer or a family member s employer as a workplace benefit
i also understand the desire to offer benefits to employees to reward them for their efforts in making their business a success
small businesses are a vital part of our economy and it is critical that we provide them with affordable heath coverage that not only covers their employees but helps reduce the ranks of the uninsured in our nation
in fact the congressional budget office estimates that only 600 000 of the 45 million uninsured would receive coverage as a result of this bill
they would be free to choose healthier individuals who are cheaper to insure and leave behind those most in need of health care coverage
finally association health plans under this bill would be allowed to license themselves in a state with looser consumer protection provisions than the state they offer coverage in leaving consumers open to fraud and abuse
additionally it would commit federal funds to aid small businesses in offering health insurance to employees
i urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the kindandrews amendment which would provide real solutions to help our nation s small businesses and cover the 45 million uninsured americans
i want to say that i join her today in opposition to this rule and to the underlying bill
mr speaker if this bill were made law we would still have well over 44 million people in our country uninsured
something is fundamentally wrong where in the wealthiest nation in the world we have 44 million uninsured
where quite frankly is the morality in that
under this bill of the 45 million uninsured americans in this country only 600 000 people would move into coverage while 10 000 workers with coverage would be pushed off of their current plans
specifically the bill overrides contraceptive protections in 21 states that currently ensure access to contraceptives and treatments for sexually transmitted diseases
clearly mr speaker this bill puts women and girls at risk and makes empty promises to millions of uninsured americans in desperate need of health care
instead of considering this bill we should be debating the real question how do we begin to put people before profits in our own health care system
what this bill should do is assist small employers or employees in affording premium payments
i have heard from thousands of small employers in america who have been pleading for options to help them manage their surging health care costs
in march of this year i held a hearing on ahps
however in 1990 they had to stop offering ahps to members with under 100 employees because of the disparity of law from state to state
mr speaker i oppose this rule and the underlying bill because it will result in preempting state laws and in a reduction in health care
the gentlewoman from california ms woolsey xz4004360 and i offered an amendment to this legislation both in committee and again last night in the committee on rules
the amendment would have prohibited employers from joining ahps if it would mean a reduction in coverage for breast and cervical cancer services
members have to remember the attorneys general fought in their states to make sure that women would have this care
according to the american cancer society over 211 000 new cases of breast cancer will be diagnosed in the united states in this year alone
in new york state there will be 14 000 new cases of breast cancer diagnosed this year alone
over 10 000 new cases of cervical cancer will be diagnosed this year and nearly 1 000 of those cases are residing in my home state of new york
nearly 4 000 women will die in 2005 from cervical cancer
preserving the coverage of mammograms and cervical screenings will help save the lives of our wives mothers and daughters and also keep down the cost of health care in this country
i know many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle have supported similar measures while in their home states as legislators
since i have been here i have done outreach within my district to get women in for their cervical exams and women over 40 in to get their mammograms
the recommittal goes back to what the states have already done mainly because in the beginning the insurance companies would not give health care to women that needed to have a mammogram or to have a pap smear to make sure they do not have cervical cancer
children deserve a healthy start in life with regular visits to the doctor and necessary immunizations
last week they voted in the committee on education and the workforce to raise the cost of education to those students seeking a higher education by raising the cost of the loans that they will seek to finance that education
in this legislation what we see them doing is taking away vital health benefits that millions of americans currently have but will lose if this legislation is passed
do the members know what the price of gasoline is in california
do the members know how hard people have struggled in these states to have minimum health care benefits so that they can have a mammogram so they can have diabetes testing and now they are going to take that away
the theory is that congress should be trying to extend meaningful health care coverage to families and to making sure that they have benefits that in fact are there when they need them
this legislation overrides all of the hard work that was done in 40 or 45 states to make sure that people would have access to well baby care to make sure that they would have access to maternity benefits to make sure that they would have access to mammograms crucial services that families need
that is why they do not want the insurance commissioners involved because at some point the insurance commissioners would do what they have done in the past
the record is replete with that replete with that in state after state after state
the congressional budget office in its most recent report april of this year analyzed the legislation two other times and concluded that 8 12 million workers would end up in ahps under this bill and over 90 percent of them would come from existing health care plans where in all likelihood their benefits are better
later this week we ought to reject the energy bill and maybe we can do something to keep people in decent health care plans lower their energy costs and when the higher ed bill comes reject that and we can save them some money on a college education
everyone gets sick at some point in their lives and everyone will need access to a meaningful package of benefits
in fact they expect that 90 percent of the new enrollees will be people who come out of better plans who will lose that coverage that people have fought hard for in almost every state in this union to have those kinds of health care protections that our three colleagues just spoke about in support of this motion to recommit
mr speaker i rise in support of the small business health fairness act hr 525 which will allow small businesses and associations to band together to purchase health insurance coverage for their workers and their families
the small business health fairness act can directly benefit the over 2 300 small businesses and associations in my congressional district and their employees
in fact 65 percent of smallbusiness owners indicate high cost as the main reason why they do not offer health insurance
the small business health fairness act represents a first step in helping to lower the number of uninsured americans many of whom work for small businesses
yet unfortunately i believe that in this bill that has been undermined a little bit and my logic is fairly simple
as i read it in section 805 of the bill it allows an ahp to preempt statelevel patient protection laws that prevent cherrypicking against small businesses with sick employees
it is just if you have anybody sick you are in serious trouble because the premium is going to be so high you can not afford it
but in my opinion we somewhere along the way allowed this very good idea to be corrupted by a very bad provision a sort of fly in the buttermilk of health care reform in the form of section 805
yet in plain english it appears to me that section 805 allows an ahp to preempt those rating laws
this is the bottom line a small business owner in remission from cancer likely can not get health insurance for himself his family or his employees if he lives in a state that allows for rating based on health status
because all other employers with healthy employees will be in the ahps
if they can band together those 150 stores and pool their resources and have 500 employees in a pool they have a chance to keep their health care
in many cases the state regulations simply stifle the health care packages
republicans and democrats alike have joined together in each of the last two congresses to pass this legislation
this can manifest itself in three critical ways
we all know about insurance loopholes the fine print that says oh we will pay your claim unless you file a claim in which case we wo nt pay the claim
this kind of malarkey has been with us ever since insurance first came in the marketplace
do you know that in our states there was a company that tried to sell a policy that actually raised the premium whenever you went to see a doctor
there is not the kind of protection on this kind of terrible rating scheme in this plan
this business of capping solvency stands in stark contrast to any actuarial approach and shows that this is absolute danger for our consumers
mr speaker i rise in opposition to hr 525 the small business health fairness act but in strong support of meaningful measures to help small businesses offer affordable quality health care coverage to their employees
for many businesses in my congressional district and across the country the rising cost of health insurance is a growing crisis
currently many small businesses devote significant resources to offer health insurance to their employees money they could have otherwise invested in their businesses
however a recent urban institute survey states that the number would actually increase because some small employers in the stateregulated market would be forced to drop coverage when premiums increase as a result of the creation of association health plans ahps
in fact the congressional budget office estimates that ahp legislation would result in higher premiums for 80 percent of small employers and as many as 100 000 sick people would lose coverage because they would not be able to afford the increases
by grouping small companies in healthcare pools this bill would give small firms some of the same advantages large corporations have in trying to keep costs down
mr speaker i rise today in support of the kindandrews substitute and in strong opposition to hr 525 the small business health fairness act of 2005
we all agree that we need to allow small businesses to band together to achieve economies of scale in purchasing coverage
what the kindandrews substitute will not do is preempt state consumer protection laws laws that have been enacted by state legislatures on a bipartisan basis in response to reallife problems in the insurance market
in fact this illconceived bill would make the current situation worse adding to the ranks of the uninsured reducing benefits and leaving small business workers with insurance policies that do not provide the care that they and their families need
there are three fundamental problems with this bill all of which stem from the decision to preempt state laws and leave no other protections in their place
a mercer consultants study in 2003 found that it would actually increase the number of uninsured by 1 million
all 50 states and the district of columbia have passed tough laws to stop abuses in the small group health insurance market
ahp policy holders and health consumers would be left in a regulatory blackhole with no place to turn if they are defrauded cheated or denied benefits
in illinois we have enacted benefits that include mammograms pap tests minimum mastectomy stays colorectal screening diabetes education and supplies pre and postnatal care mental health parity that goes beyond inadequate federal requirements and access to cancer drugs
we have a prudent layperson rule to ensure access to emergency services direct access to obgyns and a ban on hmos gagging doctors in their communications with patients
many of us who previously served in state legislatures fought for those benefits because private insurance policies refused to cover items like mammograms maternity care diabetes education prosthetics or chemotherapy
we had constituents whose insurance companies refused to cover their babies arguing that conditions developed in the mother s womb were preexisting dropping those critical benefits will not make health care more affordable it will simply shift costs to employees and their families
i also want to point out that women have a tremendous stake in this debate
mr speaker i rise in support of hr 525 the small business health fairness act
purchasing alliances have been a popular response in many states to the problems many selfemployed and small business owners have had securing affordable health insurance for themselves or their employees
because small businesses are extremely costsensitive studies indicate that even a 5 percent reduction in costs will result in a 10 to 15percent increase in small businesses offering health insurance
unless a selfinsured plan is in existence before the date of enactment it would be required to offer membership to a broad crosssection of trades or to employers representing at least one higherrisk occupation
the bottom line is this legislation will help small businesses which are the engine in our economy provide health insurance to their employees
mr speaker i rise today in strong opposition to hr 525 the regurgitated association health plan ahp bill
this is the fourth vote on this exact same legislation in as many years
although proponents claim that ahps would give small employers bargaining power to purchase affordable health insurance most states already have laws in place that allow for group purchasing arrangements
in fact this bill would override key state laws and regulations that protect millions of americans
in my state of california employees who join ahps could well lose access to these services as well as certain emergency services direct access to obgyns mental health parity and other important benefits
moreover this law would allow health plans to gag doctors the currently illegal practice of health insurers preventing doctors from discussing treatment options that the plan does not cover even if some of those options are in the patient s best medical interest
ahps are likely to create new fraud and abuse problems in health care as well
these plans are very similar to multiple employer welfare plans mewas that congress created in the 1970s
the department of labor found that many of these plans were frauds and left their enrollees holding the bag for more than 123 million in unpaid health expenses
in fact the respected 2003 mercer consultant study that was done for the national small business association found that the number of uninsured will increase by 1 million as increased nonassociated market costs force small employers to drop coverage
in fact the 2003 mercer study found that premiums would increase by 23 percent for those outside the ahp market
it also found that there would be an increase in the number of uninsured workers in small firms an increase of 1 million people as a result of this plan being implemented
in fact that is how you get cheaper insurance
almost every member of this house voted for the federal patient bill of rights that would have recognized these state protections that are in place for insurance programs yet this bill would take those out carte blanche
as a person in small business for over 22 years and having represented a lot of small businesses i can tell you from personal experience that small business employers do not want inferior coverage for their employees
in fact mr speaker i can tell you that ahps really already exist
women in small businesses deserve to go to gynecologists without referral from another doctor
i understand that we have 50 states and in those 50 states many of them have different mandates for what has to be covered and what does not have to be covered and there is some sense when you are talking about organizations operating across state lines that you would streamline that effort
we said let us look at six patients rights that have been agreed to on a bipartisan basis by this congress in previous legislation and which are overwhelmingly agreed to in our states and let us say with respect to those six rights you ca nt take that right away from one of our constituents one of our patients one of our consumers if you are an associated health plan
we did not even get to hear it or vote on it in this house
if you pass this legislation and if you are in an ahp you are not going to get it
you do not have to wait in line before you take your child to see the pediatrician
use of drug formularies access to hospital emergency room treatment 42 states have this requirement and making sure that we do not restrict the ability of our doctors to give us their opinions to make sure that those states where they say you can not have a gag rule where your physician can tell you the patient what he or she thinks is in your best medical interest they can not be punished by the insurance company for telling you the truth
mr speaker in every state and every district when we meet with small business owners their number one concern is rising health care costs
these are statistics that are so often stated in this town that we forget what the real impact is
we have a modest solution before us today that no one can claim will address all of the problems but it can provide some help in a market that needs it
in fact the requirements for association health plans are even more strict
will association health plans cure all of the problems when it comes to health insurance in the small group market
but will it bring some elements of affordability and competition in these markets
i rise in strong support of this legislation
they can get better bargaining power in terms of costs and benefits for their employees
it is generally reported that there are over 40 million people in america without health insurance at any given time
those who work for small businesses should have the same type of access to health insurance that their counterparts in large corporations already enjoy
in fact this bill allows insurance companies to preempt state law making possible a race to the bottom by associated health plans as companies because of this bill can offer the cheapest insurance with the least coverage
that is why i offered an amendment in the committee on rules along with the gentlewoman from new york mrs mccarthy xz4002570 that would protect mammograms and cervical cancer screenings from being preempted by association health plans
unfortunately the republican majority does not see the value in protecting women from breast andor cervical cancer because they would not allow our amendment to come to the floor to be debated before we voted on this bill
mr speaker in my district the sixth congressional district of california the women of marin county are plagued by an unusually high rate of breast cancer and particularly young woman have the high incidence of breast cancers
but fortunately in california we require insurance companies to cover mammograms
i can not accept the idea of even one woman in this nation foregoing an annual mammogram or a pap smear only to be diagnosed later with advanced breast or cervical cancer because an association health plan does not provide coverage
no one knows this better than my constituents in marin county california who suffer from the highest rates of breast cancer in the country
they deserve more protections from this deadly disease not a rollback in coverage of the most basic screening tool we have mammograms
i urge each of my colleagues support the women in your lives
mr speaker i rise in strong support of hr 525 the small business health fairness act designed to allow small businesses to create large insurance pools in order to give them market power which will allow them to purchase quality health insurance at affordable prices through association health plans
in truth our biggest bipartisan failure in this congress has been our inability to help 45 million now pushing 50 million americans who do not have health insurance
sixty percent of these people work in small businesses or are selfemployed
ahps are not a panacea but they are a step in the right direction
that is not true due to the antidiscrimination language in the bill
this misanalysis reflects some of the backward thinking in our health care system that people would put mandated benefits ahead of prevention
in fact the american diabetes association cited a recently completed study on diabetes prevention that conclusively showed that people with prediabetes can prevent the development of type 2 or fullblown diabetes by making changes in their diet and increasing their level of physical activity
however they might be able to afford a more modest vehicle that would get them to their doctor s office where they could at least get a diagnosis advice and recommendations in order to improve their quality of life
let us quit talking about health insurance and actually deliver it to the american people who work in small businesses and who are selfemployed because they really need it
when i go home and especially as a physician in congress when i go home and talk to small businesses they say whatever you do whatever you do do something about my health care costs
either they are selfemployed or they work for small businesses so they have to purchase health insurance in the individual market
six people can buy insurance for cheaper than one person 60 cheaper than 6 600 cheaper than 60 and 6 million cheaper than 600 and it can be quality insurance and hr 525 is a step in the right direction
who do you think will be making the decisions about the kinds of provisions that will be in that insurance policy
it is patients in the associations and they are much closer i would argue to the individuals making decisions about what is going to be included under those plans than human resources officers in large companies
hr 525 is a step in the right direction
twentysix percent of all adults in louisiana lack health insurance and 226 percent of all working adults in louisiana lack insurance
mr speaker first of all i have respect for our insurance commissioners but i want to say that three out of the last four in louisiana went to jail
the preemption language in the bill only grants two limited exceptions from state laws that regulate insurance
no further change in the legislation is necessary
and i find it odd that there is no mention of what its cost is going to be to the federal government in putting forth these subsidies
what we need to do is foster competition in health care and right now 45 percent of all of the health care dollars are within governmental systems medicare and medicaid and so forth
the other 55 percent is in the insurance market and there is no competition
there is no competition in this arena
and so i urge colleagues on both sides of the aisle to not support this amendment and to vote for hr 525 which offers a good starting point to creating competition in the health care market
mr speaker i would like to engage the gentleman from wisconsin mr kind xz4002180 in a colloquy
we should assist in their growth and improvement in whatever ways we can
as republicans we are working to increase the number of insured americans since as many as one in seven americans is uninsured
moreover the most recent us census statistics show that increases in the number of uninsured employees comes solely from declining coverage in the small business sector
the small business health fairness act is a strong step in the right direction and i am pleased to have passed it
mr speaker i rise today to address the issue of health care insurance in america its rising costs and a solution that will help to reduce the cost for many americans
our nation is in the midst of a health care crisis
this crisis is especially acute in my district in southeastern pennsylvania
last week i held a small business committee forum in my district
pennsylvania s health care problems are among the worst in the nation
doctors in pennsylvania are faced with some of the highest medical malpractice insurance rates in the country
over 50 percent of pennsylvanians say their family has had difficulty in paying the cost of health care or obtaining health insurance coverage
since 2001 the cost of health insurance has risen 59 percent and employers who offer health care benefits are paying an average of 11 percent more for health insurance premiums than they did in 2004
this is the fourth year in a row of double digit increases with no end in sight
for a nation of the 21st century and in a country that boasts the world s largest and most productive economy this is simply unacceptable
and this study confirms even a small cost savings can result in large increases in purchasing power for all of our small businesses
mr speaker today i rise in opposition to this rule and the underlying measure of hr 525
this country leads in medicine and technology
women are now going in for annual mammograms
in and of itself mammograms do not prevent breast cancer but they can save lives by finding breast cancer as early as possible
for example mammograms have been shown to lower the chance of dying from breast cancer by 35 percent in women over the age of 50
today we are increasingly catching and treating breast cancer in the early stages yet the legislation we are debating here on the floor today would effectively roll back these advances and even worse doctors would now have to tell the 28yearold woman who thinks she has found a lump in her breast that her health care insurance does not cover a mammogram to better see the abnormality that her health care coverage is no longer subject to minimum standards established by her state because she is covered by an associated health plan an ahp which is located in a different state with far more relaxed laws on health care coverage
some may claim that these standards for health care treatments like those that require insurance companies to cover mammograms are nothing but burdensome regulations but these safeguards go to the heart of what responsible health care is all about providing necessary care to those in need
as a direct result 80 percent of small businesses would see an increase in their health care premiums
we are putting our small businesses in the awkward position of not being able to offer health care coverage to that young woman facing the possibility of breast cancer or offering access to a health care plan that will not cover her diagnosis and certainly not a treatment
we can support the democratic alternative and pass legislation that actually addresses the critical health care problems facing small business owners or we can pass the legislation in front of us that does the opposite
mr speaker i yield myself such time as i may consume to comment that only 1 out of every 14 people enrolled in an ahp will be newly insured
it is the story of a husband and wife living in southern california
doug and dana rapidly found themselves buried under hundreds of thousands of dollars in bills
it raises premiums on 80 percent of small businesses will increase the number of uninsured by 1 million people and reduce coverage for another 7 million individuals who are most in need of care
madam speaker i rise today in support of the wind cave national park boundary revision act of 2005
wind cave national park is one of our nation s oldest national parks and one of the jewels in our national park system
established over 100 years ago wind cave was the first cave in the world to be set aside as a national park
this makes it the fifth largest cave in the world
home to native wildlife such as bison elk pronghorn mule deer coyotes and prairie dogs the park is one of the few remaining mixedgrass ecosystems in the country
the bill s passage in the senate and its consideration here today are the fruits of those discussions
in addition to receiving support in the house of representatives from my two predecessors and myself this bill enjoys the bipartisan backing of the south dakota senate delegation and south dakota governor mike rounds
as the expansion project has proceeded interested parties have weighed in with their concerns and they have been answered
it is my hope that my colleagues will support the expansion of this park and vote in favor of this important legislation
a total of 26 million reports were filed in 2002
in approximately twothirds of these cases there is sufficient evidence to prompt an assessment
mr chairman the underlying bill that we are dealing with today is about safety and protection and so is the conyers amendment which is why i rise in strong support of it
the legal protections are essential to our system of ordered justice but on a symbolic basis it is important that congress enunciate clearly that hatemotivated violence based on gendersexual orientation or disability is wrong because quite frankly too much of what we do in this chamber conveys the message that we really do not believe in equality for all and that is sort of like a wink and a nod that a little discrimination is okay
a senior republican member of the other body said a few years ago a crime committed not just to harm an individual but out of motive of sending a message of hatred to an entire community is appropriately punished more harshly or in a different manner than other crimes hate crimes are different than other violent crimes because they seek to instill fear and terror throughout a whole community be it burning a cross in someone s yard the burning of a synagogue a rash of physical assaults in a gay community center
both in the 107th and 108th congresses the house of representatives voted in favor of motions to instruct conferees to retain the local law enforcement hate crimes prevention act as part of the department of defense authorization bill
unfortunately despite the support of a solid bipartisan majority in both this body and the other body the provisions were dropped in conference
just last year in separate instances two men in mississippi were brutally murdered based on their sexual orientation
the following week roderick george was shot in the forehead
authorities have concluded that antigay animus was a motivating factor in both cases
all americans regardless of their race gender disability or sexual orientation have a right to feel safe in their communities
gays and lesbians should not have to live in fear anywhere in the united states of america
as the person who represents the area that jessica lunsford grew up in and knowing her family very very well all of america was focused on jessica when she turned up missing
jessica is no longer with us and i commend the members of congress including yourself mr speaker with whom i have worked very closely and certainly the gentleman from wisconsin mr sensenbrenner xz4003650 the chairman of the committee on the judiciary in putting together the children s safety act
there were many loopholes in the various state laws in jessica s case
that is but one of the very excellent facets of this bill in addition to having the nationwide registration and availability on line so that parents so that grandparents so that anyone can go and find out who the offenders are in their neighborhood so that every family member can have a modicum of safety in knowing who is nearby
additionally the bill also picks up on some language that i had in the jessica lunsford act and part of this bill is named after her that provides for more frequent contacts a mailing or random mailings to the sexual offenders so that they have to report
with all of the various facets of the bill many members who are concerned who have lost children to these offenders to these violators of our most innocent children every single member who put a bill in and those who signed on as cosponsors realize the importance of protecting our streets of protecting our families of protecting our children from these lowlifes who prey on our most innocent young children
i want to make sure that the rule is adopted so we can go on pass this bill send it over to the senate and hopefully they too will see the need the absolute imperative need that america has in demanding that this bill pass so that our children will be protected
child molesters prey on those that are most vulnerable in our society and we must stop them
thanks to mandatory minimum sentences almost 10 percent of all inmates in the federal and state prisons are serving life sentences an 83 percent increase since 1992
in two states new york and california 20 percent of the people in prison are serving life sentences
well a system that currently houses more than 2 million americans almost four times the number of individuals incarcerated in 1985 at a cost of 40 billion to run and operate
so in the end if we are truly serious about protecting our children from acts of sexual exploitation and violence we have got to turn to prevention
friedrich of the mayo clinic and mayo medical school from the board of directors association of the treatment of sexual abusers all these letters have poured in urging that we put more prevention into this measure rather than less
the director s duties would be to track state compliance with new registration requirements in the bill and report back to congress on their progress
the large number of sexually exploited children in this country is certainly an emergency
i think we have special offices in the department of justice concerning violence against women and cops on the beat programs and i think our children deserve no less
mr chairman while there are many different grant programs in the department of justice providing resources for initiatives fighting violent or sexual assault we have not found any that are directly and specifically at local law enforcement s ability to protect children from sexual predators
however it does nothing to prevent the abuse from happening in the first place nor does it help officers investigate and track down offenders after complaints
there are few needs as pressing as the importance of stopping the sexual abuse of children and i appreciate the fact that we are providing special grant programs for prescription drug abuse telemarketing fraud and now we can find a way to fund programs to protect the most vulnerable in our society our children
because currently we lack sufficient data to assist in determining how to address bias crime directed toward children
the fbi s annual hate crime statistics act report provides the best snapshot of the magnitude of the hate violence problem in america
this is an important omission as indicated by a special doj report on the subject in 2001
there have been sharp rises in incidents of fraud involving children s social security numbers which have been documented
however it is not too farfetched to think that the misappropriations of the personally identifiable information of a person who has not attained the age of 18 could be used in a way that could bring about many of the offenses set forth in this act
so the objective of the amendment crafted by the gentlewoman from texas is to protect our children at all costs and this amendment would do this by making it a crime to knowingly misappropriate the personal identification information of a minor in interstate or foreign commerce
mr chairman i thank the gentleman from virginia for his generosity in yielding to me
we have never had on the federal books in federal law a prohibition against killing someone because of their race
dubois and the naacp brought this up in the 1930s
i commend this to the careful attention of all of my colleagues in this 109th congress
mr chairman i rise today in strong support of hr 3132 the children s safety act of 2005
this children s safety act of 2005 does in fact close the gaps
it tightens the ability to track down where convicted sex offenders are living and to improve the ways we notify our neighborhoods and our school districts when convicted sex offenders choose to live in our community
i am pleased that the gentleman from florida s mr foley xz4001360 legislation and my legislation was effectively included in title i of the bill we are considering today
when watching the news for the past 2 years it is sickening to see of how many communities how many neighborhoods how many parents are terrorized because sex offenders are back in their neighborhoods
as a father i do not want to see a child of mine victimized in that way and i want to put myself in the shoes of those parents who had to experience this dreadful victimization
mr chairman i rise in support of hr 3132 the children s safety act
there are nearly 550 000 registered sex offenders here in the united states one for nearly every 200 children
a 2003 investigation found in california alone 33 000 registered sex offenders could not be accounted for
mr chairman when i worked in the white house we worked on passing megan s law
to utilize this new technology and to make our children safer i introduced hr 3407 the jessica lunsford and sarah lunde act with companion legislation in the senate with senator nelson
similar to programs already under way in some states the system would utilize electronic technology such as gps to track sexual predators upon their release from prison
there is no opt in or opt out
i am pleased that the gentleman from wisconsin mr sensenbrenner xz4003650 has included an electronic monitoring pilot program in the children s safety act
furthermore i am pleased that the chairman is also willing to address some of the other issues we discussed in the manager s amendment
i would also like to thank the gentleman from indiana mr burton xz4000550 for his help in securing our amendments
this bill the children s safety act is an important step toward ensuring their safety and using the technology that is available today in the marketplace to ensure our law enforcement community has all the tools that are necessary to protect our children
these are claims in which the federal court is asked to review alleged errors in death penalty cases in state court that were either procedurally defaulted in which the defendant failed to present the claim in state court or two that already have been reviewed by the state courts and have been determined to be harmless and that only relate to the prisoner s sentencing not the portion of the trial that determines guilt or innocence
under this amendment factintensive and timeconsuming harmless error sentencing claims will be reviewed again in federal court only if the state court erred in determining that the claim was subject to harmless review
an example of how this impacts victims of child abusers was raised at the house committee on the judiciary subcommittee on crime hearing by ms carol fornoff whose 13yearold daughter was raped and murdered in tempe arizona in 1984
the evidence of the guilt of the man convicted in killing her daughter was overwhelming
these are claims in which the federal court is asked to review alleged errors in death penalty cases in state court that were either 1 procedurally defaulted in which the defendant failed to present the claim in state court or 2 that already have been reviewed by state courts and have been determined to be harmless and 3 that only relate to the prisoner s sentencing not to the portion of the trial that determines guilt or innocence
under this amendment factintensive and timeconsuming harmlesserror sentencing claims will be reviewed again in federal court only if the state court erred in determining that the claim was subject to harmlessness review
an example of how this impacts victims of child abusers was raised at a house judiciary crime subcommittee hearing by mrs carol fornoff whose 13yearold daughter was raped and murdered in tempe arizona in 1984
the evidence of the guilt of the man convicted of killing her daughter is overwhelming yet today 21 years after christy ann fornoff was murdered the defendant still is litigating his habeas appeals in the federal courts
there needs to be some limit some end to the process in these cases
after 9 years under the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of 1996 or aedpa aydepa it is clear that the act did not eliminate or even reduce the problem of delay in the federal habeas process
as evidenced by testimony in the senate judiciary committee in my home state of arizona 63 capital cases have been filed and remain pending since the effective date of the aedpa aydepa
thirteen preaedpa aydepa cases remain pending in federal court five of those cases have been in federal court longer than 15 years the others range in time from 9 years to 14 years
let me be clear that fundamental sentencing errors and all guiltphase errors still would be subject to a second round of review in federal court under this amendment
also this amendment does not in any way limit the state courts review of state criminal convictions nor does it affect the us supreme court s review of either a defendant s direct appeals or statehabeas petitions
the amendment only limits the federal habeas review that begins in the lower federal courts after all state appeals and us supreme court certiorari review are completed
deference to state courts is appropriate in this context since these courts are closer to the trial and will have a better sense of what facts are likely to influence local juries
this section merely precludes a repeat of this process at the federal level for minor errors that are not related to guilt of the underlying offense and that already have had an opportunity for review in state courts
mr chairman as cochairman of the congressional missing and exploited children s caucus and an original author of the sex offender registration and notification measure included in this bill i rise in strong support of hr 3132 the children s safety act of 2005
all beautiful children carrying with them the hopes and dreams of every young child in this country
while katrina the hurricane and judge roberts are much in the headlines below the fold seems to be daily an occurrence of a violent act against our children
i have said repeatedly that in this country we track library books better than we do sex offenders
it is horrific that in this country we are experiencing these untold tragedies throughout our nation but we can do better and in this bill we will do better
i would like to thank bradley schreiber my legislative director who has worked so many hours in trying to perfect and work alongside staff to make this legislation possible ernie allen from the national center for missing and exploited children john walsh from america s most wanted who has led a crusade for well over 20 years since the death of his beautiful son adam in florida
sex offenders are the worst in our society
our states our 50 states many are border states whereby if they are in tallahassee florida it is very easy to go to valdosta georgia very easy to get a new job and a new occupation
and if we do not have a strict punishment on them they simply will continue to move about the country and prey on vulnerable children in other states
jessica lunsford was buried in a garbage bag by a known sex offender who failed to register
let us not cause any unnecessary paperwork for john couey while jessica lunsford is in a plastic garbage bag
we have to have a driver s license in the state in which we live
we have to have a license tag in the state in which we reside
they are told they must report in the new state
i said it before we track library books better than we do these criminals and it is time we balance the scale of justice in favor of our children
the minimum mandatory may tie the hands of judges but it will in fact tie the hands of the predator
i and many of the strongest proponents of hate crimes legislation are also among the strongest proponents of free expression in this house and i want to be very clear
a belief in free expression means the belief in the right of obnoxious people to say hateful things
this is not an effort to prevent people from engaging in racist or homophobic or sexist insults
i regard that to be a very unpleasant but fully constitutionally protected practice and there have been mistaken assertions in this
there was in fact a case in philadelphia which lent itself to the interpretation that unpleasant speech was being prosecuted
nothing in this law in any way this amendment that the gentleman from michigan who happens to be one of the greatest defenders of freedom of expression in the history of congress nothing in this amendment impinges in any way on anybody s right to say or write anything they want
what it says is that if you commit an act which is otherwise a crime because the predicate for this is that you have to commit a physical act which would be a crime against a person or property but generally against a person that it becomes an aggravating factor if it is demonstrated to be motivated and the courts have made it clear that you have to demonstrate this is an element of the crime in some way you must demonstrate that it was motivated by prejudice
well in fact of course our laws state and federal are replete with examples where the exact same act is treated more harshly depending on the motivation
other people in that vicinity in that area who share those characteristics are also put in fear
because as i understand it under federal law if one of us were to be walking out in the street with a private citizen and we were both assaulted the individual assaulting us has committed a greater crime than the individual assaulting a private citizen
that is we have one category of hate crimes in that it is a more serious crime to assault a member of congress
now by the way it is obviously not in any way constitutionally inappropriate to denounce members of congress
we are dealing with a law which in no way impinges on anyone s freedom of expression and says that when individuals are physically harmed in part because of who they are that others who share that characteristic are also put in fear and that is a way to try to diminish that form of activity
we tried in the 1930s to pass laws which were federal hate crimes
the lynch laws were laws that said murder is murder but where people are murdered for racial reasons in parts of the country where the individuals may not be protected where law enforcement might be complicit that is a federal law
but the fact is that the principle of federal intervention to protect individuals against crimes of violence that are ordinarily state crimes in those cases where there is a pattern of nonenforcement which is a predicate again for activity in this bill goes back to antilynch laws and i think many of us regret that those laws have not been passed
i originally sought to offer an amendment to this important bill that would have required states to ensure that sex offenders are properly registered before they are issued a driver s license and in doing so mandate that their license would have to be renewed every single year
in short if a sex offender refuses to keep their registration current which is now a problem facing too many states then he would be unable to obtain a legal driver s license
i think that this threat can serve as a useful deterrent and encourage sex offenders to maintain their registration in fact improving the registration compliance rate of these offenders
in a state where over 30 percent of sex offenders are noncompliant and lost in the system we took these very same steps in nevada to ensure a greater compliance rate
i am proud that nevada is a leader in this nation in having modern efficient computer systems that will allow it to implement this licensing procedure
in consideration of these concerns my amendment today will require the gao to study the feasibility and costs of this driver s license requirement
this study will also seek the opinions and expertise of federal and state law enforcement to ensure that this additional reform of our sex offender laws assists them in protecting our children
finally my amendment calls on the gao to study the effectiveness of nevada s state law so that congress and this nation can learn from my state how this system might work on a national level and how we can do a better job in monitoring sex offenders
however i understand the importance of ensuring appropriate resources are provided and will work with mr sensenbrenner to study this issue so we can move forward in implementing these regulations to protect our children and prevent these horrible crimes
mr chairman i rise today in strong support of hr 3132 the children s safety act of 2005
in order to effectively protect our loved ones we must provide the american public with unfettered access to know who these dangerous criminals are and where they are living
additionally this bill strengthens the criminal code for sexually violent crimes and creates more stringent regulations which convicted offenders must adhere to in order to ensure proper monitoring
mr chairman today we must come together to make certain that our children grow up in a safe and secure environment and that parents are unafraid to let their children play in the neighborhood because they have the information they need to protect them
i urge all of my colleagues to cast their vote in support of this legislation and collectively answer the american public s call to provide them with additional resources to combat these predators before another life is lost and tragedy befalls another family
this rule provides that the amendment in the nature of a substitute recommended by the committee on the judiciary now printed in the bill shall be considered as an original bill for the purpose of amendment
it makes in order only those amendments to the bill that are preprinted in the lt em gt lt em gt congressional record or are pro forma amendments for the purpose of debate provides that each amendment printed in the lt em gt lt em gt congressional record may be offered only by the member who caused it to be printed or a designee and that each amendment shall be considered as read
for too long the laws have not fully reflected or reacted to the changing environment in which our children are vulnerable
additionally the bill requires a 20year minimum sentence when the crime of violence results in a nonserious bodily injury to a child
fifteenyearstolife imprisonment is required when the defendant uses a dangerous weapon and in any other case the minimum penalty ranges from a mandatory 10 years to life imprisonment
additionally mr speaker this bill would increase the existing mandatory penalties for several existing sexual offenses including engaging in a sexual act with a child committing abusive sexual contact and sexual exploitation of a child trafficking child pornography and the use of the internet to prey on children
the trafficking of children is a problem not just here in the united states but globally and this bill will increase the penalties for sex trafficking of children
sexual abuse of children must be stopped at all levels and in all degrees
in conclusion mr speaker i want to encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to unite behind this commonsense legislation
mr speaker i yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman from florida ms ginny brownwaite who has been extremely active in the crafting of this legislation
her bill which she will talk about is actually included in this overall comprehensive bill
and she knows well if not better than all of us about these matters because some of these heinous acts occurred within the last year in her great state of florida
mr speaker i yield myself such time as i may consume and in closing i would like to begin by saying that there are very few matters in our society that are as clearcut as this one
as i noted in my opening statement this is commonsense comprehensive legislation that attacks the problem in many different ways from expanding the definition of sex offenders to strengthening law enforcement s tools to increasing mandatory minimums for child abusers and kidnappers
mr chairman i rise today to speak in support of the children s safety act of 2005
this legislation if passed will close the loopholes in the current system that allow sexual predators to evade law enforcement
provisions incorporated from my bill will increase the criminal penalties and establish mandatory minimums for those that harm our children whether it is over the internet or in person
strong laws that hold the criminal accountable are a vital component in the effort to protect children
strong sentencing is an essential component in any effort to fight crimes against children
this legislation contains many vital provisions in protecting our children from these violent predators
mr chairman when i came to this house i hoped that i would have the chance to make a difference in the area of crimes against kids and thanks to the leadership of the gentleman from wisconsin mr sensenbrenner xz4003650 i have had this opportunity
in fact we have all had this opportunity
we have made great strides in recent years the amber alert system two strikes and you are out for child molesters the debbie smith act which we passed last session which will make sure that our dna databases are up to date and more usable and we will have better training and education for those health care professionals and law enforcement professionals who work in this field
but sadly we have been reminded in recent months that despite all the work that we have done we have a long way to go
the children s safety act is in my view a great stride towards doing what we can and what we must to protect our kids from those who would prey upon them
i would like to speak briefly about one of those loopholes that people in my home state of wisconsin have learned about tragically
the situation the case the story of amie zyla which has led to the amie zyla provisions in this bill
the case of miss zyla she was a young girl in the county of waukesha wisconsin when she was assaulted brutally by a young offender
in fact amie zyla was not notified of the release of this man until she saw him on tv actually saw him on the news and there was his face and she realized for the first time that the man who had done so much damage to her was back out on the street right where she was
now mr chairman a lot of numbers have already been tossed around and will be tossed around in the coming debate
but i want to suggest to you that this is not about the numbers and that people will toss around the numbers but we can not tell if those numbers are accurate because we know that these crimes are the most underreported crimes in society
my guess is and most experts will tell you that the damage that is done the number of crimes is far in excess of any of the studies that are out there
there is so much we have accomplished in the last few years
according to a survey conducted by the us department of justice one in five children 10 to 17 years old are recipients of unwanted sexual solicitations online
one of every seven victims of sexual assault is under the age of 6 one in five girls will be sexually exploited before they reach adulthood
and one in 10 boys will become victims before they become men
according to the national center for missing and exploited children the whereabouts of 100 00 to 150 000 of some 500 000 sexual offenders currently registered in the united states are unknown
i fully support the measures included in the child safety act
if there is a child abuser in california who has been proven through the courts to have a history of child abuse that history is on record in the state of california
but should that abuser decide to move to my state of arizona there is no documented history of his record of abuse in california that exists in arizona
currently there is no national child abuse registry to show that this is a child abuser no easy way therefore for localities to know this is a child abuser who is unfit to have children in their care
nothing is in place nationally that provides one state a direct way to report to other states that someone has an established history of child abuse making the job for our local and state child advocacy services much more difficult
children are being placed in danger when child abuse offenders move to a state where their history is unknown
this national registry would be a commonsense and a necessary step in the fight against child abuse
local authorities need a more certain way to uncover an individual s history of child abuse in another state and this amendment will allow the attorney general and the secretary of hhs to work together to create this database that can be updated by data from the several states and utilized by states to keep children safe
mr chairman i rise today to oppose the socalled child safety act hr 3132 because it forsakes meaningful crime reduction in favor of ineffective solutions that will only create a false illusion that our children are better protected from sexual abuse
unfortunately this bill will do more harm than good and in the balance will do precious little to make our children safer
we need a real system that gives parents peace of mind and enables them to be aware of the presence of pedophiles in their neighborhood
i would be proud to support it and i hope it will be addressed on the floor in a more rational way
they discount mitigating factors in crimes prevent judges from meting out punishments that are tailored to the criminal and have been proven discriminatory to people of color
instead of turning themselves in they will go under the radar and into unsuspecting communities
but killing citizens in order to exact retribution is inappropriate for a government that seeks to be moral
mr chairman i just wanted to put in the record why if you are kind enough to accept this this is so very important
as i spoke to the evacuees what they said to me was that in the superdome there were outright examples of rape and abuse of children
they may not have been the family members but in that instance if the family members are lost an expedited foster care and an expedited adoption would be relevant
if in this instance of this law we can expedite those background checks and have this language in this bill i certainly know that it would help the thousands of children that may be impacted
but if this language is placed in this bill at least they will have a placeholder that their cases will be expedited so that their lives can be put back in place and so that sex offenders will not be the ones to be adopting andor have foster care of these vulnerable children
my amendment would set forth a sense of congress that background checks conducted as a precondition to approval of any foster or adoptive placement of children affected by a natural disaster or terrorist attack should be expedited in order to ensure that such children do not become subjected to the offenses enumerated in this act
while family members often step in to take care of children who have lost their natural parents these family members usually only have limited resources and as a result the child as we all watched the devastating stories of hurricane katrina unfold it was very disturbing to me to learn that several minors were raped while waiting to be rescued from the new orleans superdome
as natural disasters seem to be more prevalent in our society we must begin to think about how we care for those children who lose their natural parents
in closing just like most other states louisiana has an open and searchable sex offender registry
the primary party responsible in most communities for checking up on the status of sex offenders who have served their sentences but must register is the local police
in addition as the citizens of new orleans and other states wait for assistance in cities around the country sex offenders are among innocent children who have lost their natural parents and are vulnerable
in these troubled times let us not leave our children helpless
i have a feeling i could be accused of a kind of insensitivity or at worst a sort of obsessiveness by bringing this up now but after reading about some of the terrible things that have been said to have happened in new orleans after the destruction wrought by hurricane katrina on august 29 2005 this idea occurred to me in a kind of lightbulb moment
so does a disaster on the scale of what we have seen in louisiana and southern mississippi
just as invading soldiers from various countries in the past have made sexual assault a part of their subjugating of a native population so the criminals loose on the streets in new orleans and even inside the superdome have made sexual assault another part of their overall orgy of violence
in the entry i wrote earlier today i wrote briefly of the horrific story coming out of the superdome of the rape and murder of a little girl followed by the beating death at the hands of 10 men of the perpetrator
i began thinking about how many people must be unaccounted for in new orleans and the surrounding region devastated by the storm
of the survivors who have made it this long and perhaps been able to get to refuge in other states whatever procedures officials who run shelters in these states have in place for registering who stays there must certainly take into account the fact that many people left their homes so quickly and under such duress that they may have only the clothes on their backs no identification money etc
louisiana has an open and searchable sex offender registry just like many other states across the us the primary party responsible in most communities for checking up on the status of sex offenders who have served their sentences but must register are the local police
just like everyone else the cops have lost family homes in a sense their lives
we can surmise that if the death toll from katrina in louisiana alone is as high as 10 000 as has been reported in the mainstream media a number of sex offenders will have succumbed to the storm and its aftermath
we can also guess that if the larger portion of the population of new orleans was able to leave before the storm or has now been taken to refugee centers in surrounding states a larger number of sex offenders are now not just out of the residence registered in the louisiana offender database but quite possibly off the grid completely and free to throw off what many of them surely must view as the shackles of having to register and have their faces placed on the internet next to a summary of whatever crimes they were convicted of committing
the most likely to use violence in the commission of their crimes and the most likely to reoffend
of those who survived there will be some who truly are trying to live the straight life and they will likely be dutiful in reporting their identities and true status as a registered sex offender
sharp rises in incidents of fraud involving children s social security numbers have been documented
however it is not too far fetched to think that the misappropriation of the personally identifiable information of a person who has not attained the age of 18 years could be used in a way that could bring about many of the offenses set forth in this act
my amendment would do just that by making it a crime to knowingly misappropriate the personal identification information of a minor in interstate or foreign commerce
some children never learn that fraudulent activity has taken place in their name until they are refused a driver s license because one has already been issued to their social security number
sadly the federal trade commission estimates that 9 percent of children in this situation learn that a member of their own family had actually perpetrated this fraud
instead their entry to adulthood is a setback with massive debt legal bills and an extraordinary battle just to get a fair chance in life
after being detained in a meeting on hurricane katrina i was grateful that my amendment was able to be offered by mr conyers the ranking member
the best way to protect young children is to keep child predators locked up in the first place because someone who has molested a child will do it again and again and again
in both cases the crimes were committed by convicted sex offenders who were out on probation
this law imposes a mandatory minimum punishment of 30 years for those who commit violent sexual crimes against children as well as a minimum punishment of life in prison or a death sentence when that crime results in the child s death
my amendment would strengthen this bill by adding an additional tool for our state and local child protection services and by eliminating the loophole in our local laws which allow child adjudicated abusers to find sanctuary by merely crossing a state s borders
this amendment is similar to legislation i have introduced in the house hr 764 which has strong bipartisan support
it is therefore vital for federal and local officials to work together to ensure necessary laws and resources to fight child abusers are in place at every level of the government
mr chairman i rise in defense of children
we must accept responsibility for the safety and welfare of foster children affected in this crisis
when katrina slammed into the gulf coast thousands of foster children were separated from foster families in shelters and they will fall through the social safety net unless we act
in drafting this legislation i worked closely with organizations like the national foster parent association and the child welfare league of america
these organizations are working directly with others on the ground in the affected region and they said what we needed to hear the federal government must become an immediate and reliable partner for states trying to cope with the human needs that are outstripping their individual ability to effectively respond
mr chairman i would like to quote from their letter many child welfare league of america member agencies are working in the disaster area to connect children with their families and to continue to provide services to those children in care they report to us directly about their struggles in attempting to meet the needs of children and families devastated by the disaster
it is clear that it will take a sustained effort on the part of volunteers and local state and federal governments to help these children and families quote and continuing to quote this legislation provides an assurance that the federal government stands as a partner with state and local governments to meet the needs of these children mr chairman there are no gotchas in this amendment
the legislation is bipartisan in spirit and humanitarian in fact
in many cases vulnerable children may not be receiving mental health treatment or family counseling
because hr 3711 cuts through the red tape and makes the federal government appropriately in a national crisis responsible for paying for urgently needed care
with one vote we can demonstrate our leadership in this time of national crisis
the image in their minds the insecurity in their hearts is real and overwhelming
across this country americans are responding to the crisis the only way they know how by stepping up with a big heart and an open wallet to help their fellow americans in need
we applaud your leadership in highlighting the needs of vulnerable foster children and families affected by hurricane katrina
many cwla member agencies are working in the disaster area to connect children with their families and to continue to provide services to those children in care
they report to us directly about their struggles in attempting to meet the needs of children and families devastated by this disaster
hr 3711 allows the kind of broad and flexible funding that will assist louisiana alabama and mississippi as well as help other states that are extending their hands in support of the relief efforts
count on cwla to work with you in any way possible to help the children and families affected by this disaster
under current law it is illegal to transfer or sell a gun to anyone convicted of a crime punishable by more than a year in jail
for some misdemeanor offenses that although punishable by less than a year in jail are of a particular serious nature we currently prohibit all transfers of guns or possession of guns by individuals convicted of such crimes
if congress is prepared in the underlying bill to require rigorous severe and intrusive registration for 20 years from persons convicted of a misdemeanor sex offense against a minor and is prepared to require states to verify this information four times a year then the offense is indeed of such a serious nature that a convicted sex offender against a child must not be allowed possession of a firearm
these are misdemeanor offenses but dangerous criminals convicted of committing a sexual crime against a child even when such offense carries a penalty of less than a year pose too great a danger to society if in possession of a firearm
mr chairman i rise in strong support of the hate crimes prevention amendment offered by the distinguished gentleman from michigan mr conyers xz4000800 the ranking member on the committee on the judiciary and i thank him for his strong leadership on this subject
this vehicle is one that gives congress the opportunity to go on record and hopefully in the majority to reject hate crimes in our country
hate crimes have no place in america
all americans have a fundamental right to feel safe in their communities
a year ago a majority of this house voted to support including hate crimes prevention legislation in the department of defense authorization bill on the heels of a strong vote in the senate
similarly the house acted in september of 2000
twice the republican leadership defied the will of the majority of the house and stripped these essential provisions out in conference
it violates this principle to have individuals in our country targeted for violence because of who they are the color of their skin how they worship and who they love
who can ever forget the brutal murders of james byrd in texas matthew shepard in wyoming waqar hasan in texas gwen araujo in california and so many others who have died because of ignorance and intolerance
mr chairman as we deal with the aftermath of hurricane katrina we must remember that we are one america a nation that must be united not just in common purpose but in common effort and common community
in the words of my good friend the gentleman from georgia mr lewis xz4002392 who i consider to be the conscience of this house we must strive towards our beloved community we must move our resources to build and not to tear down to reconcile and not to divide to love and not to hate let that be our call
i too hope those votes will be here today because we do have an historic opportunity to pass the underlying bill but more importantly in terms of this historical opportunity that is presented to us to pass this amendment as well
mr chairman i rise today in strong support of both the pence amendment and the child safety act of 2005
it will fix a glaring loophole in the current law by requiring pornographers to keep records of the names and ages of their subject proof of identification
this requirement we believe will deter the use of underage children in pornography
we also in this legislation extend federal jurisdiction to socalled home pornographers that use downloading on the internet and digital and polaroid photography to essentially create an athome cottage industry for child pornography
mr chairman i rise in strong support of the children s safety act of 2005
i commend the gentleman from wisconsin mr sensenbrenner xz4003650 for this legislation and appreciate very much the bipartisan way in which he has worked with me in developing this legislation and in listening to the concerns that i have brought from experiences in our region
she was an exceptional student a leader in our community
she was abducted from a shopping center parking lot in broad daylight on a saturday afternoon nearly 2 years ago
this type of disappearance never happens in our part of the country and it traumatized the whole community
thousands spent weeks trudging through snow banks in the worst weather we ever saw searching for dru
well 5 months later her dead body was found in a ravine just outside of crookston minnesota
he was living in minnesota
we did not know of his existence in north dakota
he was registered as a sex offender only in the state of minnesota
it provides the kind of information in terms of where these highrisk offenders are living where they are working going to school what kind of vehicle they are driving
people need this information to keep their children safe and that is why i am proud to be a cosponsor of this bill and pleased that the chairman has designated in the legislation this registry in memory of dru sjodin the dru sjodin national sex offender registry
it also has tough sanctions for those who would harm our children and finally federal dollars to assist local police departments in making certain that people are complying with their registry requirements
we send our children off to school every day and we trust that our teachers are the best and the safest and the best trained in the country
in the state of nevada we hire about 1 400 to 2 000 new teachers a year
mr chairman we all abhor the horrific cases of child murders or sex offenses committed by those who are referenced in the bill
but the question before us is whether what we are doing in the bill will actually reduce the incidence of child molestation or actually increase it
we should certainly seek to avoid enacting legislation that expends scarce resources in a manner that is not cost effective or that exacerbates the problem
in one actual case a teacher was reading the names of offenders to grade school students in an apparent effort to protect them when one student blurted out the question to another student is that not your father
this victimizes the victim twice and may well discourage offense reporting that is already considered very low in these situations
now we have taken a step in the right direction in the bill by encouraging those states and localities that are not already doing so to consider whether there are offenders who should be required to register but may not have to be put on the internet
because research has shown that intensive therapeutic sexual offender treatment cuts sexual offense recidivism in half
any recidivism rate is too high so i am pleased that we are working together to fashion a provision that will assure that all sex offenders in the federal system will receive appropriate effective treatment prior to their release and i hope that we can continue to work together to provide a similar system for state offenders where we could significantly reduce child victimization by assuring access to effective treatment for all
now there are provisions in this legislation that are not based on research or sound reasoning like the death penalty mandatory minimums both of which have been studied and shown not to have any effect on crime
we also have the anomaly in this because it is federal legislation that because indian reservations their sole access to courts is the federal system they will all be under the federal system but most others will not
now day by day we are seeing more and more evidence that the death penalty administration is fraught with mistake racial discrimination and it is applied in an arbitrary way
this bill includes a 5year mandatory minimum for any technical violation involved in registration
for example if you are already registered and you attend the local community college but forgot to recognize that the community college is in a different jurisdiction and you should have registered there too well that offense is subject to a 5year mandatory minimum
another provision that is in the bill that will not have much effect on reducing child molestation is eliminating the access to habeas corpus
there is a provision in the bill that says that felonious assaults against a juvenile which could be two juveniles having a fist fight in the school yard if it gets into a big fight that that is a 10year mandatory minimum if no injury occurs
now of course if an injury occurs in the fight then you are talking about 20 years
we have other ways of dealing with that in such a way that we can actually reduce that 33 as much as 50 percent
4 and 7 preprinted in the lt em gt lt em gt congressional record when we call up title iii
mr chairman i rise in opposition to the amendment and would just point out that this requirement for a driver s license just adds another little gotcha for which someone could be subjected to a 5year mandatory minimum and therefore would oppose the amendment
i join in support of the amendment
it is absurd that misdemeanants and other minor offenders who get a suspended sentence for a crime that was committed 15 years ago could get a 5year mandatory minimum sentence for a technical violation of a registration requirement such as showing up at 5 30 on the last day of registration when the office closed at 5 oclock or failing to register the fact that they are in a community college that has different sites
or if they work in construction if they register at the home office of the construction company do they also have to register at each location where they are doing construction
are our children going to be safer or less safe if an offender knows that he is in technical violation
if he shows up to register after he has been in technical violation he knows he is looking at a 5year mandatory minimum
mr chairman it is also absurd that an offender would be sentenced to a minimum 5 years for giving a technically false statement regarding this registration when under the same section of the law there is a maximum of 8 years no minimum sentence for either making a false statement in connection with international or domestic terrorism
again this amendment retains the 20year maximum for cases such as those cited by the chairman but it allows common sense in determining which offenders would get what sentence for what violations
in everyday experiences judges can see differences great and small in the facts and circumstances in the cases before them
so it makes sense to have a rational assessment by one who has heard and seen the evidence and facts and circumstances of the case making the appropriate decision within the guidelines set by the sentencing commission relating to the gradations in seriousness of the crime and the other characteristics
of course under the federal system the ones who will primarily be affected will be native americans because they try all their cases in federal courts and it is unfair to them and unfair to common sense where identical offenses can be committed one by a native american another a few miles away the same crime and vastly different sentences because the native american is stuck in federal court with the 5year mandatory minimum
these mandatory minimums violate common sense and so i am delighted to join the gentleman from south carolina in this amendment and hope our colleagues will support it
mr chairman are we in title iii
in addition section 302 includes mandatory minimums
if there is no injury in that situation that is a 10year mandatory minimum
but to have a mandatory minimum to apply in situations where no injury has occurred no dangerous weapon was involved 10 years mandatory minimum for teenagers having a fight this just does not make any sense at all
there are plenty of provisions throughout this bill and throughout the criminal code to deal with people who deserve this kind of time but to have a mandatory minimum in cases where no injury occurred is clearly excessive to be applied in all cases without discretion whether it makes any sense or not
mr chairman the language in the bill is bad enough
restricting access to habeas will result in more innocent people being put to death or languishing in jail for crimes they did not commit
this is just going to make it worse and more innocent people will be in jail
mr chairman in the recent case of free speech coalition v ashcroft the supreme court indicated that if the material is not obscene it can not be prohibited unless real children are involved
the supreme court indicated in the decision that the fact that this material may whet someone s appetite or the nature of the case caused problems for law enforcement those could not be the grounds for violating the constitution in having material that is not obscene being prohibited
the case whether you like it or not and bringing it up as a floor amendment means we can not try to conform the language to the supreme court decision so the only thing we can do is to vote against it if we believe in the constitution and if we read free speech coalition v ashcroft
mr chairman i rise in support of the amendment and i yield to the gentleman from michigan mr conyers xz4000800 the ranking member of the committee on the judiciary
i introduced this legislation on june 30 in a bipartisan effort to address the growing epidemic of violence against children and the need for greater protection from convicted sex offenders through state registration and notification programs
in june our nation was horrified by the kidnapping and murders of members of the groene family by a convicted sex offender
two wellpublicized tragedies earlier this year in florida in which 9yearold jessica lunsford and 13yearold sarah lunde were murdered by convicted sex offenders further underscore the need for quick congressional action to address the danger posed by individuals who prey on children
in addition to the widely reported tragedies that have rightly brought this issue to the forefront the statistics regarding the frequency with which such heinous crimes occur are staggering
statistics show that one in five girls and one in 10 boys are sexually exploited before they reach adulthood
according to the department of justice one in five children between the ages of 10 and 17 receive unwanted sexual solicitations online
in june of this year the subcommittee on crime terrorism and homeland security held a series of three hearings on child crimes issues focusing on violent crimes against children sexual exploitation of children and the sex offender registration and notification program and related legislative proposals
on july 30 the judiciary committee considered this bill and ordered it favorably reported by an overwhelming vote of 22 to 4 mr chairman there are over 550 000 sex offenders in the country and it is conservatively estimated that at least 100 000 of them are lost in the system meaning that nonregistered sex offenders are living in our communities and working at locations where they can and likely will come into contact with our children
the bill authorizes united states marshals to apprehend sex offenders who fail to register and increases grants to states to apprehend sex offenders who are in violation of registration requirements contained in the legislation
the courage of some such as the father of jessica lunsford to speak out on this important issue in the face of unmistakable grief is truly admirable
mr chairman the time to protect our nation s children from sexual predators in our communities and online on the internet is now
first the amendment includes a requirement that the bureau of prisons provide adequate treatment programs for sex offenders in all six of the regions and that they have adequate access to treatment in both residential and nonresidential programs
the amendment incorporates the proposal by the gentleman from california mr gallegly xz4001440 which will further assist states in hiring more prosecutors and investigators for cases solved by dna evidence
third the amendment includes proposals contained in hr 3687 offered by the gentleman from minnesota mr gutknecht xz4001640 the gentleman from massachusetts mr delahunt xz4001020 and the gentleman from texas mr poe xz4006520 and specifically authorizes technical assistance grants to improve the quality of criminal investigation and prosecution of child abuse cases
mr chairman i urge my colleagues to support this amendment in the bill
criminal records and sex offender information are in many cases not available to law enforcement or the community to track these offenders as they move to new areas
it has been reported by the texas department of justice for example that the state is experiencing significant increases in violent crime
there are 1 350 sex offenders unaccounted for in houston alone after being evacuated from louisiana
the parole department in louisiana has no idea where these people are and can provide no identifying information fingerprints or photos
reports also indicate that crimes against children in texas shelters are rising
these states are in desperate need of federal assistance
my amendment does just that by directing the justice department to provide technical assistance to help law enforcement in these areas and to identify sex offenders who have been relocated
it might need a little finetuning regarding the structure of the office but we can do that in conference
mr chairman i rise in opposition to the amendment
mr chairman this amendment deletes the 5year mandatory minimum sentence for a sex offender who crosses state lines to fail to register in the new state and also deletes the 5year mandatory minimum for making false statements in a sexual abuse investigation
so if this amendment is adopted judges will be given the power to place on probation those who were convicted of not registering in a new state or making a false statement to law enforcement relative to a sexual abuse investigation
i do not think that probation is advisable in these instances and that is why this amendment should be defeated
the most significant enforcement issue that exists today in the sex offender program is that over 100 000 sex offenders or nearly onefifth in the nation are missing meaning they have not complied with the sex offender registration requirements
in order to address the problem of the missing sex offenders that is those who fail to comply with moving from one state to another sex offenders will now face federal prosecution with a mandatory minimum of 5 years
the combination of incentives for the sex offender to comply and stiff criminal penalties and additional law enforcement resources to focus on this problem should help address the overwhelming number of noncomplying or missing sex offenders in our community
the 5year mandatory minimum penalty is a critical component of this new enforcement scheme and this amendment punches a hole in that enforcement scheme and allows a loophole to have the current situation continue to fester
never again should our communities have to suffer from the fear of unidentified sex offenders in their communities their schools and their youth organizations
the facts surrounding the jessica lunsford case in florida demonstrate that time is of the essence and false statements can make the difference between life and death of a missing child
in the lunsford case three witnesses knew that john couey the alleged rapist and murderer of 9yearold jessica lunsford was living within 150 yards of jessica s house but failed to tell investigators
a 5year mandatory minimum penalty would ensure truthful and full cooperation by witnesses in such investigations
mr chairman i rise in opposition to the amendments
i believe in this case he is wrong
first of all we do need to have a swift and effective death penalty in the case of violent offenders who murder children
secondly we have talked quite a bit about mandatory minimum penalties in the context of the previous amendment that was offered by the gentleman from south carolina mr inglis xz4006490
let me say that if all mandatory minimum penalties contained in this bill for sexual abuse and exploitation of children are eliminated it does allow judges to send out into society on probation people who have been convicted of sex offenses for or against children
i kind of listened with interest and with respect to the argument of the gentleman from south carolina mr inglis xz4006490 on mandatory minimums in the previously debated amendment
impeachment is a severe penalty and if you look at the 17 impeachments that the house of representatives has voted on in its history the only time where there has been an impeachment voted is when a federal civilian official ends up conducting himself or herself in a manner that obstructs the functioning of government whether it is the branch that that official serves in or the other two equal and separate branches
i am saying that in this case the discretion of the court should be eliminated and those who are convicted should go to jail and that is why the mandatory minimums ought to stay in this bill
eliminating these statutes for these crimes reflects the increased use of the success of dna in solving decadeold crimes
i would note that this same provision was passed by the house in the 108th congress as a part of the child abduction prevention act by the overwhelming vote of 410 to 4 it was modified in conference with the senate as a part of the protect act
the second provision in this amendment raises the class on the existing misdemeanor for failure to report child abuse thereby raising the maximum penalty for such an offense from 6 months imprisonment to a year imprisonment
i would point out that this is nearly identical to hr 3088 which passed the house 380 to 19 in october of 2000
i would just point out that it has been carefully drafted to ensure compliance with the supreme court decisions approving of such laws in kansas v hendrick 1997 and kansas v crane in 2002
mr chairman i rise in strong opposition to the amendment
statistics on hate crimes prosecution should be fully considered in a very thoughtful way including testimony that scholars have presented that says that hate crimes legislation actually increases those types of crimes rather than decreases them
in recent months we have heard all too often about the innocent lives of children being shattered by an adult who sexually abuses the child
the bill requires a sex offender to appear in person at least once every 6 months to verify their registration information
the bill sets other mandatory minimum sentences for crimes of violence against children like murder kidnapping maiming aggravated sexual abuse sexual abuse or where the crime results in serious bodily injury
the statistics surrounding child sexual abuse are astonishing 1 in 5 girls and 1 in 10 boys are sexually exploited before they reach adulthood
mr chairman i rise in opposition to hr 3132 the children s safety act of 2005
many child advocates themselves oppose this bill because kids in grade school or junior high will be swept up alongside paroled adults in sex offender registries
many caught in registries would be 13 and 14 year olds
in some states children 10 and under would be registered
they destroy honesty in sentencing by encouraging plea bargains they treat dissimilar offenders in a similar manner even though there are vast differences in the seriousness of their conduct and their danger to society
judges serve a very important role in criminal justice and congress should not attempt to do their job for them
nobody especially the parents and victims of sexual abuse who have contacted me on this issue should confuse my objections to this bad policy with indifference to the problem of child sex abuse in this country
i support establishing treatment programs for sex offenders in prison background checks for foster parents funding for computer systems to track sex crimes involving the internet and at last resort procedures for committing sexually dangerous persons to secure treatment facilities
i hope that working with the senate we can improve this legislation and implement the policies that everyone agrees are needed without the unintended consequences of the bill in its current form
mr chairman i rise today to speak in support of the children s safety act
convicted predators should be put in prison where they belong and kept away from our nation s children
people have a right to know where sex offenders live and it is important for parents to have access to a national registry in order to make sure their children are safe
in addition to punishing sexual offenders and protecting our children we must also provide services resources and counseling to the people who are victims of these horrible crimes
i want to thank the gentleman from wisconsin mr sensenbrenner xz4003650 and his staff for this support in working with my office on this provision
mr speaker sexual predators lurk in the shadows of our neighborhoods and prey on those who are innocent and defenseless
mr chairman i rise in support of the bill but hopeful that we can make it even a little bit better
there is however this issue of mandatory minimums in the bill
in fact it is quite often the case that you send your possessions on ahead in a moving van and the question is when did you move from california to ohio was it when the moving van got there or was it when you took the first flight from california to ohio but then you returned to california to get the rest of your possessions and drove back
i think the mandatory minimum in this case is particularly inappropriate
in fact mr chairman it is a 5year mandatory minimum
so the hypothetical i just posed of somebody moving from california to ohio the moving truck is there they fly out twice to ohio and finally they are moved if they do not register in a timely fashion and it is a very brief time they have to register then what happens is they must go off to jail for 5 years
of course that requires some trust in the judges but i am thinking we can do that
at least in south carolina we have good judges judges who make decisions that seem to be consistent with the spirit of this law
if jurisdictions have judges who do not do that perhaps there should be some pressure brought to bear on these judges and in fact impeachments if those judges consistently violate the sentencing guidelines
it strikes the mandatory minimum in the case of failing to register
we in strong action here are requiring exactly the person he just described to register and we say to them they must register within the prescribed period
the question is whether we can trust the sentencing guidelines and the sentencing commission and federal judges to come up with a system to figure out whether that person that the gentleman is describing flagrantly violating it should go off for 20 years as opposed to the hypothetical that i posed as somebody in confusion about when exactly they moved let us say from california to florida as to whether that case deserves a mandatory minimum of 5 years
because what we are doing here if this amendment fails is tying the hands of that judge in ohio such that he must or she must send the person off for 5 years if there was confusion about when and how they moved to the state of ohio
there is one thing that a predator wants more than anything else and that is to remain anonymous to sneak in and out of our communities and commit their criminal ways
from the countless phone calls letters and emails pleading to protect our kids from sex predators we know these protections to our children in the children s safety act are a priority to our nation and our people
keeping our children safe from predators should be all of our priorities here in the united states congress
in this country we are able to track a cow from the time it is born as a calf to the time it ends up on the supper table somewhere in the united states as a steak
as a coauthor and cosponsor of the children s safety act as a former judge in houston texas i urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to listen to their constituents listen to the people of this country vote in favor of safety for american children
these crimes committed against children on the internet are facilitated by the latest technologies and advances in computers and the internet
without properly equipping law enforcement these cases will not be investigated and prosecuted effectively allowing many predators to slip through the cracks in our criminal justice system
a similar project has successfully been implemented in canada
in order for the child safety act to be successfully implemented law enforcement must be equipped and trained to meet the challenges of investigating cases involving advanced technological tools
mr chairman i rise in support of the children s safety act and i offer this amendment which i believe is acceptable to the chair and which i believe also is in the best interest of our communities
this rule has a requirement that all amendments be preprinted in the lt em gt lt em gt congressional record to be in order for today s floor debate
mr speaker i rise today in support of h res 437 establishing a select bipartisan committee to investigate the preparation and response for hurricane katrina
and we salute all americans who have stepped to the plate to help in any way they can
congress has a responsibility to conduct oversight but at this stage the oversight needs to conduct oversight in a manner that does not interfere with rescue and relief efforts
it has forced officials across america to take another look at the laws and regulations governing disaster response to identify ways to cut bureaucratic red tape in order to respond as quickly as possible
it s hard not to point fingers and assign blame in the aftermath of tragedy
with thousands stranded this administration would not lead and now it wants its buddies in the congress to lead the coverup
with such incompetence and indifference what reason is there to believe that what we have witnessed might not happen in our own backyard that the fate of those we saw in new orleans would not be the fate of other people be they poor folks in the rio grande valley from hurricane flooding or any other disaster be it humancaused or natural or both
without knowing objectively what why and how the rescue mission failed there is no way to ensure that the horror that we have seen would not be repeated in our own communities
you bring in the citizens from around the country and have the kind of independent inquiry that led to a bestselling book by the 911 commission
last night in the committee on rules many of my democratic colleagues asked excellent questions
it was a hearing that they held on recovering from hurricane katrina and he did this to share his experience and very valuable lessons that he learned from dealing with many many very very difficult challenges disasters that we faced in california earthquakes fire mudslides the devastation that we faced
i will tell members that pete wilson handled every single one of those challenges in his 8 years as governor extraordinarily well and we learned tremendously from the tragedies that we faced in those instances
as he said obviously while nowhere near the scale of hurricane katrina and we all know that hurricane katrina has been described as the worst natural disaster to ever hit our country some of the things that were faced in california there were terrible california floods in january of 1997 that resulted in eight deaths the evacuation of 120 000 people relocation of 55 000 people to 107 shelters damage or destruction of 30 000 residences and 2 000 businesses and total damage estimates at about 2 billion
that in 1997
i talked earlier today during the rule considering the establishment of this committee about the northridge earthquake in 1994 and it resulted in 51 deaths and injured over 9 000 people left 22 000 people homeless
the interesting thing as we look at these figures is we all know that they pale in comparison to the tragedy of hurricane katrina
one of the things that was most impressive to me and one of the things that we have already found here to be very beneficial was the fact that the private sector has stepped forward and is in many ways doing things the government can not do
and i think it is often joked about the fact that the private sector is there ready to meet a need a need that the government in no way could meet
we know that for an emergency response like that we faced clearly the government had to step in
we know that state and local governments have the responsibility to make those recommendations to the federal government and then bring them in
we also know that at virtually all these levels of government we have heard the leadership from president bush when it comes to the federal government to governor blanco in louisiana state that things were not handled as well as they could have been and both president bush and governor blanco republican and democrat have taken responsibility for dealing with this situation
and one example that i like to point to and i have got this right here is in the 1994 northridge earthquake we had the santa monica freeway collapse over la cienega boulevard
the santa monica freeway is the most traversed interstate in the country
and the earthquake took place in january of 1994 and i happened to be by there and one of the police officers let me go up and i actually took a chunk of the santa monica freeway
this has been sitting in my living room out in california for a long period of time
he wrote a piece on this the day before yesterday in the wall street journal in which he referred to the fact that people said it would take a long period of time
madam speaker in 66 days the santa monica freeway reopened working 24 hours a day 7 days a week
this is the kind of incentive that we need to put in place to ensure that they deal with this circumstance
so i think that we have the ability to respond to deal with this and the united states congress is in a position to make sure that we look at encouraging the most creative ways to address this challenge look in a bipartisan way at these problems
and i will tell my colleagues that i know with absolute certainty that the people who are providing the leadership of this committee will clearly want to be in consultation with the democrats with members of the minority to ensure that any witness who could help get to the bottom of this problem to the root of this problem is called before the committee
i do not represent hollywood california by the way i should say for the record i represent areas around hollywood in suburban los angeles an area that has been impacted by a wide range of disasters
i think it is absolutely reprehensible to believe that any member of this house democrat or republican would want to do anything that would jeopardize the ability to find out exactly what happened leading up to hurricane katrina and exactly what happened in the aftermath of hurricane katrina
i hesitate to say that the american people are wrong but i will tell my colleagues this i do not believe that the american people are right when they claim to a number of 60 percent that democrats do not want to get to the root of this problem which is what they have said in this muchhailed abc newswashington post poll
the rules of the house that apply for the subpoena process for other committees in the house will apply similarly for this new select committee that is charged with dealing with this circumstance
madam speaker i have listened to these terms sticking our head in the sand ignoring the problem i have no idea what anyone is talking about when they say things like that
he has made it very clear that as someone who was victimized by hurricane katrina he should in fact be able to subpoena and i can assure him under the standing rules of the house as a member of the committee if the minority leader chooses to appoint him to that committee he will be able to participate in determining who testifies before that committee
so we are in this together madam speaker whether members like it or not
i believe the democrats along with republicans want to find out exactly what has created this challenge at all levels of government and even in the private sector with which we are contending at this point
mr speaker the united states of america has gone through the worst natural disaster in our nation s history
we do know one thing both president bush republican and the democratic governor of louisiana governor blanco said that mistakes were made leading up to hurricane katrina and mistakes were made in the aftermath of hurricane katrina
we have an opportunity we have an opportunity to come together as we have in previous disasters and deal with it meet our constitutionally mandated responsibility for oversight of the executive branch to investigate and look at what happened at all levels of government local government state government the federal government even the private sector
that is exactly what the gentleman from illinois speaker hastert has proposed working with our colleagues in the other body to come together with a committee that will allow members of both political parties to raise any question that they want to allow this committee to have the authority to subpoena witnesses bring them forward
we are dealing with a hurricane right now in the carolinas
i believe i have a responsibility to the people whom i represent i have a responsibility to all the american people just as we all do to make sure that the problems that we faced leading up to and in the aftermath of hurricane katrina never happen again
i hope that we will be able to have that sense of solidarity and so i am saying on behalf of the gentleman from illinois speaker hastert i know that he looks forward to having our colleagues on the other side of the aisle appointed along with those who he will appoint to serve on this very important committee and with that with our quest of trying to ensure that we never go through what we have gone through in the past several weeks i urge support of this very important resolution
look what happened today in the new york times
in fact one company is fined a 32 million fine for what they overcharged during hurricane hugo
because after 4 years from september 11 what we saw and over the last 3 weeks is not the best of america in the sense of government s response
madam speaker i rise today in support of house resolution 437 to establish a select bipartisan committee to investigate the preparation for and the response to hurricane katrina
madam speaker congress has an important constitutional role to play in providing oversight to the executive branch and federal agencies
but more importantly congress has a responsibility to the people we represent to investigate the preparation and response efforts to hurricane katrina and make recommendations on how we can better prepare and respond to disasters in the future
america must be better prepared to handle disasters in the future
clearly clearly in hindsight there are things that could have been done better
but madam speaker one of america s greatest strengths is our longstanding tradition of pulling together in times of need
i am proud that in my home state of washington which is located 2 500 miles from louisiana and the gulf coast families are reaching out to help those affected
for example washington apple growers have contributed truckloads of worldclass apples to people living in mississippi and the other hardhit areas and throughout america
america has been challenged by natural disasters in the past and we will no doubt be challenged by disasters in the future
only by republicans and democrats working together in a bipartisan fashion will the best interests of our nation prevail
mr speaker i rise in strong opposition to house resolution 437 legislation that proposes to establish a partisan committee to investigate the bush administration s clumsy response to hurricane katrina
this congress has a proven history of lax oversight of the administration and i do not believe it can be trusted in this case to undertake a truly independent and probing inquiry
mr brown s unjustifiable appointment to fema is not the only outrage in the katrina tragedy
that is why so many americans oppose a partisan committee like the one proposed in this legislation
in fact 71 percent of the public said that the proposed congressional investigation would get bogged down in politics rather than focusing on the facts such skepticism is wellfounded
many in washington dc prefer a partisan inquiry into the federal government s response to the worst disaster in a nation s history but my constituents have been clear the government s response was appalling and they want a full and independent investigation
they want to know the truth so that in the future such tragedies are minimized and responded to with speed skill and experience
madam speaker democrats want to make sure that we help the victims of katrina first secondly we want to make sure that there is oversight on the money that we are spending a lot of money and thirdly we want to have an oversight meaningful in depth honest searching courageous as to why the federal government was so inept in its response and so late
i will ask my friend who chairs the rules committee who used to come to this floor on a regular basis and say when democrats were in the majority why will you not allow us to consider an alternative
are you afraid that you can not keep your members in line
in fact a washington postabc news poll revealed this week that 76 percent of americans support an independent commission
the reality is if this republican majority were charged with investigating the actions of a democratic administration there is no doubt in my mind that its oversight would be real and vigorous
mr speaker i never rise on this floor addressing the question of hurricane katrina without thanking all of the enormous outpouring from americans of charity and concern particularly commenting on my city and my state that have welcomed now almost 245 000 survivors into the state of texas and now close to 100 000plus in houston in my congressional district and other congressional districts in the area
one of the first things i did in visiting those survivors in the astrodome was to apologize on behalf of the federal government
each meeting i subsequently went to and each time i was able to touch a survivor or hear their story of pain i again apologized for the complete collapse and ineffectiveness of our ability to deploy in advance of hurricane katrina to be able to be on the ground with resources whether they be the national guard or the military or fema or anyone else that might have contributed to the saving of lives or in fact providing the survivors with a pathway out of mississippi or alabama or new orleans
but mr speaker moving checkers on a checker board is not in fact a solution to our problem
be reminded that the 911 commission working in a bipartisan fashion equal numbered in population if you will reflecting different views was able to bring out the dirty laundry but also the good points
they reminded us that one of the key elements of failure in 911 was the lack of interoperability
the citizens of louisiana mississippi and alabama deserve nothing less than the citizens of new york and new jersey and connecticut those in pennsylvania and our own pentagon who received an independent commission one that was heralded for its results and for its independence and its ability to work together
the citizens who were stranded in the superdome or in the convention center deserve nothing less than what this nation received with an independent commission
the spouses of so many of our members who have not been recognized at all deserve nothing less than to make sure the efforts that have gone on already and the answers that everybody seeks are provided by an independent commission an independent commission blessed by both the gentleman from illinois mr hastert xz4001690 and the gentlewoman from california ms pelosi xz4003140 coming together in the way that we should as a country
with all due respect this would be an investigation in name only
you ca nt have a comprehensive and fair investigation when the people controlling that investigation have a vested interest in the outcome
i think it is important for us to remember and i think in a few short minutes the president will address the country from new orleans and the french quarter about the federal commitment to the hurricanedevastated areas
he will be in louisiana but i would assume he will also be addressing mississippi alabama and some of the other surrounding areas that were affected by katrina
there has been a lack of organized congressional visits for us to even understand what those people are going through in the south
i think it is important if we are going to follow through on some of these statements that have been made here on this floor if we are going to follow through on what the president would say tonight in another 20 minutes to the country are we going to be here for the long haul or are we going to give the people affected in the south what we call here in washington dc the potomac twostep
are we going to allow this house in a vote that we took today that i voted against not that i am not in solidarity of the reason why we wanted to put together a select committee of the oversight of what happened in hurricane katrina but the fact that the people of the south are not getting what the 911 families got and the american people got after 911
if we are going to do something in the congress to find out where government failed where nonprofit failed and not have a 5050 relationship with the majority side to be able to get to the truth we are going to see partisan votes on that select committee
better yet we are going to appoint a committee just like it is regular business here in the congress
also the largest supplemental i must add in the history of the congress and this country outside of a war supplemental
well if it goes to 200 billion what will be the federal commitment in the end
a we know the people that will be working in the rebuilding process that are victims of this hurricane will not receive the prevailing wage because davisbacon has been waived
so i want to come out tonight and say that individuals that are in the affected area i believe the country needs to rally around them and demand a 911like commission
we are going to let politicians stand in judgment of politicians
we are going to let a majority party stand in judgment of the majority in the executive branch
there are individuals right now that have mold in their homes and individuals right now that still do not have even the simple opportunity to bury their dead
there are children right now that are lost in the hundreds and yet it is just another day at the office
over in the other body across the hall yesterday there was a vote that went down on a partisan party line
i am saying the leadership here in this congress is not doing it
but i will say this that i believe the american spirit will rise on behalf of these individuals who are living in shelters right now and who do not even know what is happening to them
i think the reason why people are saying well we are moving expeditiously and we are trying to do this that and the other and we want to make sure people get accountability is that these are poor individuals who by the way work every day but who may not have the education that the brokers and the stock folks and all of those folks had in 911
we are here to represent those who got up early one tuesday morning voting for representation so that they would be represented in this house so that democrats and republicans alike would be represented in this house and independents would be represented and those that are too young to vote would be represented
i do not know how long the press will stick with this issue to keep it in the forefront but we can not leave these individuals behind
we want you to pass a resolution that has some teeth in it
mr speaker let me just say this in order to clarify the whole issue on subpoenas
in section 5 it calls for joint operations and it comes down to the majority party
so your statement was correct the minority view on the committee or the democratic view on the committee if we wanted a particular individual to be subpoenaed could not be subpoenaed if we are not in the majority to be able to do so
and that is in section 5 of the joint operations
i think that it is important for us to remember that this is not the only battle as it relates to making sure that this never ever happens again especially after a 911 bill passed through homeland security given all this authority fema having the resources to prestage the equipment and to be able to move in for it to ever happen again
whether it is something the governor did not do in mississippi or louisiana or alabama or something that the mayor did not do in the town wherever it may be gulfport new orleans what have you we have to get to the bottom of it
unfortunately i do not believe it as a campaign i see it preventing lives in the future from being lost
the bottom line is we always talk about what would be different if we were in the majority
that means maybe fema did not have what it needed to be able to respond to people stuck in the superdome and in shelters
and in mississippi where i went in hancock county they had sanctioned looting
because obviously if he was there the day before the storm and his administration was there before the storm and they watched this come in knowing what the national weather center has done and i am speaking from fact
i went down to miami just south of my district in miami and met with the director of the hurricane center last friday
i know nothing about it but i stayed in a holiday inn express last night
but when it comes down to governance and responsibility and making sure if you are poor middle class or wealthy in this country that this government will govern on your behalf and that did not happen
will we have a lot of show and a lot of folks getting excited in the select committee
i think it is important that the american people members of congress no matter what community you represent if you believe in making sure that people get the same representation for us to have a 911 commission and i must add and say to the gentleman from ohio mr ryan xz4003521 and we come to the floor to talk about what we should be doing and how we should be doing it or what we are doing on this side of the aisle it is important for us to know the facts
this is the same congress in the majority that the 911 families came up here and they voted down two opportunities to set up a 911 commission
this is the same congress until it just became overbearing that there were major mistakes in our intelligence major mistakes and flags and they are still finding stuff because of the 911 commission that could have saved lives
so now the difference between the 911 families and what has happened down in the south is the fact that these individuals are poor that they are still in the recovery process and they have not been heard from yet
i am not saying just democrats that are concerned about individuals that are affected in affected areas
they can run the tab up to whatever they can run it up to and then the president is going to waive davisbacon which allow the people in the recovery process to receive minuscule wages not what they would ordinarily get from federal procured work
the differences a coming back here in session it would have happened without hesitation if democrats were in the majority
the only reason i am saying democratic leadership versus republican leadership because that is exactly the direction we are going in now
we are talking about a 911 commission that is still doing its work and it is the same administration and the same majority side in congress
the american people community after community are taking care of the evacuees taking care of these americans but we need to make sure that the government that they pay taxes to that their children are fighting in a war for making sure that they are not left behind because they do not have the economic means to be able to come up here to washington and say we want a commission we want it now we want to make sure this never happens for my husband my neighbor for my family for a family member or just someone who is unrepresented in this process
mr speaker reclaiming my time we have central time in the affected area eastern time
this is a fema trailer down in hancock county mississippi
there are maybe 10 phones in this trailer
i do not think we are going to get down to the real truth about how we can avoid this from happening in the future the governmental response also making sure that the nonprofit agencies that we tie in with that they did what they were supposed to do
as it relates to the evacuation of poor people there was a bill dropped down today on the democratic side of the aisle that called for a response plan an evacuation plan for the poor for the elderly for the individuals that need assistance the most because what we saw in new orleans what we saw in louisiana what we saw in mississippi the individuals that were left behind were the individuals who did not know where their next 5 was going to come from or were waiting on their check to come in or did not have a car to get out and it is catastrophic
if somebody wants to do something i think they need to help these individuals in the south
they need to help these individuals who do not have the means to come to washington to organize themselves and ask for a governmentsanctioned funded independent commission to be able to make sure that someone s husband or wife does not run out of oxygen because the levees broke and because we could not reach them and that instead they sat in their homes for 3 days and perished
like in the charity hospital where 35 or 40 folks perished because the levees broke and we could not do anything and we come to find out that those individuals did not even drown
so we need individuals that are professionals in this field to make sure that this never happens again
mr speaker i will just go ahead and say for those individuals that felt that the resolution that we passed today was the best thing since sliced bread and they are on the plane on the way back to their districts or what have you off for the weekend that they did their part now they go home and do what they have got to do in their district that is fine
and if one is in power to be able to make that happen then so be it
the 1964 civil rights act the 1965 voting rights act never would have been if it were not for the people out in the streets making it happen
if it were not for black and white people of goodwill saying that somebody like me can have an opportunity to come to the congress and give a special order to talk about the very individuals who can not represent themselves if it were not for those individuals white and black people in the north saying something is not right in the south and we are going to risk our lives to get the attention of the government that they pay taxes to allow them to have the kind of representation they deserve this is far deeper than the resolution on the last day of a work week
but all they did was they voted for representation and they salute the same flag that we solute every day here in this house and they deserve the representation
i am disturbed mr speaker i am disturbed by the fact they are partisan votes that are going on the other side of the congress and in this house as though it is just another piece of legislation
on the commission procedural vote here on this house floor that was voted down for us to have this week voted down for us to have a 911 kind of a commission i believe that was today and yesterday there is an article and i will give it to the members just in case they were not watching the senate wwwsfgatecom there is an article senate kills bid for katrina commission now let me tell my colleagues something
if they wanted to get to the bottom of it and to make sure that it never happens again and to make sure that americans do not have to watch the horror the horror of people dying and bodies floating not because of katrina but because of lack of response because the levee broke and because of a lack of administrative duties and governance on all levels if we do not want that to happen again why are we not passing a 911 kind of commission for the people in the gulf states
we have men and women right now with sand in their teeth and bombs blowing up every day around them away from their families some have family in the affected area
i am encouraged that the democratic leader the gentleman from california ms pelosi xz4003140 is willing to stand in there against the wind for what the american people believe in and not allow business as usual
throughout the country people are bringing people into their homes so i say that every time that we have an opportunity to come to this floor and speak as free americans in this democracy we are going to give those individuals voice
i am glad that there is some leadership on this floor that sees the importance in that
i thank my colleague for joining me in this special order this evening
madam speaker i rise in strong opposition to this partisan resolution that spits in the face of the american people s call for a robust inquiry that is independent of politics
yesterday s report by the 911 commission provides data to back up what every american learned by watching the government s dismal response to hurricane katrina that 4 years after 911 our nation is still not prepared to respond to a major crisis in this case a disaster that had been predicted gameplayed in an exercise run by fema and which we knew about 24 hours in advance
this is the republican congress that has not conducted true oversight hearings into the decision to go to war in iraq the lack of a success strategy in iraq the outing of a cia operative among many others
so we can stick our heads in the sand and pretend the government has handled the recovery well and basically do nothing or we can appoint a truly independent commission to help avoid these mistakes in the future
the vast majority of the american public supports the establishment of an independent bipartisan commission so that the inquiry focuses on the facts instead of getting bogged down in partisan politics
in fact if you look in the bible the old testament leviticus chapter 16 verse 8 we find the origin the etymology of the word scapegoat the goat that departs
in scripture you had two goats
this is the most redactive the most secretive administration in the history of the united states
we know a bit about what it is like to have devastating loss in a flood
the city of grand forks flooded in 1997
the majority appoints more people to the committee than the minority so they basically control the committee process in the house of representatives
what is happening in this congress and in the house and in the senate is that the republican party controls both chambers
so the democrats in the minority have no subpoena power
so what we were trying to say what the minority party was trying to say the democrats were trying to say with h res 437 is this select committee that will oversee and look at how the screwups went about down in the gulf coast should be equal
has anybody looked into this in a real way in depth
how about the medicare bill that we passed at 3 in the morning
he is saying should he not as a representative of a state in a congressional district that lost lives and homes and property and everything else should he not be able to subpoena somebody just like every other member of congress if i am on that committee
mr speaker the washington post reported just to support the gentleman s argument five of the eight top federal management agency officials came to their posts with virtually no experience in handling disasters and now lead an agency whose ranks of seasoned crisis managers have thinned dramatically since 911
i still say it had a lot to do with the number of electoral votes in louisiana and mississippi than anything else
we know that a president appoints his friends who make a lot of donations to posts in the executive branch
during a rise in hurricanes
i can not believe that with all of the challenges that we have right now in this country that this president can not go to the wealthiest americans his top campaign contributors and ask them to give back just a wee little bit of their tax cut that they got over the past 4 or 5 years just a wee little bit to help us fund hurricane katrina to help us fund the war
and one would think and i hope as the president is talking right now that somewhere in his speech he has the guts to ask the wealthiest people in the country to help us here because we need help
i ask the president to take the leadership role that the american people have given him and have the guts to ask the wealthiest people in the nation to help us rebuild the gulf coast to help us fund this elective war that he got us into
if they are in the health care industry i am sure they are doing okay
if they are in the oil industry i am sure they are doing just fine
record profits as far as the eye can see in the oil industry
they are the only ones doing really well in the country right now
i am sure in the gentleman from florida s mr meek xz4002700 district as in my mine people who do not have a lot of disposable income are the ones bringing the canned goods
but right now our government needs funds and we need the wealthiest in the country to contribute
and to see the disparity between those who have and those who do not highlighted through this whole tragedy i think really is a call for all of us in public office especially those in highranking leadership positions like the president to make the proper request and we need to ask those who have been doing very well to contribute to this fund
this outfit that is in the executive branch right now it is all politics
it is all about politics and trying to keep the republicans in the majority
now as the gentleman mentioned earlier talking about davisbacon davis and bacon were two republican members of congress who passed a prevailing wage law that allows for when federal money is being spent in a certain area that the feds will pay the prevailing wage of that area for the workers
because if they are paying federal money then they should obviously be paying for whatever the going rate is in that area
we are going to repeal the basic provision that allows for workers to at least make a decent wage in that area
and today in the hill newspaper these gentlemen from americans for tax reform are saying that this repeal will make it obvious that davisbacon is nothing but dead weight
so here these guys are wasting all of their time all their energy on putting the screws to the workers guys in new orleans that are now living in baton rouge or in mississippi or in houston who want to go back home and help rebuild their community and make the going rate in their community the prevailing wage in their community and these guys are wasting all their time and energy trying to screw them to the wall instead of overlooking and seeing what halliburton is doing
we are using the same administrative process with the reconstruction of katrina as we have been using in the war which wasted billions of dollars no oversight of halliburton no oversight of all of these people who make tremendous contributions back to the president and to have the audacity with the great human tragedy that is there and the human suffering there to say that you are going to waste your time and your energy making sure the workers do not get their fair share because that is dead weight that is wasteful government spending
this one gentleman in here he says something along the lines of it is a waste of money because the federal money will go to the worker and if it is a union worker the union worker will pay union dues per hourly wage
these union workers pay like 5 cents an hour to go for the union dues 10 cents an hour it depends on what union you are in
seventy percent of the people in this country want an independent commission to look at this or a bipartisan commission to look at this
eleven republicans nine democrats we do not have an ounce of power on this thing and we will get slammed just like we do every day down here and the end result will be a fema that continues to be inept and inadequate in its response to natural disasters
we are not going to let go until we get the kind of commission that the american people want that is only fair and that will best fix the problems that we have in fema right now because it will have proper oversight
i have served in this body now 25 years and in that 25 years a little over half of it was under a democrat house and democrat leadership tip oneill jim wright three speakers in all on the democrat side
and i can tell you the ratio of this committee we would have just rejoiced in getting 9 out of the 20 spots during that period of time
i think it is tremendously fair and i think the speaker has been very fair in what he has talked about
now anyone in this house that would suggest that any member of this house or any member of either party would whitewash or push something under the rug that could mean the life and death of the american people or the destruction of property because it is politically expedient i just can not imagine that
and i think after they look at it and after this report comes out the american people will have faith once again in their government
we do that in committees every day
we have appropriated an awful lot of money to be spent down in that area and we are going to appropriate a lot more
we saw fema make some big mistakes in the past down in miamidade county where they were paying for funerals last year where there was not a hurricane
so this the committee has a big big job and it should be done in the congress
madam speaker high talk from the majority follows the abysmally low performance of the federal organizations that they oversee and that our people trusted to protect them in their hour of need
the fact that thousands of men women and children are dead the fact that hundreds of thousands more have become evacuees in the richest country in the world shows that we do not have everything under control
and now to show how seriously it takes its constitutional responsibility to get the government back on track to show that it is not interested solely in rhetoric but also in results the majority has seen fit to create a partisan political body which we all know will care more about the political survival of the leadership than the actual survival of the people
if it was joint subpoena power would exist in this bill as would joint control of the committee s operation scope and direction
apparently in the wake of disaster comes hypocrisy
along with its assurances of a fair and honest investigation of the failures of the federal response to katrina assurances which are the product of wishful thinking as opposed to a sincere review of recent history the majority puts forth empty arguments in favor of this bill
what exactly is their incentive to publicize their lack of vision and errors in judgment
madam speaker more absurd things happen in this house all the time
for example some might say that appointing a man with absolutely no experience in emergency management to head the federal emergency management association was absurd and yet nobody challenged that appointment until it was far too late
madam speaker i do not mean to say that the chairman and his colleagues do not care about improving our national preparedness for a future emergency because i know that they do but the fact that political pressures have in the past and will again in the future distort and in some cases destroy investigations of government failings when the investigations are carried out by us this is so obvious that it should be beyond question
mr speaker i rise in strong opposition to h res 437 which would establish a partisan committee to investigate the hurricane katrina preparation and response
after all these are the same people who took more than 140 hours of testimony to investigate whether the clinton white house misused its holiday card database but less than five hours of testimony about prisoner abuse in iraq
the downing street memo has sent shockwaves through the world and confirmed our worst fears about the iraq war sham but mum s the word from republicans in congress
so as a member of this body who was elected by as good a margin as anyone else here i do object that i could not ask for a witness that i could not subpoena a witness to deliver the message that needs to be delivered about the lessons learned in mississippi
fema could have avoided millions of dollars in unnecessary aerial replenishment of people that we could get trucks to because they insisted on one point of delivery in a county where very few people still had cars that were running and those that had cars that ran could not get gasoline
fema could have sent thousands of people on their way to their families in other parts of the state but did not bring gasoline in for them
madam speaker given the gentleman s desire to see that we get to the bottom of this given that the gentleman is elected by a majority of the people from california and given that i am elected by a majority of people in the most affected area does the gentleman not think it would be fair that i would have the same right as someone from the affected area to subpoena witnesses as the gentleman from the west coast of this country would have
i have served in the congress for 30 years the first 19 in the majority the last 11 in the minority so i have seen life from both sides
we have just experienced a national tragedy that has caused immeasurable pain to countless americans and yet here in the house of representatives nothing seems to have changed
the house is not rising above raw partisanship even in a time of national tragedy
the committees in the house and the senate that have oversight jurisdiction were starting to hold hearings and suddenly the republican leadership said well we are going to have a housesenate committee
have we really looked at how the white house used the intelligence as faulty as it was that was the basis for going to war in iraq
has the house looked at the question of the outing of a cia agent by people in the white house in order to punish her husband who was critical of the iraq war
we had more hearings when the republicans were in charge and there was a democratic administration on whether president clinton misused his christmas card list for political purposes
but when you do not make an effort and you have a record of abusing the power that you have in running this institution and ignoring the oversight responsibilities on really important matters in order to protect a republican administration from possible embarrassment we have no confidence whatsoever that we are going to get to the facts of what went wrong in dealing with hurricane katrina
madam speaker i rise in strong support of the resolution to create a bipartisan bicameral congressional committee to investigate the local state and federal response and preparation to hurricane katrina
as a member of the louisiana delegation i am not interested in polls
as a member of the louisiana delegation i also believe that the members from impacted regions must have a participating voice in the investigation to provide firsthand knowledge of frustrations and impediments that our offices confronted
it is urgent that deficiencies in command control communication and response be corrected
mr speaker i move to suspend the rules and pass the bill hr 438 to designate the facility of the united states postal service located at 2000 allston way in berkeley california as the maudelle shirek post office building
madam speaker i rise today in strong support of hr 483 the garzavela united states courthouse designation act offered by my colleague and my good friend the gentleman from texas mr ortiz xz4003020
this bill pays tribute to two great americans federal judge reynaldo garza and federal judge filemon vela who were judicial legends in the great state of texas
judge garza was the nation s first mexican american federal district judge appointed to the federal bench by president kennedy in 1961
this outstanding man had done advanced study in the field of law and was a great orator
in 1976 president carter asked him to serve as the nation s attorney general but he declined because he did not want to leave his beloved south texas and his service on the federal bench
he did however accept an appointment to the 5th court of appeals by president carter and for many years commuted back and forth between south texas and the circuit court in new orleans
in 1982 he obtained senior status and even after his retirement he remained active by filling in on the bench whenever he was needed
he was committed to education particularly in encouraging literacy and he was known and highly respected by everyone for the evenhanded way in which he dispensed justice
i served 1 year as foreman of a federal grand jury which he appointed in his district court in brownsville texas
it was a privilege and a pleasure to work with him and meet in his chamber where i witnessed firsthand the honesty the integrity and compassion of this gentleman from south texas
his last official act took place from his hospital bed when he officiated the swearing in of his protege federal judge ricardo h hinojosa as the new chairman of the federal sentencing commission
judge vela was nominated to the federal bench by president carter in 1980
during his tenure the federal docket dramatically increased due to the enormous population growth in south texas
he worked tirelessly to design and have built the new courthouse in brownsville
he also was passionate about teaching children about the law and the criminal justice system in order to encourage them to make right choices of life
judge vela had one of the longest running and most successful radio programs on legal subjects which was broadcast in spanish to more than 2 million listeners in south texas and northern mexico
he also participated in 220 spanish radio programs entitled enriquezca su vida termine sus estudios meaning enrich your life complete your studies that focused on encouraging children to stay in school and off drugs
madam speaker i join with the gentleman from brownsville texas mr ortiz xz4003020 in supporting hr 483 a bill to name the courthouse in brownsville texas as the reynaldo g garzafilemon b vela united states courthouse
the first honoree judge reynaldo garza was born in brownsville in 1915
judge garza served his country during world war ii in the air force
in 1961 president kennedy appointed judge garza to the district court for the southern district of texas
in 1979 president carter appointed him to the united states court of appeals for the 5th circuit
in addition to his judicial duties judge garza has long been interested in education issues
he served former governors john connally and mark white on commissions to improve the quality of education in texas
judge garza recognized the importance of education in judicial proceedings and his concern for uneducated men at the mercy of unscrupulous people
judge garza was very active in his church and has served the knights of columbus in the brownsville area for many years
in 1989 judge garza was honored by the university of texas with a distinguished alumnus award
his record of public service includes the work with the rotary club the latinamerican relation committee in brownsville trustee at his law school advisory council for the boy scouts and he was elected as the city commissioner for the city of brownsville
mary s school of law in san antonio
his civic activities including being the charter president for the esperanza home for boys and the cosponsor of the spanish radio program enrich your life complete your studies judge vela s other civic activities include membership on the independent school district task force and membership in the general assembly of the texas catholic conference
judge vela was nominated by president carter for the federal bench and was confirmed by the united states senate in 1980
i join the gentleman from texas mr ortiz xz4003020 in supporting hr 483
mr speaker i seek to claim time in opposition to the motion
mr speaker normally i would not come to the floor to oppose a bill naming a post office in someone else s district
i am confident i speak on behalf of some of the west coast members of congress as well as the mainstream american values and certainly have no personal animosity towards the lady for whom this post office is named in this bill
mr speaker just to make a couple of gentle points the effort has been at least on the record as not i do not want to say fighting against injustice but a record of fighting against justice particularly in the case of the effort to free mumia abujamal
when they go back by that post office in berkeley and look at the name on the post office they are going to ask what were the principles that brought this about
madam speaker i rise in strong support of hr 483 a bill to honor two members of the united states judiciary
the bill would designate the federal courthouse located in brownsville texas as the reynaldo g garza and the filemon b vela united states courthouse
the gentleman introduced this same legislation in the 108th congress which passed the house last september
these two jurists displayed the very finest in legal scholarship
in addition both these gentlemen have made substantial contributions through extensive volunteer efforts to the well being of their communities
after serving in the federal district court judge garza was appointed to the us court of appeals for the fifth circuit
when judge garza was appointed to the fifth circuit judge filemon vela succeeded him on the us district court for the southern district of texas in brownsville
he worked closely with the esperanza home for boys and headed numerous local activities to encourage young people to stay in school
judges garza and vela were active members in numerous civic organizations including the texas bar association and the united states sentencing commission brownsville rotary club the latin american relations committee and the brownsville chamber of commerce
i think the gentleman has done a great job in describing the contributions of two great giants from south texas
it has passed two or three times but it has stalled in the senate
we have a wealth of riches in south texas including these two giants of men
reynaldo garza was the first hispanic appointed to the federal bench by president john f kennedy in 1961 and judge filemon vela was appointed to the federal bench by president jimmy carter back in 1980
both of these men have become legends in the south texas area by virtue of their commitment to education and to our community
today we are remembering the lives and groundgreaking achievements of the late judges reynaldo guerra garza and filemon vela and inscribing the us courthouse in brownsville with their names
like me judge garza came from a humble background from a family whose parents were born in mexico and came to this country in search of opportunity for their children
he rose to preside over one of the highest courts in the land in the process becoming the first mexicanamerican federal district judge and rendering some of the most important civil rights decisions in this country s history
judge vela much like judge garza grew up of modest means in south texas
he is remembered as a hardworking and committed judge whose impact was felt not only in the courtroom but in the community as well
madam speaker i urge all of my colleagues to support this legislation naming the courthouse in brownsville texas after reynaldo g garza and filemon b vela two great judges great role models and great men
mr speaker as a member of the committee on government reform i am pleased to join my colleagues in consideration of hr 438 legislation naming a postal facility in berkeley california after maudelle shirek
maudelle shirek the granddaughter of slaves was born in jefferson arkansas before moving to the bay area over 60 years ago
in the 1960s and 1970s she was active in the antiwar movement
she founded two senior centers was one of the first elected officials to address the aids epidemic and helped organize the free mandela movement a wellknown and outspoken former member of the berkeley city council and former berkeley vice mayor maudelle shirek was instrumental in encouraging former congressman ron v dellums to enter politics and has served as a role model for many people in the community especially the gentlewoman from california ms lee xz4002370
earlier this year the young adult project 2005 black history month celebration honored maudelle shirek s life legacy and service mr speaker i commend the gentlewoman from california ms lee xz4002370 for seeking to honor her constituent in her community a former member of the city council in this manner and urge swift passage of this measure
these items can be addressed in the next supplemental regular fiscal year 2006 bills or in reconciliation
agencies funded in the laborhhs treasury transportation and defense bills will be funded at the lower of the housepassed or current rates since the senate will not pass these bills by october 1 the house and senate have not passed a cr under the current framework since 1994
by returning to a traditional cr that funds the government operations at the lowest possible level it will provide a strong motivation for this congress to complete its work in regular order and produce individual appropriations bills and conference reports
the committee does not support an omnibus or minibus in any form and will do everything in its power to ensure that that does not happen
in order to help the senate with the difficult process of passing the treasury transportation and laborhhs bills we will continue to push the lower rate longterm continuing resolution prospect
the instructions proposed in the motion to recommit range far beyond the subject matter of the joint resolution
i have a lot of notes here most of which i will not use but let me simply note that this is another case of the failure to effectively govern by the republican president and the republican majority in this congress
we have failed in the basic test of governing and i think it is important to understand why
throughout the year we on the democratic side of the aisle in the minority have worked with the majority on every possible procedural issue and cooperated with them procedurally at every juncture so that we could enable this house to pass the 10 appropriation bills that are necessary to pass even though we disagreed in most instances with the content of those bills
now we are here and in spite of our procedural cooperation the republican majority has managed to pass only two of the 10 appropriation bills under our responsibility
in my view it is because the majority caucus has such a fundamental disrespect for the basic functions of government that it has sacrificed and squeezed so many education and health and veterans and other programs in order to pay for huge supersize tax cuts for the most wealthy among us that in the end they have not been able to convince their senate colleagues to go along and go on record and endorse those cuts
that results in a number of i think extremely inequitable realities
it for instance means that we are effectively cutting in health care it means that we are cutting maternal and child health care and we are cutting rural health outreach programs
it means that we are cutting the community service block grant a program which deals with the needs of the poorest people in this society by 50 percent
but it leaves intact it leaves intact the huge supersize tax cuts for the top 1 percent of earners in this society people who make more than 400 000 a year
and it leaves in place the president s edict his unilateral edict in the wake of hurricane katrina that the workers in the afflicted area who are trying to put that area back together are not even going to be allowed to get a decent prevailing wage that they would otherwise be guaranteed under davisbacon
mr speaker 32 000 is a lot more than a lot of people in this country make in a year
but we are going to give an average 32 000 tax cut to the people in this society who need it least
it makes sure that the only major farm bill that is going to expire is the program that is given some financial support to the smallest farmers in this country the milc program
now the question is being asked in this town how are we going to pay for hurricane katrina
in my judgment mr speaker that is the wrong question
the right question is how are we going to be able to pay for the decisions already made by the republican majority of this congress and the white house to give away to the wealthiest people in this society the top 1 percent over 1 trillion in tax cuts over the next decade
we are going to give away in tax cuts to the top 1 percent ten times as much as katrina is being estimated to cost
so if the members vote for this continuing resolution today they are voting to keep those giant tax cuts in place
i am going to offer a motion to recommit which number one would provide that the funding levels in this bill be at the current rate rather than the threeheaded rate spelled out by the gentleman so that we do not even for a month cut back on what we are doing on job training or community service block grants or lowincome heating assistance or other programs like that
and it would also i should add instruct the congress to come back with a change in the tax code so that we limit the size of the tax cuts for people who make over 400 000 to the size received by persons in the top 5 percent of the economy
to those in the majority side of the aisle who say that we should not be doing that i would say that does not surprise me because that represents the economic philosophy of the majority party
section 2 would simply repeal the president s edict that workers in the katrinaaffected region would not be subject to the protections of davisbacon wage protections
section 3 would simply guarantee that the milc program remains in force for the same length of time as other titles of the farm bill
and section 4 would require a reduction in the size of the tax cuts for taxpayers with incomes of over 400 000 as i just described in my previous remarks
mr speaker if the rules required equity in legislation we brought to the floor this amendment would be in order
mr speaker in the wake of hurricanes katrina and rita our country has been made brutally aware that there in fact are two americas that exist in this country
recently released census data shows that in 2004 37 million people were living in poverty
in addition this data shows that 1 in 6 children were living in poverty
the 50 percent cut to csbg in the continuing resolution would have a devastating effect on evacuees and on lowincome individuals
we have a responsibility to ensure that all americans have an opportunity to share in america s prosperity
this rule provides for 1 hour of debate in the house equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the committee on appropriations
additionally the resolution provides that suspensions will be in order at any time on the legislative day of thursday october 6 2005 and the speaker or his designee shall consult the minority leader or her designee on any suspension considered under the rule
lastly the rule provides that a motion to proceed pursuant to section 2908 of the defense base closure and realignment act of 1990 shall be in order only if offered by the majority leader or his designee
in an impressive display of bipartisanship and just sheer hard work the house passed all 11 appropriations bills prior to the july 4 district work period
these six are awaiting closure in conference
unfortunately the appropriations process within the two bodies has not been completed prior to the start of the new fiscal year which of course begins this october 1 we must institute a continuing resolution in order to allow the government to function through november 18 2005 while we complete consideration of the remaining appropriations bills waiting on the senate to complete their final actions and for the conference committees to do their work
the legislation includes language prohibiting agencies from initiating or resuming programs or procurements not funded in the fiscal year 2005 and prohibits agencies from awarding new grants and certain other forms of assistance during the period of the cr which of course is through november 18 of this year
clearly we have had a shift in priorities since that budget resolution passed
as a state that was hit by four hurricanes last year and had the beginnings of katrina come across our state this year our hearts go out to our brothers and sisters on the gulf coast and we recognize that this government has a commitment to help lift up those citizens on the gulf coast and where appropriate we have a federal responsibility in the rebuilding and reconstruction process in louisiana and mississippi and alabama and a lot of other places
it is important that we recognize that had we not taken some of the steps that we have taken in the past we would not have eliminated 100 billion off of the deficit in the last year
we would not have been in a position where revenues to the government would have actually been higher than they were as a result of the lower taxes and the growth in the economy that has come about as a result of that
i think we can all be very proud of our appropriators finishing their schedule before july 4 and now we are in a position unfortunately of being in a bit of a holding pattern waiting on the senate and our conference committees to do their work
i applaud the gentleman s bipartisan effort to find ways to pay for these unanticipated expenses that we have come across and i wish him the best in that effort
it is certainly a difficult proposition in this town to eliminate any program but the president led early this year with that thought in mind and he had mixed success
we had a herculean effort this summer to move these bills on schedule move them out before july 4th and because of supreme court nominations and everything else obviously the senate has had other issues on their agenda and we are in a holding pattern on the appropriations
however in order to expedite this legislation for floor consideration the committee will forgo action on this resolution
an email on this issue sent by the committee states we are happy to concede your jurisdiction in this matter and included the language solely because of omb s office of management and budget request that we do so
we do nt believe that it prejudices any future action on your part i will place a copy of this letter in the congressional record during floor consideration
as my good friend from florida has pointed out the senate s slowness in acting on appropriations bills means that the continuing resolution that we are discussing here today is necessary
for too long there has been a dearth of both presidential leadership and accountability in this area
the bill is called the stimulating leadership in cutting expenditures act or the slice act for short
it would do two things first it would authorize the president to identify specific items in federal spending that he thinks should be cut and second require congress to vote on each of those items
the bill would apply both to appropriations and to spending items in the recently signed transportation bill
the president has said we should pay for responding to katrina and rita through spending cuts alone but the president s own party and the majority in this house are divided on what to cut
i hope all of our colleagues will join us in this crucial effort to restore fiscal sanity to our nation s capital
since 2001 the budget surplus that president clinton and a republican congress bequeathed president bush has been erased and our country is now in debt to the tune of 8 trillion or 25 000 for every american man woman and child
but having campaigned on giving back most of the budget surplus in tax cuts president bush insisted on much more and congress went along
and then came the attacks of 911 and with them the need for increased spending on homeland security a military response in afghanistan and a war in iraq
even in the face of national emergency neither the president nor congress has seen fit to call on americans for any sacrifice and instead of temporarily scaling back tax cuts the president has insisted on making them permanent even as federal spending has skyrocketed
so now we are putting the costs of war and everything else the government does on the national credit card but the debt is owed not just to ourselves as in the past but to china japan and india
part of the answer is that budget and tax policy in washington has been so captive to very partisan and extreme ideological voices that it has been hard to find common ground and moderate consensus
even in this time of war extremists in the republican party view tax cuts as almost a religious calling while some in my party reject any spending cuts except in defense
to help begin such a serious debate earlier this year i introduced legislation that would give the president authority to require congress to vote up or down on specific appropriations items the president deemed unworthy of funding a workable and constitutional alternative to the line itemveto legislation that the supreme court struck down in 1998
the bill is called the stimulating leadership in cutting expenditures or slice act
that name fits because the bill would promote presidential leadership and congressional accountability on proposals to reduce other spending in order to offset the costs of responding to the recent natural disasters
the bill would establish a twophase process the president would have until november 1st to tell congress which if any of the spending in the transportation bill should be cancelled
and he would have until the end of this year to identify any items in fiscal year 2006 appropriations bills we wants to eliminate
in each case if the president proposes a cut congress would have to vote on it we could not ignore the proposal as can be done under current law and if a majority approved the cut it would take effect
the bill recognizes this by giving the president the leadership role of identifying just which other spending he thinks should be cut in order to offset some of the amounts the federal government will be spending in response to recent natural disasters
but i do know that we should stop wasting time in theoretical debates about whether we should make spending cuts and start debating specific proposals
for the benefit of our colleagues here is an outline of the bill stimulating leadership in cutting expenditures slice act the purpose of the bill is to facilitate presidential leadership and congressional accountability regarding reduction of other spending to offset the costs of responding to recent natural disasters
the bill would amend the budget act to provide as follows the president could propose rescission of any budget authority provided in the recently passed transportation bill or an appropriations act through special messages including draft bills to make those rescissions
the president would have until november 1 2005 to propose canceling spending items in the new transportation act and until january 1 2006 to propose rescissions from fy 06 appropriations bills
debate in the senate would be limited to 10 hours and no amendment or motion to recommit would be allowed
the facts on the ground have changed and our agenda here in the house must change accordingly
i am confident that we will do right by those affected by the hurricanes but we still need to ask ourselves where our financial and legislative duties are in response to katrina construction continued funding for iraq and afghanistan and increasing fiscal deficit
are our priorities in line with our financial obligations
for the costs of this year s installments of the tax cuts enacted in 2001 and 2003 225 billion this year alone we could pay for the gulf states recovery from katrina
our priorities in the coming months should not waver from the ultimate goal
mr speaker i rise in strong opposition to hr 3893
this bill is a laundry list of giveaways to the oil industry one of the most profitable industries in america and one that is right now gouging american consumers
moreover there are no offsets for subsidies to big oil in this bill
mr speaker i rise in very strong support of this rule and of course in strong support of the underlying bill hr 3893
we have made in order the democratic substitute
my understanding is that the democrat substitute is similar if not identical to the democrat alternative that was put in play in the committee on energy and commerce at our 16hour markup last week
another good reason to vote for the rule is that the manager s amendment that has been incorporated into the base text takes into account many of the issues that were debated in the committee on energy and commerce and many of the issues that were supported by our minority members of that committee last week in particular the concerns about price gouging
the amendment that was adopted in committee on price gouging last week only referred to price gouging within a disaster area that had been declared by the president of the united states and it only applied to gasoline and diesel fuel
the manager s amendment incorporates many of the ideas that the gentleman from michigan mr stupak xz4003910 and the gentlewoman from new mexico mrs wilson xz4004342 on the majority side had in their alternative price gouging amendments
and i know there are very legitimate concerns in the northeast and the midwest this winter about the price and availability of home heating oil
as we have that debate there are several facts that i think we should keep in mind
number one since 1981 we have closed 176 refineries in this country
that means that we have in operation today 148
we have closed over half of the refineries in the united states of america in the last 30 years
that might be acceptable if the demand for their products was going down but in fact the opposite is true
the demand for refined products in our nation is rising every year somewhere between 1 percent to 3 percent a year
the consequences were clear for every american to see in the aftermath of katrina and rita when over half of our refineries shut down temporarily and about 25 percent of our oil and gas production shut down
in some parts of the country the price of gasoline doubled and even tripled
so quite simply mr speaker it is time to invest in our energy infrastructure and one of the critical components of that is our refinery capacity
we have not built a new oil pipeline in this country in over 40 years
i want to thank the distinguished committee on rules for bringing this rule to the floor and i look forward to working with them on this issue and other issues in the future
mr speaker i rise in strong support of this rule
the house today takes an important step in recovering from hurricane katrina
the bill before us today is the product of a markup in committee that started at 8 am
hurricane katrina hit in the wrong place at the wrong time and american consumers are suffering
nothing should stand in the way of this bill passing
in the end the issue before us is whether people who work for a living will get the gasoline they need to go to work at a price they can afford to pay
but they drive to work in cars and trucks that run gasoline
we ve known about the problem in refinery capacity for 30 years and done nothing
mr speaker i want to point out one thing to the body there is one thing in this bill one thing that scores as a cost by the congressional budget office
it is the markey amendment that we accepted in committee to increase the home heating oil reserve from 2 million barrels to 5 million barrels
we accepted it because the gentleman from massachusetts has a legitimate concern about the plight of people that need home heating oil in the northeast
that is the only thing in the bill before us that the cbo has scored
or is that a legitimate need of the american people that we put into the bill because the gentleman from massachusetts mr markey xz4002530 asked for it legitimately so and it made sense and we put it in the bill
we consume 21 million barrels a day of oil in this country
the amount of oil that china is going to need from the world market in the next year is expected to go up perhaps as much as a million barrels a day
i would like to point out that every state puc in the country already regulates the retail price of natural gas so in that particular instance i am not sure that his amendment would do much good
mr speaker pursuant to house resolution 481 i call up the bill hr 3893 to expedite the construction of new refining capacity in the united states to provide reliable and affordable energy for the american people and for other purposes and ask for its immediate consideration in the house
in 1981 there were 324 operating refineries in the boundaries of the united states of america
now this is actually the permitting application to expand an existing refinery in the state that i live in the state of texas
in the new source review every one of these steps has to go forward
on the right of the chart are additional permits in addition to the new source review
what company s board of directors in their right minds would want to go through this process and tie up billions of dollars for years and years if they did not know that they would at least get a definite decision in a timely fashion
but it is a fact that we use 21 million barrels of oil a day in this country and we only have the refining capacity for about 16 on a good day and unfortunately since katrina and rita we have had many good days
we are down to 14 million barrels of refinery capacity that is available and we need 21 million barrels of refinery capacity to refine our consumer demands that we have right now in this country
if a governor does not want it to expedite the review they do not have to and this stays in existence which means in those states they will not get any new or existing refineries built or expanded
but in some states and i hope my state of texas is one i think governor perry would ask for this expedited review
if that happens and if we can get a company that wants to invest in a new refinery or expand an existing refinery you will actually get a decision in a timely fashion
i have reason to believe that if we pass this bill and if the senate passes this bill within the next year you are going to see america s systems step forward and actually ask to build new refineries in the united states of america
we should send it to the senate encourage them to vote for a similar bill and then go to conference and produce a conference report that the president can sign and let us get our country moving again and at least begin to start the process to lower gasoline prices for every american in this country
in the days right after hurricane katrina gasoline prices shot up past the 3 dollar mark almost everywhere
americans nationwide worried if the price would be higher on their way home from work than it was in the morning
then hurricane rita came along and damaged refineries in louisiana and texas
every driver in america has endured shortages and price spikes that still have not fully subsided
we leave in place state measures against price gouging
but i do nt want this to get in the way of expanding refinery capacity after hurricane katrina so i will set it aside for now until we can hold the additional hearings that some believe are needed
we will have a vote in the future on this policy and when it passes our nation s supply of both energy supply and common sense will expand
we let any retail gasoline provider know the federal government is watching so do nt gouge consumers in an emergency
dear chairman barton on september 28 2005 the committee on energy and commerce ordered reported hr 3893 the gasoline for america s security act of 2005 in recognition of the desire to expedite floor consideration of hr 3893 the committee on the judiciary hereby waives any consideration of the bill
the committee on the judiciary agrees to waive any formal consideration of the bill with the understanding that its jurisdiction over these and other provisions contained in the legislation is no way altered or diminished
this waiver is further conditioned upon the understanding between our committees that there are no provisions contained in hr 3893 that could be construed or interpreted to alter modify or to have any effect on any laws or regulations pertaining to any fuel additive including ethanol and mtbe
i would appreciate your including this letter in the congressional record during consideration of hr 3893 on the house floor
dear chairman sensenbrenner i write in regards to hr 3893 gasoline for america s security act of 2005
further knowing of your interest in the debate surrounding fuel additive liability nothing in hr 3893 should be construed or interpreted to alter modify or to have any effect on any laws or regulations pertaining to any additive including ethanol and mtbe
i will include our exchange of letters in the committee s report on hr 3893 and i look forward to working with you as we prepare to pass this important energy legislation for the american people
then you need to put the example in the statute
it says in the area to which the declaration applies what if the price gouging is outside of the declaration area
we do not have in the manager s amendment the words unconscionably excessive we do not have the words gross disparity i am not disputing the intent
i do question the advisability of putting that in statute when it is not defined
a strategic refinery reserve as i understand it in this bill you actually go out and build the refineries and it is unclear to me whether you would operate them around the clock or just in some sort of an emergency
but if the secretary of energy did not want to operate them continuously i guess he would have that authority in the plan to have them as a sort of ready reserve
mr speaker i claim the time in opposition to the motion to recommit
mr speaker i want to engage in a short colloquy with the gentleman from new york mr mchugh xz4002640 concerning liheap funding
i will work with the gentleman to help increase the amount of funds appropriated for liheap to help those americans including those americans in your great state of new york most vulnerable to the higher energy costs we are seeing today
let me simply say that it appears to be the stupak language on price gouging that was in the democratic substitute
if that is correct we have already had the vote and we have in the pending bill language that addresses price gouging
she said yes but i do it and i do it in high heels backwards so we both agree on both sides of the aisle that we need to do something about price gouging
mr speaker i thank the chairman for yielding me time and i want to thank the gentleman from texas mr barton xz4000180 for working so hard to accommodate those of us who represent the northeastern part of this country in this bill
i rise in strong support of this legislation and i do so having worked hard to make sure that those of us who represent the northeastern part of the country are satisfied with what we have before us today
the issue of pollution in this country needs to be addressed and the clean air act definitely needs to be amended but i felt for a long time a refinery bill was not the place to do that and i commend my leadership for being able to work that out
as the gentlewoman from new mexico mentioned in her speech there is a wonderful provision on price gouging that will protect consumers against price gouging from the refinery on down
the third point is that the only cost in this bill is the cost associated with increasing the northeast home heating oil reserve from 2 million to 5 million barrels a day which is critical to the northeast
the bottom line is if you are satisfied with higher gas prices if you are satisfied with the concentration of refinery capacity in hurricaneprone areas if you are satisfied with the fact that we have not built a new refinery in so many years if you are satisfied with the status quo and if you think your constituents are satisfied with that if you think that 2 million barrels is enough for the northeast heating oil reserve if you think this bill is going to cost money even though it will not then vote against it
mr speaker i thank the gentleman from michigan mr stupak xz4003910 and the gentleman from virginia mr boucher xz4000430 for their leadership in offering this substitute and i am proud to join them
i rise in strong support of this substitute for two reasons
we can all agree there were some good provisions in the first energy bill but katrina exposed its shortcomings as well as vulnerabilities that still exist in the energy market
in contrast this substitute deters price gouging at every stage of production not just the retail phase but at all phases in the chain of supply and this will strengthen those measures
in its present form yes
mr speaker 1 year ago the price of a gallon of gasoline in america was 194
today our constituents are looking toward their elected representatives to rein in gas prices once and for all
if we pass this energy bill in its current form we pass up that opportunity a second time
in that spirit we offer this motion to recommit which attacks soaring gas prices head on
our motion achieves this objective by investing new authority in the ftc to investigate enforce and then punish price gouging and market manipulation
any violation will result in new civil penalties and will be enforced with up to triple the damages of the profits gained by the violation
unlike the underlying bill this motion has teeth by reining in scrupulous practices of the oil and gas executives interested more in padding their bottom line than helping middleclass families make ends meet
i urge my colleagues to stand up to the oil companies and show hardworking americans that we are in their corner
our price gouging provisions are superior to those of the underlying legislation and our provisions are in effect at every stage of the oil and gas production covering everyone in the supply chain
it is so interesting for me to stand here in this body and listen to people say it was rushed through committee that we have not given proper thought to this issue
but this issue has been on the table for 10 years and if former president clinton had not vetoed drilling in anwr in 1995 we might not be standing here having this discussion today
and the people in tennessee in my district are tired of the talk mr speaker
i want to hit two provisions that are included in this bill
it is going to help us to be able to move forward on refineries in a more expeditious manner
mr speaker i rise in strong opposition to hr 3893 the second energy special interest act of 2005 the bush administration s energy policy and the machinations of the republican leadership on this subject have an alice in wonderland quality
instead he has cut funding for the conservation and efficiency programs we already have in place
if we re going to spend more money it should be invested in programs that actually help people
higher fuel efficiency standards public transit and even bicycles will do much more to reduce our dependence on foreign oil than what s in this bill
if just two percent of trips taken nationwide were taken by bikes we would save more than two thirds of a billion gallons of gasoline a year and up to 5 billion in total consumer driving costs
mr speaker i rise in strong opposition to this bill
the whole premise of this bill is faulty refining capacity in us is increasing
let me repeat that refining capacity in the us is increasing and it has been increasing for a decade
saying that we have less refining capacity today because we have fewer refineries is like saying that we have fewer crops today than we did in 1920 because fewer americans are farming
there has been much attention given to the fact that our nation s refinery capacity is limited but there has been no substantial evidence presented to conclude that the reason for this shortage is difficulty in siting or obtaining the environmental permits necessary in order to build a new refinery
in fact there has been some evidence that suggests the reason for the thin refinery capacity is that refiners are reluctant to build new facilities since they are enjoying record profits under the current regime
later today i will be joining with our colleague the gentleman from michigan mr stupak xz4003910 in offering a substitute for the bill
the new reserve would build on the success of the strategic petroleum reserve and would provide the nation with a reserve refinery capacity that could be used in times of national emergency to increase the supply of gasoline and minimize supply disruptions and price spikes
mr speaker i am pleased to join with mr stupak xz4003910 in offering this substitute which would replace the underlying bill with two targeted provisions aimed at increasing our nation s refinery capacity and giving the federal government the tools necessary to investigate deter and punish price gouging
together these two provisions would be an effective response to problems in our gasoline market
in doing so we would build upon the success of the strategic petroleum reserve by creating a natural extension of that successful program of refinery reserve
in addition state and local governments could choose to purchase refined products from the reserve
keeping the refinery reserve operational in that fashion would ensure that there would be no lag time in it going online when needed to address a national emergency
weakening the clean air laws and providing incentives to the refinery industry as proposed in the underlying bill is not the best way to ensure new refinery construction
the truth is that the refinery owners are benefiting enormously from the current limited capacity with profits increasing 255 percent during the past year alone 255 percent of profit increase in a single year
i also believe that hurricane katrina did reveal a weakness in our energy supply systems highlighting the reliance this country has on the gulf coast for our energy resources
approximately 47 percent of the us refining capacity and 28 percent of oil production are located in the hurricaneprone region
so i think it is time for america to take steps to build more refineries and protect this country in time of natural disaster
i am pleased in a conversation with the chairman and the gentleman from florida mr stearns xz4003880 they are going to consider having a hearing on the issue and i think that is a good thing
in fact according to the department of energy if diesel vehicles made up 20 percent of our fleet in 15 years we would save 350 000 barrels of oil a day
however i want to make it clear that i have been assured by the chairman of the energy and commerce committee the gentleman from texas that section 108 of the legislation does not intend to alter or delay in any way the bush administration s on and offroad diesel rules
mr speaker i rise in strong opposition to this illconceived legislation
i guess the best thing we can say about the bill is what is not in it namely the repeal of the longstanding bipartisan moratorium on new offshore drilling
it affects businesses and families on a daily basis and i should know because my gas prices in my district are usually among the highest in the nation
this is a strategy that relies on increasing our supplies at all costs while conservation efforts are ridiculed by our vice president as signs of personal virtue this is a strategy that says if laws over the past several years we have had repeated chances to craft commonsense efficient and effective energy legislation that would set america on a more stable future but this republican congress has failed to do that and this failure is once again realized in this bill
mr speaker more than ever in the wake of the recent hurricanes congress and the american people are focused on meeting our energy needs
whether it s the rise in gas prices at the pump or the anticipation of expensive home heating bills this winter all americans are feeling the pinch
instead of only meeting our energy needs by increasing supply we need to continue to improve conservation methods and our r amp d efforts in renewable sources of energy like wind and solar power
mr speaker well the majority party is shocked shocked that price gouging took place in the wake of katrina
of course they turned a blind eye to the gouging of consumers for months and years before that by big oil working in collusion with opec
in the last 4 years the top five oil companies have made 254 billion of profits
exxonmobil in the quarter before katrina 14 billion in onequarter
producers of gas they are getting 46 percent more 47 cents a gallon refiners they are up to 250 percent in one year 70 cents a gallon
it is the same thing enron did in california to stick it to everybody on the west coast of america
the president offered last year to let valero or anybody else build a new refinery on a closed military base waiving all environmental laws and the chief operating officer of valero stock up 263 percent in one year you thought google was doing good he said why would we do that
we need real help for americans shortterm relief against price gouging take on opec in the world trade organization
just wait for the public outcry if this bill passes when people find out that refineries can be put up in their backyards with no local input and especially when they find out that these refineries profits went up 255 percent last year
the provisions in this bill are toothless at best
number two i have been saying this for the 9 years i have been in congress we need a forwardlooking energy policy that puts real teeth into conservation and renewables so that we can reduce our dependence on foreign oil
well i offered an amendment both in committee and at the committee on rules which was denied
all this amendment says is let us increase the use of renewable energy in this country
the major changes in language in the bill were revealed late last night i believe at 11 pm
we do not know whether the provisions in the energy bill passed less than 2 months ago to expedite refinery siting are working
we literally have before us a bill which is composed of scraps assembled from the waste baskets at the house legislative counsel crafted together by my republican colleagues to do something which they will have great difficulty in explaining today
the former majority leader as is custom has tried to blame democrats for all ills saying and i quote t he democrats made us drop many important issues out of the last energy bill that would have helped this situation that we have found ourselves in now and it is time to go back and revisit those i would remind the house that it was widely pointed out when that legislation was before us what a remarkable example of bipartisanship and legislative cooperation it was
if we decide to act on an expedited basis we should be focusing on immediate problems of rising gasoline prices and anticipated increases in natural gas and home heating oil prices which are coming upon us in the fall
democrats will today offer a sensible substitute that provides tough consequences for price gouging whenever it occurs in the industry not just by the little corner gas station
mr speaker i have a plane to catch in about 1 hour
mr speaker i rise today in strong opposition to the wrongly named gasoline for america s security act
in order to challenge the selection of their hometown for a new refinery
and further if the local communities lose in court they have to pay all of the industry s legal bills
mr speaker i rise in strong support of this rule and i thank my friend from miami for his superb management of this as well as the hard work he is doing upstairs as we worked late last night to ensure we could put this package together
i do not want him to actually hear this mr speaker but i want to say he has done an absolutely phenomenal job in fashioning this very important piece of legislation that is designed to increase our nation s refinery capacity
i am privileged to represent the los angeles area and we see prices in excess of 315 and 320 a gallon
obviously we have seen some relief but it is clear if we look at the history of refinery capacity it is one that has played a big role in exacerbating the cost of gasoline
since 1981 we have seen the number of refineries in the united states of america cut in half
the fact of the matter is when you have a regulatory burden which is designed to create a disincentive for the construction of refineries why would anyone in the industry consider it
now many have argued that this is a partisan bill when in fact the gentleman from texas mr barton xz4000180 has turned himself inside out to try and accommodate concerns that members of the minority have
the combination of the base text of the bill and the manager s amendment which will be in fact passed when we pass this rule we address the concerns on heating oil put forward by the very distinguished gentleman from massachusetts mr markey xz4002530 and you can go right down the line and look at a number of issues that were brought forward by members of the minority including the gentleman from illinois mr rush xz4003500 the gentleman from washington mr inslee xz4001930 the gentleman from washington mr dicks xz4001090 and others who have raised issues of concern and the gentleman from texas mr barton xz4000180 has worked diligently to address those
mr speaker i thank the gentleman for yielding me this time and i rise in strong opposition to this bill
just today in the newspaper it reported that americans can expect to spend 45 to 90 percent more on home heating fuel this year than they did last winter
we saw during hurricane katrina looters in new orleans but the real looters are the big oil companies
this bill includes provisions that preempt state and local government s authority to decide where refinery facilities are placed in individual communities
what this country critically needs but was neither in the energy policy act of 2005 which was signed into law nor in this bill is a policy to reduce our addiction to oil through the promotion of alternatives and clean renewables automotive fuel efficiency and the reduction of greenhouse gases
we must create policies that achieve these goals and we need not destroy the environment and the rights of our citizens in doing so
mr speaker i rise in opposition to the rule
i want to point out something that is in the underlying bill which authorizes the president to designate federal lands that might be suitable for the construction of an oil refinery
but they failed to place language in the bill that would protect millions of acres of other equally sensitive lands including national forests the national wildlife refuge system national conservation areas wilderness study areas the national wild and scenic river system the national trail system and the national landscape conservation system
i can not imagine why a president would want to clear the path for building a new refinery in chincoteague virginia the great bay refuge in new hampshire or in arkansas s cache river refuge
mr speaker i rise in opposition to the bill and in support of the democratic substitute
one of my predecessors pete mccloskey was a great champion in the congress on those issues and i think it is regrettable that that is where the republicans are today because if there were more that would stand up we would be able to put into place a bill that would really serve the american people well
hurricanes katrina and rita only exacerbated what has been happening to consumers in our country for the past year
in california prices climbed 1 between january and august
they rose 50 cents in a month s time between july and august with prices rising to well over 3 a gallon
i paid close to 4 a gallon in my congressional district just a week ago
consumers in other parts of the country have seen similar hikes
for refiners revenues have increased 255 percent in one year from september 2004 to september 2005
the last time i remember seeing revenue increases like this was when enron reliant and other gougers were raking in their profits during the socalled california energy crisis
it is economics not regulations that have led to the shortfall in capacity
mr speaker i rise today in opposition to hr 3893
he wrote we just broke ground on a new brick plant and should be in operation by august of 2006
i just hope gas prices do nt break us before we get the new plant in production the american people desperately need effective new energy policies but hr 3893 is simply more of the same failed giveaways to big oil
these provisions would relax existing pollution controls on thousands of industrial facilities across the country in what one energy industry official even called the most blatant attack on state and local environmental authority that he s ever seen
the substitute also creates a strategic refining capacity for the country in times of a national emergency without jeopardizing the environmental safeguards put in place by the congress to protect our air water land and public health
mr speaker i rise in strong support of the stupak substitute and in strong opposition to the underlying bill
because this underlying bill just opens that up and says if the president of the united states decides we need oil refining capacities they can puts it in your back yard
they did make an amendment at midnight last night that is still vague but says they have to following brac reuse law but that does not affect federal lands that may be in the closed base
so essentially they could parachute an oil refinery in the middle of a closed military base and it waives all of the requirements that are local zoning and all of that
fort ord california is surrounded by the national marine sanctuary and is one of the most beautiful areas in the whole united states
mr speaker my question is in the current uncertainty do you know which members the leadership from whom you are to take instruction to close the vote
i think we did a good job with the energy bill which can not provide immediate relief but will allow prices to stabilize in the future and to become more affordable over time
well there is a lot here in the us but we are nt allowed to use it that is why i support expanded oil and gas production offshore in the ocs
in the refining business historical profits are well below average that s why no one invested in expansion until recently when margins improved
it is clear that some price increases should be investigated especially given price spikes in atlanta that topped 6 after hurricane katrina
we should cover water supplies financial services clothing food and other things we need to survive in the modern world
i am particularly grateful to chairman barton for eliminating the new source review reform provisions in the committeepassed version of the bill
that language had the potential to hinder our efforts to improve air quality in houston
my constituents are extremely concerned with air pollution in our district and we are working on solutions with the help of both industry and residents
it is in the national interest for refineries not to go down and if they do to get back up quickly the department of energy is authorized to provide assistance with generation capacity water service critical employees ensure raw materials can be accessed and any other necessity
but the language in the gentleman from michigan s mr stupak xz4003910 amendment is clearer and the penalties are much stronger than those in the original bill
this is a critical issue that must be addressed to prevent price spikes like we saw in atlanta after the hurricane that drove prices to nearly 6 a gallon
mr speaker this amendment strengthens the consumer protections in the overall bill and that is why i support it and i urge my colleagues to do the same
mr speaker this is one of the two most important bills that has come before this congress maybe in the last 10 years one we passed a couple or 3 months ago
this bill is not just important to us in congress that we pass something it is not just important to companies that have to adhere to the contents of it not just to the big oil companies as they have been referred to we need them they need us we need what they can do for us but it is important to the youth of our nation
they are today in school juniors or seniors or maybe in junior college totally unaware of what we are doing here but so affected by what we do
about 64 years ago i was a senior in high school and i heard frank roosevelt at that podium right there stand up and say in a speech after our nation had been attacked to some generations much is given of some generations much is expected lt center gt lt pre gt page h8771 lt pre gt lt center gt so mr speaker of course i rise today in support of hr 3893
while the impetus for the bill arose from tragedy it opened our eyes to the vulnerability of our nation s gasoline supply and causes us to act to prevent the price spikes and shortages from happening again and everything we have said or done here on this floor is going to be in the lt em gt lt em gt congressional record for the american people to see
there has not been a new refinery built in some 25 or 30 years and the ones that are currently running are doing so at 95 percent of operating capacity and at peak times of the year even higher
the main thrust of this bill before us today encourages the building of new refineries and in more diverse locations
i have one in my district at texarkana not subject to the vicissitudes of nature or the hurricanes it is inland far enough
there are other areas in here
it will do nothing to help small refineries utilize their capacity to increase supply and encourage robust competition in the industry
it will do nothing to provide authority to the president to temporarily waive federal state and local fuel additive requirements in the event of an extreme and unusual supply circumstance caused by a natural disaster which proved to be critical in the wake of katrina and rita
mr speaker one of the things that you can say about the way in which the national republican party has handled america s energy problem is that they are being very consistent and that goes back to the first moment when they controlled both the congress and the white house when the president charged by the bush administration to develop an energy policy did the natural thing for them brought in the energy companies to tell them what kind of policy we should have
that attitude is reflected in this bill as well as the one that this congress passed last july
one corporation alone made more than 25 billion in profits in 2004
their profits in 2005 are even higher while the american people struggle to get back and forth to work because of the price of gasoline and as they will struggle this winter to heat their homes to try to stay safe and secure
lives will be lost because of the way in which the national republican party is handling this energy problem
in order to justify gasoline being sold at 3 a gallon under a free open market you would have to have oil priced at 95 a barrel
we have a market that is controlled by the oil companies for the oil companies and against the interests of the american people and all of that is conspired and entered into by the national republican party in the white house and in this congress as well
that is what we are seeing here today in the context of this legislation more for the oil companies less for americans
yet the bill could also put taxpayers on the hook for unlimited damages if a refinery is stalled in litigation or must meet new regulatory standards
the fact is that refineries are not being built in this country because the companies do not want to build them for economic reasons
and this bill will undermine local control by forcing some communities with closed military bases to accept refineries without having any input in the process
they emphasized the need for new alternative energy supplies and highlighted the role that new technologies can play in using energy more efficiently and generating it in new ways
sadly the republican bill will do nothing in this area
and one amendment that would have led to real strides in efficiency the boehlertmarkey amendment which would have increased fuel economy standards for cars and trucks to 33 miles per gallon by 2015 was not even allowed by the rules committee
your side decided to go ahead in my opinion for political purposes
in a letter that he sent today after the committee on rules reported the manager s amendment late last night the gentleman from new york mr boehlert xz4000350 wrote in a dear colleague please join me in voting no on hr 3893 which will increase the deficit harm the environment undermine the states and give charity to the oil companies while doing virtually nothing to help consumers chairman boehlert s remarks
mr speaker it is clear that this republican majority is exploiting the disruption to our nation s refining capacity caused by hurricane katrina and rita to push many of the same provisions that they could not pass in the energy policy act we passed in july
this republican bill for example would create a fund that would pay oil companies if they are sued even if they lose in court
in sharp contrast the democratic substitute sponsored by the gentleman from michigan mr stupak xz4003910 and the gentleman from virginia mr boucher xz4000430 would put some bite in the federal trade commission s bark
mr speaker i am informed by the tally clerk that every member of congress who is in town has voted
in that instance is it not appropriate once the people have spoken through their representatives in this house to bring the vote to a close
kennedy said we were going to go to the moon in 10 years this bill will not get us to cleveland
and the reason is it invests in old technology
did kennedy challenge the country to invest in propeller plane technology
here we are simply investing in oil fossil fuel technology a giveaway to the oil and gas industry of millions and billions of dollars of taxpayer money
hr 2828 will get us there with new technologies and fuelefficient cars new technologies and new productive capabilities in wind and solar and wave power and a whole slew of other things
mr speaker it goes with out saying that we are facing a serious energy crisis in this country
many factors ranging from the war in iraq to increased demand from china and india have caused the spike in prices
many americans are suffering from the high cost of gasoline which has exceeded 3 dollars a gallon in some areas
in addition as winter approaches the price of natural gas is also expected to be exceedingly high which will further increase the burden americans particularly those who fall into low income brackets will have to shoulder as they figure out how to pay for gas to get to work and electricity to heat their homes
with their devastating power katrina caused us oil and refinery operations in the gulf of mexico to shut down an estimated 1 million barrels of refining capacity
with louisiana and mississippi being such a crucial part of the us energy infrastructure these interruptions played a vital role in spiking prices
both hurricane katrina and rita should serve as flashing light that we need more refineries in this country
while this may be the case we as policy makers must go about it in smart way that gives us the capacity we need but also does not jeopardize the environment and health of the american people
in addition the bill does not provide any additional penalties for those who engage in price gouging and does not direct penalties collected back to consumers
in contrast the stupakboucher substitute list factors that the ftc must use when defining price gouging
in addition it directs penalties collected from price gougers to go towards liheap
finally the bill builds on the proven success of the strategic petroleum reserve by requiring the federal government to operate strategic refinery reserve to ensure adequate supply of refined products in emergency situations
in essence the provision would authorize and direct the secretary of energy to establish a program at historically black universities hispanic serving institutions and community colleges to encourage minority students to study the earth and other sciences and enter the field of geology in order to qualify for employment in the oil gas and mineral industries
as we continue to deal with the energy crises we are facing we need qualified individuals in the fields who can assist with providing new information as to the location of reserves

the twelve top producers of african american baccalaureates in the physical sciences including 1 xavier university of louisiana were all hbcu s
while hispanic serving institutions his s have also produced great leaders in this country according to the hispanic association of colleges and universities hispanics are historically underrepresented in the areas of science
the gasoline security act as reported by the committee on energy and commerce includes language that takes away states rights to have state decisions on clean water act permits and water quality related to the placement of refineries and pipelines decided in state courts
instead the gasoline security act overturns 33 years of successful statefederal partnership and forces states to defend their actions in the us court of appeals for the district of columbia
in the absence of this provision challenges to state decisions would be brought in state courts as they always have
i offered an amendment that would have prevented this dilution unfortunately it was not make in order
section 401 of the clean water act requires that before any federal permit or license is issued that could result in a discharge into the state s waters the state in which the discharge would occur must issue a certification that the proposed activity is consistent with the state s water quality standards
this authority is the states ability to ensure a role in federallypermitted activity within the state s borders
the provisions contained in both the refinery and pipeline titles of the gasoline security act are modeled on a similar provision in the recently enacted energy policy act
this language was inserted in response to a specific case in connecticut where the business community wanted to construct a pipeline over state and public objections
the proponents of the pipeline believe that federal courts will be less deferential to connecticut s position in denying the water quality certification
in fact less than two hours after president bush signed the energy policy act islander east pipeline co
i urge my colleagues and members of the rules committee to help stop the trampling of the states rights to defend the quality of the environment and public health by making in order my amendment to modify these provisions from hr 3893
mr speaker the spike in gasoline prices after hurricanes katrina and rita has drawn national attention to domestic energy supplies as well as fuel efficiency standards
hurricanes katrina and rita devastated much of the energy infrastructure in the gulf of mexico
i urge my colleagues to join me in voting against passage of the energy bill
mr speaker it is very clear when we look at what has happened in the last few years where we have had a number of mergers of oil companies the top five oil companies i believe now dominate more than a third of the market
that puts us in a position where we sacrifice not only the standard of living of many americans to the oil companies but now we are sacrificing the environment itself
i think that many americans are already aware that one of the reasons that we are in iraq is because of oil
oil is costing us peace in the world
sunlight is a disinfectant in many ways but it is also a powerful energy source
we need wind power we need geothermal we need to tap all available technologies to take us in a new direction where the globe itself is not at stake
what a disgrace it is that we put the lives and the existence of the gwitchin indians in alaska at risk for more oil
dear representative on friday october 7 the house will consider hr 3893 the gasoline for america s security gas act of 2005 this bill takes the approach that environmental laws must be weakened in order to encourage the us refining industry to expand or construct new refining capacity
the facts clearly show that not only are current environmental laws in place at a time when the refining industry is experiencing record profits but that recent fundamental changes to the refining industry namely recent mergers have created financial incentives for refineries to encourage tight supplies
in 1993 the 5 largest us oil refining companies controlled 345 percent of domestic oil refinery capacity the top 10 companies controlled 556 percent
this dramatic increase in the control of just the top 5 companies makes it easier for oil companies to manipulate gasoline prices
the proof is in the numbers
in 1999 us oil refiners made 228 cents for every gallon of gasoline refined from crude oil
and the washington post noted that those profit margins have soared even higher in 2005 to 99 cents on each gallon sold for a more than 300 percent increase since 1999
since 2001 the largest 5 oil refiners in america have recorded 228 billion in profits
they have no interest in creating surplus capacity because that will erode their profit margins
in march 2001 ftc concluded in its midwest gasoline price investigation
and a may 2004 us government accountability office report agreed with public citizen that recent mergers in the oil industry have directly led to higher prices
it is important to note however that this gao report severely underestimates the impact mergers have on prices because their price analysis stops in 2000 long before the mergers that created chevrontexaco conocophillips and valeroultramardiamond shamrockpremcor
mr speaker i rise today in opposition to hr 3893 which pretends to be a response to our nation s exorbitant energy costs but which is actually a giveaway to oil and gas companies that does nt help america s struggling consumers
in fact many of the provisions in this legislation are not new we have seen them before but they have proven so controversial that they were excluded from the energy bill that congress passed earlier this year
rhode islanders are paying an average of 286 for a gallon of gasoline and high home heating oil and natural gas prices are causing families to wonder how they will be able to afford to stay warm in the coming winter months
in recent weeks rhode islanders have learned of two utility rate increases for both electricity and gas
these proposed increases come at a time when the average price of gasoline at the pump is up 51 percent compared with last year and home heating oil is up 57 percent in the same period
congress must take swift action to reduce the cost of energy but this bill benefits only the oil and gas industries which have been reaping record profits in recent months
we have heard legitimate questions about how much of the recent increase in energy costs is the result of price fixing yet this legislation s provisions to combat price gouging are insufficient and amount to no more than a slap on the wrist
in fact one of the bill s original provisions expanding loopholes for refineries and power plants to avoid compliance with the clean air act was deemed so controversial that it was removed in the dead of night
additionally the democratic plan would create a strategic refinery reserve which like the strategic petroleum reserve would improve our nation s ability to prevent oil and gasoline shortages in the wake of a natural disaster such as a hurricane
mr speaker i rise today in opposition to the gasoline for america s security act and in strong support for the substitute offered by the gentleman from michigan mr stupak and the gentleman from virginia mr boucher
the energy information administration eia estimates that in the upcoming winter homeowners in the northeast can expect to pay almost 30 percent more to heat their homes
american families will pay hundreds if not thousands more in extra energy costs this year
yet in the name of hurricane katrina the house majority leadership is pushing a bill that does nothing to reduce our dependence on oil lower gas prices or help americans get through the upcoming winter
we need to bring some real transparency into the oil industry and shine the brightest possible light on how these companies making billions in record profits are squeezing every possible dollar out of the american people
i was honored to join the gentlewoman from new york mrs slaughter in offering an amendment that would have ended the practice of wholesale price discrimination by prohibiting oil companies from restricting the source of a dealer s supply of gasoline
unfortunately as they do time and again the majority rejected these excellent amendments in favor of pushing a bill that will do nothing for americans paying high energy costs
i rise in strong opposition to this very restrictive rule
now we are all touched by the magnitude of the devastation caused by hurricane katrina and hurricane rita in the gulf coast
but as in any catastrophe there is always somebody waiting in the wings to make a profit off the human misery and suffering
we just gave them over 128 billion in subsidies and tax breaks 2 months ago and now they are back asking for more help
despite a recent survey indicating that 86 percent 86 percent of americans favor an increase in fuel economy standards the committee on rules prevented prevented consideration of the boehlertmarkey amendment which would do just that
the fact that gas prices shot up in the wake of this monstrous hurricane is a reflection of the reality that we do not have the capability to meet the sort of refining needs the country has that will put the kind of pressure on gas prices that are so important to our consuming public
in the last year i met on several occasions with adel aljubeir a representative of the country of saudi arabia
you have not built a refinery in three generations
mr speaker i rise today in strong opposition to hr 3893 the gasoline for america s security act of 2005
it is a set of giveaways to big oil and to big gas while simultaneously out here on the floor the last two speakers are calling for a gutting of environmental laws and cutting of medicaid and other social programs for the poorest people in our country as a response to hurricanes katrina and rita
this republican party is so out of touch that it believes that the oil and gas industries the wealthiest industries in our country the industries that are tipping american consumers upsidedown and shaking money out of their pockets is the first bill they should bring to the floor to respond to hurricane katrina even after 10 years of a conscious conspiracy on the part of the oil industry to shut down 30 refineries voluntarily
in a series of memos 10 years ago the oil industry said that we have too much refining capacity in our country
we must shut it down if we want to charge the consumers in our country more money
we are here because this party believes that an energy policy is the president holding the hand of a saudi prince and taking him in for a barbecue at crawford that it can substitute for the kind of plan which president kennedy had in 1961 when the soviets were challenging our supremacy in outer space
mr speaker the republican party is in violation of the first law of holes when you are in one stop digging
i rise in opposition to the rule providing for consideration of hr 3893 the gasoline for america s security act of 2005 let me begin by saying that i ve been in congress for 29 years now and this is absolutely the worst energy bill that i ve seen in the last eight weeks
it makes only one substitute in order and it bars the amendment filed by the gentleman from new york mr boehlert myself and the gentlelady from california ms eshoo to mandate new fuel efficiency standards for cars and suvs
this amendment was identical to one that i offered in the energy and commerce committee and it is unconscionable that at a time when gas prices are over 300 a gallon nationwide that the republican leadership of this house would deny the members an opportunity to debate the issue of whether or not to increase cafe standards
the last energy bill that president bush signed into law way back in august was praised by the chairman of the energy and commerce committee who said its boutique fuels provisions would make it more efficient to use our boutique fuels by reducing the number of these fuels so that we have greater transportability of our boutique fuels between those regions of the country that need those fuel sources eight weeks later we are about to take up a bill that repeals those boutique fuels provisions and replaces them with a completely new boutique fuels statute
when the last republican energy bill was on the house floor in july the speaker of the house said it promotes greater refinery capacity so more gasoline will be on the market and it increases gasoline supply by putting an end to the proliferation of boutique fuels eight weeks later this house is about to repeal the refinery provisions the speaker praised and replace with a whole new refinery bill
this bill is based on a false premise the premise that somehow our nation s environmental laws stand in the way of building more refineries around the country
twentyone of the 30 refineries that the refiners voluntarily closed or 78 of the shut down refinery capacity were located in states that are not on the gulf coast and therefore would not have been affected by hurricanes katrina or rita
nine of the top 10 producing refineries that were shut down were located outside the gulf coast including 3 in illinois one in kansas one in michigan 2 in california and 1 in washington
the one new refinery permit application that was submitted out in arizona was approved by the epa in less than a year
during the last decade there was a wave of mergers in the refinery industry
oil industry documents from the mid1990s suggest that at that time major players sought to shut down refineries in order to decrease supply and thereby drive up prices
consider this a 1996 chevron internal memo stated that a senior energy analyst at the recent api american petroleum institute convention warned that if the us petroleum industry does nt reduce its refining capacity it will never see any substantial increase in refinery margins a march 1996 memo from texaco discussed concerns that the most critical factor facing the refining industry on the west coast is the surplus of refining capacity and the surplus gasoline production capacity
this results in very poor refinery margins and very poor refinery financial results
significant events need to occur to assist in reducing supplies andor demand for gasoline it seems clear that the oil industry in closing 30 refineries over the course of the last decade was pursuing a deliberate business profitmaximization strategy aimed at addressing the oil industry s problem of low profit margins in refinery operations
according to a recent article in the washington post there s been a 255 percent average increase in refiner profit margins over the last two years
now all of that is great news if you are a shareholder in any of the big companies
is it going to mandate an increase in fuel efficiency standards for cars and suvs so we can begin reducing consumer demand
is it going to promote investment in and deployment of solar and wind energy technologies that could be an alternative to natural gas
in reality it should be called the leave no oil company behind act this is a terrible bill
we can not begin to discuss how we are going to reduce our dependence upon imported oil unless we debate increasing the fuel economy standards for automobiles and suvs in the united states
the gentleman from new york mr boehlert xz4000350 and i have made this amendment for 4 years in a row
in fact if the state or city sues and loses they must pay the legal bills of exxonmobil
we should be debating a futuristic innovative energy strategy to cut in half our dependence upon imported oil to use automotive technologies to use solar and wind to quadruple our expenditures to surpass the world to be number one looking over our shoulders at number two and three in the world to do what president kennedy did in responding to the sputnik challenge of the soviet union
instead our industry that engaged in a conspiracy to shut down 30 refineries in the last 10 years is now coming here and asking us to waive the clean air act as the answer to their irresponsible actions
mr speaker i rise in opposition to this bill
they call on jihadists everywhere to attack not just people but also oil wells and pipelines arguing that the killing of 10 american soldiers is nothing compared to the impact of the rise in oil prices on america and the disruption that it causes in the international economy the decisions being made today by the republicancontrolled congress are handicapping our nation at the starting line
the only solution the republican leadership in congress has to offer up to our current energy problems is giving oil companies more giveaways and more exemptions from environmental laws
they ve just passed a resolution in the european parliament to increase that target up to 25 percent
a major factor making this rapid growth possible is the significant investments european governments have made in r amp d
in 5 years time we see china as a world leader in this department
already 35million homes in china get their hot water from solar collectors
how do we expect to keep up let alone lead in these emerging innovative energy technology markets if we starve our r amp d sector and refuse to set bold goals that stimulate creativity and achievement
americans know in their bones that we need to do more that we are lagging behind in this race
today we can not afford to walk away from the challenge to lead the world in the future of energy technology
in 1961 president kennedy announced a goal of sending a man to the moon and returning him safely to earth
instead of the bill before us now we should be bringing a bill to the floor of this house which would adopt a national policy of cutting our dependence on imported oil in half within the next decade
launch a manhattan project scale r amp d initiative that is twice the size of comparable programs in the european union japan and china combined
the us is the technological engine of the world and we must lead the innovation in wind solar energy and new fuel sources
if the democrats were in charge of this house we would be challenging america to establish a national oil savings goal drive the future of the energy industry and revolutionize our domestic use of fuels
mr speaker i rise in support of the amendment offered by the gentleman from michigan mr stupak xz4003910 and the gentleman from virginia mr boucher xz4000430
the bill before us today proposes to gut the clean air act in order to promote construction of more refineries
it is predicated upon the false premise that somehow our nation s environmental laws somehow stand in the way of the oil companies attempts to build new refineries
they ve ordered 1 new refinery and that one got its permit through the epa in 9 months
has the majority lost confidence in its own new law
why would we allow the epa to extend deadlines for cleaning up ozone pollution in some cases until 2015 without imposing any of the additional cleanup requirements mandated under current law
mr speaker i observe that we are operating in a 5minute vote and we are now nearing 20 minutes for this vote to have been completed
mr speaker where does the point at which at the discretion of the chair is no longer being used for the convenience of the members but instead in order to abuse the discretion that the chair has in keeping
it is unacceptable for anybody in this congress to say we can not do anything about the shortterm crisis of high energy costs
i have senior citizens in my district and low and moderateincome families who are scared out of their minds about how they will heat their homes this winter
we must crack down on price gouging in the short term and find other ways to lower prices
in the long term we should reduce our reliance on foreign oil by aggressively pursuing renewable energy sources something that we should have been doing a long time ago
what we have here in this socalled gas act is more of the same tax breaks to reward the bad behavior of oil and gas companies reduced regulations that compromise our communities and nothing absolutely nothing for the relief of our citizens
let me say to my colleagues who vote for this do not go home and tell their constituents that they did anything for them because in truth they have not
mr chairman as you know the high energy costs are having a very negative effect on the low income home energy assistance program and many state liheap programs are expecting a major increase in applications and need for additional funding immediately to help ensure lowincome families and seniors can afford to heat their homes
i recently joined with more than 100 of my colleagues in writing to the committee on appropriations members requesting 1276 billion in additional liheap funding and i hope mr chairman that you would work with me and other members who share those concerns to make sure this very important assistance program will be available to those who need it in the upcoming winter heating season
mr speaker i rise in opposition to this rule and this legislation
today we have the opportunity to lead and help the people of this country in a genuine and lasting manner
confirmation of this criticism is contained in today s rule
to allow a refurbished utility to emit at its old potential levels could permit an almost twofold increase in emissions
similarly a powerplant could increase emissions in one of these nonattainment areas and neither have to demonstrate air quality impacts nor be required to offset these increases of emissions as they are required to do under existing law
lt p gt beyond making it easier and cheaper to increase refining capacity and to prosecute for price gouging what does this legislation do to wean our dependency from oil and from a growing worldwide shortage in oil
in fact this rule blocks us from even considering what is clearly one greatest opportunities to reduce the country s dependence of imported oil
you would think that in light of world events and the vulnerabilities hurricane katrina and rita illuminated we would have a different bill
world oil supplies have tightened the price of oil has shot up to over 60 a barrel and many of our foreign sources of oil the middle east in particular but africa and venezuela as well have grown even less stable
this bill while better than what was approved by the energy and commerce last week is woefully deficient and heads our country in the wrong direction
we have increased population and we want more manufacturers to remain in the united states
we have to have the carpooling measures in this bill
the gasoline for america s security act builds on the energy policy act of 2005 and keeps us moving in the right direction
the other side says repeatedly it is not in there but it does
but the american people understand you can not drive a car with politics in your tank or heat a home with politics
first of all with regard to the amendment let us understand what is in there
if there is concern for giving large amounts of money to oil companies what they propose we do is that the federal government gets in the business of quote designing and constructing refineries and then put that into use at times in their national emergencies or sell gas to states which this bill actually allows states and governments to have some of this gasoline now but for the government to own and operate refineries and invest all the money in there
in the alternative if we can provide incentives for private industries to build whether it is something small or large refineries that makes a lot more sense
what happens now with a coalfired power plant for example if they want to go in and do some routine maintenance and while they are in there maybe improve the efficiency of the plant the epa comes by and says no you are going to do something different here
what they have done instead of using the abundant supply of coal we have 300 years worth of coal in this nation they will move to natural gas instead in order to meet some of those standards
natural gas means we have more demand the costs go up it affects homeowners in the price of heating their homes and it affects our chemical industry
the unions for jobs and the environment have sent a letter and i will submit this letter as well for the record which states the efficiency and competitiveness of our facilities and the safety of our workers hang in the balance
like the act does in section 106 a we have encouraged the environmental protection agency epa to clarify the program as soon as possible
the efficiency and competitiveness of our facilities and the safety of our workers hang in the balance
we support nsr in that context
however when nsr is applied in an unclear or inflexible manner to existing facilities very different results occur
in those cases facilities are discouraged from undertaking appropriate actions for fear of huge penalties long delays or both
by applying nsr in that way our members will not have the opportunity to work on projects that we know are extremely important to energy efficiency
the result is that some of the almost 20 million manufacturing jobs at stake in heavy industry are placed at risk
boilers operate under high temperatures and pressures with superheater tubes exposed to flue gases at temperatures as high as 2 000 degrees and pressure around 3 000 lbssquare inch and must be maintained in order to be safe for workers section 106 a and b ensure the orderly and timely implementation of nsr clarification
the amazing thing to me when i was listening to the republicans in the last hour is when they were trying to make the analogy to their households and talking about their kids
and one of the republican members talked about how he went down to the candy store and you could only spend what was in your pocket and that is what we want to do here
i remember when i first came down in 1988 there were a group of republicans who would come down and do special orders every night and they had the pages come out with this digital clock that really was the length of this dais here and every night they would talk about the deficit and how they wanted to cut the deficit and the deficit was climbing too high
by contrast the house democratic budget achieved balance in 2012
but president bush comes in and he is elected and he says the answer to the economy is we are going to cut taxes
the economy has little to show for the 860 billion in tax cuts under president bush
and they come to the conclusion in this report i just want to read this one section it says almost every broad measure of economic activity gross domestic product jobs personal income and business investment among others has fared worse over the last 4 years than in the past cycles
proponents of this series of major tax cuts since 2001 have projected that gauges such as these would reflect improvements after enactment in fact the opposite has occurred
so where this republican philosophy has just created a dynamic that has really ruined the economy it is not completely ruined we are getting along but by every economic indicator things were better in the last few years of the clinton administration
i would venture to say that the republican fiscal policy is really stupid for everyone because the bottom line is that in the last few years of the clinton administration when we had a surplus and we were balancing the budget everybody was getting richer
you are doing better than the rest of the guys because the rest of the guys are suffering but the irony of it is in the last few years of the clinton administration the economy was booming so much that everybody was doing better
i do not even care if i were the wealthiest person in the world i do not see how i benefit under this administration ultimately because if the economy does not grow the way it did in the boom years of the clinton administration nobody benefits
as my colleague from massachusetts was saying the irony of it is they are increasing the deficit in order to give more tax breaks for the rich and for the corporate interests
none of the war reconstruction in iraq is paid for and if you look at these charts as you were saying you can see that the very cuts that are being proposed in programs here in the united states in many cases money is being spent in iraq deficit spending to do the same things in iraq that are being cut here
i do not want to go through the whole thing but if you look at health care 10 billion in medicaid cuts are proposed by this republican budget 252 million in cuts for health care professionals 94 million in cuts to community health clinics in the us in iraq we get 110 primary health care centers built or renovated 2 000 health educators trained 32 million children vaccinated
it sounded like he was doing a reconstruction program like in iraq or the marshall plan after world war ii
now they are proposing cuts in all of the programs that would actually benefit people
the republican budget would cut 9 billion in student loans 806 million from no child left behind
on the other hand in iraq they rehabilitated 2 717 schools and 36 000 teachers and administrators were trained
in the us the republican budget has a 200 million cut in clean water state revolving funds and opens anwr to oil drilling
in iraq we spend 1 billion for safe drinking water 4 million for marshland restoration
it is just really americans versus iraqis and i am not saying that we should not help the iraqis in some way
in the us under the republican budget 336 million is cut from the army corps of engineers including funding for the levee construction in louisiana
in iraq we are rehabilitating the canal system including repairs to levees and rebuilding the iraq railway line
the gentleman from ohio mr ryan xz4003521 talked about prevention before in the context of health care
we talk about prevention in terms of health care by eliminating community health centers people go to emergency centers and it costs more
an argument could be made if we did not cut funding for the levees in louisiana we may not even have had the crisis there
mr speaker the budget bill that they want us to vote on the one we were supposed to vote on last week cuts funding for levees again not necessarily the one in new orleans but other levees in louisiana
this is not the same one that fell in new orleans
it was in september of the year after
they had these book bags that were in blue and they had emblazoned on them the seal of the united states with the eagle
i had just come back from approximately the first day of school here in the us and i had just been to a teacher event at one of my local schools and the teachers were complaining that the pencils and paper were not provided there and they had to actually go out the teachers and buy pencils and paper and pads and crayons for the children because they were not provided at our public school in my district
the pride that was on the faces of my republican colleagues for all the wonderful things we were doing in iraq and i kept saying that was very nice but we do not have those things here in my district
mr speaker if the gentleman will continue to yield one of the things that the 30something group has been talking about and it relates directly to what he said is this idea that there should be a bipartisan commission in the aftermath of hurricane katrina
mr speaker i rise in strong opposition to the republican energy bill
winter is around the corner and so are skyrocketing increases in home heating costs
families who heat with natural gas could see their fuel costs increase more than 70 percent in some parts of the country
yet for the second time in 1 month the republicans have brought a bill to the floor that fails to address price gouging fails to bring down prices and fails to put us on the road to energy independence
the republicans in this culture of corruption and cronyism came down on the side of greed
this bill includes all the special favors to the energy industry that were too extreme to be included in the energy bill passed by congress less than 3 months ago
in fact the gentleman from michigan mr stupak xz4003910 has that very bill
we have an enormous untapped potential in the area of energy efficiency and renewable energy
by implementing existing technologies and developing new ones in every sector of the economy and american life we can take a giant step toward energy independence
mr speaker my parliamentary inquiry is is it not bringing dishonor to the house of representatives for this body to act in the shameful way that it is
mr speaker i rise in support of the rule and the underlying bill and commend chairman barton for his exceptional and timely work on this legislation
for what began as a hurricane of nature very quickly became a hurricane of spending here on capitol hill 60 billion appropriated in 6 days paid for by simply adding to the national debt
now some of us thought we should pay for the big cost of hurricane katrina by cutting big government and this week with the leadership of president george w bush and the leadership of the republican majority in congress we are beginning to do just that
and while the details take shape that would save tens of billions of dollars through an acrosstheboard spending cut through additional entitlement savings through a presidential recision package the first time in this administration by reopening the budget act with a budget act amendment the first time congress has done that since 1977 and by ending nearly 100 outdated federal programs we are beginning that process as well
with more hurricane spending right around the corner i rise humbly to challenge my colleagues in the house and mr speaker i rise to challenge my colleagues in the united states senate to be strong and courageous and do the work
let us have the courage to make the tough choices to find the means to pay for the cost of hurricane katrina and its aftermath through reductions in government spending
i rise after listening to the last two or three speakers because we are short of energy in this country because we have locked up our energy
we are short of energy in this country because we have built no refineries to process the oil that we purchase now from third world countries
this winter home heating oil is going to be in very short supply
in some markets it will be way higher than others because it is not an even distribution system
but natural gas is the one thing that we have to deal with this fall in my view because natural gas has not doubled it is 700 percent more
it is the one we have where we can be totally selfsufficient in this country on the clean fuel natural gas that fuels our industry heats our homes heats our schools heats our hospitals
mr speaker i rise in opposition to the stupak substitute and in support of the underlying legislation
we have seen this year that we have passed comprehensive energy legislation but that legislation did not address really the linchpin of the need in our country for greater refining capacity and greater pipeline security redundancy and reliability
katrina exposed that fundamental weakness in our nation s energy security and in our nation s economic security
and much of that reason is that the cost of doing business a refinery investment in this country is so much higher than offshore
if we can streamline the regulatory process give new incentives so that companies will invest in our country and new pipeline security and redundancy and reliability as well as a new refining capacity then we can do something about high gas prices and the disruptions that occur in a natural disaster like katrina
it has been exposed with katrina and the other side reminds me of those who when a barn is burning and the fire truck is wanting to come and put the fire out and do something about it they stand in the way and block the road and then want to blame the fire department for failing to put the fire out
the chairman of the committee has shown remarkable speed in getting this legislation to the floor
you can not regulate and put hurdles and tell the oil industry that is really global these days that you can not build refining capacity in america
they understood that you can not concentrate our refineries in one place and that you have to have more capacity
i tell you i have working families in my district that pull up to that pump and talk about mortgaging their house in order to get it completely full
this is the responsible thing to do moving this country forward and putting us in a place where we are not foreigndependent and we have the ability to lower the prices and give stable prices in the future in this great country
this legislation builds on progress we had in the energy bill dealing with boutique fuels but what i want to do is explain the problem we have with boutique gasoline blends in america
mr speaker we can have cheap gas and clean gas at the same time in this country
unfortunately we are missing a couple of our standardbearers who are usually here our two members from florida the gentleman from florida mr meek xz4002700 and the gentlewoman from florida ms wasserman schultz who are down dealing with the hurricane and the storm down in florida
i would also like to say hello briefly mr speaker not only to those citizens of florida but some friends of mine who are paying attention to what is happening here tonight and good friends of mine who are back in ohio now bill and molly gales who are watching us paying attention trying to understand some of the issues of the day and i would like to give a shout out mr speaker
and i want the american people to understand this the democrats do not have any power in this chamber
they control every legislative and executive branch of government in the united states of america right now federal government
i would like to say my friends on the other side who were talking about saving money and controlling the deficits that are projected as far as the eye can see 500 billion i would like to say to our friends mr speaker go to wwwthomasgov and you can get the votes for two particular votes that i think the american people and members of this chamber would be interested in
go check out hr 1 this is wwwthomasgov hr 1 in the 108th congress
do not come in and mislead the american people
hr 1 in the 108th congress was the prescription drug bill which we were lied to about the original price was supposed to be 400 billion
then go in the 109th congress thomasgov hr 3893 our energy bill
our friends that are so concerned with reining in spending the republican house passed a bill that has given billions of dollars to the oil companies and bp s profits today came out 34 percent higher this quarter
you try to dust off the rhetoric from the 1980s and put it in today s society and it just does not work because it just does not make any sense
our friends the republican majority that started out with this big republican revolution that i think has ended up in a republican devolution would not pass the paygo rules
i am not afraid to stand up and say i am going to ask bill gates to pay a little more in taxes
i do not think that is a bold political move but the wealthiest people are the only ones in this country who have not been asked to sacrifice in some way to pay for the two or three wars that we have going on and the greatest natural and national disaster this country has ever seen
mr speaker if the gentleman would yield briefly i just want to share a thirdparty validator that we have as we continue talking about welfare in the united states and what it is being spent on
cal thomas as most of you may know is one of the conservative columnists in the country
in his column this week he says seventytwo percent of farm subsidy money goes to 10 percent of recipients the richest farmers partnerships corporations estates and other entities cal thomas thirdparty validator says too much money going to the big farmers and this is a big welfare state
start with the rich cal thomas one of the top conservatives in the country is telling the republican congress the republican senate and the republican president start cutting the welfare programs for the richest people in this country
we have been pinned into a corner in this country where the people down in new orleans and those people who do not have and the middle class are somehow to be blamed for our huge deficits when 72 percent of ag money ag subsidies are going to the top 10 percent of the farmers
the money that is getting cut and we understand that reform needs to take place and our friends on the other side have not been willing to do it but to cut 94 million in community health care and community health centers that is preventative medicine
that investment is ultimately going to save our country money and save our health care system money because those people who will not have access to the community health care centers will end up in an emergency room a week or two later
instead of going to the community health center with a cold they are going to go to the emergency room in downtown youngstown or east hartford connecticut or wherever they are living and they are going to walk in with pneumonia and it is going to cost the taxpayer more money
basically what we are trying to say is that the republican majority in the house and the senate are not only spending american hardworking taxpayer dollars to subsidize the most profitable industries in the country the oil industry the pharmaceutical industry and the top agricultural the megafarms
not only have they provided a welfare state for iraq where we are not going to loan them the money and get the money back welfare to corporations welfare to iraq and then we are cutting the programs that just may lead to economic growth in the united states
when i was in china i went to shanghai
it is the only one in the world
why is that in shanghai and not in the united states of america
loans to graduate students 840 million in cuts eliminate the national science foundation math and science program grants
and tuition is going to double in 5 years
and to make cuts in programs that would invest in the american people and lead to economic growth instead of listening to cal thomas who says cut for the richest people who are getting corporate welfare they do that because they could then raise money for their party
mr speaker reclaiming my time that is another example of the extreme republican majority in this house choosing their party over the country
but to not give the democrats subpoena power to try to fix the problem because they hired all of their cronies in the top 8 or 10 positions in fema is again what is best for their party not what necessarily is best for the country
and the democrats are providing time and time again in committee on the floor with amendments with ideas whether it is lend the money whether it is reduce the cost for prescription drugs whether it is strip the billions of dollars in subsidies that went to the oil companies the democrats have always provided an alternative a change to take the country in another direction
mr speaker i rise in strong opposition to this bill and in support of the stupakboucher substitute
the federal energy information agency predicted that the price of natural gas would increase by 71 percent in the midwest this winter
in chicago the average heating bill is predicted to be 1 475 per household
yet instead of addressing an impending heating crisis and protecting consumers this bill is filled with giveaways to the same energy companies that are making record profits in the aftermath of the hurricanes
even though natural gas prices are four times what they were in 2001 there is no mention of natural gas in the price gouging section of this bill
in illinois to qualify for the low income home energy assistance program a family of four must earn under 29 000 a year under that
members in this body are faced with a choice representing consumers and small businesses or big oil companies
we should not leave the american people in the cold this winter while energy companies are left with money to burn
we built our last refinery in this country and i graduated from high school
coal to liquid fisher trove technology developed during world war ii is evident in production in south africa today
what we have done in this bill is we have taken the definition of refinery and added coal to liquid which means we can harvest the great coal reserves of this country
we are also able to disburse our refinery assets around the country so we are not held hostage by having 47 percent of our refineries in hurricane alley
this bill is a tremendous step forward in decreasing our reliance on foreign oil new technology diversifying our refinery portfolio and i ask all of my colleagues to join me in support of this legislation
i want to speak on an issue they do not address in fact i think they roll back which i think is critical to addressing the price spike and that is boutique fuels
when i fly back home i fill up in st
i fill up my vehicle in st
louis and then i drive across the river to my hometown in collinsville which is 30 minutes from the st
in other words the unleaded gas i burn in st
louis is not allowed to be purchased and bought in illinois and it is not allowed to be purchased and sold in springfield even though i am burning that fuel and driving back and forth
what makes it more difficult is that when you have constrained refinery capacity and you have one refinery producing for one area of the country when that refinery has a disruption or goes down then there is no way you can get fuel in there unless you waive environmental regulations which is what the bill allows us to do if there is a natural disaster or hurricane
motorists in missouri and across the nation are paying a premium for gasoline and diesel fuel especially in the wake of severe weather in the gulf of mexico
missouri s fourth congressional district is primarily rural and residents rely heavily on transportation in going about their daily lives
in order to make sure consumers are being treated fairly the federal trade commission and the justice department should be given explicit authority to investigate collusion and price gouging within the oil industry
it will not lower their energy prices and it puts in place weak price gouging standards
people are struggling to be able to afford to drive to work in the morning and families are wondering how they are going to pay to heat their homes this winter
this energy bill written in the midst of what is threatening to become the worst energy crisis the country has ever experienced does nothing to help reduce the price of gasoline
that is not me talking the chairman of the house committee on energy and commerce the gentleman from texas mr barton xz4000180 admitted this very fact in the committee on rules yesterday
he told us without taking command and control measures this congress can not do anything in the short term to lower gas prices even if the bill is passed and he wrote the bill
there are things that this congress can do to help our fellow americans in this time of crisis
i know because we debated many of those measures in the committee on rules just last night
in fact of the 18 democratic amendments offered only one was allowed
since the gas act will not address the needs of the people either now or in the years ahead what will it do
edward murphy a refinery specialist with the american petroleum institute told the washington post just yesterday there is not a shortage of capacity in america because capacity is a global issue
in almost 30 years no oil company has applied to build one
in fact since 2001 4 years ago the top five oil companies in the united states have recorded combined profits
that is more money than we have spent on the war in iraq and it is split between just five companies
this is not the only way in which the republicans are standing up today for the corporations who need help the least
so if exxon wants to build a refinery in your backyard or near your child s school and you and the local community want to oppose it it means you very well may have the pleasure of paying exxon s legal fees for trying to protect your community
mr speaker today i rise in opposition to the antipublic health anticonsumer gas act the legislation is an insult to the american public which needs real relief but this is an attack on our public health and it is a giveaway to corporate america
their interests will harm in my opinion 55 million latinos that live within 10 miles of coalpowered plants and the 68 percent of all african americans that live within 30 miles of a coalpowered plant
these changes will increase the risk of disease to schoolchildren in texas who are exposed right now to 434 million tons of toxic pollutants in just 1 year because of almost 140 nearby industrial facilities
these changes will increase the risk of disease to over 207 000 children who go to schools within a 2mile radius of a chemical plant or refinery in texas
these changes will not help construct new refineries or guarantee an increase in refinery capacity and will do nothing to lower the cost of gasoline
the local air pollution program and control officers the south coast air quality management district the american lung association and many others are in opposition to this bill
i will support the democratic alternative which protects public health protects consumers and secures our refineries in times of emergency
i urge my colleagues to join me in opposition
mr speaker i rise in strong opposition to hr 3893 the socalled gasoline for america s security act of 2005
in the name of helping the economy it decimates environmental laws and eliminates the ability of state and local governments to decide what s best for them
it is so environmentally reckless that one has to wonder if republicans think that they in addition to being exempt from our ethics rules breathe different air than the rest of us
the reason that the cost of refining has increased is because oil companies voluntarily closed 30 refineries in the late eighties and early nineties to increase their profit margins
it would allow the president to place new refineries in national forests wildlife refuges and closed military bases
the military base in my district would probably be an appealing target for this president
mr speaker let me say to all my colleagues that are concerned about this bill within the bill is a gas price gouging prevention portion the gas price gouging prevention act my amendment that was approved in committee
included in the manager s amendment it will for the first time direct the federal trade commission to define price gouging and prosecute it as an unfair and deceptive trade practice
it will direct federal trade commission expertise and resources in addition to existing state antigouging laws on eliminating retail and wholesale price gouging in a designated disaster area as well as any extended problem in the areas around the country as determined by the president and the secretary of energy
penalties include fines up to 11 000 for violation in addition to equitable remedies like returning illgotten profits
the amendment prohibits price gouging in the market for crude oil home heating oil gasoline and diesel fuel
for the first time in this country we are going to define it
the bill is triggered for 30 days in the affected area not just 1 or 2 weeks but 30 days and beyond if the president of the united states in consultation with the secretary of energy deems it to be appropriate
the amendment prohibits price gouging in the market for crude oil home heating oil gasoline and diesel fuel
it is difficult to define price gouging the existing state statutes in this area have vastly different definitions and interpretations
therefore the amendment directs the ftc to define price gouging within 6 months of enactment consistent with the requirements for declaring unfair acts or practices in section 5 of the ftc act
the bill is triggered for 30 days in the affected areas and beyond if the president in consultation with the secretary of energy deems it to be appropriate when the president declares a major disaster and only for those major disasters that the secretary has determined could significantly affect production distribution or supply
in addition the issue of price gouging must be addressed
unfortunately the tremendous goodwill of the american people in helping their fellow citizens on the devastated gulf coast was marred by some now infamous instances of gasoline price gouging
experts say the rapid rise in gasoline and diesel fuel prices nationwide following these natural disasters primarily resulted from a supply crisis
my amendment the gas price gouging prevention act which is included in the manager s amendment will for the first time direct the federal trade commission to define price gouging and prosecute it as an unfair and deceptive trade practice
the gas gouging prevention act will direct ftc expertise and resources in addition to existing state antigouging laws on eliminating retail and wholesale price gouging in a designated disaster area as well as any extended problem areas around the country as determined by the president and secretary of energy
penalties include fines of up to 11 000 per violation in addition to equitable remedies like returning illgotten profits
i thank my colleagues especially mr walden for their help in making the amendment even better and i urge that we pass gas price gouging prevention act included in hr 3893 the gasoline for america s security act in closing this legislation will go a long way to better protect the us oil markets as well as all consumers who depend on them
i would tell all my colleagues in the energy markup in the full committee the gentleman from michigan mr stupak xz4003910 did offer his amendment
the gentleman from michigan mr stupak xz4003910 did an able job of pointing out some of the things in my amendment that he felt were weak
so the chairman and i and others on the committee went back and we incorporated a lot of what the gentleman from michigan mr stupak xz4003910 brought up in the debate
we included it in this manager s amendment
so there is really no reason to vote for the stupak substitute because much of what we have in the manager s amendment is already included
as a member on this side of the aisle i wanted to thank the gentleman from michigan mr stupak xz4003910 for his help so that we are able to include in the manager s amendment some of his points and i think we made a stronger bill
i would say to those members on both sides of the aisle there is really no reason to support the stupak amendment because lots of what he is talking about dealing with price gouging as i mentioned earlier in my speech we have included in the manager s amendment
it does not provide consumer protection against price gouging in the crude oil or home heating oil market
unfortunately petroleum distillates which are used in so many products that are sold to consumer product companies such as cosmetics could be subject to price gouging under this amendment
overall i think the point i am trying to make is we incorporate a lot of the gentleman from michigan s mr stupak xz4003910 concerns in our manager s amendment
in the end i think my colleagues should realize we should vote against the stupak substitute
i agree we should have legislation to prevent people from lining their own pockets by taking advantage of others in a time of crisis
however i can not support the manner in which mr stupak s amendment addresses the problem
there is no mechanism to allow prices to reflect the changes in the market dynamic following a disaster other than cost
because the amendment only accounts for price increases related to costs increases and does not include other factors such as fear or panic it will artificially restrain prices that lead to shortages in gasoline at the time consumers in a disaster area most need access to gasoline
this is because the amendment does not adequately allow for actual or anticipated changes in supply to be reflected in price
unfortunately petroleum distillates are used in so many products that selling distillates to consumer products companies such as cosmetics could be subject to price gouging under this amendment
it does not allow the ftc to consider countervailing benefits to consumers namely that an increase in price can discourage hording by the first consumers to arrive at the gas station leaving no gas for those who arrive later
it gives the president authority to declare an emergency for any disruption of gasoline distribution or any significant pricing anomalies in the market
the stupak amendment does not provide consumer protection against price gouging in the crude oil or home heating oil markets
mr speaker the gentleman from pennsylvania makes a good point but if you look at today s washington post natural gas danger signs they talk about a 90 percent increase in natural gas
higher costs threaten our economic growth in us manufacturing
following katrina gas prices in some states reached 6 per gallon deepening suspicion of the oil industry profiteering
whether it is gasoline or natural gas the problem lies right here at the refinery level with a 255 percent increase in the last 12 months alone
a senior analyst at the recent american petroleum energy convention warned that if the us petroleum industry does not refine or reduce its refining capacity it will never see any substantial increase in refining margins so since 1995 since this memo they have closed 30 refineries
this conclusion is also backed up by the gao government accountability office which said in 2004 that by closing refineries they were able to drive up to those exorbitant prices we are paying today at the pump
our amendment will give the president authority to take immediate action in the face of energy crisis by declaring a national energy emergency
it will provide the federal trade commission with new authority to investigate and prosecute those that engage in predatory pricing from oil companies on down to gas stations with the emphasis on those who profit the most
hr 3893 does nothing to address natural gas and propane gas prices even though gas prices are expected to rise by more than 90 percent as shown in today s usa today
the base bill provides no additional penalties for those who engage in price gouging
it would also put in place new consumer protections to prevent market manipulation and ensure greater transparency in the cost of a gallon of gas
why is it we in america no one can tell us what does it cost for a gallon of gas
in the wake of hurricane katrina americans are pulling together donating to relief organizations and giving their time to help the people of the gulf coast recover
that is how american people react when they see their fellow citizens in need
as eight governors wrote to us in congress urging passage of our legislation they stated and i quote to price gouge consumers under normal circumstances is dishonest enough
mr speaker i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from virginia mr boucher xz4000430 a member of the committee and my partner in drafting this amendment the substitute amendment
mr speaker when the oil refineries raise their rates 255 percent in the last 12 months that is unconscionably excessive
well mr speaker if the gentleman will continue to yield i guess we are going to have to look in the bill because in the bill we also put in there factors to be considered excessively too much
if you go to the bottom of page 2 bottom of page 3 we put it in there
our bill says that in 90 days the ftc has to define it for us
the president has the authority to go outside the area just like he does in the underlying area
in answer to the gentleman s last question if you look at page 4 we have rulemaking in there where the ftc shall promulgate the rules necessary and appropriate to enforce
under the rulemaking process you myself just about all of us have an opportunity to put in our two cents worth on what we feel may be excessive market manipulation or price gouging
much like we did in the energy bill for nuclear
mr speaker i yield the balance of my time to the gentlewoman from california ms pelosi xz4003140 our democratic leader who has been so supportive in our efforts to make sure that americans get a fair shake at the gas pump and when they heat their homes this winter and go to work each and every day
mr speaker i rise in strong opposition to this bill today
although there is bipartisan recognition that this bill should at a minimum address pricegouging that occurred in the wake of katrina this bill s pricegouging provisions are weak
they give the federal trade commission ftc authority to pursue price gouging by sellers of gasoline or diesel fuel only in those areas where a natural disaster has occurred
in fact the only refinery that industry has attempted to build since 1976 a facility in arizona received its permit in just nine months
refining capacity has become tight in recent years so now companies can use their substantial profits to increase that capacity
but there is no reason to think that market forces can not solve the current problem and no reason to believe that burdensome environmental rules had anything to do with industry decisions not to add to refining capacity in recent years
i share the concerns of thomas markham the executive director of the lowry redevelopment authority in colorado who also serves as the president of the association of defense communities about how this provision might affect former military bases
as he writes in a letter on behalf of the adc shifting the responsibility to the federal government for planning how closed military installation will be reused would interfere with the timetested approach developed over the past two decades
communities must be in charge when planning for life after closure i realize that the rule as adopted today improved the bill language slightly to give communities more voice in the proposed process
again this provision is a solution in search of a problem
there is nothing in the brac statute or in new dod regulations that prevents a local community through its redevelopment authority from building or permitting an oil refinery on a military base
raising cafe standards is the single biggest step we can take to reduce oil consumption since about half of the oil used in the us goes into the gas tanks of our passenger vehicles
the substitute also authorizes new civil penalties of up to three times the amount of unjust profits gained by companies who engage in price gouging
yet with only 3 of the world s known oil reserves we are not in a position to solve our energy vulnerability by drilling at home
mr speaker what have members been hearing in their districts
and in fact in alaska we are getting 50 percent of what we got only 7 years ago
the energy bill signed in august will help us in the long term but it will not help us in the short term
this bill will help us in the long term not in the short term
we have not built a new refinery in a generation
i will remind my colleagues that this bill passed by a voice vote after 16 hours of markup and i applaud the gentleman from texas mr barton xz4000180 my chairman for making sure we did it in a bipartisan way
mr speaker i rise in strong opposition to hr 3893 which in many ways is little more than a hastily assembled and opportunistically revived retread of discarded ideas from past energy debates
mr speaker our constituents are asking for transparency in markets and price relief at the pump
mr speaker we do indeed have an energy crisis in this country one that can not begin to be solved by the kind of special interest wish list being passed off as legislation today
in the near term we need to restore confidence and transparency to the marketplace by taking decisive steps to punish and deter market manipulation where necessary
next it is imperative we make long overdue improvements in automobile fuel economy while diversifying our fuel mix to include alternatives like cellulosic ethanol and biodiesel
finally we need to invest in the next generation of 21st century technologies that create jobs protect the environment and move us towards energy independence
a few hours ago in the dark of night the bill was rewritten
there is not one member who really understands everything that is in this bill or understands what this bill will really do
but there are dozens of cronies and special interest lobbyists smiling this morning because they know the fix is in
and that may not be the worst of it because the republican leadership is trying to do all of this in the name of katrina
the damage was immense and so was our responsibility in congress to do all we can to help those who have been displaced rebuild their lives
mr chairman i rise in strong opposition to hr 3893 and in strong support of the stupak substitute
the ideas in this bill are not new
they are the same egregious environmental assaults that republicans in congress have tried unsuccessfully to pass for years
there is no excuse for this legislation to allow children with asthma to have to suffer more medical problems on the eastern coast of the united states in order to address a tragedy in the gulf coast of the united states
to pass them now in the guise of helping hurricane victims would be shameful
mr speaker one of the things that bothered me at the time of katrina and then rita was when you saw on the television long lines of cars at gas stations that were charging 5 or 6 for gas that you knew they did not pay that much to get in there
i do not believe that disasters should be a windfall for opportunists and i appreciate the chairman and his staff working with us over the last week to strengthen the pricegouging provisions in this bill
currently under current law most pricegouging statutes are at the state level and only 23 states in the nation have pricegouging statutes
you have to have two companies colluding in order to investigate it
it will apply in a disaster area and also beyond that disaster area if the president expands the area of coverage
i want to thank the chairman for his leadership and his staff for really strengthening the pricegouging provisions in this bill and for the first time in this country giving the federal government the tools they need to combat people who are taking advantage of terrible situations and take care of this problem of windfalls
mr speaker times of tragedy should not be windfalls for opportunists in the wake of hurricane katrina gas prices fluctuated to upwards of 600 in some communities
prosecution for price gouging is generally a state matter unless it involves some form of collusion or other activity in violation of federal laws
while the federal trade commission ftc monitors gas prices and investigates possible antitrust violations in the petroleum industry there is no federal law to prohibit price gouging by individual bad actors
the gas act requires the ftc to enact a price gouging definition as soon as possible within six months an improvement from the potential delay in the language reported out of committee
the house should pass a strong price gouging law that would be in effect in disaster areas
i urge my colleagues to vote in favor of hr 3893 the gasoline for america s security act of 2005
mr speaker hurricane katrina may not only have been one of the most destructive natural disasters in our nation s history the argument could be made that katrina was the perfect storm in exposing our nation s vulnerabilities in supplying oil and gas to meet our energy needs
disruption in our energy supply whether through opec polices to reduce production disruption in domestic drilling and shipping caused by hurricanes or limited refining capacity energy security is a matter of national security
progress also needs to be made in developing alternative fuels as well as making the machines we use more energy efficient
the argument has been made that our nation s ability to refine both imported and domestic sources of oil is limited because no new oil refineries have opened in the united states in almost 30 years
additionally just under half our refinery capacity or 47 percent is concentrated in the gulf of mexico
i was very disappointed that the rules committee failed to make in order an amendment to hr 3893 to increase corporate average fuel economy cafe standards
i support boosting cafe standards for us auto makers to 33 mpg over 10 years by 2015 consistent with the findings of the national academy of sciences in order to save 10 percent of the gasoline the nation would otherwise consume by 2015
why is telework not included in this bill
i am very concerned when i hear from my constituents who do nt understand how the price of gasoline at the pump can jump 25 cents in one day or how the same brand of gasoline can be selling at widely different prices at gas stations only a few miles apart
in the wake of the perfect storm that katrina brought to our nation we need to take action to both increase our energy supply and to become more energy and fuel efficient
chairman we are writing to urge that the rules committee make in order congressman boehlert s amendment to increase corporate average fuel economy cafe standards when it reports out a rule for the consideration of hr 3893 the gasoline for america s security act of 2005 the amendment a version of which has been made in order in each of the last three energy bill debates in the house is germane to hr 3893
in the wake of hurricane katrina and 3 per gallon gasoline prices more americans are becoming aware of the need to address the demand as well as the supply side of our gasoline crisis to protect their own family pocketbooks as well as to enhance the nation s energy security
and the study did not even consider three important technologies that automakers have since begun to introduce in the marketplace that can achieve even greater fuel economies hybrid engine technologies clean diesel technologies and highstrength lightweight composites and steels
the issue must not get lost in disputes about other aspects of hr 3893 which deals with a wide variety of legal and regulatory issues
mr speaker i rise in strong opposition to this bill the socalled gasoline for america s security act
in fact refining capacity has declined by 10 percent
in fact the key thing people need to understand in this debate is that the profit margins for the refineries has gone up 255 percent
this bill really is outrageous in terms of having the taxpayers pay the refineries to cover their unanticipated costs
it is in the bill and it is called standby support standby support
what that means is if they encounter some sort of reasonable delay government regulation or something like that and they suffer losses and they can not open on time or they are delayed in their operations we the taxpayer get to pay for that
these are delays in the normal course of business but yet this bill would have the taxpayer pay for those losses and that does not make sense
let me suggest that the broadest possible protection for the american people in terms of price gouging comes from the democratic substitute
for those of you who support federalism this measure goes in opposition to state rights
when you are talking in your church or in your home or where you work about high fuel prices you can play this and let people see why we have the prices that we have right now why they are going to be paying more for home heating oil why they are paying more for gasoline because this side of the aisle over here does not understand the problems that we have in this country
let us quit blaming the people who are trying to be leaders in this country and put us on the right track for an energy policy
mr speaker i want to address a serious problem with the underlying bill and that is that it relies exclusively on the federal trade commission and its willingness and ability and resources to enforce the price gouging remedy in the bill
i think we should all remember this is the same ftc that said we do not have any authority to investigate price gouging in this area we do not need any authority in this area
everything is just fine thank you very much and then when pressed further said we do not want any authority in this area because we will just make a bad situation worse
well mr speaker relying on a sorry bunch of people that do not know their job do not care about their job and do not believe in their job is like going hunting and having to tote the dog
the attorneys general of our states are elected by our constituents they know the conditions in their states better than we do they have the resources and the discretion under the substitute to decide whether or not it is in the best interest of their constituents our constituents for them to act when we do not
mr speaker i rise today in vigorous support of hr 3893
this bill takes us back to earth in reality
no new refinery has been constructed in the united states since 1976
refining capacity is not being increased due in part to a permitting process that is overly cumbersome and capital intensive
600 000 barrels are off line in my southwest louisiana district
this bill makes the necessary commitments to expand and diversify the refining industry in this country
it would also encourage investment in new pipelines and expansion of existing infrastructure to transport petroleum products more efficiently and at a lower cost to consumers
affordable energy is going to be an important factor in our ability to do that
mr speaker i rise in strong support of the stupakboucherbishopschwartzbarrow substitute amendment and i want to thank the gentleman from michigan mr stupak xz4003910 for his leadership on this issue of national importance
contributing to these costs as we all know is the dramatic increase in the price of gasoline
in the midst of hurricane katrina gas refiners were selling a barrel of gasoline for 434 percent more than a barrel was selling exactly 1 year ago
these steep costs make it difficult for hardworking americans to meet their financial obligations and they underscore the reality that the president and the majority party in congress have failed to enact policies to protect american consumers from price gouging and reduce the nation s overall dependence on gasoline and oil
they are concerned because after a doubledigit increase in home heating costs last year prices are expected to increase at even higher rates this winter
in fact it makes matters worse
and the plan we are offering in the substitute amendment today will help to meet these goals
and our plan will improve our nation s energy security through the establishment of a strategic refining reserve so that we are never again are in the position of releasing crude oil from our emergency reserves but unable to refine it and bring it to market
winter can be very cold in pennsylvania and if congress fails to take immediate action some of my constituents will simply not have enough money to pay these high prices and may be forced to choose between heating their homes and putting food on their table
in the last 60 days it has gotten a whole lot more expensive to drive to and from work with the price of gasoline going up
it rose about 55 cents in just the last 2 months
in 1981 we had 324 refineries in production
we are importing gasoline and obviously one of the choke points in the supply system is the ability to convert crude oil into gasoline
what this bill does and i am speaking against the substitute and in favor of the underlying bill is that it removes a regulatory burden that many folks who want to build a refinery have to submit themselves to
major investments are needed in order to construct a refinery and businesses simply are not willing to put those dollars at risk subject to a regulatory approval permitting scene that is disjointed at best
we put the doe in charge of shepherding the permitting process not making the decisions on behalf of the state and the federal regulators but simply encouraging them to get it done on a timely basis
so i am standing in favor of the original bill the manager s amendment and speaking against the stupak substitute
i rise today in opposition to the rule and the underlying bill hr 3893
constructing new facilities would increase the nation s capacity to process crude oil and soften the effects of future supply disruptions but the oil refiners are not interested in incentives to do so
in fact they have minimized capacity to maximize profit
congress needs to pause and examine our energy stance in a longterm strategic manner
obesity is a problem in america but it is not evident that the availability of highfat food or restaurants are the sole cause
in the subcommittee on commercial and administrative law which i chaired last congress we explored the threat the food industry and its workers face from frivolous litigation the threat to personal responsibility posed by the proliferation of such litigation and the need for passage of the personal responsibility in food consumption act
in reality it means we must
i would remind my colleagues that john banzhaf an attorney who testified last year against this bill stated in 2003 somewhere there is going to be a judge and a jury that will buy this and once we get the first verdict as we did with tobacco it will open the floodgates it is unlikely that lawsuits against food establishments over their menus will make us healthier
the trial bar serves an invaluable purpose in helping average americans gain rightful and proportionate compensation when harm is done
whatever the rhetorical purpose the sponsor of this amendment seeks to accomplish it should be defeated because it is badly drafted and in the context of the bill its application would be nonsensical
but whatever the intent of the amendment is the fundamental problem is that corporations can not gain weight and suffer from obesity which is the term used in the bill
i suppose perhaps in conference we could work on the issue but i am loath to commit the chairman to that process
i think it is actually more like 40 percent in some recent studies i have seen
adopting this amendment would turn the personal responsibility in food consumption act into the parent irresponsibility act
even the ultraliberal los angeles times has stated this is wrong saying in an editorial if kids are chowing down to excess on junk food are nt their parents responsible for cracking down
there is a problem in america
it would be good if corporations did perfect things but we live in an imperfect world where parents have the ability to turn off the television parents have the ability to teach their children what to eat and how to eat well
parents have the ability to deal with these issues in ways that this congress and industry can not do
in fact not a single state consumer protection law allows a state agency to sue for damages because someone got fat from eating too much
however because the amendment implies state consumer protection laws do allow lawsuits in which the claim is obesity or weight gain courts may well read it to grant all state agencies new powers to use their state consumer protection laws to seek damages against the food industry for obesityrelated claims
it would not be right to allow states to use their consumer protection laws in ways they can not use them now namely to sue the food industry for obesityrelated claims
in any case section 4 5 b of hr 544 makes it clear that obesityrelated lawsuits can be brought by anyone who can prove he suffered harm as a result of a violation of state or federal law including laws that prohibit deceptive or misleading advertising by showing he individually and justifiably relied on such deceptive or misleading advertising and that such reliance was the proximate cause of the injury
mr chairman in closing let me just say that we have consumer protection laws
the term dietary supplement as defined in 21 usc
it is defined in 21 usc
but if you want to help combat the obesity problem in america vote down this gutting amendment and preserve the concept of personal responsibility
he is the founder of structure house a residential weightloss facility in durham north carolina
he said the following at a senate hearing on this legislation lawsuits are pointing fingers at the food industry in an attempt to curb the nation s obesity epidemic
these lawsuits do nothing but enable consumers to feel powerless in a battle for maintaining one s own personal health
negative lifestyle choices cause obesity not a trip to the fast food restaurant or a cookie high in trans fat
the fact that we are addressing the issue here today is a step in the right direction even the chairman of the american council for fitness and nutrition susan finn has written that although obesity is a serious health threat to millions of americans lawsuits and fingerpointing are not realistic solutions
if the gentleman is concerned about and i know the gentleman has great concern about the effect of supplements like ephedra which have largely been abandoned by the industry that is something we ought to be considering but not in the context of this legislation
it is reassuring to see the congress is taking measures to help rid our court system of lawsuits that are costly and hurt those consumers and businesses in our country
twelve million people in this country are employed by businesses in the food industry making it the nation s largest private sector employer
this is an industry that has a direct impact on the nation s economy and these fastfood obesity lawsuits are opposed by nearly nine in 10 americans
individuals not restaurants are responsible for food choices that they make freely in their own daily lives
in addition the food addressed by this legislation is legal and unadulterated and the rights of individuals to pursue lawsuits resulting from claims like the mislabeling of food or food safety issues is preserved
it is unacceptable to make arguments that certain types of food that are sold in certain types of restaurants as a result of consumer demand are somehow dangerous and that the average consumer must bear the burden in higher food costs because of the overindulgence by some individuals who file these types of lawsuits
mr chairman in 2001 the us surgeon general proclaimed childhood obesity a health issue rivaling cigarette smoking
the surgeon general further stated that the rate of overweight children in america doubled in the past 20 years and tripled among its adolescents
but apparently few here in washington seem to have taken notice or cared and predictably rates have continued to rise across the country
today one in three children is overweight
yes mr chairman i said one in three almost 35 percent
has it provided more funding for obesity awareness or tried to implement programs to improve nutrition in schools
congress is headed in the wrong direction with this bill which removes any and all incentives from the food industry to improve their products for children
experts in this field unequivocally state that the fear of litigation and regulation prompts the industry to rethink how it markets and sells food to children
unfortunately the bill as presently written forecloses the opportunity to hold the industry accountable and thus puts any future improvements in jeopardy assuring continued high rates of childhood obesity leaving me to wonder whether we in congress are here to represent the people or big business
the bill is entitled personal responsibility in food consumption act
personal responsibility is a twoway street both the consumer and the executives of the industry both should act in a personally responsible manner
so i ask my colleagues to join me in supporting this amendment to hold fast food companies accountable and to protect our young children
the schools are bringing in the fast food restaurants so they can make some more money and they encourage it
it provides that the amendment in the nature of a substitute recommended by the committee on the judiciary and now printed in the bill shall be considered as an original bill for the purpose of amendment
this resolution makes in order only those amendments printed in the committee on rules report accompanying the resolution and it provides that the amendments printed in the report may be considered only in the order printed in the report may be offered only by a member designated in the report shall be considered as read shall be debatable for the time specified in the report equally mr speaker i rise today to speak on behalf of house resolution 494 and the underlying bill hr 554 the personal responsibility in food consumption act
mr speaker today the house will consider hr 554 the personal responsibility in food consumption act a common sense piece of legislation that passed this house in the last congress by a substantial bipartisan vote of 276 to 139
i might further add that 55 democrats joined with 221 republicans supporting this bill in an effort to help rein in this mentality of jackpot justice that has plagued our judicial system and cluttered the dockets to a virtual standstill
this legislation would require courts to dismiss any lawsuits that seek damages for injury resulting from weight gain obesity or any health condition associated with obesity filed against manufacturers distributors sellers marketers or advertisers of any food product in addition to trade associations that represent them
a recent gallup poll found that approximately 9 in 10 americans a number of whom are themselves in the ranks of overweight or even obese opposed holding the fast food industry legally responsible for dietrelated health problems of people who eat that kind of food on a regular basis
without question mr speaker obesity is a problem in our society
like most other americans i am also well aware that obesity is on the rise in our country and particularly among our children
however the root of the problem is not the existence of fast food or the presence of a local fast food restaurant but rather the root of the problem lies in the choices of consumers
i have never heard of anyone pulling up to the drivethrough window with a hamburglar sitting in the passenger seat forcing someone to buy just one more big mac
and when an individual does make a poor decision he or she should not be able to abuse the courts so as to shift responsibility to someone else in order to cash in
an individual for example can still sue in those instances where a contract or a warranty is breached as long as the basis for the lawsuit is not related to weight gain obesity or a health condition associated with either
obviously individuals can still sue in accordance with applicable state laws protecting against deceptive trade practices and if a person becomes sick from a tainted food product
in closing i just want to emphasize that this legislation is common sense and it includes exemptions to ensure legitimate claims still make it to court while abusive lawsuits are stopped at the courthouse door
mr speaker this bill the personal responsibility in food consumption act hr 554 is all about again personal responsibility and to point out how ludicrous it would be if we allowed personal injury lawsuits against the food industry or any other company that makes a legitimate product
we just talked earlier in the afternoon mr speaker in regard to gun manufacturers
in fact it is my belt
this belt i am proud to say is handfinished american alligator produced right here in the good old usa
mr speaker let us suppose now that i decided it is unlikely that i would do this but let us suppose i decided i wanted to wear a size 42 and i punched a few extra holes in this belt which is a size 36 so i could wear it and buckle it with a size 42 pair of trousers
these trousers fell right to my knees in a public place
i do not think i should have the right to sue the belt company because i used its product in a manner that it was not designed to use
it creates tremendous numbness and loss of feeling in the anterior part of the thigh
in fact it will only make matters worse
the personal responsibility in food consumption act of 2005 is a good bill and i look forward to further discussing its merits on the house floor today
mr speaker as i mentioned earlier a strong bipartisan majority passed this bill in the last congress and i have no reason to doubt that we should be able to pass it again by a similar maybe even a stronger margin and i urge my colleagues to support this rule and the underlying bill
the gentleman from pennsylvania mr murphy xz4002850 has worked extensively in the field of psychology particularly child psychology
my background in a prior life my professional experience was for 30 years in the practice of medicine and the specialty that i enjoyed practicing was obstetrics and gynecology and we have that opportunity in that field of medicine to see a child at the very beginnings of life and know how critically important a good start is
we talk about some of the things that this republican majority has done some of the very good programs since president bush has been in office certainly not the least of which is no child left behind regarding our k12 education program
some of the bullet points these may be a little bit difficult to see mr speaker but hopefully we can focus the camera in on the bullet points
secondly in the united states more than 250 000 low birth weight infants are born each year
in some instances they are unhealthy children who are near term but low birth weight
that is why i think it is so important and i know the gentleman from pennsylvania mr murphy xz4002850 would agree with me that when we emphasize the issue the immigration issue of securing our borders and want to make sure that every immigrant that comes into this country comes here legally and has an opportunity to get prenatal care as of course many of those who come in an illegal manner are afraid or do not now how or where to get prenatal care and will just show up in the emergency room having delivered an unhealthy premature that is just the beginning of the cost because if there is a disability that is long lasting or maybe even lasting a lifetime and that is often the case whether it is a heart defect or a musculoskeletal deformity or a mental defect as a result of lack of oxygen sometimes even blindness the cost is just astronomical
so it is so important it is so important that we do things in this congress at the federal level to encourage that women get prenatal care and that children are born healthy and that indeed no infant not just no child left behind but no infant is left behind
so i just wanted to go over with my colleagues some of the things in regard to prenatal care that are so important that i always stress to my patients of course encouraging immunizations and vitamin supplements monitoring of diet increased physical activity clearly to avoid smoking and alcohol use during pregnancy and drug use
i am sure the gentleman from pennsylvania mr murphy xz4002850 will talk about that later in the hour as he discusses things like childhood obesity and childhood mental health
but i wanted to speak a little bit about a program that we just reauthorized in the last couple of weeks here in this 109th congress and what i am talking about is the head start program
head start and its cousin early head start or comprehensive child development programs serving children from birth to age 5 as i stated as well as pregnant women and their families the critical component of the head start program is that it is child focused with the overall goal to increase school readiness of young children in lowincome families mr speaker
the head start program has a long tradition of delivering comprehensive and highquality services designed to foster healthy development in children that need our help the most
the program provides a range of individualized services in areas of education early childhood development but not stopping there
it even goes a step further by providing nutritional counseling and encouraging parental involvement in their child s development
i have got a lot of statistics and as we continue the hour i will relate some of those specifics particularly in regard to the reauthorization and how much we are doing in that program
but i just wanted to point out as i know the gentleman from pennsylvania mr murphy xz4002850 agrees how important it is that we do everything we can to make sure that our children get a good start in life
so it is hugely important that they are healthy that they are happy that they are loved and they have an opportunity as we all want in life
mr speaker as the gentleman pointed out and he is so right we need to move into the 21st century in regard to our health care system and modeling
you are talking about in the last few minutes of course your specialty in talking about mental illness and as it relates also to childhood obesity and i could not help but think as i was listening to your discussion and as you know this week we just passed hr 554
hr 554 is the personal responsibility in food consumption act of 2005
i used a little analogy when i was talking about this on the floor yesterday in discussing the rule of my belt which is a size 36
that is i hate to admit the size of my waist but if i wanted really out of blind pride to suggest that i had a 24inch waist and i cinched that belt down a couple of notches in doing so i put pressure compression on something referred to as the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve it would result in a condition of numbness and lack of feeling on the anterior thigh
parenthetically mr speaker i also want to mention the gentleman from florida mr keller xz4002120 the author of the bill our good friend and colleague is actually in the hospital now and recovering hopefully from a fairly minor condition but we want to pay tribute to him
the comment that i wanted to make is this issue of personal responsibility and parents should have that personal responsibility obviously in the way they conduct themselves in regard to how they eat and a healthy diet and exercise but even more importantly is the responsibility that they have to give a good example and instruction to their children
i think probably they might predominate in some of those diseases which we categorize as mental illness
how in the world can they grow and develop with a healthy selfimage
it is their responsibility to make sure that they are from the very beginning when they start eating at the table to make sure that they are healthy and stay healthy so you do not have to have them ending up in your office treating them for not only mental illness but also the many complications of obesity
we always talk about waste fraud and abuse in the medicare and the medicaid programs and wanting to eliminate that and we are very diligent and will continue to be so
we are not talking about lowhanging fruit here in regard to saving money and saving lives
so clearly that is what my message would be in regard to that
without question probably the most common condition that we see in smoking moms is something called toxemia of pregnancy
we do not know exactly what that poison is but something occurs in those moms that develop toxemia
in the extreme toxemia of pregnancy before birth results in a very very high blood pressure
so we are talking about one of the worst complications of pregnancy other than just out and out exsanguination from bleeding which is also a possibility in any pregnancy
and then of course childhood asthma which i am sure the gentleman has seen plenty of cases of that youngsters that come in because there is that secondary smoke situation
not only do they have to suffer with it during the 9 months of pregnancy of their mom but once they are born that smoking continues in the household
the gentleman is so right and i appreciate the opportunity to weigh in on this issue
this issue of scoring as the gentleman is talking about it reminds me of course of the debate during the medicare modernization and prescription drug act that we passed in december of 2003
of course that part d will go into effect and the modernization piece is already in effect for medicare but part d the prescription drug part will start january 1 but all we heard and continue to hear particularly from the other side and for those naysayers who keep wanting to talk negative about really a very good program that is going to be a godsend for our neediest seniors i talked about this on the floor my colleagues i know heard me last night
you get no credit for the fact that many people who sign up and yes there will be an additional medicare cost for them on this part d program but the fact that they are able to take those medications they can finally afford to take that statin to lower their cholesterol and that medication that insulin to lower their blood sugar or whatever antihypertensive to lower their blood pressure guess what the truth of the matter is and what the gentleman was emphasizing is that you get no credit for saving those costs not to mention the fact that it is so much more compassionate to spend money on prevention rather than treatment particularly when the treatment sometimes is not very successful and a person could ultimately be in a nursing home for years and disabled for the rest of their lives
it is the same thing this scoring issue in regard to the tax cuts that this republican leadership has effected over these past 3 years
the scorers the cbo the number crunchers say well these tax cuts the elimination of the marriage tax penalty increasing the child tax credit from 600 an infant to 1 000 a child giving small business men and women an opportunity to more rapidly depreciate investment in bricks and mortar and creating new jobs all of these things elimination of the death tax no taxation without respiration i firmly believe in the scorers said that was going to cost us 13 trillion
so many of these things that we are talking about tonight in this hour these innovations these community health centers that the president has funded recommended and feels so strongly about on the scoring side you get no credit for but we do save money as the gentleman points out
mr chairman i rise in strong support of hr 554 the personal responsibility in food consumption act and i thank the gentleman from wisconsin for moving this legislation to the floor
in order to help ensure that america continues to be a good place to do business and to help create and maintain american jobs it is important that we not allow opportunistic trial lawyers to extort money from legitimate companies
american agriculture produces the safest most affordable and abundant food supply in the world and should be protected from trial lawyers attempts to reach as far up the food chain as possible with unfounded claims seeking unjust enrichment
it would allow claims to go forward in several circumstances including cases in which a state or federal law was broken
mr chairman i rise today in support of hr 554 the personal responsibility in food consumption act
these stories may sound funny but the facts show these types of frivolous lawsuits bankrupt businesses deplete pensions gouge consumers and deprive americans with real complaints access to their day in court
mr chairman i rise today to express my concern that we are again dealing with a notion that there is a crisis in our courts with obesity lawsuits
hr 554 the socalled personal responsibility in food consumption act is a measure that seeks to give federal immunity to food manufacturers sellers and advertisers for obesityrelated claims
the reality is there is only one such pending suit in the entire country so i am hard pressed to see why we need to take up this measure today especially since there are so many other important issues we need to address
i do not think it is the role of the united states congress to intervene in every individual and private issue in america
furthermore the language in hr 554 is so broad it would cut off legitimate claims against the food industry even where the industry acted to deceive the public and even where it violated state or federal law
for instance those in the food industry who fraudulently or deceptively market or sell lowfat products that are not really lowfat should be held accountable but this measure would let them off the hook
lawsuits aimed at unscrupulous tactics help to change the behavior of the bad actors in the industry we should allow our legal system to process these legitimate cases
mr speaker i rise to join many of my colleagues in strongly opposing the restrictive rule set forth on hr 554 the the personal responsibility in food consumption act of 2005 as you know in light of the world we live and the importance of nutrition this is a very important piece of legislation
in closing let me note that while this issue may be important there are far more urgent issues we need to be focusing on at this time
in addition the earthquake registering 76 in magnitude that struck pakistan has caused major devastation in the region
while the numbers are still coming in it has been estimated that 23 000 have died and at least 47 000 have been injured
we were in a homeland security hearing which is going on as many of my colleagues know assessing the circumstances with hurricane rita and hurricane katrina
i know the gentleman from wisconsin mr sensenbrenner xz4003650 is well aware of great intention in our committee to always work together and so i offer this amendment recognizing that my colleagues will consider this as an opportunity to work together
one could argue that in the backdrop of hurricane wilma now reaching a category 5 that this congress should be addressing many many other issues particularly enhanced funding for homeland security and of course how we can do things better
in essence this is an amendment to protect against consumer retaliation
now those of us who have raised children during this timeframe will never know until the final tests are in studies are done 10 and 20 years from now as to whether or not the eating of fast food that many of us took our young children to for play and excitement is going to be longlasting in its damage
in 1996 oprah winfrey was sued under my home state s food disparagement laws by the beef industry for comments she made following the first mad cow scare this country witnessed albeit she was denied her first amendment rights
after years of litigation in my state transfer of her television show to texas and expenditure of over 1 million ms winfrey prevailed at trial and on appeal
again i wish we were on the floor talking about restoring the drastic cuts in the budget reconciliation bill that deal with health care and deal with housing and deal with the various issues of education and special grants to help the least of those but we are on the floor talking about mcdonald s and burger king certainly friends of young parents who through their professions and other responsibilities did a lot of eating at burger king and mcdonald s but it does not in any way give them the privilege of denying consumer rights and the rights of consumers not to be retaliated against because they have expressed their viewpoint and the rights of the first amendment
i do not recall any hue and cry in this body during or in the aftermath against ms winfrey to ban food liability suits
but if we are to end the public s right to a jury trial on issues of food safety we can not end the public s right to freedom of speech by leaving food critics who play an important role in educating the public as i close stimulating positive change on good sound eating habits
in 1996 oprah winfrey was sued under my home state s food disparagement laws by the beef industry for comments she made following the first mad cow scare this country witnessed
i do nt recall any hue and cry in this body during or in the aftermath of the lawsuit against ms winfrey to ban food libel laws
but if we are to end the public s right to a jury trial on issues of food safety we can not end the public s right to freedom of speech by leaving food critic who play an important role in educating the public stimulating positive change and promoting sound eating habits open to lawsuits from an immunized industry
this amendment addresses this concern and insures that every american can engage in or has access to an open and honest debate on matters of public health
mr chairman i simply ask the question in this bill consumers are left vulnerable and i would ask the gentleman would he not work with me in this amendment to ensure that they are not left vulnerable as we are protecting our fastfood industry
mr speaker i rise to support the rule and the underlying bill hr 554 also known as the personal responsibility in food consumption act and sometimes fondly referred to as the gentlewoman from california ms matsui xz4006631 said the cheeseburger bill
it provides a legal product and it provides it in a legal way
mr speaker most restaurants are small businesses that contribute to their community in literally countless ways
they said we need a debate on health care and i am pleased to engage in that debate
i am reminded of the book that talks about everything i need to know in life i learned in kindergarten
lawsuits do not reduce the 127 million annual medical costs that our nation incurs on obesityrelated conditions in children and the increase in obesity rates
proper diet and exercise will help reduce medical complications that are increasingly common in children such as hypertension diabetes high cholesterol and heart disease which were once found almost exclusively in adults
in my years working as a psychologist and oftentimes consulting with courts i have yet to find a court that can replace a parent
it is very important for all families in our nation and certainly an issue that concerns all of us on both sides of the aisle
little offers are made in terms of what is needed
according to the national center of health statistics 83 percent of children in this country under 18 years of age have excellent to very good health
now 17 percent of america s children are in less than favorable health either to mild or severe levels
according to the american academy of pediatrics 63 million uninsured children over twothirds of all uninsured children in america are currently eligible either for medicaid or for the state health insurance programs but they are not enrolled
in 1995 and this is for all ages medicaid spent 150 billion
while we are looking at such things as how do we pay for hurricane katrina s outcome in this devastated gulf region how do we take care of so many needs is it fair to just continue to say to the american people we are going to continue to spend more without finding ways of eliminating waste and fraud and abuse
the new york times wrote recently about an amount of some 44 billion in medicaid fraud in that state
one dentist billed for over 980 procedures in one day
when it comes to our children we also have to make sure the system works with these programs in ways that optimize the health and outcome
indeed in the health care system where so much money is used inappropriately and wastefully we ought to have some changes
yes if we switch to an intelligent health system that uses electronic prescribing electronic medical records real patient care management for our children rather than having a system that gets bogged down and collapses of its own expense and weight we can come up with success for our children and no longer be mired in failure
a lot of what people think happens when they have an individual or chronic disease is something common like diabetes or asthma in a child the doctor will examine and make sure that the child has the right medications watches their diet and the environment around them and hope all goes well
you can end up with chronic about 10 percent of the cases that show up in an emergency room are someone who has no ability to pay but it is estimated that 60 percent or more 60 percent or more of patients who show up in emergency departments are nonemergencies
if in such cases the care was given ahead of time whether it is through a community health center a clinic direct patient care with a physician if we monitored and kept a careful eye on those children with chronic conditions we could save massive amounts of money
emergency care can cost five to eight times more than outpatient care and we can actually save billions of dollars in the system
this is where we can find savings and in so doing we save lives as well as money
in the majority of these cases the doctor said it would affect what diagnosis they had and future tests called for
mr speaker i am not talking about things that take place only in families that have access to computers and finances to do this
a lot of this is done in areas of low income levels of high risk populations where we really find it is much more affordable
what the federal government is going to do and what we are doing here in the republican conference is asking those questions and demanding some answers of changing some of that system
what i would like to do is call upon the gentleman from georgia mr gingrey xz4001510 who as an obstetrician has worked with many families particularly in the area of prenatal care
one of the critical areas in cutting costs and being more effective in health care is dealing with prenatal care in an effective and positive way
i believe it is centered in colorado with over 700 nurses delivering inhome prenatal care and early infant care to more than 13 000 lowincome families throughout the nation
interestingly enough they were able to demonstrate they could return 4 savings for every 1 invested in these services by the time the children reach age 15 by reducing expenditures for such things as special education emergency room visits
secondly i also applaud my colleague for bringing up those aspects about head start and early head start so critically important for families who are struggling to make ends meet to have this system that really puts the parent at the center of the child s care making sure they are involved in all the decisions making sure they have the information they need to have making sure that they are in essence put into the role of parent and not government in the role of parent and that makes all the difference in the world
unfortunately what has happened in this nation i believe it may only be the state of illinois that still requires gym class in school and as such children spend much more sedentary time at home playing video games or in front of the television less active and eating more during that time
and what has happened in the last 10 years and look here the proportion of obese children has tripled since 1970
it has doubled in the last 10 years tripled among teenagers actually during this time period and increased incidences of disease associated with that including such things as now we see adult onset diabetes showing up in our children
we see the risks that take place with blood pressures that are showing up in children who really did not have these problems before
this is an estimated annual cost of obesityrelated diseases in the united states 100 billion
this is not something that is cured by simply having government come in and tell people what they can and can not eat
something has broken down in our families and our communities where we are no longer telling kids they have had enough to eat or they are not going to eat any more of that or they need to get out and play
the annual hospital costs for obesityrelated disorders in children ages 6 to 17 years of age increased from 35 million to 127 million between 1979 and 2000
the annual estimated cost for diseases associated with this physical activity in 2000 was 76 million but we know that daily participation in physical ed classes by high school students has dropped from 42 percent in 1991 to 29 percent in 1999 and continues to decline
we need to go upstream and work on some basic prevention and that means quite frankly mothers and fathers across america have to work on these issues of teaching their children to be responsible for their own bodies making sure that we as members of congress are talking about these issues but making sure as we monitor how money is spent we are much better off looking at ways that funding could be given to communities programs to schools to hospitals to help make sure we are working on prevention of obesity rather than paying the high costs at the end of the line for so much of the increases in health care because obesity has continued to climb
many a child i saw in my clinical practice as a psychologist oftentimes came in a child who was well overweight teased by their peers struggled with this on top of their other physical problems
they oftentimes got in this downward spiral less activity more socially isolated
what happens in the area of mental health is sometimes in this chamber and our nation we look down upon it from a couple of different angles
jokes still abound on television calling people crazy loony out of control retarded in derogatory terms for something that we continue to see in this nation as a sign of weakness instead of a real disease
again if we are going to deal with things in the health care area to truly reduce costs and deal with patients we have to understand in the area of children s mental health psychological disorders are real
it is interesting you can have some children face tremendous difficulties in their life and they do not seem to show problems in mental outcomes but that does not mean that those who do have problems are simply weak
girls may have different symptoms with depression but in all cases we also see there is a commonality between parents and we may see for example as the outcome of the hurricanes in the gulf coast that there will be some children who live through tremendous trauma and they may have some posttraumatic stress reactions but it may never reach the level of posttraumatic stress disorder
it may never reach that level because they may in their own biological factors have resilience but their family may be there to support
we know for example that children with depression respond fairly well pretty well to some of the talk therapy or counseling to help them understand strategies to deal with problems in their life recognize the symptoms and do their own intervention themselves to change those symptoms
we do know that they can respond to treatment and it is important we continue to fund in areas of medicaid and everywhere else medicare psychological psychiatric treatment because it is helpful
what did not come up in those discussions are a couple of important factors
in many cases they may be general practitioners pediatricians family doctors obstetricians
interestingly enough one of the things we oftentimes taught medical students in medical schools is once patients start getting better with symptoms of depression the risk for suicide may increase because the support systems back off and they say johnny s feeling better we do not need to have him in the hospital or do not need to be around him as much
as they are getting their energy up as they are back in the world and thinking if we do not change the way they think with depressive thought patterns if we do not interrupt that and change it you can actually increase the risk for suicide
that being the case we have to make sure that as we are looking for more effective ways of spending money the taxpayer dollars in medicaid and medicare and head start that we are working comprehensive care with the patient with mental illness as well such problems as i said before about bipolar that is manic depressive illness attention deficit disorder anxiety disorders all of these with a strong genetic component and elements where we can make huge changes in people s lives
somehow in this chamber we politicize this to somehow think we are doing something wrong in both areas of the conservative far right the liberal far left somehow accuse maybe there is some conspiracies involved in this and there is not
we see this in the area of children s health when you start to look at so many aspects here that you really can make some huge differences
but one of the things to keep in mind about depression which is one of the most common mental illnesses affecting more than 19 million americans each year that it can cause longer lasting forms
you can lose pleasure in life complicate other medical conditions can lead to suicide but it is also associated with many other medical issues
people with heart disease 40 to 65 percent of them will have depression and what is interesting is untreated depression in these patients can lead to complications such as the health care costs can double
now i ask the gentleman from georgia mr gingrey xz4001510 on this he certainly treated many a patient who had medical complications as well as some of the psychological ones and i would like to ask him in looking at some of these more comprehensive chronic care models of how we need to be moving forward in a modern system of health care and not be just looking at individual disease but how looking at more advanced forms of bringing technology and changing the system how he sees that affecting the patient in a costeffective way
i believe that the sad statistic is that the pittsburgh region has some of the highest maternal smoking rates during pregnancy in the nation
also it is related to my understanding is yet so many other aspects come from this that you may find in such children also eating disorders and diabetes and cancer risks even if that child never themselves smoked cigarettes
i believe a direct and indirect medical cost of smoking in this nation is about 138 billion per year
of course another reason why i believe it is so important not only for the government but really for individuals and businesses to focus so much on helping to change that is the state of california for example estimates that their statewide tobacco prevention program during the 1990s resulted in overall cost savings of 84 billion in health care
a recent review of health promotion and disease and management programs in businesses that provided health education to their employees including exercise healthrisk screening weight control nutrition information stress management disease screening and smoking cessation found a significant return in investment saved about 150 to about 5 for every dollar spent in the program
northeast utilities program in its first 24 months reduced some of the claims by about 14 billion
and i call upon my colleagues we need to make some fundamental changes in how cbo scores these things
we have got to stop just looking at how much it costs up front and look at how much it saves in the long run
again i look at such things as if we are able to have more people go to federally approved health centers community health centers in their community instead of showing up in the emergency departments yes it may cost money the president called for a couple billion dollars to put into those community health centers
i am reminded of the story of the fellow who was on his hands and knees late at night under a streetlight in the city probably had too much to drink and a police officer sees him and says excuse me sir what are you doing
prenatal care early head start head start what that contributes to in helping save problems
i like the president s plan of a community health center in every county in america where there is poverty and an uninsured can help reduce emergency visits by fourfifths the cost of the emergency visits
and it is one of those things where unfortunately the political rhetoric comes through in this chamber and i do not know of anybody who has ever been cured by a floor speech but it certainly is one where there is just so much talk that continues on spending too much here spending too much there
and if we are continuing to spend on wasteful or fraudulent or abusive or simply health care issues that are not taking care of the disparity of outcomes between for example low socioeconomic families families that are struggling to make ends meet and feel they do not have the money to pay for their doctor visits and those that may be in poverty we need to work on those disparities of outcomes and make sure that we take care of those children early on and that is why the issue of community health centers for our kids is so critically important
we have seen tremendous inaccuracies in those numbers
my colleague from georgia spoke about those inaccuracies when it came to looking at things such as the death tax and them being off over 1 trillion in their estimates
but also it is one of those things in health care too
now i am going to see if my colleague has any final comments to make in this area of health care
president lincoln said governments should do that which the people can not do for themselves now in the areas of such things as food and consumption people and parents ought to be watching what they eat
well what we also ought to be doing ourselves is working along with physicians and schoolteachers and people in the community to make sure our kids are healthy and safe and exercise and eat right
if we are truly going to do what is right and decent and honorable for the next generation it is a matter of doing what is right in health care
the science tells us when it comes to managing the disease it is not appropriate to just look at that individual disease but to see how it operates in the context of the child and their family
that is what takes place in states like nebraska and other hospitals around the nation
the question is will we have the courage to work together in a bipartisan manner to do it
my hope is that our colleagues drop the gloves on this put down the swords stop looking for opportunities to send out sound bytes and to have people make phone calls and use it as political fodder but instead to be able to look our constituents in the eye and say when we were all here when we were all granted the authority to do something about america we took an opportunity to save lives and save money and we ought to start with our children
in this case the personal responsibility in food consumption act hr 554 usurps state jurisdiction over lawsuits related to obesity against food manufacturers
the idea that a fast food restaurant should be held legally liable because some of its customers over indulged in the restaurant s products and thus are suffering from obesityrelated health problems is the latest blow to the ethos of personal responsibility that is fundamental in a free society
this separation of powers strictly limits the role of the federal government in dealing with civil liability matters and reserves jurisdiction over matters of civil tort such as food related negligence suits to the state legislatures
unconstitutional expansions of federal power no matter how just the cause may seem are not in the interests of the food industry or of lovers of liberty
in conclusion while share the concern over the lawsuits against the food industry that inspired hr 554 this bill continues the disturbing trend of federalizing tort law
enhancing the power of the federal government is in no way in the longterm interests of defenders of the free market and constitutional liberties
madam chairman in addition to the violation of principles of federalism outlined by my colleague from north carolina this piece of legislation is another piece in which we are taking upon ourselves the right to try a case in the legislative branch instead of respecting the separation of powers by allowing cases to be tried in the judicial branch where they belong
the majority in congress has apparently already decided the proper outcome of these cases and is adjusting the law accordingly just for these cases rather than trusting our laws and our courts to hear evidence from both sides and decide the cases on their merits
even if they are frivolous cases the judicial branch has ways to sanction people for bringing frivolous cases but once again special interests are receiving in these cases special treatment
instead of having to go through the courts like everybody else where they do not know the outcome of the case until evidence is presented and the law is applied these defendants will get to try their cases in the legislative branch where popularity and politics prevail
meanwhile everyone else without special privileges is stuck trying their cases in the courts where they have an unbiased judge and jury instead of favorable politicians and they are stuck with the same law that applies to everybody else
just a few months ago we changed the law for terri schiavo because her parents knew how to reach someone in congress and we ignored the multitude of judicial decisions that had already been decided and we changed the law for that case not cases like that just for that case
a few years ago in a child custody case in the washington dc area that case was decided by special legislative language in a transportation appropriations bill
later today as my colleague from north carolina has pointed out the house will probably pass legislation to fix the result in firearms legislation so that the firearms industry will get to try their cases and their issues in the legislative branch rather than being stuck with the law that applies to everybody else
mr chairman trying cases in the legislative branch is bad policy
we should honor the rule of law and apply the law in all cases
mr chairman in closing let me just say that as the gentleman from arkansas who is a physician indicated weight gain can be caused by contamination or other problems even if that contamination was unknowing
madam chairman i rise in support of hr 554 the personal responsibility in food consumption act of 2005
hr 554 the personal responsibility in food consumption act would correct this disturbing trend
it would however allow obesityrelated claims to go forward in several circumstances including cases in which a state or federal law was broken and as a result a person suffered harm
under hr 554 cases could go forward in which a company violates an expressed contract or warranty
this legislation passed the house of representatives during the 108th congress in the form of hr 339 with a large bipartisan vote of 276 to 139
according to a recent gallup poll nearly nine in 10 americans oppose holding the fastfood industry legally responsible for dietrelated health problems of people who eat that kind of food on a regular basis
those who describe themselves as overweight are no more likely than others to blame the fastfood industry for obesityrelated health problems or to favor lawsuits against the industry as one judge put it if a person knows or should know that eating copious orders of supersized mcdonald s products is unhealthy and may result in weight gain it is not the place of the law to protect them from their own excesses even the los angeles times has editorialized against such lawsuits stating if kids are chowing down to excess on junk food are nt their parents responsible for cracking down
he is the founder of the structure house a residential weight loss facility in durham north carolina
musante said the following at a hearing in the other body on this legislation through working with obese patients i have learned that the worst thing one can do is to blame an outside force to get themselves off the hook to say it s not their fault and that they are a victim
as one mastermind behind the lawsuits against the food industry has stated if the legislatures wo nt legislate then the trial lawyers will litigate madam chairman the personal responsibility in food consumption act will help preserve the separation of powers support the principle of personal responsibility and help protect the largest private sector employer in the united states
mr chairman i oppose this amendment but support the underlying bill hr 554 the personal responsibility in food consumption act
it is an important piece of legislation that continues a series of tort reform measures considered in congress this year
in general the bill prohibits weight gain related claims against the food industry
i remember in 2002 when individuals filed a lawsuit against mcdonald s alleging that the fast food chain had made them overweight and unhealthy
now there are suits against all types of the 900 000 restaurants in the food industry from small local eateries to giant fast food chains
in recent years we have seen fast food chains add more healthy choices like salad and fruit to their menus but people should have the freedom to eat what they want
mr chairman we should encourage personal responsibility and healthy eating in our society but we should not encourage lawsuits that blame others for our own choices and that could bankrupt entire industries
because americans should have the freedom to eat what they want and because we should take responsibility for our own actions i support the passage of the personal responsibility in food consumption act
the points i want to make are really more in the spirit of questions
but i do have some questions and i think i will just present them in my comments and if somebody wants to comment on them they can
it is very deliberately written i believe to include all food additives no matter how small amounts and the fact that the great majority of food additives have zero caloric intake and would have no relationship to obesity i think that is a flaw in the bill
that could have been for example from a food additive maybe a cause that was not known to the public of some kind of additive in something that they had eaten or drank
or the hypothetical perhaps you have something that is actually a heart poison from some food additive that has no calories in it zero calories in it but over a period of time does bad things to the ability of under this bill which i believe is so broadly written it would include those kinds of situations
the word calorie or caloric intake or caloric content is nowhere in this bill and i again refer my colleagues it is not in the bill itself you have to go to the code the term food means articles used for food or drink for man or other animals chewing gum and articles used for components of any such article
anything you drink anything in it regardless of caloric intake is covered by this bill
i think this is probably one of the reasons why it died in the senate and will die again but i would encourage people to look at these kinds of details if there is intent to move this bill forward
mr chairman i rise in opposition to the personal responsibility in food consumption act because i do nt think that any industry should have the right to conduct its business without the oversight of the judicial system
in other words the muchfeared milliondollar settlement for someone who eats 12 big macs a day is not going to happen
that s why there are only a few obesity cases in court right now and why the only reason we re considering this bill today is because the wellheeled mcdonald s corporation does nt want to face a legitimate lawsuit for false advertising
we would nt want judges to ban us from holding hearings and nor should we ban them from hearing cases even more important than the issue of obesity or congressional meddling in the judicial branch is the fundamental right of every american to have their day in court
madam chairman i rise in opposition to this legislation
i rise in opposition to the bill because i think it is an overreaction and indeed i think it is perhaps an ultimate attestation to the fact that many of my colleagues have lost confidence and faith in the legal system on the one hand or that regardless of what the legal system does if it does not yield for them the result that they are seeking they are willing to compromise any principle that they have professed to stand for to achieve the result that they wish to achieve
even worse the bill bans these lawsuits in a retroactive way
in short in the considered judgment of each of these 18 state legislatures laws have been enacted that best serve their states
it also disrupts the process in some states that have combined obesity bills with menu labeling requirements as part of their overall health enhancing legislative scheme
have we lost confidence in our state and federal court systems that have systematically thrown out most of the lawsuits that have been filed against the food industry using this fat theory as it is commonly referred to
have we lost confidence in our whole federalist form of government in which tort law has been particularly the province of the states
have we lost confidence in our state legislatures that are in the middle of responding in their particular states to any problems that may be on the horizon in this area
we have instead cast ourselves as the imperial congress because the same people who came to this congress saying that they believe in states rights have now shown they do not care about states rights
there is another bill right behind this one that will be up today or tomorrow that does the same thing in the gun context
it will be like a tree falling in the forest
this bill insulates an entire industry from liability and more importantly it undermines our state judicial and legislative systems that should be and are in the process of dealing with this to the extent that they have identified it as a problem
in that sense the bill represents yet another arrogant attempt by this congress to impose its will on the states and i urge my colleagues to get a grip and understand what we are about to do here
some of us are frustrated by some of the litigation that has taken place in this area
i am not a fan of fat litigation either but sometimes we have to be patient enough in a legislative body to let the institutions that are supposed to work work
most of the lawsuits that have been filed in this area have been dismissed
mr chairman there are 26 pending laws out there in the states
i thought that is what my colleagues who are supporting this bill believed in more heartily than anything else they came to congress to talk about
what are we doing to states rights here in an area that throughout history has been the province of the states
we can not be so intent on getting a particular result so resultsoriented that we disregard everything that we have set up in place to deal with problems of this kind our judiciary our state legislatures our common sense
unfortunately this one makes a bad bill actually worse than it was originally drawn and it does so in this way
there are already pleading requirements in every state and basically what this amendment does is make those pleading requirements higher for the food industry than for anybody else in america
and in essence where you end up is that lawyers who represent people who are claiming to have a cause of action are not only now under this language called upon to represent their clients and make a reasonable effort to determine whether there is a basis for their claim they have to be the jury also
in the meantime some dietary supplement companies stopped making ephedra products because of the mounting litigation
it allows them to sell dangerous products to americans without ever having to take responsibility in a court of law and our amendment would close the dietary supplement loophole
i know that the argument on the other side is that we want people to take personal responsibility but is it fair to say that there is personal responsibility when a company hides thousands of serious adverse effects as was the case with a company that had a product with ephedra in it or when a company does not warn about its risks when companies know about dangers and do not market their product responsibly
we are not talking about in this situation a food product that may be heavy in fat or may have cholesterol or whatever
people should expect in eating foods generally recognized as safe that if they abuse their eating habits they are responsible for it
a food supplement a dietary supplement in the form of a pill or some other process is like a drug and i do not think we would want people to be subjected to no lawsuit that is legitimate if the drug has never been approved and never warned about by the manufacturer
mr chairman i rise today in strong support of hr 554 the personal responsibility in food consumption act
as a physician and just as someone who can read the data i can tell you that we have an epidemic of obesity in this country
the most important step we can take to curb obesity is to impart to everyone in this country that obesity can be controlled when we take personal responsibility
i support this legislation because it sends the message to everyone in the united states young and old that taking control of your weight is your responsibility and taking personal responsibility is the only way that weight control can be achieved
we now have precious few legislative days left on the calendar and an everexpanding list of legislative priorities yet the majority leadership has decided to take up a bill that preempts a handful of obesity lawsuits that are already being effectively handled in the courts
in touting the merits of hr 554 my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have cited the need for american people to take responsibility for what they eat and how they live
mr speaker obesity is one of the great health epidemics in the united states and as today s debate will show it continues to go ignored
if you talk to any health professional in the country whether it be the director of the national institutes of health or a nurse at a local clinic they will tell you that our health care system is on an unsustainable path especially when it comes to obesity
obesity is the number one preventable cause of death in america
as members of congress we need to take personal responsibility for the trajectory of the health care system in the united states
the obesity epidemic in the united states should spur this congress into action
i recently visited a dialysis center in my hometown of sacramento california earlier this year
in its late stages it limits terribly one s quality of life
according to the centers for disease control health care costs related to obesity are costing us more than 117 billion annually and much more in damage to our citizens quality of life
it will mean taking a hard look at whether our public schools are up to the test in terms of offering nutritious meals and physical education classes for everyone
in the shortterm the easy path is to dodge this whole debate to pass this tort reform measure and walk away from the discussion
regardless of what happens with this legislation today america s health care system will still be in dire need of responsible leadership
i think i have voted on it a number of times in the past
i urge my colleagues to support this bill because it is a sad reality that legitimate industries in this country need special protection against entities that are looking to make money to provide new sources of revenue outside of the tax base and other ways of looking for people that can afford to settle on cases that they would never ever settle on under any other circumstance
i rise in support of s 397 the protection of lawful commerce in firearms act
the bill is very similar to a house bill that i joined with the gentleman from florida mr stearns xz4003880 in sponsoring earlier this year
frustrated that congress and most state legislatures have rejected repeated attempts to have gun control imposed some have now turned to the courts in their effort to limit the legal availability of firearms
they should not be restricted in their future purchases because the threat of lawsuits has rendered the american market economically unattractive for the manufacturers
while the bill before us will prohibit lawsuits against manufacturers and others in the chain of distribution based upon misuse of the firearm it does not interfere with traditional remedies for damages resulting from defects or design in the manufacture of products
mr speaker i rise today in support of the protection of lawful commerce in arms act
it is critical that the house once again pass this legislation in order to reduce the burden of unsubstantiated lawsuits and the infringement on our second amendment rights
i stand in support of this legislation and i will work to see that the second amendment right of our citizens to protect themselves will not be infringed upon
they have tried and failed to accomplish this in the people s house and in state legislatures
these lawsuits rest on the misguided notion that those in the firearm industry are liable for the criminal misuse of their products
it is important to every firearm owner in the state of wyoming that these lawsuits stop
the protection of lawful commerce in arms act will stop these lawsuits while protecting causes of action based on negligence defective product and other valid claims
mr speaker i rise today in opposition to s 397 the protection of lawful commerce in arms act
advocates of this bill believe that it is necessary to pass in order to prevent the rise of frivolous lawsuits against companies that manufacture and distribute firearms
since 2000 we have witnessed a 9 percent increase in gunrelated homicides
in 2003 firearms were used in over 365 000 cases of violent crime
when guns and ammunitions reach the wrong hands we must be able to hold accountable the companies that put destructive weapons in the hands of these criminals
for cases of gun violence in which the firearms industry should be held responsible this resolution does not protect its victims
in past years state and federal courts have found these types of cases to be grounded in such credible legal principles as negligence product liability and public nuisance
mr speaker i rise in strong opposition to s 397 the gun manufacturers liability protection act
shielding gun manufacturers dealers and distributors from liability is one of the most egregious forms of corporate welfare we ve considered in this house all year
in july of this year we gift wrapped a provision in the medical malpractice bill that shielded the pharmaceutical industry from liability on any drug that made it through the regular fda approval process
thanks to this congress americans can continue to exercise their constitutional right to seek redress in the court system unless it involves guns or drugs
we fought hard for these ideas in the clinton administration and i urge my colleagues to resist any pressure to have them removed
mr speaker this bill denies americans one of their most basic rights in order to provide special protections for a very special interest
mr speaker i rise in strong opposition to this bill
for god s sake who in this country needs to own armorpiercing bullets
madam speaker before we open debate on the rule for s 397 the protection of lawful commerce in arms act prohibiting frivolous lawsuits against the firearm industry i would like to say that our nation s judicial system is out of control
indeed some lawsuits are motivated by ideology and a distaste for the firearm industry and guns in general
so it is important to note that s 397 the protection of lawful commerce in arms act does allow the following types of lawsuits to be filed number 1 an action against a person who transfers a firearm or ammunition knowing that it will be used to commit a crime of violence or drug trafficking crime or comparable or identical state felony law secondly an action brought against the seller for negligent entrustment third actions in which a manufacturer or seller of a qualified product violates a state or federal statute applicable to sales or marketing when such violation was a proximate cause of the harm for which relief is sought
this exception would specifically allow lawsuits against firearms dealers such as the dealer whose firearm ended up in the hands of the dc
fourth actions for breach of contract or warranty in connection with the purchase of a firearm or ammunition and fifth actions for damages resulting directly from a defect in design or manufacture of a firearm or ammunition
i want to point out madam speaker to the gentleman from florida my good friend regarding this particular legislation s 397 we have in this body not just in the 109th this year passed very very similar almost identical legislation and there were some 11 amendments i think offered during the markup in the committee on the judiciary
in fact at least one member of the committee from the other party from the minority party voted against most of those amendments and voted in favor of favorably reporting this bill
this bill also was passed in the 108th congress hr 1036
mr speaker in response to the gentleman from massachusetts mr mcgovern xz4002630 i want to point out that this bill prohibits lawsuits against a manufacturer or seller of a firearm or ammunition or notforprofit trade association for damages resulting from the criminal or unlawful misuse of a firearm or ammunition
but it provides as i said in my opening remarks mr speaker five exceptions to this liability protection including and i will just mention one in response to my good friend from massachusetts
snipers were successful in court on these grounds
any of these tools used in an irresponsible manner and used contrary to their attending purpose can hurt and yes even kill others
the protection of lawful commerce in arms act is a bill to curb our lawsuitfriendly and yes sometimes abusive society and to protect lawabiding citizens from individuals who avoid responsibility and undermine the good faith of our legal system
although america s first gun manufacturer springfield armory went out of business in 1968 we still have to protect america s remaining lawabiding companies who conduct business in a responsible and in a lawful manner
it would be a tragedy for a nation with such a rich and innovative history in manufacturing to have our police and military carry over foreignengineered firearms
mr speaker i encourage passage of this rule and passage of the protection of lawful commerce in arms act
mr speaker i rise in strong support of s 397 the protection of lawful commerce in arms act and thank the chairman of the judiciary committee the gentleman from wisconsin for bringing this legislation forward
recently more than 30 cities and counties have filed lawsuits against the firearms industry alleging that the industry is liable for the actions of third parties including those that use lawful firearms in a criminal manner
this bill will help to put an end to the judiciary legislating in the firearms field
as oliver wendall holmes stated in an 1894 harvard law review article why is not a man who sells firearms answerable for assaults committed with pistols bought of him since he must be taken to know the probability that sooner or later someone will buy a pistol of him for some unlawful end
the principle seems to be pretty well established in this country at least that everyone has a right to rely upon his fellow man acting lawfully
the house has passed the protection of lawful commerce in arms act on several occasions
mr speaker i rise today in support of the protection of lawful commerce in arms act
over the last few years trial lawyers have filed suit against firearms manufacturers across the country in the hopes of bankrupting the industry
these frivolous lawsuits are often based on the dubious premise that gun manufacturers should be held liable for the actions of others who use their products in a criminal or unlawful manner
contrary to many rumors this bill will not prevent legitimate victims from having their day in court for cases involving defective firearms breaches of contract criminal behavior by a gun maker or dealer or the negligent entrustment of a firearm to an irresponsible person
mr speaker while i have serious concerns about the trigger lock language added to this bill in the senate the protection of lawful commerce in arms act is an important step in the right direction
mr speaker i rise in support of the protection of lawful commerce in arms act
a lawsuit against a gun manufacturer simply for being a gun manufacturer has no business in american courts
i am proud that every court in our judicial system has agreed with that and has thrown out these frivolous lawsuits
however in us courts we have the american rule where each side pays their own legal fees under normal circumstances instead of the english rule where the loser usually pays
some people in this country are politically opposed to the firearm industry and believe most firearms should be illegal or hard to obtain
so these folks do not have a problem spending nonprofit money and public money on a losing lawsuit in pursuit of ideology
however that is not fair to the firearm industry which is not only completely legal but has the right to own their product enshrined in the us constitution
therefore it is particularly bad that the firearm industry has had to pay 200 million to defend themselves from frivolous lawsuits that have never ever succeeded in court
i rise in support of the rule
in pennsylvania philadelphia attempted to claim public nuisance violations of firearm manufacturers but a reasonable court dismissed the claim stating that the city s charges were a theory in search of a case firearm manufacturers have a timehonored tradition of acting responsibly
in addition the gun industry plays a large role in my state of pennsylvania in our economy
these lawsuits which attempt to blame the firearms industry for crimes committed by criminals who misuse their products have already cost this industry more than 100 million in attorneys fees and a suit against the industry has yet to win
senators santorum and specter have both cosponsored the senate version of this bill which passed the senate in july
president bush has indicated his support for this legislation and i look forward to this bill coming to the floor so that we can pass it in the house and its being signed and becoming law so that our american firearms industry will not be subjected to potentially bankrupting lawsuits
a study by the atf in june of 2000 documented 1 700 federal and state gun law prosecutions and 1 000 verdicts from july 1996 to december of 1999 while there were nearly 500 000 gun crimes committed annually
madam speaker i rise today in strong opposition to this closed rule and the underlying legislation
my friends in the majority are again bringing to the floor a rule that blocks debate in the body before it begins
that was not made in order
under this rule however not one of these amendments or any of the five other commonsense amendments offered by democrats in the committee on rules last night will be given any consideration by the full house
the remaining cases are still in court and i gather that this legislation contemplates eliminating those citizens rights to be in court
in fact several state appeals and supreme courts have also ruled that gun manufacturers and dealers can be held liable for the reasonably foreseeable use of firearms for criminal purposes
how many times do we have to see a baby with a gun in its hand or at its head or killing some member of the family before we get to safety modifications
the ruling in the dc
other rulings have resulted in major crackdowns on straw purchases where legally purchased guns are resold to individuals unable to lawfully purchase a weapon on their own
in each of these instances it is beyond fair to say that they were not frivolous lawsuits
perhaps my friends in the majority can help me understand what is so unreasonable in requiring an industry that produces a product with the sole purpose of killing to take the necessary precautions to protect public safety and is it our belief that the american judicial system is incapable of properly dismissing lawsuits that are both unreasonable and overzealous
republicans are using the legislative process in an attempt to penalize attorneys and trial lawyers historically supporters of democrats who hold the gun lobby a major campaign contributor to my friends in the majority accountable for its actions
i implore my colleagues to reject this rule and the underlying legislation and i would say to my good friend the gentleman from georgia mr gingrey xz4001510 that i know of nothing in my makeup that would cause me at any point in time to want to do anything in derogation of the rights of american citizens under the united states constitution
mr speaker i would urge my colleague that just spoke that the many people that i know and they are numerous in my state and elsewhere that were killed by guns and are advocates against guns are not fanatics
additionally i thought i made it clear i wish to make it clear again that insofar as the second amendment is concerned everyone that i know in this body is protective of a person s right to own a gun
mr speaker just in case people think that it is only those of us who believe in our legal system that are opposed to this particular measure i have in hand a letter from law enforcement s opposition to hr 800 and here is what it says dear representative as active and retired law enforcement officers we are writing to urge your strong opposition to any legislation granting the gun industry special legal immunity
on january 12 2001 officers mcguire and lemongello were shot in the line of duty with a trafficked gun negligently sold by a west virginia dealer
the dealer had sold the gun along with 11 other guns in a cash sale to a straw buyer for a gun trafficker
in june of 2004 the officers obtained a 1 million settlement from the dealer
instead of honoring them for their service legislation granting immunity to the gun industry would deprive them of their basic rights as american citizens to prove their case in a court of law
we stand with officers mcguire and lemongello in urging you to oppose this legislation it is signed by the international brotherhood of police officers the major cities chiefs association the hispanic american police command officers association the police foundation the michigan association of chiefs of police chiefs of police from new jersey ohio massachusetts nevada california new york north carolina maine oklahoma texas missouri rhode island and kansas and virginia and countless others that time will not permit me to add
if police officers who are out there protecting us can not find the protection in this house of representatives from bullets or armorpiercing bullets and we are going to protect people who manufacture that stuff from having legal suits brought against them some that may be dismissed some that may be won some that may be lost but it is an american right just like that second amendment is an american right that i will go to my grave believing in but i will go with these police officers in believing that it is wrong to deny people an opportunity to take their matter to court and have it decided appropriately by a court of law and juries of their peers who are all 435 of our constituents
in addition to what is wrong is this system is wrong
mr speaker i rise today to express my concern over s 397 the protection of lawful commerce in arms act
when i was in the california state assembly i chaired the public safety committee where i worked to pass sensible gun safety legislation and i have voted to ban assault weapons
the legislation also requires the immediate dismissal of pending lawsuits even cases in which a court has found the suit to be meritorious
in recent years dozens of individuals and municipalities have filed lawsuits against gun manufacturers for damages caused by gun violence
the bill would even restrict many cases in which a product defect is at issue
furthermore lawsuits brought on behalf of officers injured or killed in the line of duty by guns negligently sold by dealers would be barred
mr speaker i do not believe that manufacturers or sellers of weapons should be liable for injuries which result from the use of their products in criminal ways simply because they produce and distribute their products
the manufacture distribution and sale of firearms is legal in our nation
and unless a manufacturer or seller of arms acts in some wrongful or criminal way holding them liable effectively as insurers i believe is inappropriate and probably a violator of the constitution s commerce clause
for example i believe that the lawsuit pending in federal court between the district of columbia and beretta and other gun manufacturers is an example of a claim that would effectively make gun manufacturers insurers for wrongful conduct
i expect the manufacturers to prevail in that case
however the bill before us goes beyond this premise and overreaches in key respects
first i oppose the look back provision in this bill that requires the immediate dismissal of civil liability lawsuits against gun manufacturers that are pending on the date of enactment
this is tantamount to changing the rules in the middle of the game and i generally believe this approach is inappropriate
i do believe in the second amendment the bill of rights that indicates that you are allowed to bear arms but this legislation has nothing to do with the first or the second amendments freedom of expression or the right to bear arms
more than 10 years ago as a member of the houston city council i passed the first gun safety legislation that held parents responsible for guns in their homes that children were then able to take and cause a tragedy
in fact it has been noted that it saved lives and saved dollars
here we now have legislation with a blocked rule that suggests that no one can sue no one can bring a suit of liability against gun manufacturers and we are now suggesting that this is embedded in the likes and the hearts of the second amendment
is it the second amendment that says to a philadelphia mother who won a settlement of only 850 000 from a gun dealer who negligently sold multiple guns to a gun trafficker a child found one of the guns on a street in philadelphia and accidently shot the mother s 7yearold son is there some reason mr speaker we should not have these kinds of lawsuits
is there some reason mr speaker that this now putting forward only a negligence per se exception will in fact disallow states like arkansas louisiana maine massachusetts nebraska north dakota rhode island vermont washington west virginia the citizens in those particular states can not sue at all because they can not meet the standard because there is no such standard as negligence per se
in my own state of texas a san antonio police officer named hector garza was brutally murdered when he responded to a family violence call
the shooter also murdered his wife and shot his uncle in the leg
mr speaker i oppose this legislation s 397 the protection of lawful commerce in arms act just as i did with my colleagues in the case of hr 800 in the judiciary committee and hr 1036 during the 108th congress
just as in the case of the malignant bankruptcy legislation s 256 that finessed itself to the house floor for consideration and then to passage into law hr 1036 passed in committee body last congress without having given many members the opportunity to have very substantive amendments considered shielded by parliamentary inquiry so too did members have very important proposals to improve this very troubled piece of legislation
s 397 like its predecessor and house companion in the 108th congress seeks to shield irresponsible gun manufacturers vendors dealers distributors and importers from liability under the guise of protection from frivolous lawsuits as the democrats of this committee stated quite eloquently in its dissenting views 10859 courts around the country have recognized that precisely the types of cases that would be barred by this bill are grounded in wellaccepted legal principles including negligence products liability and public nuisance
these courts have held that those who make and sell guns like all others in society are obligated to use reasonable care in selling and designing their product and that they may be liable for the foreseeable injurious consequences of their failure to do so even if those foreseeable consequences include unlawful conduct by third parties
in the past iteration of this legislation i offered an amendment that would exempt from the scope of the bill any lawsuit brought by a plaintiff who was harmed as the result of an unlawful transfer of a machine gun semiautomatic assault weapon or large capacity ammunition feeding device
the us code in section 922 of title 18 makes it unlawful for a person from transfer or possess a machine gun semiautomatic assault weapon or large capacity ammunition feeding device
in addition before the committee on rules earlier this week i joined my colleague from california ms lofgren xz4002450 in offering an amendment captioned lofgre x044 that proposes an additional exception to the definition of qualified civil liability action for law enforcement officers acting in that capacity
the de minimis effort that we as legislators can give is to protect legitimate claims filed by them in connection with the use of firearms
the amendment did not say that gun dealers should be liable simply because they sold a gun that was used in a crime nor does it say that the families of all 297 officers shot to death between 1997 and 2001 should be able to recover
it would not have protected mr lemongello who brought his suit in a state that does not recognize the doctrine of negligence per se
i would also point out more than 30 000 gun deaths occur each year so the almost blanket immunization from suit proposed in this legislation represents nothing more than an unwarranted and unjust special interest giveaway to the powerful gun lobby and a shameful attack on the legal rights of countless innocent victims of gun violence
the lofgrenjackson lee amendment would have protected the right to sue for members of the law enforcement community along with their spouses or next of kin in the event of their wrongful death
it makes no sense that the sellers of weapons that have been banned by congress can avoid civil liability when the guns they sell are used in crimes
the deadly characteristics of semiautomatic weapons and assault rifles was tragically illustrated in my home state of texas
the shooter also murdered his wife and shot his uncle in the leg
under this amendment the victims of gun violence will not have to wait for a criminal conviction in order to seek justice
in addition i will offer an amendment that will exempt from the scope of the bill those lawsuits involving injury or death to minors under the age of 16
however none of the exceptions in the bill protects the rights of minors or the parents of minors to sue for civil damages when a minor is injured or killed by a gun that is negligently or recklessly manufactured or distributed
when they fail to do so they should be held accountable in a court of law
gun manufacturers and merchants should be liable in courts of law when their negligent acts result in the death or injury to a minor
mr speaker let me mention that the gentleman from maryland mr van hollen xz4004150 has a long and prominent history in knowing the laws of this nation in his earlier life and as well rendering them in the proper manner
and i want to follow the comments that you made about the amendments offered in the committee and as well make mention of the fact of the kind of complete reckless if you will lacking of sensitivity to putting forward real balanced legislation
in our dissenting views the democrats of this committee mentioned courts around the country and by the way there are views about gun safety across the aisle
but courts around the country have recognized that precisely the types of cases that would be barred by this bill are grounded in wellaccepted legal principles including negligence products liability and public nuisance
these courts have held that those who make and sell guns like all others in society are obligated to use reasonable care in selling and designing their products and that they may be liable for foreseeable injurious consequences
and therefore the manufacturer does have some liability in it
and even in this climate of homeland security it is well known that our first responders need to be protected by the reckless use of machine guns and ak47s
it turns a blind eye to the sniper in washington to the philadelphia mother
mr speaker i rise in opposition to s 397 the protection of lawful commerce in arms act
this bill prohibits civil liability lawsuits against gun manufacturers from being brought in federal or state court
i am also concerned that we have prohibited suits from being brought in both federal and state courts and that police officers shot in the line of duty are barred from filing lawsuits
yet over the years i have seen democracy especially in this great house deteriorate continuously
this is not the democracy that i learned about when i was in school or the democracy that i believed in as i became an adult
last night in the rules committee the majority voted against protecting police officers and voted to make it easier for felons to get guns
that was used in the shooting back in 1993 that killed my husband and wounded my son
i believe in the second amendment
and yet because of the way the states do not keep records we have people that are not in the nics system
what i want to do is make sure that every state can come to the speed that they should be when someone is found guilty in court and they are being adjudicated to prison that their rights of being able to buy a gun are taken away
you want to talk about that we have terrorists in this country and we have a terrorist list but they are allowed to buy guns
now again we keep hearing the rhetoric that goes back and forth in this hall all of the time that we are trying to take away the right of people to own guns
but we can have gun safety issues put out into place so that we can bring down the number of 30 000 people killed in this country every year so we can bring down the 100 billion that is spent every year on health care loss of productivity and using our police
in a decade we have had over 15 million lawsuits
and for this and every other issue that we are taking away the right of victims to be able to have their day in court
and yet this body with our republican friends wants to take away the rights of people to have their day in court
the legislation in front of us as far as i am concerned is frivolous
when we think about the millions and millions of lawsuits that have been filed over the last 10 years only 57 have actually involved the gun industry 57 and for that we are taking time up here in congress
may i remind many of my colleagues that the nra has put extraordinary pressure on members and certainly even in the states
we know that the gun industry when they ship the guns to gun dealers and then a gun is used in the commission of a crime through the tracing it goes back to the gun dealer to say that this store bought the gun from here
in new york state over 60 percent of the guns used in crime are traced back to the manufacturers
but again 1 percent is causing over 60 percent of the harm in this nation
but again it comes down to where the victims should be allowed to have their day in court
my colleagues say that we can have our day in court
the states that have the right through their attorneys general to sue the gun manufacturers should have their day in court
we are not looking to take the right of someone to own a gun but the gun industry and these bad dealers are costing this country over 100 billion in health care every single year and here we are going to give them blanket immunity
madam speaker on christmas eve in 1999 in my hometown of worcester massachusetts 26yearold danny guzman was shot and killed
according to the police one of the employees had been hired by kahr to work in its worcester manufacturing facility despite the fact that he had a long history of drug addiction theft to support that addiction alcohol abuse and violence including several assault and battery charges
police determined that the guns were stolen from kahr before the weapons had serial numbers stamped on them and were then resold to criminals in exchange for money and drugs
in march 2000 police arrested a man who pled guilty to the gun thefts
this is just one of the many stories that illustrate the reckless and irresponsible nature of many not all but many in the gun industry
i have to believe that gun owners all across this country would not object to ensuring that gun manufacturers allow for more responsible practices in terms of protecting what they manufacture
and it is our understanding based on my conversations with members of the judiciary committee that in fact this would not be covered
in that same year over 25 000 guns hit america s streets after being stolen or lost under suspicious circumstances
and according to court testimony in the case stealing guns happened at the plant all the time and it happened all the time because no system was in place to prevent theft
and in this particular case the employee got his job at the gun plant despite a criminal record that included a history of drug abuse theft and violence
if this bill becomes law the guzman family in massachusetts in addition to losing a husband a son and a father will lose their right of legal recourse and justice
businesses in the firearms industry do not deserve special treatment under the law
i rise in support of the rule
mr speaker when drafting the bill of rights to our constitution our founding fathers guaranteed the right of the people to keep and to bear arms in the second amendment and for 217 years the second amendment has protected our freedom
now unable to accomplish their goals at the ballot box they are targeting arms makers in the courts for the illegal use of their product
this is why the pentagon took the extraordinary step in sending a letter to each member of this house urging the passage of this important legislation
mr speaker i rise today in strong opposition to the protection of lawful commerce in arms act this bill is an attempt to carve out an exclusive liability exemption and its vote on the floor today is a giveback to the gun industry at a significant cost to the american people
in the washingtonarea we are particularly sensitive to gun violence
you may not all remember but our nation was held captive for three weeks in october 2002 while two men systematically killed ten people and wounded three others with a sniper rifle obtained from an irresponsible gun dealer that lost over 200 other unaccounted for guns
the language in this bill is so restrictive that survivors of the victims would not have had any legal recourse against the company whose negligent business practices led to the deaths of their family
almost 30 000 people in our country die from firearm injuries murders and suicides each year
that accounts for the second leading cause of death for young people under 19 in the united states
mr speaker i rise today to add my support to s 397 the protection of lawful commerce in arms act
the protection of lawful commerce in arms act s 397 is bipartisan commonsense legislation that takes an important step toward preventing reckless lawsuits targeting the firearms industry
the bill provides protection for those in the firearms industry from lawsuits arising from the acts of people who criminally or unlawfully misuse their products
in light of the concerted efforts by opponents of the second amendment to destroy the gun industry through frivolous lawsuits it has become imperative that we protect the jobs and economic wellbeing of the thousands of people who work for manufacturers and sellers of firearms and ammunition
congress must work diligently to reduce the level of political rhetoric surrounding gun control protect the second amendment and promote the role of personal responsibility in society
this bill is a key element of our effort to bring some sanity to what s become a thriving personal injury industry in this country
but trial lawyers are eager to cash in on the pain of victims and criminals rarely have deep pockets
i joined my colleagues in the house in passing similar legislation during the 108th congress
that unfortunately got held up in the senate
mr speaker while i sympathize with the original objective of s 397 the protection of lawful commerce in arms act i am forced to oppose this legislation primarily because of unconstitutional gun control amendments added to the bill in the senate
as a firm believer in the second amendment to the united states constitution and an opponent of all federal gun laws i can not support a bill that imposes new unconstitutional gun controls on americans
in fact i have introduced legislation the second amendment protection act hr 1703 which repeals misguided federal gun control laws such as the brady bill
first a section was added to the bill to outlaw any licensed gun importer manufacturer or dealer from selling delivering or transferring a handgun without a secure gun storage or safety device each and any violation of this requirement can result in a person being fined up to 2 500 or having his license revoked
further the severe penalties for noncompliance whether intentional or accidental add yet more weight to the crippling regulations that hang over gun transactions in the united states
just like the democratic congress before it that passed the assault weapons ban the republican congress is poised to give in to antigun rights scare tactics by selectively banning bullets
instead of each gun owner being able to decide what ammunition he uses in his gun federal bureaucrats will make that decision
the armor piercing bullets restriction imposes a 15 years mandatory minimum sentence for just carrying or possessing such bullets even without a gun during or in relation to a crime of violence or drug trafficking
further it does not take much imagination to see how such a provision could be used by an antigun prosecutor in the prosecution of an individual who used a gun in self defense especially considering that use of such bullets to murder can result in a death sentence
in such instances a defendant who exercised self defense may well accept a guilty plea bargain to avoid the severe enhanced penalties imposed under s 397
last month i wrote to house speaker dennis hastert majority leader tom delay and committee on the judiciary chairman james sensenbrenner of my opposition to these antigun rights provisions in s 397
the house voting for hr 800 would allow the differences between hr 800 and s 397 to be reconciled in conference committee
in conference every expectation would be that the new gun control provisions would be stripped from the legislation given that the original unamended s 397 had 62 senate sponsors and cosponsors a filibuster proof majority in the senate
the right to keep and bear arms is enshrined in the second amendment of the constitution of the united states and the protection of lawful commerce in arms act today will reaffirm our nation s ability to keep bear and manufacture lawful firearms in the united states of america
but throughout the history of tort law in this nation we have built on the principle of individual responsibility in which a product may not be defined as defective unless there is something wrong with the product not with the way that it is used
the progeny of cases that have emerged in recent years against gun manufacturers flies in the face of both our constitution as well as the history of common law and its tradition
while this bill cites in its findings that the second amendment protects the right of individuals to bear arms there has been a definitive resolution by the courts of just what right the second amendment protects
in united states v miller the supreme court wrote in 1939 that the obvious purpose of the right to keep and bear arms in the second amendment was to assure the continuation and render possible the effectiveness of state militias and that the guarantee of that right must be interpreted and applied with that end in view this language was a clear indication that the second amendment right to bear arms guarantees the right of the people to maintain effective state militias but does not provide any type of individual right to own or possess weapons
mr speaker for more than sixty years following the supreme court s decision in miller there was little judicial debate regarding the scope of the second amendment
in fact virtually every federal appeals court has decided this issue and only one the fifth circuit in united states v emerson has endorsed the individual rights view
since the emerson opinion in 2001 which was joined by only two circuit court judges and actually upheld the gun law at issue the individual rights view has been rejected by the fourth sixth seventh ninth and tenth circuits
in 1984 in the second circuit the court cited miller for the proposition that the right to possess a gun was not a fundamental right because the second amendment did not guarantee the right to keep and bear a weapon unless the evidence showed the firearm had some reasonable relationship to the preservation or efficiency of a well regulated militia us v toner
in 1996 in the third circuit defendant s possession of machine guns did not have a connection with militiarelated activity required for second amendment protections to apply us v rybar
the sixth circuit in 2000 held that the lower courts have uniformly held that the second amendment preserves a collective rather than an individual right us v napier
the seventh circuit the second amendment establishes no right to possess a firearm apart from the role possession of the gun might play in maintaining a state militia
the ninth circuit in 2003 stated that it is this collective rights model which provides the best interpretation of the second amendment silveira v lockyer
the tenth circuit a 1977 case to apply the amendment so as to guarantee an appellant s right to keep an unregistered firearm which has not been shown to have any connection with the militia merely because he is technically a member of the kansas militia would be unjustifiable in terms of either logic or policy us v oakes
requiring a conviction before an offender can be sued for the civil consequences of his unlawful acts would constitute an extraordinary change in traditional civil liability standards
the public will remember that oj simpson was found civilly liable for damages even though he had been acquitted in criminal court
moreover such a requirement would create absurd results based on what a prosecutor may decide to do in a particular case and when he decides to do it
and even where there is a conviction the timing of the conviction alone may be dispositive of the claim because there is nothing in the bill or the law which tolls the statute of limitations on a civil claim pending a conviction
and there is nothing in the bill to deal with what happens if the conviction is reversed or appeal
absent a conviction the unlawful transfer still must be proven in order to pursue the case
in re atkinson 291 nw2d 396 minn
mr speaker i rise in support of s 397 the protection of lawful commerce in arms act
the committee on the judiciary considered and favorably reported hr 800 in may of this year
just like hr 800 and similar legislation that passed the house by more than a twothirds majority during the last congress s 397 will stop frivolous and abusive lawsuits against manufacturers and sellers of firearms or ammunition by prohibiting lawsuits resulting from the criminal and unlawful misuse of their products from being filed in federal and state courts
third the bill includes several additional exceptions including an exception for actions in which a manufacturer or seller of a qualified product knowingly violates any state or federal statute applicable to sales or marketing when such violation was the proximate cause of the harm for which relief is sought
finally the bill contains additional exceptions for breach of contract or warranty in connection with the purchase of a firearm or ammunition and an exception for actions for damages resulting directly from a defect in design or manufacture of a firearm or ammunition
recent trends in abusive litigation have inspired lawsuits against the firearms industry on the theory of liability that would hold it financially responsible for the actions of those who use their products in a criminal or unlawful manner
such lawsuits threaten to rip tort law from its moorings in personal responsibility and may force firearms manufacturers into bankruptcy
a new york appeals court stated recently that courts are the least suited least equipped and thus the least appropriate branch of government to regulate and micromanage the manufacturing marketing distribution and sale of handguns law enforcement military personnel rely on the domestic firearms industry to supply them with reliable and accurate weapons that can best protect them in the line of fire
one abusive lawsuit filed in a single county could destroy a national industry and deny citizens nationwide the right to keep and bear arms guaranteed by the constitution
insofar as these lawsuits have the practical effect of burdening interstate commerce in firearms congress has the authority to act under the commerce clause of the constitution
the lawful commerce in arms act by prohibiting abusive lawsuits against the firearms industry supports core federalism principles articulated by the united states supreme court which has made it clear that one state s power to impose burdens on the interstate market
anyone who actually reads this bill will immediately realize that that claim is patently false and it is important to note that some of the editorial pundits apparently do not believe in reading the bills before they write and publish
under s 397 a plaintiff would be permitted to conduct discovery to establish the facts and circumstances surrounding what happened to the firearm while in the possession custody and control of the dealer and how it came into the possession of the criminal shooters
a plaintiff would be permitted to have his or her day in court to try to establish whether the dealer knowingly violated or made any false entry in or failed to make an appropriate entry in his records which he is required to keep pursuant to federal law
these initial 300plus unaccounted for firearms are considered instances of failure to timely record disposition information in the bound record book so under s 397 a lawsuit against that dealer could go forward and i include this report in the record at this point
aft officers will prepare this form in quadruplicate
additionally 5 firearms transfers to nonlicensed individuals were located in your computer sales records for which you had no atf form 4473s
date planned correction corrective action the licensee shall endeavor to locate the required disposition records such as atf f4473s in order to show evidence that a proper transfer occurred
failure to keep atf f4473s in alphabetical chronological or numerical order

failure to record dispositions made in the bound books
these initial 300 unaccounted for firearms are considered instances of failure to timely record disposition information in the bound record book
of licensing with no bound book entries at least 10 dispositions to other licensees unrecorded and at least 6 dispositions to nonlicensees located in computer sales records that have no proper disposition
see list of firearms that no atf f 4473s have been located on but other records of transfer have been such as 25 firearms identified by the washington department of licensing and computer records indicating a sale but no other information in regards to the transfer
in addition the licensee will annotate the bound book disposition entries with date name and address and note that no atf f 4473 exists
report bushmaster rifle model pcwa3x serial number l284320 on an atf f f331011 licensee theftloss report and make note in the bound book
tort law however rests upon a foundation of individual responsibility in which the product may not be defined as defective unless there is something wrong with the product rather than with the product s user
and what this bill attempts to do is to get tort law back to its original moorings where the manufacturer of the product that is not defective in its nature is not legally liable for the criminal misuse of that product by its user
that is what the issue is before the house today in consideration of s 397
the bill allows the following types of lawsuits to be filed first an action against a person who transfers a firearm or ammunition knowing that it will be used to commit a crime of violence or drugtrafficking crime or a comparable or identical state felony law second an action brought against the seller for negligent entrustment or negligence per se third actions in which a manufacturer or seller of a qualified product violates a state or federal statute applicable to the sales or marketing when such violation was the proximate cause of the harm for which the relief is sought
and this exception would specifically allow lawsuits against firearms dealers such as the dealer whose firearm ended up in the hands of the dc
snipers and those who fail to maintain the required inventory lists necessary to ensure they are alerted to any firearms theft fourth actions for breach of contact or warranty in connection with the purchase of a firearm or ammunition and actions for damages resulting directly from a defect in design or manufacture of a firearm or ammunition
it provides immunity for people who have not done anything wrong even thought their products may be used in a criminal nature but it does allow lawsuits to proceed against the bad actors
today firearms are found in half of all texas households
a state law similar to s 397 which protects the gun industry from frivolous lawsuits in fact is already in effect
our courts are already overloaded with frivolous lawsuits designed to topple industries that manufacture products a few individuals in our society have decided are not safe or appropriate for americans to have
mr speaker i rise in opposition to the socalled protection of lawful commerce in arms act because i do nt believe that giving gun makers gun dealers and gun trade associations special exemption from lawsuits makes our streets any safer
if this law had been in place the families of victims of the dcarea sniper could never have held negligent suppliers accountable
in september 2004 eight victims received a settlement from the dealer that lost the snipers assault rifle from its inventory along with at least 238 other guns
as if this blatant pandering to an industry responsible for widespread violence and mayhem is nt bad enough this bill also violates the fundamental right of every american to have their day in court
mr speaker i rise today in support of the rule and in support of the underlying bill
it respects in my opinion the legislative process saves taxpayers dollars protects legitimate lawabiding businesses and strengthens our commitment to the second amendment
when i first introduced this bill in 2001 it had 231 cosponsors but never received a vote
the next session we had 250 cosponsors and an overwhelming 285 to 140 vote on the floor but then the bill just died in the other body
so not only is this bill bipartisan in the house and in the senate it is bipartisan in this nation with 33 states both democrats and republicans in the state legislatures and governors signing on to the bills that ultimately became laws
mr speaker i thank the distinguished chairman of the committee on the judiciary for his help in bringing this bill to the floor
he has been a leader on this bill in shepherding it through the committee on the judiciary time and time again
i also want to thank my colleague from virginia mr boucher xz4000430 for introducing this bill with me through the last three sessions of congress and all the other members who have strongly supported the protection of lawful commerce in arms act over the years
this is the united states of america where we are responsible for our own actions but yet these frivolous lawsuits against a vital legitimate and perfectly lawful industry have continued unabated for the last several years in the simple hope of bankrupting this industry
i have three charts here which list in detail these cases
if my colleagues would bear with me i would like to focus on a recent case in this last chart which is circled
this case took place in the county of los angeles california
the fact of the matter is that there are several pending lawsuits which continue to abuse the judicial system and would threaten legitimate lawful businesses including in new york city and right here in the district of columbia
it includes carefully crafted exceptions to allow legitimate victims their day in court for cases involving defective firearms breaches of contract criminal behavior by a gun maker or seller or the negligent entrustment of a firearm to an irresponsible person
in conclusion mr speaker i am pleased that we are voting on this bill
it is with a great deal of satisfaction to the 257 bipartisan cosponsors that this bill hr 800 as amended by the senate and passed by the senate two to one 65 to 31 is poised to pass in this congress as a bipartisan law
i urge my colleagues to join with us in voting for this piece of legislation
however after careful review of the bill and consideration of points raised by its supporters and opponents i have concluded that i can not in good conscience vote for it
i voted against similar legislation in the past because i was not convinced there was a need for congress to take such action to restrict certain lawsuits against the manufacturers and sellers of firearms
and as in the past i am particularly reluctant to support legislation that would go further than barring future lawsuits by requiring the immediate dismissal of cases under active consideration by the courts
it seems to me that this is a dangerous precedent for the legislative branch to undertake and the courts are in a much better position than congress to decide whether the people who have brought those pending cases have valid claims or whether their complaints are frivolous or malicious
and while the bill before us which has already passed the senate differs in some respects from versions we have considered before it too would apply to pending cases
it s true that under current law even actual let alone suspected membership in a terrorist organization by itself is enough to bar someone from purchasing a firearm
mr speaker i know that litigation can be costly and i am not in favor of frivolous lawsuits
nor am i in favor of banning gun ownership or abolishing the domestic gun manufacturing industry
i have also had many informative conversations with many colorado sportsmen and women including some of my staff who make a compelling case that but after a careful reading of the provisions of this legislation and the most objective review that i can make of the arguments for and against its enactment i still think we in the congress should leave it to the courts to decide which of the lawsuits covered by this bill are frivolous and which are not
mr speaker i rise in strong opposition to this dangerous and misguided bill that would exempt gun dealers from liability even when they negligently sell weapons to criminals
it was just 3 years ago this month in october when the community that i represent right outside here of washington dc was terrorized by two snipers who left 10 people dead and three people injured
the snipers obtained their weapons from a negligent gun dealer in washington state
mr speaker i have been struck by how some people in this institution and other places believe that the name given to a bill will somehow fool the american people as to what the bill actually does
this bill has the title on it protection of lawful commerce in arms act
in fact what the bill does is to make lawful many negligent actions that today are unlawful
what it actually does is protect those gun dealers who are engaged in wrongful negligent sales of weapons to criminals
as a result the passage of this bill will make it easier easier for criminals to get weapons and it will ensure that those gun dealers who negligently negligently put guns in the hands of criminals will not be held responsible for their wrongful actions
and it is a sad day mr speaker in this body when special interests and the gun industry exert such influence that they are able to convince the congress to strip innocent victims of crimes of their rights and instead extend protections to those unscrupulous dealers who put guns into the hands of criminals
now proponents of this legislation will tell us that most gun dealers in our nation are honest and law abiding
in fact the bureau of alcohol firearms and tobacco has found that about 1 percent about 1 percent of gun dealers are responsible for nearly 60 percent of the guns that are traced to crimes
the real beneficiaries of this legislation are those small handful of dealers who are negligently putting guns in the hands of criminals
it is giving them a green light to go ahead and say i see nothing when they are engaged in sales to wrongdoers
let us focus for a minute on the victims of gun crimes in our country
the rifle came from bull s eye shooter supply in tacoma washington which had an extensive history of firearms violations and had not reported the rifle as missing as required by federal law because they said they did not know the rifle was missing
if this law had been in effect at that time those victims and their families would have received nothing
in fact this bill was being debated on the floor of this house 3 years ago this month when those killings were going on and this house realized how bad it would look to victimize those people twice to have them victimized once by the snipers and again by the united states congress by denying their day in court and that is why this house decided to withdraw the bill at that time from consideration from the floor of the house
in new jersey june 2004 two former new jersey police officers ken mcguire and dave lemongello were shot in the line of duty with a trafficked gun that had been negligently sold by a west virginia dealer
the dealer had sold the gun along with 11 other handguns in a cash sale to a straw buyer a trafficker someone who got the guns because he could legally obtain them but then turned around and sold them to a criminal who committed the crimes
if this bill had been in effect then that case would have been dismissed and justice for those police officers would have been denied
and because of that many law enforcement officers and organizations have written a letter opposing this bill a copy mr speaker which i will insert in the record
why do we want to make the gun industry the most protected industry in america
in the interest of truth in advertising the real name of this bill should be the protection of negligent gun dealers act i urge my colleagues to oppose this
on january 12 2001 mcguire and lemongello were shot in the line of duty with a trafficked gun negligently sold by a west virginia dealer
the dealer had sold the gun along with 11 other handguns in a cash sale to a straw buyer for a gun trafficker
in june 2004 the officers obtained a 1 million settlement from the dealer
instead of honoring them for their service legislation granting immunity to the gun industry would deprive them of their basic rights as american citizens to prove their case in a court of law
we stand with officers mcguire and lemongello in urging you to oppose such legislation

why change the rules to deny legitimate victims their day in court
mr speaker i yield 3 minutes to my colleague from new york mrs mccarthy xz4002570 who has been such a leader on this important issue in protecting the victims of gun violence
i want to address an issue we have not covered this morning which deals with the question of terrorists trying to get their hands on guns in this country
we know from our reports and records that osama bin laden and other terrorists have said to their terrorist network that they can easily obtain weapons in the united states and we know from a government accountability study from january of this year that between february 3 and june 20 of 2004 35 known or suspected terrorists those are people who are on the terrorist watch list purchased guns in the united states and that from july 1 through october 31 of last year 12 additional people on the terrorist watch list purchased guns in the united states
but that person can then get in their car at the airport go to their local gun store and buy as many semiautomatic weapons as that terrorist wants
i am on the terrorist watch list and i want 12 semiautomatic assault weapons and under this bill if we pass it today we could not hold that gun store owner liable in any way for a wrongful sale
we offered an amendment in committee
we said we do not want to except from lawsuits and liability a seller who knows that the name of the person appears in the violent gang and terrorist organization file maintained by the attorney general and the person subsequently used the qualified product the weapon in the commission of a crime
we had a vote in committee on this amendment
mr speaker i will include in the record the following letters in opposition to s 397
i have read the bill and that is why i offered the amendment in committee
and what the bill says very clearly under negligent entrustment is essentially if the gun dealer knows or should know that the person to whom the product is supplied is likely to use the product in a manner involving unreasonable risk of physical injury
but you know what that is not what the explanation was in committee
in fact i have the committee transcript here and the gentleman from utah mr cannon xz4000590 stated that the reason that they did not want to adopt the amendment was not because the bill already covered that scenario
the attorney general in testimony before our committee said maybe we should think about that
it would close the door on lawsuits by the victims of the snipers in this area
most of those cases were in fact dismissed from the courts
because we want to deny people who bring legitimate suits today people like the families of the sniper victims people like the officers from new jersey the police officers who i must point out again and emphasize obtained settlements in those lawsuits
we have a bill here saying we are going to protect the lawful commerce in arms act which in fact changes the rules to make what is today unlawful lawful
why do we not go about the business of passing legislation to protect the victims of gun violence rather than that small handful of badapple gun dealers who wrongfully and negligently help put the guns in the hands of killers in this country and allow them to go on the kind of rampage that leads to the death of so many people
the killers are in jail
dear senator i am writing on behalf of the american bar association to express our strong opposition to s 397 the protection of lawful commerce in arms act and to similar legislation to enact special tort laws for the firearms industry
the aba opposes s 397 and has opposed similar legislation in the past two congresses because we believe the proposed legislation is overbroad and would unwisely and unnecessarily intrude into an area of traditional state responsibility
the responsibility for setting substantive legal standards for tort actions in each state s courts including standards for negligence and product liability actions has been the province of state legislatures and an integral function of state common law since our nation was founded
s 397 would preempt state substantive law standards for most negligence and product liability actions for this one industry abrogating state law in cases in which the defendant is a gun manufacturer gun seller or gun trade association and would insulate this new class of protected defendants from almost all ordinary civil liability actions
in our view the legitimate concerns of some about the reach of a number of suits filed by cities and state governmental units several years ago have since been answered by the deliberative competent action of state courts and within the traditions of state responsibility for administering tort law
there is no hearing record in congress or other evidence to contradict the fact that the state courts are handling their responsibilities competently in this area of law
there is no data of any kind to support claims made by the industry that it is incurring extraordinary costs due to litigation that it faces a significant number of suits or that current state law is in any way inadequate
the senate has not examined the underlying claims of the industry about state tort cases choosing not to hold a single hearing on s 397 or its predecessor bills in the two previous congresses
proponents of this legislation can not in fact point to a single court decision final judgment or award s 397 proposes to exempt his one industry from state negligence law
negligence laws in all 50 states traditionally impose civil liability when individuals or businesses fail to use reasonable care to minimize the foreseeable risk that others will be injured and injury results
but this proposed legislation would preempt the laws of the 50 states to create a special higher standard for negligence actions for this one protected class different than for any other industry protecting them from liability for their own negligence in all but extremely the proposed federal product liability standards will unfairly insulate firearm industry defendants from accountability in state courts for design defects in their products
the proposed new federal standard would preempt the product liability laws in all 50 states with a new higher standard that would protect this industry even for failing to implement safety devices that would prevent common foreseeable injuries so long as any injury or death suffered by victims resulted when the gun was not used as intended
under existing product liability laws in most states manufacturers must adopt feasible safety devices that would prevent injuries caused when their products are foreseeably misused regardless of whether the uses are intended by the manufacturer or whether the product fails or improperly functions
over the last 30 years an average of 200 children under the age of 14 and over a thousand adults each year have died in gun accidents this bill if enacted would insulate the firearms industry from almost all civil actions in addition to its existing protection from any consumer product safety regulations
the risk that states may at some future date fail to appropriately resolve their tort responsibilities in an area of law where there is no evidence of any failure to date can not justify the unprecedented federal preemption of state responsibilities proposed in this legislation
the wiser course for congress we believe is to respect the ability of states to continue to administer their historic responsibility to define the negligence and product liability standards to be used in their state courts
s 397 and hr 800 would provide sweeping immunity to members of the gun industry in numerous cases
supporters of gun industry immunity have added language to s 397 and hr 800 that was not included in the gun immunity bills considered by the last congress hr 2037 s 659 s 1805 and s 1806
limit atf s ability to prevent the importation of nonsporting firearms used frequently in crimes
to take such antilaw enforcement actions in the post911 age when we know that suspected terrorists are obtaining firearms and may well seek them from irresponsible gun dealers is nothing short of madness
the bill also would likely limit the ability of state attorneys general to bring actions against gun sellers who violate state law such as those who engage in straw sales to someone who illegally buys guns on behalf of prohibited buyers
in closing we would note that many of us have other reservations as well about substantive aspects of s 397 hr 800
the national rifle association and others in the gun lobby are pushing legislation that would deprive gun violence victims of their legal rights and give special legal privileges to the gun industry house bill hr 800 and senate bill s 397
similar legislation was defeated in the last congress and it must be stopped again in the 109th congress
two former new jersey police officers ken mcguire and dave lemongello shot in the line of duty with a trafficked gun negligently sold by a west virginia dealer won a 1 million settlement
the dealer had sold the gun along with 11 other handguns in a cash sale to what turned out to be a straw purchasing team

dear senators and representatives as a professor of law at the university of michigan law school i write to alert you to the legal implications of s 397 and hr 800 the protection of lawful commerce in arms act my colleagues who join me in signing this letter are professors at law schools around the country
though described as an effort to limit the unwarranted expansion of tort liability the bill would in fact represent a dramatic narrowing of traditional tort principles by providing one industry with a literally unprecedented immunity from liability for the foreseeable consequences of negligent conduct
s 397 and hr 800 described as a bill to prohibit civil liability actions from being brought or continued against manufacturers distributors dealers or importers of firearms or ammunition for damages resulting from the misuse of their products by others would largely immunize those in the firearms industry from liability for negligence
it might be suggested that the bill would merely preclude what traditional tort law ought to be understood to preclude in any event lawsuits for damages resulting from third party misconduct and in particular from the criminal misuse of firearms
tortious or criminal acts the probability of which makes actor s conduct negligent if the likelihood that a third person may act in a particular manner is the hazard or one of the hazards which makes the actor negligent such an act whether innocent negligent intentionally tortious or criminal does not prevent the actor from being liable for harm caused thereby emphasis supplied similarly actors may be liable if their negligence enables or facilitates foreseeable third party criminal conduct
in keeping with these principles cases have found that sellers of firearms and other products whether manufacturers distributors or dealers may be liable for negligently supplying customers or downstream sellers whose negligence in turn results in injuries caused by third party criminal or negligent conduct
in other words if the very reason one s conduct is negligent is because it creates a foreseeable risk of illegal third party conduct that illegal conduct does not sever the causal connection between the negligence and the consequent harm
under this bill the firearms industry would be the one and only business in which actors would be free utterly to disregard the risk no matter how high or foreseeable that their conduct might be creating or exacerbating a potentially preventable risk of third party misconduct
and they could engage in this negligent conduct persistently even with the specific intent of profiting from sales of guns that are foreseeably headed to criminal hands
under this bill a firearms dealer distributor or manufacturer could park an unguarded open pickup truck it might appear from the face of the bill that s 397 and hr 800 would leave open the possibility of tort liability for truly egregious misconduct by virtue of several exceptions set forth in section 4 5 i
those exceptions however are in fact quite narrow and would give those in the firearm industry little incentive to attend to the risks of foreseeable third party misconduct
the negligent entrustment exception would therefore not permit any action based on reckless distribution practices negligent sales to gun traffickers who supply criminals as in the above example careless handling of firearms lack of security or any of a myriad potentially negligent acts
no jurisdiction attempts to legislate standards of care as to every detail of life even in a regulated industry and there is no need
s 397 and hr 800 would turn this traditional framework on its head and free those in the firearms industry to behave as carelessly as they would like so long as the conduct has not been specifically my aim here is simply to provide information and insure that you are not inadvertently misled about the meaning and scope of s 397 and hr 800
as currently drafted this bill would not simply protect against the expansion of tort liability as has been suggested but would in fact dramatically limit the application of longstanding and otherwise universally applicable tort principles
i rise today in support of senate bill 397 the protection of lawful commerce in arms act
mr speaker i consider myself a strong supporter of the second amendment to our constitution and truly believe in the rights of americans to keep and bear arms
i urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join me in supporting senate bill 397 a commonsense measure to protect small businesses and preserve the second amendment rights of american citizens
the original legislation from the house had 257 cosponsors and the original bill in the senate which did not contain the kohlreed amendment had 62 cosponsors
having said that though i think it is very important and i urge my colleagues to support the protection of lawful commerce in arms act because we need to take immediate steps to protect the firearms industry and manufacturers and responsible gun owners from the liberal left s culture of frivolous litigation and to legislate by lawsuit
mr speaker i rise today in strong support of s 397 the protection of lawful commerce in arms act
the second amendment was not written as a mere exercise in constitutional thought
it had a practical purpose first to ensure that citizens would have the tools to protect their families and their homes and second to ensure that an armed militia could be called up to defend the country in emergencies
but these lawsuits mr speaker have the potential of crippling the american firearms industry in the same manner as the threat of medical liability has crippled the medical industry
in my estimation mr speaker these lawsuits are a threat to our hardearned second amendment rights
mr speaker i thank the gentleman for yielding time and wish to express my appreciation to him and members of the rules committee who have delivered a rule enabling consideration by the house today of significant legislation relative to the reform in the regulatory structure of governmentsponsored enterprises
i can not express enough appreciation to chairman oxley for his longstanding tolerance on this matter the many hours of agony i am sure i have caused all members on this subject matter and i am very appreciative for his courtesies extended in bringing to the floor a bill which has been over many months hammered into the shape we currently find it
as to the current issue before the house in the consideration of the rule now pending i wish to make clear that the manner in which the manager s amendment was constructed is no different from the construction of hundreds of manager s amendments over the years in this body
in this case one element of that manager s amendment is the establishment of assistance for victims of the significant hurricanes the country has experienced a highly appropriate utilization of a new fund
the entity which will manage and distribute the funds does not now exist and so for some members constraining the utilization of the fund in its beginning stages was a logical precaution
it is about restoration of housing in the case of hurricane victims many of whom do not live in my district but certainly reside in my state
they are living in a fema trailer or a tent or with family and friends or in any number of circumstances around the country
they are desperate for the opportunity to come home to live in that structure that they call their own
i think in light of the concerns expressed the overwhelming need for housing inventory the fact that this is a 5year program which will end at the end of 5 years that we do not have yet an entity to manage supervise or distribute the funds it is highly appropriate that the constraints adopted in the manager s amendment be favorably considered by this house and adopted
more broadly i think the rule has made in order a number of amendments that were not discussed in committee which the house will consider and vote on accordingly and i think at the end of the day no matter the construct of the final bill it is important to understand that a governmentsponsored enterprise reform is absolutely essential
it is given a privileged position in the marketplace
they utilize taxpayerguaranteed debt in order to make a profit for their shareholders
they are unique in their construct in that they are authorized by the congress but are shareholderdriven institutions
a small cabal of 50 or so members who though small in number loud in voice threaten this republican majority and hold this congress and our country hostage
they claim they want smaller government but they are saddling our children with trillions in the notorious birth tax yes every child born in america today comes into this world with a 30 000 debt to the government thanks to the skewed economic policies of the socalled fiscally conservative republican party
they claim they support families but they are robbing the basic tenet of the american dream home ownership right here in this very bill
i want to speak in favor of the manager s amendment if it is adopted certainly a great and important bill and the rule itself
the actual truth of the matter is that housing ownership in america is at an all time high
the gses fannie mae and freddie mac have played an important part in that
they provide liquidity in the secondary market so that there are more opportunities for people to borrow at relatively low rates of interest
fannie alone is 17 trillion in terms of assets and both of these entities had some accounting troubles
the gentleman from ohio mr oxley xz4003070 and the gentleman from louisiana mr baker xz4000120 have led the way so that we can reform and have appropriate oversight for those enormous but important entities that help the housing market in america flourish
they want to allow folks that engage in political activity including voter registration to have access to money that otherwise would go to lowinterest loans or to help affordable housing builders at the local level actually build bricks and mortar
they want somebody that will actually build them with the sticks and the bricks and the mortar a home to live in
one of the largest advocates the groups that the other side would like to have receive up to 2 or 3 billion this fund may reach in the next 5 years is a group called acorn
they have every right to participate in first amendment activity but not with money that we give them from congress
thomas jefferson said that to force a man to contribute to a cause in which he does not believe is the definition of tyranny
acorn had a game plan in the year 2003 in florida
by the way they do this in many other competitive states
they argued to the public that this was about support for a minimum wage constitutional amendment in florida
mr speaker i agree with the gentleman it was never discussed in committee
the restrictive language being put forward which would say no faithbased group could participate has never been debated in this committee and we are not allowed to do an amendment on the floor
i agree it was not brought up in committee
it was brought up in a private session between the republican study committee and the thenmajority leader
in fact under provisions of the bill which are agreed upon unanimously what acorn proposed would have disqualified them from getting funds
there is agreement that if groups are engaging in partisan activity they should be excluded
one thing that the majority forgot to mention one of the pieces of their amendment to which we object is the piece that says you can only participate in this program if housing is your principal purpose
the faithbased initiative rest in peace
you can not have somebody come in and get them to register
there is an extremism here that is not comprehensively accepted in the history
so what the gentleman from texas would have members believe both gentlemen from texas it is an open rule on this issue because if you are willing to vote not to give a preference to the hurricane areas you can also vote to let the catholic church participate in lowincome housing
if you think the catholic church and the episcopal church and the methodist church and other churches ought to be able to participate in this then you have to vote not to give preference to the hurricane areas
all i asked for was a chance to agree to everything in the manager s amendment except for three things allow faithbased groups to participate
it is a tough vote for members in the hurricane areas because they will be demagogued
if the manager s amendment is defeated let me announce now i will then offer a motion to recommit which will be everything in the manager s amendment except these three things
mr speaker all we are asking for is a chance for an upordown vote on three provisions which have never been voted on which were inserted here because the most conservative elements in the republican party the republican study committee got the majority leader to make them a condition of the bill coming to the floor
i rise in support of the rule rise in support of the bill and i also want to note that governmentsponsored enterprise reform is way overdue and it does pose a systemic risk to our financial system
mr speaker i would like to discuss briefly an amendment that i had offered that was adopted by the committee by voice vote back in may
mr speaker i thank the gentleman for yielding me time and i rise in support today of this rule
i understand there is an accusation that somehow language dealing with the affordable housing fund that members do not have an ability to weigh in on that
we now have achieved the highest rate of homeownership in the entire history of the united states of america
we have the highest rate of homeownership in the entire history of america
now i know this fund is included in the bill and so be it i support the legislation
mr speaker i rise in strong opposition to the rule on hr 1461
it adds an antiminority antifamily provision that was not included in any of the sections of the legislation i supported in committee
the rule will prohibit nonprofit groups involved in voter registration and getoutthevote activities from receiving money from the affordable housing fund created by the bill
it will negatively impact good civic organizations in my district such as amigos del valle national council of la raza and catholic and faithbased organizations
the newly added provision is included in the manager s amendment and appears to be aimed at suppressing the civic engagement of low and moderateincome and minority families
i will insert at this point in the record two letters to speaker hastert
the newlyadded provision is included in the manager s amendment and appears to be aimed at suppressing the civic engagement of low and moderateincome and minority families
many of the organizations that would be left out are uniquely positioned to develop the affordable housing needed in their communities
specifically nonprofit applicants would be restricted from participating in voter registration and many classic civic engagement activities in the twelve months before the time of application
in addition the nonprofit applicants would be deemed ineligible if they are affiliated with an organization that engages in these activities
nonprofit communitybased organizations have played a critical role in fighting against those who would limit the voice of latinos
the groups often serve as the main point of contact in hispanic communities and in many cases they are the only local organization addressing their social civic and educational needs
speaker i am writing to you on behalf of the jesuit conference board of the society of jesus in the united states to express our concern regarding an amendment to hr 1461 the federal housing finance reform act of 2005 that concerns the affordable housing fund
today there are approximately 3 300 jesuit priests and brothers working in our domestic programs and abroad which include over 100 parishes various social works throughout the country 28 jesuitaffiliated colleges and universities and around 60 jesuitaffiliated secondary and middle schools
many of our projects put us in direct contact with lowincome people that benefit from affordable housing programs or that suffer from a lack of housing
the us catholic bishops in their statement putting children and families first comment that many families can not find or afford decent housing or must spend so much of their income for shelter that they forego other necessities such as food and medicine
we applaud the effort to increase the affordable housing stock in the country
however the manager s amendment that will be introduced would disqualify any nonprofit organization including faithbased groups from using resources from the fund to build affordable housing if that organization has engaged in voter registration getoutthevote and other nonpartisan voter participation activities
furthermore language in the amendment also disqualifies organizations that are affiliated a term broadly defined with any organization that engages in such activities
current law and language in hr 1461 already contains sufficient restrictions to ensure that funds are used solely for affordable housing and not for other activities
do nt let the unconstitutional manager s amendment get in the way
in the lord
the bill would increase home ownership among lowincome families increase investment in housing in low income and economically distressed areas and in general increase the nation s supply of affordable housing
nonprofit organizations and any affiliate of the nonprofit would be prohibited from engaging in nonpartisan voter registration or getoutthevote activities
these restrictions would force lowincome housing groups and faithbased groups to choose between obtaining funding for lowincome housing and using other funds to engage in nonpartisan voter registration and getoutthevote activities
in my home state of new jersey organizations like catholic charities provide vital social services to vulnerable people in need such as food clothing counseling and health services
their activities are nonpartisan and play a vital role in ensuring that people are able to vote if they so desire
the majority protests loudly when its actions are judged to be motivated by a desire to suppress voter turnout and civic participation in urban or lowincome areas
mr speaker once again this house majority is resorting to heavyhanded tactics that are designed to do one thing only to achieve a preordained result by shutting down a full and fair debate in this house
let me remind my colleagues what the chairman of the rules committee mr dreier said on this floor 12 years ago in march 1993 frankly it seems to me that the process of representative government means that a person who represents 600 000 people here should have the right to stand up and put forth an amendment and then have it voted down if it is not supportable
mr speaker it is outrageous that this house would take such an action any action that would inhibit or prevent anyone from engaging in nonpartisan voter registration unless of course you fear the wrath of the voters in response to your abuse of power
let me read just two sentences i hope i have the time to do it proposals that would limit eligible recipients to organizations that have as their primary purpose the provision of affordable housing would effectively prevent catholic dioceses parishes and catholic charity agencies from participating in affordable housing programs that is the catholic conference of bishops speaking
they say it would force catholic agencies not acorn would force catholic agencies to choose between participating in affordable housing fund programs or engaging in constitutionally protected voter registration and lobbying activities with their own funds
as one member of this body complained once again the vast majority of americans are having their representatives in congress gagged by the closedrule committee
this undermines democracy in this the people s house
mr speaker so the public understands and our colleagues understand what i indicated was that the gentleman from massachusetts mr frank xz4001400 the ranking democrat on this committee who has been here over a quarter of a century wants to offer an amendment that was supported in the committee and he has been precluded from offering that amendment
mr speaker i rise in opposition to h res 509 as reported out of the committee on rules last night relative to our debate of the gse legislation hr 1461
while many substantive amendments were made in order the committee blocked what we undoubtedly consider one of the most substantive amendments that was offered by the gentleman from massachusetts mr frank the ranking member of the body from which the underlying measure was discharged
the gentleman s amendment would have removed language contained in the current manager s amendment that bars organizations with proven experience in mobilizing community support and resources a nonpartisan initiative
in addition the manager s amendment would constrain the ability of experienced faithbased and communitybased organizations to successfully compete for the affordable housing funds that are proposed in the underlying bill
the nugatory provisions in the manager s amendment will contravene the hard work that i and many other members have done to this end
while i applaud the effort made by the administration to remove barriers to full participation in federal programs and funding faithbased entities proposals such as the manager s amendment will bar these groups from access to this funding while forprofit agencies remain free to engage in the democratic process which is every american s birthright
the committee i serve on the committee on financial services has labored for 6 years 20 hearings hundreds and hundreds of hours and hundreds of witnesses to put together what i think is probably one of the best examples of bipartisan activity this house has seen in many years
it is unfortunate that we come here today with the manager s amendment excluding faithbased entities from participating in the affordable housing fund
i am convinced that the overwhelming majority of our friends on the other side of the aisle if they understood the restrictions in the manager s amendment and the denial by the committee on rules of a right to vote on the issue that is all we asked it was never considered in the subcommittee
it was never considered in the full committee
maybe it was directed at one entity but in fact it has encompassed in its grasp the faithbased entities of this country which provide most of the affordable housing
we have taken 15 protections in the bill to see that the intended purposes were not abused
as a result we are going to compromise an otherwise perfectly bipartisan bill that could have shone with great favor in this house at this particular time in our history
mr speaker i rise in support for the underlying bipartisan bill on gses but in strong opposition to the rule that was put in at the last minute a provision that prevents any nonprofit recipient of a housing grant from conducting nonpartisan civic voter registration
what in the world are we doing today in this congress in an attempt to limit this great right on which our country was founded
restricting the right of nonprofits in this way violates these organizations first amendment rights
yet this provision forbids any nonprofits from even applying for a grant if they have encouraged voting in the recent past
many faithbased organizations including the catholic church the presbyterian church the american jesuit conference have come out in opposition to this provision and i will place in the record at this point a list of these organizations that have come out in opposition to this provision
however we are strongly opposed to the inclusion of language in hr 1461 that restricts nonprofits including religious organizations from receiving affordable housing funds if they have engaged in any voter registration voter identification getoutthevote and other nonpartisan voter participation activities or voter encouragement efforts within 12 months of the application
they very people in need of affordable housing are those who often need the most help in fully participating in our democracy as voters
it is highly ironic that at the very moment when we have seen in the starkest of terms the great need for affordable housing important legislation to meet that need is encumbered with language that undermines our democracy
including a provision that would prohibit episcopal organizations that encourage democratic engagement from participating in affordable housing fund programs would limit our response to god s call to serve the least among us and severely restrict our efforts to provide safe decent and affordable housing
in supporting the affordable housing fund in hr 1461 we are acting upon a resolution passed at our 2003 general convention that reaffirmed our commitment to providing affordable housing for the poor
the resolution calls for the legislative branches of the federal government to provide rental and owneroccupied housing that is safe accessible and affordable for lowincome and moderateincome persons and their families including persons with disabilities and to ensure that housing assistance programs are adequately funded to address the growing gap between the number of affordable housing units available and the number of renter households in the bottom quartile of income in this nation as a church we have also acknowledged the use of the political process as an act of christian stewardship and recognized that a faithful commitment to voting is an extension of our baptismal covenant to strive for justice and peace and the dignity of every human being we have asked all episcopalians to actively engage in advocating for voter rights encouraging voter registration getting out the vote and volunteering to assist voters at the polls mr speaker we ask that you do all in your power to see that the provisions related to voter participation are removed from hr 1461
no organization should be asked to choose between providing homes for those in need or enabling citizens to fully participate fully in our democracy
john bryson chane dd lt center gt lt center gt lt em gt bishop of washington lt em gt lt em gt national organizations opposed to voter restrictions in hr 1461 lt b gt washington dc october 19 2005
speaker the undersigned national organizations have learned that the compromise reached by house leadership on hr 1461 the federal housing finance reform act of 2005 includes provisions that would restrict the ability of american citizens to engage in our democratic process
specifically we object to the restrictions on nonprofit organizations that apply for grants through the affordable housing fund established in hr 1461
the egregious provisions which we strongly oppose disqualify any nonprofit organization that has engaged in voter registration voter identification getoutthevote and other nonpartisan voter participation activities in the 12 months prior to application from eligibility for the affordable housing fund grants
it further prohibits nonprofit organizations that receive grant funds from engaging in these activities
for the first two years the funds will be prioritized to rebuild housing in the areas devastated by hurricane katrina
moreover even if a particular nonprofit organization does not itself engage in any of these activities itself affiliation with an organization that does would disqualify the nonprofit from applying for affordable housing fund grants
these provisions are blatantly undemocratic and raise substantial constitutional questions in the attempt to limit the rights of affiliation
people of color are overrepresented in the low income population making this a civil rights issue
the low income housing community has worked tirelessly to establish the affordable housing fund in hr 1461 because we know the dire need for funds to increase the nation s affordable housing stock
but nothing is worth compromising the right of all americans to participate in our precious democracy
lutheran services in america
it goes against our deepest principles and strikes at those who can least protect themselves and i feel that it is particularly inappropriate that the majority is trying to limit the rights of the disadvantaged this week in the wake of the death of rosa parks who stood up for the right to vote in so many courageous ways
mr speaker i rise in opposition to this rule which did not permit a vote on congressman frank s amendment to strike from this bill the provision that prevents any nonprofit recipient of a housing grant from conducting nonpartisan civic voter registration
of all our rights this is the right that our founding fathers held most dear that thousands have come to this great democracy to hold and that right now our men and women are dying to protect in iraq
restricting the rights of nonprofits in this way violates these organizations fundamental first amendment rights
yet this provision forbids nonprofits from even applying for grants if they have encouraged voting in the recent past
indeed faith based organizations are strongly united in their opposition
it is particularly inappropriate that the majority is trying to limit the rights of the disadvantaged to vote this week in the wake of the death of rosa parks
this amendment to preserve nonpartisan voter registration could be called the rosa parks amendment to remind us that she cofounded the rosa and raymond parks institute for self development to help young people register to vote and i am confident that she would have supported it with the quiet dignity and faith that she demonstrated in her own life
mr speaker i rise today in opposition to this restrictive rule and to the manager s amendment made in order under the rule
as evidenced by the 655 committee vote in favor of the bill on may 25 hr 1461 clearly has the support from both democrats and republicans
the federal housing reform act as reported out of the committee in may is the kind of legislation that the framers intended congress to pass
despite overwhelming bipartisan support in committee the republican leadership held the bill hostage for 5 months merely because a radical faction of their party opposes affordable housing and specifically opposes the affordable housing fund included in the bill
unfortunately after being strongarmed by the republican study committee the republican leadership forced changes that not only weakened the affordable housing fund provision but will actually restrict the ability of lowincome people from voting in future elections
here is the deal they have a manager s amendment that has some very good things in it but tucked in that manager s amendment there is included some language that many of us find offensive
and the gentleman from massachusetts the ranking member of the financial services committee wanted to have an amendment made in order to strike that offensive language and was denied that opportunity last night in the rules committee
under these restrictions any nonprofit community group or church would be ineligible to receive funding if either they or their affiliates have engaged in nonpartisan voter registration and getoutthevote activities
they are part of a pattern by the extreme right in the republican party in an attack on poor people
they would require any organization that wanted to receive funding from the affordable housing fund to sacrifice their freedom of assembly which protects their right to associate with one another in groups for economic political or religious purposes
this language in this manager s amendment severely restricts the ability of affordable housing professionals to fulfill their role
after hurricane katrina president bush and the leadership in the house talked about the need to help poor americans rise out of poverty
but it is hard not to see the irony that 2 days after her death we are going to debate and vote on a bill that will restrict the ability of the poor to have access to affordable housing and to vote in democratic elections in this country
mr speaker i include in the record the following letter from catholic charities usa which strongly opposes the language in the manager s amendment
dear congressman mcgovern on behalf of catholic charities usa the national association of catholic social services agencies and institutions serving over seven million people in need every year i urge you to support hr 1461 the federal housing finance reform act of 2005 and to oppose amendments that would prevent experienced faithbased and communitybased organizations from successfully competing for the proposed affordable housing funds
we strongly support the creation of the housing funds and are convinced that this initiative would increase the development of affordable housing but we have learned that the rules committee will be asked to put in order a managers amendment to bar organizations with proven experience in mobilizing community support and resources
not only our catholic charities agencies but many religious orders and some parishes whose missions are serving the poor and vulnerable in their communities develop and manage very effective affordable housing programs alongside programs that provide food clothing counseling and other health and social services
in addition we oppose amendments that restrain nonprofits from receiving these funds if they are engaged in any nonpartisan voter registration activities even if these activities are funded by their own resources
one of the strengths of our democratic system has been the almost universal involvement of communitybased and religious organizations in encouraging all citizens to register and vote
nonprofits with expertise in housing should not have to choose between two equally important missions supporting full participation in our democracy and providing affordable housing
while this administration has worked diligently to remove barriers to full participation in federal programs and funding by faithbased organizations these amendments would bar these very same groups from being considered for this funding while forprofit agencies remain free to engage in these same voter activities
existing limits in hr 1461 on activities that qualify for affordable housing funds prevent abuse of this funding
in addition catholic charities agencies routinely sign certifications to receive federal state and local government funds that prohibit diversion of program funds for political and lobbying purposes
the proposed affordable housing fund to be created under hr 1461 is sorely needed especially in the devastated gulf coast region where hundreds of thousands of families have not been able to return to their homes
in such challenging times it would be unfortunate if experienced faithbased organizations and nonprofits that have performed laudably in meeting the needs of these survivors would be barred from participation in funding that would help meet critical housing needs
mr speaker i include the following editorial that appeared in today s new york times entitled a ban on voter registration which is very much opposed to the offensive language in the manager s amendment
not satisfied with just delaying the bill house ideologues are advocating an outrageous and potentially unconstitutional provision that would bar the nonprofit groups that build most affordable housing from participating in the fund if they also participate in even nonpartisan voter registration
the provision would conflict with state laws that require housing grant recipients to do things like register voters and would put the federal government in the unacceptable position of actively discouraging political participation
a measure that would bar them from nonpartisan activities has absolutely no place in a democracy
mr speaker the gentleman from texas keeps on saying this is about policy not politics but what would be more political than the language in here that denies poor people the right to vote
we are down 50 percent in real terms in elderly and disabled housing at a time when the leadership on the other side of the aisle has tried to eliminate the community development block grant program
mr speaker to prohibit organizations from receiving funding for housing many of these organizations faithbased organizations that participate in nonpartisan activities as the new york times said today has no place in our democracy
the fact of the matter is that many of these faithbased organizations that do an incredible job in housing will be barred from participating because of this provision
the approach that we took beginning with the need the glaring need for a worldclass regulator for the gses became quite evident with the revelations of some of the accounting scandals that took place in both of those institutions and to a lesser extent with the home loan banks
looking back in the past when chairman baker was a lone voice in trying to get changes in the regulatory structure to where we are now is quite extraordinary
it is quite extraordinary that we are actually debating a rule that would bring up a major piece of legislation totally changing the way we look at gses and their role in the housing market and the secondary market particularly as it relates to their regulation and how they are regulated
some of the issues we debated that were so contentious i think of receivership and all of the debates that we had about the necessity for including receivership language in it so in case one or both of the gses that the regulator could actually put them in receivership essentially became a nonissue just a few months ago
i think that points out the kind of progress we made in the committee
let me point out that program has been incredibly successful over the years borrowing a page from the home loan banks in this case to set aside 5 percent from fannie mae and freddie mac that would potentially provide hundreds of millions of dollars towards affordable housing
again i think members agreed with that and the concern was always i think in the back of everybody s mind to make certain that this money was accountable and it was used for bricks and mortar actually building the homes instead of political advocacy and the like
i am thinking of habitat for humanity as a good example but also state housing agencies and forprofit companies that would compete for those funds and would have to be approved by the board we set up in the legislation again providing accountability where that money goes because it is technically certainly not government funds taxpayer funds but private sector funds
and then of course along came hurricane katrina hurricane rita and now wilma and those events provided another glaring need for affordable housing in those heavily struck areas
that is why we wanted to include those and provide them with the opportunity to essentially be first in line for those funds because of the enormous complications that have developed down there in terms of housing and exacerbated an already difficult situation
i think we are in a position where we can debate the manager s amendment under the rule
there are several democrat amendments made in order republican amendments made in order four on each side
i think the rules committee has done a superb job in doing that
it waives all points of order against consideration of the bill and provides that the amendment in the nature of a substitute recommended by the committee on financial services now printed in the bill shall be considered as an original bill for the purpose of amendment and shall be considered as read
it waives all points of order against the amendment in the nature of a substitute and makes in order only those amendments printed in the rules committee report accompanying the resolution
it provides that the amendments made in order may be offered only in the order printed in the report offered only by a member designated in the report shall be considered as read and shall be debatable for the time specified in the report equally divided and controlled by the proponent and opponent
they shall not be subject to amendment and shall not be subject to a demand for a division of the question in the house or in the committee of the whole
finally the rule waives all points of order against the amendments printed in the report and provides one motion to recommit with or without instructions
mr speaker i rise today in strong support of this rule and the underlying legislation hr 1461 the federal housing finance reform act of 2005
this bill cosponsored by my good friend chairman richard baker was accepted at its full committee markup last may and reported to the house by an overwhelming bipartisan vote of 65 to 5 this balanced rule under debate makes in order a manager s amendment and an equal number of additional amendments from members of both sides of the aisle with four republican and four democrat amendments also made in order
currently approximately 70 percent of american households own their own home a fact that is due in no small part to the liquid and strong capital markets that allow families to achieve the american dream of homeownership at rates never seen before
but the same gses that help to drive high ownership rates are also among the largest us financial institutions with approximately 25 billion in assets
this legislation also establishes an affordable housing fund based on the affordable housing program already in place for the federal home loan banks
these funds will be awarded through a competitive application process to forprofit builders state housing agencies and nonprofit organizations and this fund will streamline hud s current affordable housing goals for the gses to meet pressing needs in lowincome and rural communities
chief among these is the recognition that congress must provide strong marketbased incentives to rebuild the devastated gulf coast region in the wake of hurricanes katrina and rita
the manager s amendment also recognizes the need for fast action in the gulf region and speeds up the effective dates of this legislation from 1 year to 6 months after enactment
mr speaker it is right out there in front of everybody republicans are good on policy and evidently the democrats do not like the politics
i am very disappointed that the gentleman from maryland referred to this as a closed rule when in fact he knows it is not a closed rule
the gentleman from maryland understands that what we have done and undertaken in this rule is the opportunity that would allow any member but in particular a member of the minority a chance to vote on a manager s amendment a motion to recommit and certainly final passage
the discussion took place in the rules committee because a decision was made well after may at the time that the committee brought it forward
mr speaker i will insert in the record a campaign plan from acorn that is very much a part of this debate today about what organizations and groups plan to do with politics and money
floridians for all campaign plan for a november 2004 minimum wage constitutional amendment initiative a florida constitutional amendment initiative to create a minimum wage of 615 with indexing will help defeat george w bush and other republicans by increasing democratic turnout in a close election will deliver wage gains to at least 300 000 floridians and will catalyze the construction of permanent progressive political infrastructure that will help redirect florida politics in a more progressive democratic direction
the 2004 election in florida is shaping up to be just as close as 2000 which al gore won by 537 votes
the 2004 projections indicate addition turnout of 370 000 a total of 64 million increasing the vote goal by 200 000 in order to have a winning margin
the other significant change in preliminary analysis is that the electorate will have 10 percent fewer ticket splitters than 2000
with less persuadable voters the need to increase base voters and turning out more infrequent voters is critical to reach the vote goal in florida
given that turnout is down when the economy is bad since our voters are more discouraged the need for a exciting ballot initiative strategy that works to address the needs of the most economically needy and also likely democratic voters is a fundamental part of a winning strategy in florida
acorn s own experience running municipal and state minimum wage ballots denver houston 1996 missouri 1996 new orleans 2002 supports the conclusion that these efforts are highly motivating to lowwage voters in 2000 61 million voters came to the polls in florida a turnout of approximately 70 percent
in 2001 over 28 percent of florida s workers earned less than the poverty line approximately 870 an hour
a full 20 percent of those workers earned less that 769 an hour a result that can be partially explained by the concentration of workers in the lowest wage job sectors retail and service
a whopping 373 percent of the state s workforce is employed in service sector jobs with another 196 percent in the low wage retail sector
the additional earnings of minimum wage workers almost 700 mi1lion in the first year because we are starting this campaign early and because we have a plan the floridians for all campaign will challenge the institutional forces for progressive and democratic change in the state to build permanent political capacity
in a state where democrats control only 53 of 160 legislative seats and zero constitutional offices the need to rebuild infrastructure and capacity to win has never been more important
for example the signature gathering phase of the campaign wil1 lead to the construction of a vast database of hundreds of thousands of economic justice activists and voters in the state
these are the same voters the democratic party must court and win to regain a presence in state politics
increasing turnout is crucial to a successful 2004 electoral strategy from the top of the ticket all the way down through the many key races in florida that include not only the presidency but also a key senate race congressional seats and also significant turnover in the florida legislature
given these many key races exciting and mobilizing constituency has never been more important but in order to do this there must be a compelling issue on the ballot
though presidential year elections always result in higber turnout the 2000 elections demonstrate the importance of every vote in florida and we do not want to leave giving our constituency the opportunity to vote themselves a raise is probably the most compelling reason to go the ballot box
while the groups promote diverse agendas a coalition of necessity is required in the face of organized and unilateral support amongst opposition groups
this ballot initiative will bring together progressive forces from around the state around a common goal increasing turnout in the 2004 election in order to support campaigns which represent the interests of all our groups
in addition to the workers who are directly affected many more will benefit through the rising tide of wages that results from raising the baseline wage level
unlike tax cut policies which supposedly put money into peoples pockets but really just raid state and federal treasuries a minimum wage increase will put real in the hands of those who need it the most working families
we are in the process of completing this plan but roughly the categoriesplans are as follows african american voters according to ncec there are 440 000 unregistered vap voting age population africanamericans in florida
of the 440 000 unregistered voters statewide 176 000 of these voters live in the 475 majority africanamerican precincts in florida
this campaign will work to register 50 000 of these potential voters through voter registration drives in the following major metropolitan areas noncuban latino voters there are 800 000 hispanic voters in florida 400 000 of whom are noncuban and 345 000 new potential hispanic voters of voting age population
the hispanic population is the fastest growing population in florida and presents the democratic party with an opportunity to build a new revitalized constituency within florida
when you look at a web site for habitat for humanity you will see large corporations on that list who contribute to new houses in this country notforprofits and others and number four on that list is my church of the entire country my church the highland park united methodist church of dallas texas
we build houses in dallas texas for poor people people who are without that ability for their families
and i think what mike oxley wants in this bill is to make it about policy not about politics
mr speaker i heard the gentleman from massachusetts refer to his 25 years of service in this distinguished body and i have great respect for that but i want him to know and i am certain he remembers this that the democrats when they were in the majority many times denied republicans an opportunity in the legislative and rulemaking process to have motions to recommit
in fact the republican majority has given the minority that under this rule as we have the entire time we have been in the majority
the purpose of these changes that we are talking about in the manager s amendment is to prevent nonprofits from receiving these funds and engaging in political activity to ensure that the scarce and available funds for housing resources are allocated effectively and for their intended purpose pure and simple
we want to make sure that they are used for rebuilding houses with the primary emphasis in the gulf region
mr speaker i find it rather embarrassing to have to come to the floor of the congress of the united states to protect the constitutional rights of the citizens of this country when in fact that is what we were all elected for to make sure that this democracy works
there is nothing in this bill that would allow any nonprofit or profitmaking organization who wished to produce housing for low and moderateincome people to use this money for any political activity
as a matter of fact we were so concerned about making sure that everybody had an opportunity to provide housing to produce housing we put in an amendment that would make sure that this money would not go to one or two big organizations that it would be available in rural communities it would be available to the faithbased communities it would be available all over this country to small and mediumsized organizations not just a few large ones
we know that there are some people on the opposite side of the aisle that did not like the idea of providing funds for low and moderateincome housing but we also know because of the leadership of some people on the other side of the aisle who understood the homelessness and the crisis that we have in america lack of housing the lowincome people that they were able to prevail and we came out with a good bill
my colleagues either want to provide lowincome housing and not put politics in it and prevent people from exercising their constitutional rights or they do not want anything for anybody
mr speaker at no time in our nation s history has the need for affordable housing been so great
as a member of the committee on financial services i was proud to see the inclusion of an affordable housing fund in the bill and proud to support the bill in committee
but this important provision will be for naught should one amendment made in order by the rules committee pass
the oxley amendment would disqualify nonprofit organizations including faithbased organizations from participating in the fund if they engage in voter participation or getoutthevote activities
as an ordained minister in the united methodist church i come to this discussion from a unique perspective
mr speaker it is the mission of the united methodist church and every denomination and every faith group in our world to serve the poor and vulnerable
james united methodist church in kansas city an important part of the mission is to shelter the poor and that is why we started in 1985 a section 202 project not far from our church
i am not sure how many members of the united states congress lived in public housing but i did
my family including my three sisters and mother and father lived in a shack literally a tworoom shack
my mother and father both worked all day every day and i can tell you growing up in public housing not one time did we ever see a candidate canvassing our community not one time do i remember any kind of effort to get the citizens to vote
we have created a culture in lowincome neighborhoods where people do not participate in the political process and what we need is to democratize the lowincome neighborhoods of our communities
and if you go around i do not care whether you are republican or democrat or just a lazy person if you go and look at the voting returns you will find that people who live in lowincome neighborhoods do not vote
we are strong only if we are able to get all of our citizens to participate in the political process
mr speaker at no time in our nation s history has the need for affordable housing been so great
as a member of the financial services committee i was proud to see the inclusion of affordable housing fund in the bill and proud to support the bill in committee
but this important provision will be for naught should one amendment made in order by the rules committee pass
the oxley amendment would disqualify nonprofit organizations including faithbased organizations from participating in the fund if they engage in voter registration or getout the vote activities and it effectively prevents many nonprofits from participating
as an ordained minister in the united methodist church i come to this discussion from a unique perspective mr speaker
it is the mission of the united methodist church and every denomination and faith group in our world as it is of many religious orders and communities to serve the poor and vulnerable
james united methodist in kansas city an important part of that mission is to shelter the poor by providing affordable housing
but an equally important part of that mission is empowering the poor and vulnerable by supporting their full participation in the democratic process
until the age of 7 i lived in a shack literally a two room shack with my mother my father and my three sisters
my family moved into public housing when i was 7 i can tell you growing up no candidates canvassed our community and few if any residents in our projects voted
my greatgrandfather who lived until age 103 never once voted in his life
the poor and vulnerable are often those who need the most help to fully participate in our democracy
when you live in public housing you are preoccupied with economic survival
let me be perfectly clear mr speaker by forcing faithbased organizations and other nonprofits to choose between participating in the affordable housing fund or engaging in constitutionally protected voter registration and get out the vote activities with their own funds the oxley amendment limits the full participation of our nation s most vulnerable citizens in our democracy
i keep a photograph of the shack where i grew up hanging on the wall in my office to remind me that i have been given the opportunity to speak for those who can not and represent in this the interests of the most vulnerable and voiceless american citizens here in the congress
these restrictions serve only the political purposes of some study group that should not have the power to derail democracy in our land
it is an assault on the poor in this country and it is obscene
mr speaker i rise today in opposition to the rule house resolution 509
they can work to bring affordable housing to working families or they can register voters in the most nonpartisan of ways but they can not do both not even to drive an elderly person to the polls
these organizations represent the mainstream values of this nation and their efforts should not be hindered by rollbacks in these constitutionally protected rights
like many other metropolitan locations my constituents in sacramento face escalating housing prices that are making it harder and harder for working families to achieve the dream of homeownership firefighters police officers the teachers in our schools
they deserve to live in the same communities they work in
increasing the conforming loan limit would bring fairness to the housing market by giving working families in more expensive parts of the country the same opportunity as everyone else to own their own home
once again this commonsense provision was included in the bipartisan committee bill and so i urge my colleagues to reject the garrett amendment
in closing i reiterate to my colleagues the importance of maintaining the bipartisan version of hr 1461 that came out of the committee
it addressed a lot of the concerns that a lot of us had about affordable housing for minorities lowincome individuals who have an opportunity to obtain a home but with the poison pill that has been put in in its final package it makes the bill very difficult to support
i think that is positive and it presents an opportunity for many individuals especially in my area san bernardino county the inland empire where we have a lot of growth in the area
this bill would give many individuals low income an opportunity to do that especially when the average cost of a home in la
is 475 000 and in san bernardino it is 352 000
had we not bought a home i would not have had stability in my roots in the immediate area
what i do not like about the bill is a poison pill that has been put on there which i believe it is unconstitutional and restrictions aimed at suppressing the civil rights engaged in by poor minorities for voting
we believe that every person should have the right to vote and to participate and we say that that does not preclude them and you have to put a priority whether it is for affordable housing or whether you will be involved in engaging encouraging individuals
america has always encouraged individuals to participate in our american democracy and that is the democracy of voting
we have our veterans who have fought for this country and are now fighting in iraq are fighting for the freedoms that we enjoy today
this would restrict these individuals who are getting funded for the housing to say you are not going to participate in this american democracy by registering individuals to vote
now what we are saying is minorities you are voting in higher numbers we are not going to include you in part of that process because if you do and if you get involved in part of that process we are going to cut out your funding
i hope we can make a correction in the senate and do justice for every individual
now we are saying leave every individual who wants to participate from lowincome minority families behind because we do not want them to participate in our american democracy
we should not deny one organization from going to them and asking them to participate in that process
what we are doing is saying you will not be involved in that process you will not be involved in that process
as an american and a member who served in the armed forces which we fought for many individuals we have that responsibility mr chairman
mr chairman i rise in support of hr 1461 to strengthen the regulatory oversight of fannie mae freddie mac and the federal home loan banks
i comment my colleagues on the financial services committee for their bipartisan approach and hard work in drafting this important bill
this fund is particularly important to me because of its potential to increase affordable housing for many hardworking families in my district
housing costs in southern california have skyrocketed
last week the los angeles times reported that the median price paid for a southern california home was 475 000 in september up 161 percent from a year earlier
in san bernardino county the median price has risen 328 percent in the past year to 352 000
i grew up in a family with 15 children without a lot of money
i am proud of the work that catholic charities and other faithbased groups engage in
their mission to help those in need includes providing shelter and also helping citizens fully participate in america s political process
the language inserted would undermine and severely limit the fund by excluding nonprofits involved in nonpartisan voter registration efforts
they are engaged in yet another backdoor scheme to sneak in unconstitutional restrictions aimed at suppressing the civic engagement of working class and minority families
these nonpartisan community groups often serve as the main point of contact and in many cases are the only local groups addressing the social civic and educational needs of the people they serve
why do republicans want to deny low income and minority voters participation in the political process
we need to encourage participation in our great democracy not limit it
mr chairman i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from new jersey mr garrett xz4001450 who was an instrumental participant in the construction of the reform legislation under consideration
in may of 1996 both hud and the treasury agencies issued reports to the committee which were suggestive of reforms which ought to be considered and adopted by the congress to which the thenacting vice president for corporate relations at fannie mae made the following professional comment this is the work of economic pencil brains who would nt recognize something that works for ordinary home buyers if it bit them in their erasers to which the cbo responded to the criticisms not only do the managements of fannie mae and freddie mac have a fiduciary responsibility to defend shareholder interest but their own financial interests and compensation are closely linked to the continued flow of subsidies to the enterprises
how prescient were those observations of the cbo in 1996
apparently in a given year the earnings per share target was hit to onethousandths of a cent accuracy i was later told by mathematical probability it just happened that triggered the payment of 65 million in bonuses in a single year
these bonuses are in addition to base salaries and other benefits and represent money provided by the american taxpayers through guarantees of obligations that the agencies are able to use in the business world to yield profits for shareholders and evidently profits for themselves
further examination of the ability of the regulator to intervene even in the matter of the unwarranted bonuses was later proven in court to be insufficient to bar payment of the bonuses until criminal illegality is proved
this enterprise will stand between the agencies who issue debt and engage in housing activities and significant potential losses to taxpayers should either of the enterprises ever be found under significant financial duress
it is the only financial regulator in the united states which must come to the congress for its funding
that is money put in the sock drawer for a rainy day
in case something goes bad you need to have capital
if any other financial enterprise were to get into financial duress and be unwound in the marketplace that process is called receivership
there are special provisions that allow the congress to intervene in protection of their financial interest
there are a host of other matters that the 360 pages of the bill address but probably the most important is a tool used by regulators today in financial enterprises known as prompt corrective action
they have in the aggregate 16 trillion invested in the two portfolios
under the prudential management and operations standards of the bill the director of the new enterprise shall examine counterparty risks management of interest rate risks adequacy and maintenance of liquidity and reserves management of asset and investment portfolios investments and acquisitions overall risk management processes and if we did not cover it in that list such other operational and management standards as the director determines to be appropriate
finally on page 273 of the bill we read an analysis of the potential systemic risk implications for the enterprises the housing and capital markets and the financial system of portfolio holdings and whether such holdings should be limited or reduced over time is the director s obligation to engage in professional study make recommendations to the congress if congressional action is needed or otherwise act in the best interest of the united states taxpayer
if people are engaged in assistance as a charitable activity in affording housing to lowincome individuals and registering people to vote this bill will not preclude that activity from going forward
what it merely says is that in an instance where we have limited funds available estimated to be perhaps 500 million spread across the entire country that those funds first and foremost should be utilized to help people in true need of housing not political activism
if one is engaged in political activism and building houses as of today s date you can continue to do it
if you wish to be engaged in this fund going forward you will have to make a policy decision do i wish to continue political activism or do i really want to help people get in homes
the bill as it is now constructed allocates 35 percent of net profit for the first 2 years from the various enterprises into a fund which gives as a priority katrina victims rita victims and natural disaster victims in that order
i can tell you if i were to go to the city of baker in my district today walk down groom road to the fema trailer park and say to them i am going to buy you a bus to haul you to go vote 2 years from now or i am going to put money into building you a home guess which one they would pick
then we talk about rita and then welcome back and plug wilma in as a natural disaster 500 million in the scope of this debate concerning ourselves with creating a resource for additional political activism does not make sense
then you can figure out if somebody is in it and who are they
that is what gets this place in trouble
let us figure out what the problem is figure out a remedy let us promulgate it make it subject to hearings pass it through the congress and plug some money in later
this is a wellcrafted proposal with extremely limited resources aimed at an enormous problem that otherwise will not get resolved in a very costeffective manner and we will outstrip the resources of this proposal for 5 years much less the 2 years for which the money has been officially dedicated for this purpose
keep in mind if you are building houses and hauling voters and registering and engaged in political advocacy as of the date of passage of this bill you can still do it
the identified needs for hurricane katrina only are probably in excess of 300 billion for housingrelated activities
if we add rita and wilma the funds will be far depleted before we ever get to the issue of whether we need to be engaged in voter registration or voter transport to the precincts
if one were to go to trailer city on groom road in baker louisiana and walk up to one of those trailers and say hey folks i am here from the federal government and i want to buy a new van to haul you to the precinct next year to go vote what kind of response do you think you will get if you said that will come at the expense of advancing replacement housing for families to go home
we know that by deploying these resources this way we can ensure we are helping people in the most effective manner possible
in 2004 the average income of those who purchased manufactured homes was 28 000
these homes cost 30 percent less than a sitebuilt house and are equal in quality amenities and efficiency
in 1992 congress set a goal for the gses to promote mortgage credit in areas where traditional credit opportunities were unavailable inaccessible or too costly
mr chairman this amendment will assist gses in continuing to serve home buyers in underserved areas and will encourage lenders to offer more and better loans to finance the purchase of new homes
i do not know where this is going to come out in the end because of the discussion and dispute over the affordable housing fund
i doubt there are those other than the gentleman from massachusetts mr frank xz4001400 and the gentleman from louisiana mr baker xz4000120 and maybe three or four other people in congress a few on the outside who can really describe all that this means in terms of the gses
when you are dealing with fannie mae and freddie mac and the home loan banks virtually any mortgage out there is in some way touching on them
if there are any organizations that need close scrutiny and regulation in this country to me it is these gses
we do need the most sophisticated kind of regulation that we can have because they are participating in some of the most sophisticated kinds of investments that one can make
we are dealing with a housing market and while i hope there will not be a bubble or anything of that nature there are problems potentially in that area that we will have to deal with and we want to make sure that they are closely monitored so they will not contribute to that particular problem
i hope it will pass in the house and we can achieve this as final legislation that the president can sign and all of us can take a great deal of pride in doing something that is constructive for america
at the same time this bill also created a massive new federal housing trust fund using a percentage of the profits of these housing gses to ensure a new stock of affordable housing in every section of this country and providing millions of families the opportunity of attaining the american dream of homeownership
they added language to ban churches and other houses of worship the ability to tap into these funds if they take part in any type of nonpartisan voter activity such as helping register people to vote or taking people to the polls
this bill could be the greatest housing construction legislation ever passed by congress and will help people in every district in america and benefit almost every church and house of worship in our country but the far right wing is opposed to it
they are hypocritically opposed to it and so stuck in ideology that they refuse to debate this bill for the issue it is
like scared children they tuck the provisions into the manager s amendment and refuse any opportunity in the rule to strike it because they know they can not win
we are a religious country and we have many members of the cloth in congress most of whom i point out are democrats and the far right knows that their antireligious language can not pass on the merits
as the gentleman from massachusetts mr frank xz4001400 has stated if the manager s amendment is defeated all of the good sections will be restored such as targeting this aid to the hurricaneravaged areas in the motion to recommit
mr chairman i rise in opposition to the amendment
the ripple effects on local homeowners communities and economies could suffer all in the name of this theoretical term of systemic risk i should add this approach is not consistent with the banking world
this power to punish a healthy institution in advance of any real safety and soundness problem does not exist in the banking world
madam chairman i rise in strong opposition to the garrett amendment that would prevent an increase in the conforming loan limit
i understand a mortgage of 359 650 sounds like a lot in some congressional districts but in my district middle class families will be priced out of the housing market if the conforming loan limit is not increased
let me give you some examples of housing prices for my district monterey county the median home sales price in september 2005 was 712 797
santa cruz county the medium home sales price in september 2005 was 750 000
for the city of salinas in monterey county the median home sales price in september was 610 000 while the medium household income was 43 720 according to census figures compiled for 1999
for the city of watsonville in santa cruz county the median home sales price in september was 654 750 while the median household income was 37 617 according to census figures compiled in 1999
there is a huge affordable housingincome gap in my district that will only get worse without an increase in the conforming loan limit
mr chairman as we consider hr 1461 the federal housing finance reform act i would like to urge my colleagues to support the inclusion of a provision to provide an increase in conforming loan limits for high cost metropolitan service areas msas
since 1980 the price of homeownership in new york has increased by 492 percent and continues to escalate in the current housing market
with drastically higher prices than other parts of the country homeownership in the area has limited access for lower and middle income new yorkers
the gse s chartered mission is to expand homeownership for low to middle income americans and this should apply to americans regardless of the geographic region in which they reside
in working towards achieving this mission fannie mae and freddie mac are restricted in their ability to participate in these high cost areas because significantly fewer mortgages fall within the conforming loan limit
the median price of a home in the new york area however is 435 200 considerably higher even for entry level home prices
while the current loan limit has been raised to the lesser of 150 percent of the statutory limit or the median home price in alaska hawaii guam and the virgin islands high cost metropolitan areas like new york city have been left out
language included in hr 1461 would increase loan limits in high cost areas to the maximum of the area s median home purchase price capped at 150 percent of the current limit
raising these limits will help lower to middle income residents in high cost areas like staten island gain access to the lower interest mortgage rates fannie and freddie are able to provide mortgage rates that compared to jumbo loans can save my constituents as much as 135 a month
it is time the taxpayers in high cost areas like new york city realize the benefits of their contributions through access to lower interest mortgages
mr chairman i agree with a great deal of what the gentleman from ohio mr oxley xz4003070 has said as i agree with a great deal of what is in the bill
in the nature of parliamentary debate we will be focusing on some specific points where i disagree but i do not want that to obscure the fact that there is a great deal of agreement
mr chairman i yield 4 12 minutes to the gentlewoman from california ms waters xz4004220 who as ranking member of the minority on the housing subcommittee has had a major role in shaping our position and in the impact of the affordable housing front
we on our side have several times offered amendments to do that in the appropriations bill
i would be glad to yield the gentlewoman from ohio further time to point out the weaknesses in the manager s amendment
when the gentlewoman says she is not in need of further time i think she is being very kind to her colleagues in the republican study committee
since this is a bill which in its form in the manager s amendment would interfere with voter registration efforts there can be no more appropriate speaker on our side than the gentleman from georgia who 40 years ago and more literally risked his life to advance the rights of people to vote
mr chairman i yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from california mr baca xz4000090 one of our most energetic members on the committee fully familiar with the need for housing in particular
mr chairman i yield 2 12 minutes to the gentleman from massachusetts mr lynch xz4002490 who has worked in the building trades and knows this issue very well
there are people who are not happy with everything in the manager s amendment
a lot of what is in the manager s amendment a lot of us like the preference for the gulf areas some of the restrictions on what people do with the use of funds
there are three small provisions in the manager s amendment that are controversial
the one that says no faithbased groups can go in there the principal purpose and the one that says nonpartisan voter registration and nonpartisan get out the vote are not possible
so if they like the manager s amendment but do not want to keep the catholic church out of affordable housing do not want to have the problem that the gentlewoman from ohio ms pryce xz4003270 mentioned where they can not take old people to the polls and do not want to restrict nonpartisan voter registration if the manager s amendment is defeated everything except those three things that were in the manager s amendment will be in the recommit
they will be able to see that they can then carefully and in good conscience vote against the manager s amendment and then vote for the recommit because it will be their amendment so they will get permission to vote for the recommit and they will get everything in the manager s amendment except the one thing that keeps out faithbased restricting it to people whose primary purpose is here and the nonpartisan restriction on voter registration
all the other restrictions and everything else will be in it
mr chairman i claimed the time in opposition to the manager s amendment because i am in opposition to a small part of the manager s amendment and like many members i have a dilemma
much of the manager s amendment is what a manager s amendment ought to be the result of taking into account in some cases things that happened after the bill came out of committee like the hurricanes some refinements
there is a wealth of experience in the catholic church in the episcopal church in the methodist church in the jewish community housing for the elderly
in other groups the local initiative support corporation in other groups the enterprise fund nonprofit groups some of which have housing as their primary purpose and some do not why do we want to say to groups that have a very successful record of building affordable housing including church groups that they can not participate in this program
so one thing that i would change in the manager s amendment is to say that they can do this if housing is one of their primary purposes not their only primary purpose
it lets the faithbased groups back in
by the way there may be some who think that if you participate in affordable housing that it will be so profitable that it will generate funds that you can use elsewhere
we have agreed that with your own money if you agree to participate in this fund you can not engage in any federal election activity as it is defined in the federal election campaign act
you can not make expenditure for any electioneering communication as defined in the federal campaign act
they are in the manager s amendment as further restrictions and we accept them
all we are saying is that nonpartisan voter registration and getoutthevote should be permitted uses in other words what the gentleman from ohio talked about
that plan by acorn would have made them ineligible to participate in this fund
we have made a concession here that yes we will say that if you are engaged in partisan political activity you can not do this
if you are caught doing it in a partisan way then you would lose the funds under here
again voting and residence are very closely linked in america
in some cases you might vote in your home if you are in an elderly development
if you have a housing development you can not under this manager s amendment help the old people in the development vote
you can not invite somebody in to do voter registration
they can come in on their own but you can not cooperate
we have some partisan differences in other areas than housing but this one got pretty bipartisan
members can have two choices they can vote against the manager s amendment and know that i will offer a recommittal motion which will be everything in the manager s amendment except the one provision that prevents faithbased groups from participating and the one that says no nonpartisan voter registration or the voter turnout
alternatively if people vote for the manager s amendment maybe some people will be afraid well i do not want to look like i am not helping the people in the hurricane area then i will offer a recommit
the recommit will make those three small specific changes in the manager s amendment
in other words members will have a chance to vote on everything in the manager s amendment all the restrictions on what these groups can do with their own money all the restrictions of what they can do with affordable housing money put our faithbased groups in and have the voter registration be allowed
in the first place there is no debate that every penny in the affordable housing fund goes for affordable housing
every faith organization in america every protestant denomination every branch of judaism and the roman catholic church says we do housing and the gentleman is right
why say to the faithbased organization whatever happened to your belief in the importance of helping faithbased organizations
all we want is to allow our religious organizations in part to be able to participate without stopping their voter registration and other activity
one particular aspect to the amendment seems to me to sum this up when it calls for higher minimum capital requirements as the director deems necessary or appropriate to ensure longterm institutional viability and competitive equity in the market
now we are all for longterm institutional viability but competitive equity means look there are banks who complain that because fannie and freddie are perceived to have some backup from the congress and let me say right now if you are listening if you are buying fannie or freddie s paper because you think i am going to vote to bail you out sell it and cash it in i am not going to do that
i agree that fannie and freddie get certain advantages in this
with regard to the powers of the regulator the gentleman from louisiana played a major role in this and the gentleman from pennsylvania was with him and the chair and ranking member of the subcommittee
the regulator can raise capital in general the regulator can decide that a particular activity is risky and capital should be raised to compensate for that
that is where competitive equity comes in
he is very clear in saying we should not be doing subsidized housing
if his amendment were to pass we would not be able to have an affordable housing program because the level of profits fannie and freddie generate which we are tapping in part 5 percent to do affordable housing would substantially diminish
people in the hurricane area who get priority if the affordable housing bill goes through that part of the bill goes through hundreds of millions of dollars will be available to replace housing literally washed away in mississippi alabama texas and in florida
i hope that the gentleman s amendment in this particular case is defeated
since he can not get at hud he goes after fannie and freddie in ways that would reduce substantially what we do in housing
he is one of the best students ever in the house
in fact i think it would enhance them and i hope the amendment is adopted
in its present form i am mr speaker
one instead of requiring that to participate in the affordable housing fund housing must be the organization s primary purpose it says it must be one of its primary purposes
as i noted in my june 10 letter to the house of representatives the catholic community through our charities agencies dioceses and parishes serves tens of thousands of men women and children who struggle to maintain adequate housing
proposals that would limit eligible recipients to organizations that have as their primary purpose the provision of affordable housing would effectively prevent catholic dioceses parishes and catholic charities agencies from participating in affordable housing fund programs
similarly proposals that would prohibit recipients from engaging in voter registration and lobbying activities with their own funds during the period they are utilizing affordable housing funds would force catholic agencies to choose between participating in affordable housing fund programs or engaging in constitutionally protected voter registration and lobbying activities with their own funds
i urge you to oppose inclusion of these kinds of unnecessary limitations and prohibitions in hr 1461 as it moves to the house floor for the bishops statement putting children and families first notes many families can not find or afford decent housing or must spend so much of their income for shelter that they forego other necessities such as food and medicine
the catholic bishops support housing policies which seek to preserve and increase the supply of affordable housing and help families pay for it we must put in place a sustainable source of funds to build affordable housing and this new fund would do that
as i said in my june letter this legislation presents congress with a genuine opportunity to make the shelter needs of extremely lowincome families a national priority
the proposed amendment seeks to impose restrictions on the eligibility of nonprofit faithbased organizations interested in applying for development funding under the affordable housing fund created in this legislation
while on one hand congress and the administration call for greater participation by nonprofit faithbased organizations to carry the load in helping our neediest citizens the house now seems poised to cut us off from a funding stream that we need in order to continue to provide affordable housing to lowincome seniors
for our many members who are nonprofit sponsors of affordable senior housing the proposal is a slap in the face to their efforts to be active participants in their communities and ensuring the highest possible quality of life for their senior residents
as an association we encourage our members to engage in and sponsor such nonpartisan and perfectly legal activities as voter registration providing transportation to the polls candidate debates and town hall meetings
dear leaders of the house of representatives we write on behalf of the union of orthodox jewish congregations of america to urge you to ensure that the federal housing finance reform act of 2005 hr 1461 contains no provisions which would be disruptive to participation of the many religiously affiliated organizations in affordable housing programs
proposals that would limit eligible recipients to organizations that have as their primary purpose the provision of affordable housing would effectively prevent many jewish community entities from participating in affordable housing fund programs
similarly proposals that would prohibit recipients from engaging in voter registration and lobbying activities with their own funds in order to receive affordable housing funds would force many jewish agencies to choose between participating in affordable housing fund programs or engaging in constitutionally protected voter registration and lobbying activities with their own funds
we urge you to oppose inclusion of these kinds of unnecessary limitations and prohibitions in hr 1461 and if they are to be considered by the house on the floor to ensure that these provisions receive a full debate and up or down vote
as is the case with many other federally funded socialwelfare programs in which faithbased entities participate there are appropriate ways to write safeguards into the legislation to prevent the diversion of funds to uses other than what they are intended without requiring recipients to forego their constitutionally protected rights as a condition for participating
we urge you to uphold these principles in the context of hr 1461
the consortium for citizens with disabilities ccd would like to go on record against language in the proposed manager s amendment that we believe would be of tremendous harm to communitybased nonprofit disability organizations across the country
ccd is a coalition of more than 100 national disability organizations working together to advocate for national public policy that ensures the selfdetermination independence empowerment integration and inclusion of children and adults with disabilities in all aspects of society
a large part of our agenda focuses on civil rights and protections for the 56 million people with disabilities in the us it is ccd s understanding that the proposed manager s amendment contains language that would require many disability organizations to violate state law if they were to apply for grants made available through the affordable housing fund included in hr 1461
this would result from a requirement in the legislation for nonprofit organizations that seek funding from this program to certify that they are not engaged in voter registration or voter education efforts regardless of the source of these funds
such restrictions in our view amount to undue federal government control over activities of nonprofit disability organizations
unfortunately the language in the proposed manager s amendment to hr 1461 singling out voter registration activities of nonprofit organizations takes an additional step that would place nonprofit disability groups in jeopardy of violating both the constitution and the law
in addition this would also conflict with the motor voter law
besides requiring states to allow voter registration at motor vehicle agencies the motor voter law also requires nonprofit organizations that receive state funds and are primarily engaged in providing services to persons with disabilities to provide voter registration forms as well as assistance in completing them
because some of these same organizations would be prohibited from engaging in voter registration activities under the manager s amendment to hr 1461 the manager s amendment would force many organizations particularly those that provide because voter registration identification and getoutthevote efforts as well as lobbying are constitutionally protected first amendment activities funding restrictions that would stifle such activities could well be struck down if they are not adequately tailored to further an important government interest
ensuring that organizations spend federal funds only as congress has intended is in itself a legitimate government objective
the extreme breadth of the language in the proposed manager s amendment however would do nothing to further this goal
for example it would affect nonprofit disability organizations that have a direct role in the development and subsequent ownership of affordable rental housing for people with disabilities
equally important the proposed legislation would affect nonprofit service provider organizations that are affiliated with affordable housing developersowners for the purposes of providing essential supportive services to people who are living in the housing
ccd has supported the affordable housing fund contained in hr 1461 since its inception
hud programs such as section 811 section 8 tenantbased and projectbased home cdbg and mckinneyvento are critical resources in meeting the needs of extremely lowincome people with disabilities
however additional resources are needed to ensure that the increasing demand for affordable rental housing in the community among people with disabilities is met
ccd therefore urges you to remove the unfair and unwarranted restrictions on nonprofit disability groups in the proposed manager s amendment to hr 1461
nonprofit disability groups should not be forced to violate state law in order to compete for affordable housing resources
so only organizations that fit in the column of nonpartisan
you can not have a voter registrar in there
the leadership in the committee on rules said we did not stop you from voting you could vote on the manager s amendment and you get a recommit
the question here is will democracy prevail in the house and when members on the other side vote their conscience and not be told that they simply can not do what they know is right many of them because it is in a motion to recommit when no other alternative was presented to them
mr chairman i rise today to compliment both chairman baker and chairman oxley for their work in order to put together a bill that the main purpose which is to regulate and strengthen the regulation of fannie mae and freddie mac
back in january of 2003 freddie mac issued a press release and stated it will issue an unaudited statement of earnings for the year 2002 and restate accounting results for prior years
november of the next year november 2003 freddie issues a restatement of past accounting results for the year 2000 2001 2002 and revises its net earnings upwards by 44 billion that they were off in their records
again in december of 2004 the fannie ceo franklin raines and cfo tim howard have to resign from those entities
finally in june of 2005 after 3 years finally freddie issues its first audited annual report since the year 2002
and now we are here in october and we look back about a week or so ago and press reports are out again suggesting that investigators have uncovered again new accounting violations of fannie mae possibly including overvalued assets underreported credit losses and misused tax credits
if there are ever two entities that need to be limited in their size it is these two entities
mr chairman i rise in support of this legislation which strengthens the language with regard to portfolios and gses
the gses claim that they are shock absorbers in the system
if you look at fannie s purchases for its portfolio during every month of 2001 you will notice that its purchases in september of 2001 of that year were the lowest level of anytime during that year
fannie might argue that they acted as a shock absorber not by buying mortgages and mbs but by committing to buy in succeeding months
mr chairman i will conclude by saying that we should support these significant portfolio limitations in order to make sure that gses are able to be reined in and not become what they have said they are and go out of their range of portfolio
it is already set up in the law that the amount that gses can lend can go up every year
it is set to go up to 400 000 for next year in 2006
as the bill was amended in committee it comes out now that that will go up by 50 percent
even if they are firemen policemen teachers who have you they would still need an income of 200 000 in order to buy a home at 600 000
by allowing the gses to get into this market what we are doing is distracting them from their purpose and hurting those very people that they were intended to help lowincome people whether they are in new jersey or california or other highinterestrate states to be able to buy their first time
there was no evidence whatsoever presented to the committee to say that the system in place in states such as new jersey or california or elsewhere are in need of gses to come in to increase their conforming limits by 50 percent
there is already an additional market out there that allows for people to buy jumbo loans and there are a number of different variations adjustable rate loans that allow people who are in the upper brackets and making 200 000 to be able to afford and to buy these mortgages
madam chairman as stated the purpose of fannie mae and freddie mac the gses was to provide liquidity difficult to the market and allow firsttime homeowners to get into the market in the first place
we can do that best by limiting their function to what it was prior to this amendment in the committee and that is to focus on firsttime home buyers in every state of the union to be able to buy that first home people of low and modest means who need the assistance of a governmentbacked program such as fannie and freddie to be able to know that there is a program there that allows them to get into that loan
we can allow the other market which is already in place which has been functioning properly where there is no evidence whatsoever to come before our committee that says there was a need to expand in this area to continue to provide the financing for people who are at the upperincome levels of 200 000 and the like to be able to buy those homes
madam chairman i believe the best thing in mind is to make sure we remain in place the system that allows firsttime home buyers the ability to get into their homes
one of my amendments preserves the minority component of the single family housing goals relating to underserved areas with a major improvement in its implementation
the gses would devote 35 percent of after tax profits to the fund beginning in 2006 which increases to 5 percent annually beginning in 2007
in 1989 in the firrea legislation we created a similar affordable housing program in the federal home loan bank system
in my hometown of chicago the federal home loan bank of chicago s ahp plays a key role in local efforts to address the housing needs of low and moderateincome families by providing financial assistance for rental and owneroccupied housing assisted living facilities senior housing developments homeless shelters and group homes
in 2004 alone the chicago fhlb awarded 321 million of subsidies to 109 projects in illinois and wisconsin and another 15 projects in other states
another 104 million was funded in downpayment assistance to help 2 278 families buy their first home in illinois or wisconsin
let me describe one ahp project in the humboldt parkwest town area of chicago to provide a better sense of the impact these programs can have in their local communities
joly hernandez and jose rodriguez with their children imani and albert lived in chicago s humboldt parkwest town community
like many they wanted a larger apartment but could not afford the higher rent due the dramatic rise in the cost of housing in the area
in the 1990s with increased recognition of humboldt park as an attractive artistfriendly neighborhood and historic district property values soared and affordable rental housing was lost to speculators and developers of expensive luxury condos and singlefamily homes
in 1994 bickerdike redevelopment corporation brc a nonprofit communitybased affordable housing developer and property manager began the arduous task of planning the harold washington unity cooperative to address the loss of affordable housing in the humboldt parkwest town area
despite the increase of new construction and housing renovation in the area a few pockets remained undeveloped
a project was planned to develop 87 housing units in 18 buildings over 10 sites in a formerly blighted fourblock area bordered by kedzie avenue albany avenue chicago avenue and ohio street
all 87 units in the cooperative will remain affordable to households earning 50 percent or less of the area median income for at least 15 years
in addition the project received financing from cdbg funds through the city of chicago trust funds from the illinois housing and development agency federal low income housing tax credits illinois state tax credits an empowerment zone grant a tax increment financing tif loan and first mortgage financing
because of the hard work and dedication of brc joly jose and their two children now live in a new home in their old neighborhood
this language would prohibit nonprofit organizations as well as any affiliate of the nonprofit from using their own funds to engage in nonpartisan voter registration or getoutthevote activities
lowincome housing groups and faithbased groups would be forced to choose between obtaining funding for lowincome housing and using other funds to engage in nonpartisan voter registration and getoutthevote activities
these provisions are not only offensive substantively but i have a real procedural problem with the way these provisions are being inserted in the bill
i sincerely hope that these provisions are stripped in conference and if that is the case i look forward to enthusiastically supporting the conference report so that this otherwise excellent legislation can become law
this has clearly been a long long time in the making
i want to congratulate the gentleman from louisiana mr baker xz4000120 as well for his steadfast work his incredible leadership in bringing this bill to the floor something frankly that has been in the making for well over a decade
i think it would be good mr chairman to remind people why we are here in the first place
admittedly they play a very critical role in our housing market in helping produce what we now enjoy the highest rate of homeownership in the history of america
we have given them unique governmentgranted benefits that we do not grant their competitors and we give them these benefits so that they can create liquidity in the secondary mortgage market and help create the american dream for so many people
we have now seen in recent years the largest financial restatement in history dwarfing the financial restatements that we saw at enron and worldcom
but all of a sudden there seems to have been a deafening silence when we see fannie and freddie engaged in activities that with respect to the financial restatements rival those that i have described
and so these people play an incredible role in our marketplace but we have given them incredible powers as well and there must be increased accountability
so i think that this legislation takes a very significant step forward in bringing about a significant regulator for these enterprises because we know that we have been warned by the chairman of our federal reserve that particularly with respect to the portfolio holdings of their own mortgagebacked securities that this represents a systemic risk to our economy
i hope in conference with the other body that we can came up with something that will help address this
again when we see them engaging in activities like airplane leasing and activities related to loan originations and the list goes on if they are going to receive governmentgranted benefits we need to ensure that they use their charter to provide this liquidity in the secondarymortgage market
first i want to thank the gentleman from ohio mr oxley xz4003070 and the gentleman from louisiana mr baker xz4000120 for bringing us to this position in the first place
it simply adds a sentence to this legislation allowing the new regulator the authority to step in where necessary to reduce the size of fannie and freddie s portfolios something that we know has nothing to do with their mission of creating liquidity in the secondarymortgage market
again as chairman greenspan said before without the needed restrictions on the size of the gse balance sheets we put at risk our abilities to preserve safe and sound financial markets in the united states a key ingredient of support for housing i urge a yes vote on the amendment
mr speaker i would ask the gentleman the bill which you just indicated would be on the floor next week and you asked for amendments to be filed in a timely fashion is a very important bill
since that time it is my understanding that there has been some change in the bill
in particular i refer to the provision which deals with the ability of those who may receive dollars under the provisions of the bill for the purposes of constructing affordable housing that if they receive federal funds that they will be unable to thereafter participate in encouraging voter registration drives or getting more people on the rolls to vote
but can the gentleman tell me whether or not he believes the rules committee will allow the gentleman from massachusetts mr frank xz4001400 to offer an amendment which would put the bill back in the position which 65 people in the committee supported at the time it was reported out
i thank my colleague for yielding and would ask him if he can give us some thought on that issue which we feel very strongly about and hope that that amendment can be protected and made in order by the committee and that we will have a full and fair debate on the floor of the house with reference to that amendment
there has been some suggestion i understand however that although the bill may be in the same shape now that there is a manager s amendment proposed and that the vote on the manager s amendment which we presume we have not seen it would cover a multitude of subjects that are in the bill that the vote on the issue that i have raised could be made on that manager s amendment
i would hope and this is not a question just an expression that the majority would make in order an amendment so that we could have a debate on that issue if in fact the manager s amendment does what we are concerned about and some people are proposing undermining the ability of some groups faithbased groups
that is why the catholic conference is so concerned about it faithbased groups or other groups who would build affordable housing get money under the bill and then be precluded from participating in any efforts not partisan efforts but nonpartisan efforts to get people on the rolls
i would just urge the gentleman who is a distinguished member of the rules committee to consider very hopefully favorably the request of ranking member frank to have made in order an amendment to deal with that subject
if you are in the middle class you are too rich to be eligible for federal programs but too poor to be able to keep up with the cost of living
mr chairman i rise in opposition to the manager s amendment because it is a deal breaker with those provisions and certainly because the conference of catholic bishops has indicated that they want to build houses and participate in democracy too
mr chairman i rise in opposition to the instant legislation hr 1461 especially insofar as it fails to remove the unfair and unreasonable language that provides that nonprofits will be prohibited from using their own funds to engage in nonpartisan voter registration and requires that housing be their primary purpose in order to receive funds
not only would the gentleman s amendment have redeemed this legislation but his motion to recommit would have removed language contained in the current manager s amendment that bars organizations with proven experience in mobilizing community support and resources a nonpartisan initiative
in addition the manager s amendment would constrain the ability of experienced faithbased and communitybased organizations to successfully compete for the affordable housing funds that are proposed in the underlying bill
the nugatory provisions in the manager s amendment will contravene the hard work that i and many other members have done to this end
while i applaud the effort made by the administration to remove barriers to full participation in federal programs and funding faithbased entities proposals such as the manager s amendment will bar these groups from access to this funding while forprofit agencies remain free to engage in the same voter registration activities
existing limits in hr 1461 on activities that qualify for affordable housing funds prevent abuse of this funding
groups many of which operate in my district of houston sign certifications to receive federal state and local government funds that prohibit diversion of program funds for political and lobbying purposes
our faithbased groups need the proposed affordable housing fund under hr 1461 especially in the devastated gulf coast region where hundreds of thousands of families have not been able to return to their homes
in such challenging times it would be unfortunate if experienced faithbased organizations and nonprofits that have performed laudably in meeting the needs of these survivors would be barred from participation in funding that would help meet critical housing needs
since convening our first government hearing on gse reform in march 2000 we have examined these matters extensively
as the ranking democratic member on the subcommittee of jurisdiction i have also had the opportunity to participate in more than 20 hearings and to hear scores of witnesses
for example the manager s amendment that we will shortly consider will add a number of new provisions that will severely restrict the ability of faithbased groups to participate in the new affordable housing fund created by this bill and to participate in our democracy
these revisions which were not previously debated in committee which have generated considerable disagreement deserve close scrutiny
beyond the concerns i have with the manager s amendment i have concerns about those amendments which would alter the delicate balance we crafted in committee to create a strong worldclass and independent safety and soundness regulator for gses
these amendments which i will oppose would remove the treasury line of credit for the gses impose capital standards based on competition rather than risk create arbitrary limitations on gse portfolios for reasons other than safety and soundness and alter provisions of the bill that will help middleincome families purchase homes in highcost areas
in closing mr chairman while this bill has many admirable aspects the process by which we have brought it to the floor is flawed
as a result i will oppose this bill at the end of the day but hope to work to improve the legislation as it moves on in the process
if we vote down the manager s amendment we will include the entire manager s amendment in the motion to recommit with three exceptions
secondly we will add in the terms that will allow for voter registration and getoutthe vote on a nonpartisan basis
so this will only affect getting out the vote and voter registration in a nonpartisan way
the powers involved in this bill allow for the regulator to control safety and soundness and to have direction of the portfolio when systemic risk would occur in these particular organizations
what it means is we will always be subject to the whim and fancy of a regulator to require these gses to sell assets or sell liabilities at the whim of the regulator s thought that there may be some need to regulate systemic risk when in fact these organizations suffer no systemic risk
i join with the gentleman from virginia mr tom davis when he analyzes out that what we would be doing is arming a regulator who may not always be the most thoughtful individual in the world to take actions against our housing industry and our housing gses at the most inappropriate time and moment causing destabilization to the housing market and in effect causing further destabilization and systemic risk to the financial markets
madam chairman simply stated the amendment would ensure a continued independent public voice in the corporate governance of fannie mae freddie mac and the federal home loan banks
the amendment also has had bipartisan support in the committee on financial services
the bill before us would make a dramatic change in the board structures of the three governmentsponsored enterprises and this issue deserves a public debate
additionally in order to represent the public interest and provide an independent voice the charters of the federal home loan banks require at least six individuals to be appointed by the regulator to serve on each bank board
in my view requiring presidential and regulatory appointees to serve on the board of fannie mae and freddie mac and the federal home loan banks is entirely appropriate given the unique nature of their charters and their important public missions
additionally the presidential and regulatory appointment system gives citizens a needed voice in ensuring the viability of our nation s housing finance system and that the benefits of this system are widely distributed
maintaining public representation on the gse boards is therefore critical to ensuring continued public trust in these very important financial institutions
these changes include providing flexibility in the size of corporate boards at fannie mae and freddie mac and lengthening the terms of service at the federal home loan banks
they include raising the number of independent directors adding community and economic development expertise and allowing appointed independent directors to continue to serve until a successor is in place
in a recent letter to me about this amendment the home builders note that a diverse governing board of directors that is well balanced in knowledge and expertise in the full range of lt center gt lt pre gt page h9190 lt pre gt lt center gt they also believe that the amendment will help ensure that the gse s board of directors are best equipped to make informed sound judgments in fulfilling their duties including monitoring risk management activities of the gses executives in sum this amendment is one that deserves the support of everyone who wants to preserve a public voice within the publicprivate entities and promote good corporate governance
mr chairman it is with some reluctance i rise now in opposition to hr 1461 the federal housing finance reform act
in its amended form the legislation no longer puts the best interest of our nation at heart but instead holds a precious resource hostage for the sake of partisan politics
the provision restricting nonprofit organizations and their affiliates from using their own funds to engage in nonpartisan voter registration or getoutthevote activities if they want to apply for the muchneeded affordable housing funds is entirely inappropriate
but first let me acknowledge that between passage in the committee and the bringing of the bill to the floor the capital standard provision has been strengthened and i congratulate the committee for doing that
but secondly let me stress that still at this point in time even though the bill itself got a strong bipartisan committee vote it lacks the support of the administration
for this reason a market crisis could become acute in a matter of days and this is something the country has to think through
today s house vote comes nearly a year after federal regulators ordered fannie mae to restate 108 billion in previously reported earnings because of accounting problems several years ago and this is not long after freddie mac restated about 5 billion in earnings
the stakes are significant given that these two gses carry together about 15 trillion in debt
on the other hand when they hold mortgages in their portfolios they are in effect simply another s amp l
hence while financial risk management tools are much greater than they were a generation ago when we had the s amp l crisis in one sense for these two institutions their use is a little bit more problematic because in the housing industry risk is transferred to fannie and freddie disproportionately
they become receivers of risk and as risk becomes concentrated within these institutions they disproportionately become on the hook if very extraordinary things happen in the economy something that is not beyond thinking
in the 1980s without sufficient capital s amp ls grew larger and entered new lines of business as their capital basis shrunk and when things got bad the taxpayer was on the hook for 250 billion
fannie and freddie today operate on a capital base much less than s amp ls did just before their collapse in the 1980s
in a letter dated october 5 2005 chairman greenspan wrote this amendment would improve the proposed legislation
the regulators for the gses should have a free hand in determining
your amendment would give the regulator greater discretion in this critical area it is one thing to have institutions established to have an advantage in cost of money provided by the united states government and another thing to also have advantage in leverage ratio provided by the united states congress
so because the growing presence of gses in our markets and the possible risk they pose to our financial system are significant it is clear we need a strong regulator and i would urge that this regulator be given this additional authority
it is rare that this house considers housing bills given our enormous housing crisis in our country
mr chairman once again we have found ourselves in a situation where some of the republicans giveth and then they taketh away
it would gag nonpartisan speech and civic engagement and participation in our most fundamental of democratic activities
it prohibits nonprofits that build affordable housing from engaging in nonpartisan voter registration
it prohibits nonprofits from engaging in nonpartisan getouttovote efforts
it prohibits nonprofits from engaging in nonpartisan election activities period
i must tell you mr chairman i am deeply disturbed that we would add language to this bill to prohibit nonprofit organizations and groups churches synagogues mosques from engaging in civic participation activity like nonpartisan voter regulation and getoutthevote drives
the right to vote the right to participate in the democratic process in our country is almost sacred
the churches the synagogues religious institutions nonprofits have a long history of being involved in efforts to get people to participate to register and to vote
many faithbased groups will be prohibited from providing housing to people who desperately need it simply because part of their moral mission is to encourage people to vote to become participants in a democratic process
this provision would stifle people and organizations from engaging in their civic responsibilities
these groups are engaging in lawful nonpartisan civic activity and i can not believe that in 2005 this is not 1964 this is not 1965 this is not the oeo
what are we saying to the people around the world telling the people in iraq they can register they can vote they can participate but we are saying here in america that our own people nonprofit churches synagogues faithbased groups can not engage in nonpartisan voter registration and voter turnout
we must promote these activities not discourage them or penalize people for engaging in them
in my estimation it is dead wrong
mr chairman i am concerned about two provisions in this bill raising the conforming loan limit and the attempt to limit the ability of american citizens to engage in our democratic process currently contained in the manager s amendment offered by mr oxley
mr chairman in my district the median price for a home in santa clara county is 715 000 yes i said 715 000
in today s market that difference can be as much as 13500 per month
i remind my republican colleagues that this administration in testimony before the house financial services committee spoke in favor of raising the conforming loan limit
mr oxley seeks to prohibit nonprofit organizations from engaging in nonpartisan i repeat nonpartisan voter registration efforts and get out the vote drives in the 12month period prior to applying for funds made available through the affordable housing fund
if that was nt bad enough the amendment further prohibits nonprofits that receive grant funds from subsequently engaging in these important activities
what are you afraid of more americans exercising their right to participate in their government
mr chairman i rise in opposition to the measure before us today
specifically i stand in this house to condemn the language in this bill which would prohibit faithbased organizations our churches my church our temples and synagogues and mosques from helping the homeless by providing housing for the thousands of families in this country who are either homeless or in shelters or forced to live in substandard housing
under the express terms of this manager s amendment nonprofit groups that engage in voter participation activities will be prohibited from applying for a grant under the affordable housing fund
in this day and age when we are beset by major crises such hurricanes katrina and rita and wilma which have destroyed literally hundreds of thousands of homes across the southern part of this country it is no time to shackle the hands of our nonprofit faithbased organizations from doing what americans have always taken pride in and that is helping their neighbor
while like most members i deeply respect the separation of church and state in matters of worship and the freedom to practice religion without government influence there has always been in this country a recognition at least until now that we have faithbased institutions and when they have sought to provide basic assistance such as food for the hungry and health care for the sick and elderly and housing for the homeless free of any effort to persuade or proselytize they are in the business of solely reducing suffering and we have recognized the goodness in that
we would have a departure in this country from that long tradition and for those reasons i oppose this bill
it would be the first concrete step the congress has taken in support of housing in this administration
in this bill we found a bipartisan way to support housing using a new funding source
we put in place safeguards to prevent abuse
this bill is the best thing that has come along for housing in a very long time
i can not in good conscience vote for this bill with this provision in it
madam chairman i rise in opposition to the garrett amendment
this amendment would take out of the bill a provision that i strongly support which raises the permissible loan limits for fannie mae and freddie mac up to the median home price in high cost areas such as new york city
this is a simple and commonsense amendment which recognizes that home prices in some parts of the country are higher than in most of the nation
in these areas middle class families can not use lower rate gse loans to buy a median price home because the price will exceed the nationwide gse limit
simple fairness requires that we solve this problem and give middle class families in these areas the same opportunity to use a lowercost gse loan as those in other areas enjoy
i strongly supported raising the loan limit in high cost areas and i strongly oppose taking this provision out
so i urge my colleagues from these areas that are not affected by this amendment to join me in voting against it so that middle class workers across this nation will have a chance at the american dream of owning your own home
mr chairman as a member of the committee on financial services i am shocked and disappointed in the result of what up until now has been a true bipartisan policymaking effort
we in this committee this past may passed a bill hr 1461 by a vote of 655
in fact just yesterday i was talking about how the committee was working collectively together and there was really bipartisanship and we would come up with a bill that we could agree upon
unfortunately the republican study committee got involved and has pushed for an unjust and unnecessary amendment that restricts nonprofits that do not have housing as their primary purpose or engage in nonpartisan voter registration or education programs from receiving funds and grants
furthermore if you read this amendment it clearly states in its language that the restrictions for notforprofits are not the same restrictions as forprofits
i wonder if forprofits can engage in whatever they want to and still be able to participate in these fundings but notforprofits would not
we should be doing everything in our power to encourage people to come out to vote
they did not do this because they are afraid their own republican members that support the cdcs and faithbased affordable housing programs would vote in favor of the frank amendment
madam chairman i rise in strong opposition to the garrett amendment which would be devastating for middleclass families across new jersey and in highcost areas throughout the country
this means that in the highcost areas such as those in new jersey where the median home price exceeds the national price by at least 200 000 in counties like bergen and passaic families would not have access to an affordable loan
those who live in highercost areas do not deserve to be punished and should not have to move somewhere else to obtain an affordable home loan yet that is exactly what this amendment does
we should be trying to expand opportunities for families who dream of owning a home in the area they want to live in not shutting them out of achieving the american dream
madam chairman i rise in strong opposition to the garrett amendment which would be devastating for middleclass families across new jersey and in high cost areas throughout the country
the reality is home prices in highcost areas are skyrocketing at higher rates and to costs that are far above the national average
because his amendment would prohibit fannie and freddie from purchasing mortgages at a cost higher than the current limit families in high cost areas such as those in new jersey where the median home price exceeds the national median home price by at least 200 000 would not have access to any affordable loan
families that live in higher cost areas do not serve to be punished and should not have to move somewhere else to obtain an affordable home loan
a family living in bergen or passaic county for instance where the median home price is 390 000 would not be able to get an affordable loan from fannie or freddie simply because they live in an area where the cost excess the current limit
we should be trying to expand opportunities for families who dream of owning a home in the area they want to live not shutting them out from achieving the american dream
the goal is to make sure we find liquidity in the secondary marketplace so people in this country have a home
the more liquidity we have in the marketplace the more stability we have in the marketplace the better it is for the nation and the overall vibrant housing market
there is an amendment that is coming up later that guts something we tried to do in this bill and that is to make sure that gses can adequately provide loans in the markets throughout this country
and people who happen to live in certain areas that are considered highcost areas such as california new york massachusetts mr frank s state currently are not able to acquire freddie and fannie loans because the housing market has grown so much and the costs have grown so much that they have exceeded the limits that gses can lend in
and it is a shame that if people live in hawaii guam and places like that they can still get a freddie and fannie loan yet in california they can not
i rise in strong support of hr 1461 the federal housing finance reform act of 2005
in my district for example fannie mae has created employerassisted housing programs for the city of brea police department to allow police officers to live in the communities they serve
they have helped to finance affordable housing initiatives in anaheim california
across the district they have been able to offer innovative programs to allow those with blemished credit to afford the dream of homeownership to help seniors convert the equity in their homes into cash to help them meet their needs and to help families and individuals with special needs become homeowners
all of this in partnership with lenders is intended to meet the evergrowing needs of our communities
as we have addressed deficiencies in gse supervision we worked hard to ensure hr 1461 does not lose sight of congress original goal in chartering gses
the mission of fannie mae and freddie mac is to provide stability and ongoing assistance to the secondary market for residential mortgages and to promote access to mortgage credit and homeownership in the united states
while we make these regulatory reforms we are also unwavering in our commitment to help americans achieve the dream of homeownership
the bill we consider today is about homeownership in this country
hr 1461 provides for a strong regulator for the gses so that investors and the markets are assured that these companies are sound and that their investments in america s housing markets are safe
while gses are chartered to operate in every district across the country their effectiveness in certain areas has been seriously hindered because high housing prices have caused fewer and fewer mortgages to fall within the conforming loan limit
those who live in highcost areas of the country should be able to participate in federal efforts to provide affordable housing opportunities
it is unacceptable for the federal government to tell my constituents that federal programs exist to increase homeownership in america but they can not qualify simply because of where they happen to live and work
the language in the bill increases loan limits in high cost areas to the median home price of the area not to exceed the limit for alaska hawaii guam and the virgin islands 150 percent of national loan limit
this does not impact the portfolios of the gses as all loans made in highcost areas must be securitized
by adjusting conforming loan limits in highcost areas we can create nearly 250 000 new homeowners at no cost to taxpayers
adding this systemic risk language would likely add uncertainty and instability into the secondarymortgage market ultimately resulting in a negative impact on the housing markets
reducing the size of the gse portfolios for reasons other than those affecting the safety and soundness of the company could negatively impact home buyers and the mortgage market in the following ways one increasing mortgage rates for customers two limiting the liquidity available to small lenders to sell their mortgages and many more
limiting the gses ability to sustain the market in time of crises and keep mortgage rates stable
the gses mortgage investment activities are crucial to fulfilling their mission to provide liquidity stability and affordability in the residential mortgage market
arbitrarily forcing the gses to reduce their mortgage investments would reduce liquidity in the mortgage market hinder the gses ability to stabilize the market and make mortgage credit more expensive
in the second quarter of 2004 the national average was 692 percent
yet in new york new york it was 366 los angeles california 516 orange county california 614 and boston massachusetts 594
for example in the north new jersey metropolitan statistical area the median home price is 435 200
the conforming loan limit provision in this bill will make a meaningful cost difference for home buyers
in highcost areas a significant majority of entrylevel homes exceed the national conforming loan limit
the conforming loan limits language in hr 1461 will help nearly 245 000 firsttime home buyers
in fact in the gentleman from new jersey s mr garrett xz4001450 district alone it helps 42 987 firsttime buyers
there are three parts in section 123
the garrett amendment deletes all three in this section
this section sets conforming loan limits and requires the agency to make annual adjustments to the limits based on increases or decreases in a housing price index maintained by the agency
and three for highcost metropolitan statistical areas the conforming loan limit is raised to the lesser of 150 percent of the statutory limit or the median home price in the area
three it eliminates flexibility in loan limits to reflect market fluctuations and the gao study to develop loan limit is deleted by this amendment entirely
this bill was worked in a fashion to allow for that to allow systematic review yearly of these highcost areas so gses can go out and compete in the jumbo marketplace decreasing the cost of loans to individuals decreasing their payments allowing more individuals in the firsttime marketplace to own a home and get the best possible home they can buy especially during bad times
gses at that time pull into them in a heavier fashion to make sure there is liquidity
these loans just are just not sitting out there floating in the marketplace
mr chairman i rise in opposition to this legislation
the provision in question would disqualify any nonprofit group that engages in voter participation activities such as voter registration and getoutthevote efforts from applying for a grant under the affordable housing fund
how can the republicans in good faith claim to work with us on the reauthorization of the voting rights act and turn around and tie the hands of those groups who are trying to incorporate the disenfranchised into the democratic process
however they are free to engage in lobbying and nonpartisan voter registration with nonfederal dollars
this bill is a slap in the face to those groups who need this money most
i encourage my colleagues to join me in opposing this bill and supporting the motion to recommit
mr chairman i rise today in support of the bill
as chairman of the subcommittee on housing and community opportunity i have had a keen interest in the strength of the mortgage market
passage of this bill sends an important signal that we understand the importance of gses and the secondarymortgage markets in maintaining a stable economy
as a result our homeownership rates and our access to capital are the best in the world
we have to ensure that these communities that have not been full participants in the pursuit of the american dream can be reached
of course there are other parts of this bill that are good and i give credit to the gentleman from ohio mr oxley xz4003070 and the gentleman from louisiana mr baker xz4000120 in strengthening oversight
i also want to thank housing subcommittee chairman ney for taking a leadership role in developing the housing goals and affordable housing fund sections of the bill as well as our ranking member mr frank for his constructive input on many of the bill s key provisions
the gses are among the largest financial institutions with 25 trillion in assets
eight thousand banks thrifts and credit unions have 550 billion in loans from the 12 federal home loan banks
we have heard from some that congress should be cautious in creating a gse regulator and mindful not to harm the housing market
however we are here today largely because we have learned over the past 2 years about multiple accounting violations and widespread corporate mismanagement by the gses resulting in billiondollar earnings restatements
federal reserve chairman greenspan has called for a mandatory reduction in their 15 trillion in mortgage portfolio holdings
hr 1461 strikes the right balance by fully empowering the gse regulator while at the same time allowing the gses to pursue their mission in the housing market
by charter they must assist in providing mortgages for low and moderateincome families
in comparison cbo estimated that in 2003 gse status provided fannie mae and freddie mac a 20 billion federal subsidy onethird of which was retained by stockholders and management not passed through to borrowers
this should result in fannie and freddie leading the market rather than lagging behind private sector lenders as hud has found in promoting affordable housing for underserved communities
the gentleman from louisiana mr baker xz4000120 has toiled in the vineyards for all of these years and we have finally reached a situation where we can finally pass legislation that will improve the regulatory structure of the gses ultimately make them stronger and more accountable provide affordable housing funds through the gses throughout the country and particularly related to the hurricaneaffected areas
i agree that i will request the rules committee make this amendment in order as part of a manager s amendment during consideration of the bill and to consult with your committee in providing an explanation of its contents
as you know the committee on the judiciary has jurisdiction over matters concerning independent litigation bankruptcy laws civil judicial matters and other subject matter contained in the bill
i am pleased to acknowledge the agreement between our committees to address changes that you will include in a manager s amendment to the bill concerning independent litigating authority
in order to expedite this legislation for floor consideration the judiciary committee agrees to forgo action on this bill based on the agreement reached by our committees and with the understanding that no other provisions affecting the jurisdiction of the judiciary committee are included in the amendment to hr 1461
a provision in section 144 of hr 1461 would provide an exemption for a limitedlife enterprise from federal taxes and thus falls within the jurisdiction of the committee on ways and means
however in order to expedite this legislation for floor consideration the committee will forgo action on this bill
this is being done with the understanding that it does not in any way prejudice the committee with respect to the appointment of conferees or its jurisdictional prerogatives on this or similar legislation
i would appreciate your response to this letter confirming this understanding with respect to hr 1461 and would ask that a copy of our exchange of letters on this matter be included in the congressional record during floor consideration
it is my expectation that this bill will be scheduled for floor consideration in the near future
i acknowledge your committee s interest in a provision contained in section 144 of the bill which would provide an exemption for a limitedlife enterprise from federal taxes
however i appreciate your willingness to forego action on hr 1461 in order to allow the bill to come to the floor expeditiously
i will include this exchange of correspondence in the congressional record when this bill is considered by the house
the fund will sunset in 5 years when its extension will be considered
thereafter priority in funding will be based on greatest impact geographic diversity timely action as well as other disaster area needs
nonprofit recipients must have affordable housing as their primary purpose and beginning 1 year before applying nonprofits and their affiliates can not have engaged in federal election activity electioneering communication or lobbying
in addition the manager s amendment includes a request from the committee on the judiciary to require consultation with the attorney general by the gse regulator when exercising new litigation authority and from the committee on government reform to remove a freedom of information act exemption for the proceedings of the new agency s oversight board
hr 1461 consolidates current gse regulation by two agencies in hud into one agency
the manager s amendment clarifies that existing rules and regulations will remain in force during the 6month transition period and until changed by the new federal housing finance agency
mr chairman i would simply say in summary to ask the members to support the manager s amendment
we need to support the folks down in the gulf region that were affected by the hurricane
the purpose of the manager s amendment was twofold to insure that money was available as quickly as possible to those victims who are 100 000 homeless just in louisiana alone to make certain that they can get access to that as quickly as possible secondly to make certain that the groups that are building those homes are not political front groups for a right or left agenda but ones who are sincerely interested in building with bricks and mortar to provide that opportunity to those folks
if you want to help those folks in the gulf region and you want to make certain that money is used effectively and not in a political way support the oxley manager s amendment
mr chairman i rise to claim the time in opposition to the amendment but am not opposed and would indicate that we are pleased to accept the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from indiana and applaud her for her foresight and leadership in the area of manufactured housing
mr chairman i rise to claim the time in opposition but i also want to say i do not oppose this amendment
madam chairman i claim the time in opposition although i am not opposed to the amendment
as a matter of fact i am very much in favor of the amendment and i congratulate the gentlewoman from california for her amendment
i know the gentleman from delaware mr castle xz4000700 and the gentleman from michigan mr ehlers xz4001190 and others on our side of the aisle have been very interested in this entire issue
madam chairman let me just say to my friend from pennsylvania there are some sections of that amendment that i support in terms of independence
in fact it failed on a tie vote in the committee
mr speaker i rise in opposition to the motion to recommit
let me first of all say to my friend from massachusetts who worked very well with us in committee on this important legislation let us not lose sight of the fact that this is the first major gse reform bill to ever come before any congress
all it says is that we want groups that have had a record of building houses a record of building houses in the various states to be able to do that
fourthly let me add the gentleman from massachusetts mr frank xz4001400 in his motion talks about a nonpartisan basis
there is no definition in the campaign laws that i can find that defines what is essentially nonpartisan and i think we need to keep that in mind
understand this effort is to try to get as much money into the areas in particularly the first 2 years in the hurricanerelated areas so we can provide affordable housing
those folks along the gulf coast that were affected florida alabama mississippi texas need to understand that this is the best way to provide affordable housing as quickly as possible with the maximum amount of oversight in this area
in addition to establishing a very strong independent regulator the legislation will also create a sorely needed affordable housing fund
the housing fund will help people with low incomes who face the greatest difficulty in finding housing that is available and affordable but as we put forward this new housing fund i do not think the manager s amendment is a very good one
we should never force nonprofits to choose between providing affordable housing and encouraging full participation in the american dream
a recent study has found that 48 million working families many of them middleincome have faced critical housing needs in recent years spending more than half of their income on rent or living in substandard housing
in 2003 fannie mae and freddie mac purchased 35 percent of all mortgages originated nationwide
in several highcost housing areas these institutions were able to purchase fewer than 30 percent of the new mortgages
in my area a large portion of real estate transactions take place over the conforming loan limit
in my own district my own area bergen passaic and essex counties the median price of housing is 125 percent above the existing loan limit one of the highest rates in the country
it prevents many middleclass families in new jersey from being able to own a home in the state
according to the congressional budget office the housingrelated gses received almost 20 billion dollars worth of indirect federal subsidies in fiscal year 2004 alone
this implicit promise by the government to bail out the gses in times of economic difficulty helps the gses attract investors who are willing to settle for lower yields than they would demand in the absence of the subsidy
more importantly the line of credit is a promise on behalf of the government to engage in a massive unconstitutional and immoral income transfer from working americans to holders of gse debt
i hope my colleagues join me in protecting taxpayers from having to bail out fannie mae and freddie mac when the housing bubble bursts
federal reserve chairman alan greenspan has expressed concern that the government subsidies provided to the gses makes investors underestimate the risk of investing in fannie mae and freddie mac
each branch was created as sovereign in its sphere and there were to be clear lines of accountability for each branch
and of course independent regulators enforce the laws in the same way as do other parts of the executive branch yet independent regulators lack the daytoday accountability to the executive that provides a check on other regulators
this flies in the face of the founders opposition to concentrations of power and government bureaucracies that lack accountability
for example in the scheme established by hr 1461 the regulator s budget is not subject to appropriations
while the regulator is accountable to a board of directors this board may conduct all deliberations in private because it is not subject to the sunshine act
ironically by transferring the risk of widespread mortgage defaults to the taxpayers through government subsidies and convincing investors that all is well because a worldclass regulator is ensuring the gses soundness the government increases the likelihood of a painful crash in the housing market
despite the longterm damage to the economy inflicted by the government s interference in the housing market the government s policy of diverting capital into housing creates a shortterm boom in housing
like all artificially created bubbles the boom in housing prices can not last forever
these losses will be greater than they would have been had government policy not actively encouraged overinvestment in housing
perhaps the federal reserve can stave off the day of reckoning by purchasing the gses debt and pumping liquidity into the housing market but this can not hold off the inevitable drop in the housing market forever
in fact postponing the necessary and painful market corrections will only deepen the inevitable fall
the more people are invested in the market the greater the effects across the economy when the bubble bursts
of course these new regulations are justified in part by the gses government subsidies
we once again see how one bad intervention in the market the gses government subsidies leads to another the new regulations
in conclusion hr 1461 compounds the problems with the gses and may increases the damage that will be inflicted by a bursting of the housing bubble
instead of expanding unconstitutional and market distorting government bureaucracies congress should act to remove taxpayer support from the housing gses before the bubble bursts and taxpayers are once again forced to bailout investors who were misled by foolish government interference in the market
today the administration sent a letter around and said that the debt of the gses totals 25 trillion and they also guarantee in addition 24 trillion
so it is a tremendous amount of money and credit that is in the system and people have become frightened about this including chairman of the federal reserve board alan greenspan
also in this bill of course we are adding into this a brand new housing program which is said to probably involve another billion dollars in the next 2 years
from a market viewpoint this is not good because we want the money in the market to be allocated purely by the market and not by government direction
but without addressing the basic flaw in the system that has created this 5 trillion worth of debt believe me we will not have an answer
mr chairman i thank the gentlemen from the financial services committee mr frank and mr oxley for working in a bipartisan way to build broad support for the gse reform bill they bring to the floor today
if enacted it will be the first affordable housing resource created without using federal dollars since congress established the federal home loan banks affordable housing program in 1989
unfortunately my republican conservative colleagues hijacked this bill in an effort to strip away the bipartisan housing fund
when they were not able to completely get rid of it they limited its use by blocking nonprofit organizations and faithbased groups who engage in vote registration with their own funds from even applying for grants to build affordable housing
our democracy depends on protecting the right of every american citizen to vote and to register to vote in every election
as the supreme court noted no right is more precious in a free country than that of having a voice in the election of those who make the law under which as good citizens we must live we dare not we must not create barriers on the right to vote and undermine 40 years of progress
no church no religious order no faithbased group or nonprofit organization should face the prospect of being deemed ineligible for money to help lowincome elderly or disabled individuals find affordable homes simply because they offer a full range of services including counseling clothing mentoring and yes helping people fulfill their right to participate in their government
we must use the opportunity in this bill to recommit ourselves to the ideals of equality and opportunity that are both our hope and our future
i rise today mr chairman because i am concerned about specific provisions in the manager s amendment which could have unintended consequences on members of our senior population and the ability of nonprofits to work together to serve lowincome communities
specifically mr chairman i would like to receive some assurance from you that you will work with me on these issues as we move toward a final bill in conference
and first i would like to work to clarify language in the amendment so it does not disqualify nonprofits from participating in the affordable housing fund if they transport their own senior housing residents to the polls
secondly i would like to see clarification that the intention of the language in the manager s amendment pertaining to overlapping board membership was not to disallow single individuals from serving on the board of two organizations
rather the language was sought to disqualify affiliated organizations from participating in the fund where clear control of one organization is maintained by another which is participating in election activities
i am not in need of any further time and i thank the chairman for his understanding of these issues
i voted in favor of this legislation but with some reservation
this is an important goal and while i support the bill and the establishment of the affordable housing fund i do not support the inclusion of language that blocks nonprofit organizations from nonpartisan activities that encourage citizens to participate in our democratic process
the amendment included language that will prohibit grantees from using even their own funds to encourage citizens to exercise their right to vote and would retroactively penalize organizations that have done so in the past
this language would restrict nonprofits who engage in first amendment political activity with their own funds from receiving affordable housing fund grants
in short it will have a chilling effect on the free speech rights of nonprofit organizations
by keeping funding out of the hands of nonprofit and faithbased organizations that are associated with any kind of voter registration activities and exempting forprofit companies from the same restrictions i ask what legitimate governmental interest is there in preventing nonpartisan voter participation activities
i will continue to protect our citizens ability to register to vote and have a voice in the political process
mr chairman i rise today in support of this amendment dealing with systemic risk to hr 1461 the legislation to reform oversight of the nation s three housing gses
i think most people would assume that congress would and should create a regulator with the authority to protect the broader financial system with respect to systemic risk especially in light of the warnings of systemic risk from the federal reserve and the treasury the 15 trillion of mortgage assets concentrated in just two companies the special ties the gses have with the federal government and the over 2 trillion in gse debt
i have just spoken with alan greenspan s office this afternoon and they totally reject the argument that the regulator has this ability to take into account the systemic risk and take the necessary actions in the bill and also the bush administration disagrees with that assertion
they think it is not in there
furthermore if the authority is already in the bill what is wrong with my additional 14 words stating it explicitly
let me also make the point that my amendment would allow the regulator to review the investment holdings of fannie mae and freddie mac and this authority is necessary because the huge concentration of onbalance sheet assets of fannie mae and freddie mac create too much interest rate risk in other words too much exposure to swings in interest rates in the hands of only a few risk managers
the traditional mortgage guarantee business model at fannie mae and freddie mac provides liquidity in the mortgage market and helps homeownership without increasing risk to the taxpayer
mr chairman congress failed to rein in the savings and loan industry in the early 1980s
that failure led to hundreds of billions of dollars in taxpayer losses
the bill was introduced on april 5 and referred to the committee on financial services which ordered the bill reported out by a vote of 655 on may 25 and filed in the house on july 14
any member wishing to offer an amendment should submit 55 copies of the amendment and one copy of a brief explanation of the amendment to the rules committee in room h312 of the capitol by noon on tuesday october 25 2005
members should use the office of legislative counsel to ensure that their amendments are drafted in the most appropriate format
you also in your leadership capacities and otherwise as a member of congress representing your constituents from maryland have been very vigorous in your support of the things which you believe the ideas which you choose to press to the rules committee
and i particularly want to thank the gentleman from louisiana mr baker xz4000120 for his efforts for years in this area and for the gentleman from ohio s mr oxley xz4003070 work and the gentleman from massachusetts mr frank xz4001400 work as well
this action we are taking today is in response to the information that we have learned about fannie mae and freddie mac
and again i thank our chairman for moving forward as he always does in a bipartisan way and for listening to the wisdom of the gentleman from louisiana mr baker xz4000120
i rise in strong support of this legislation and appreciate chairman oxley and chairman baker s efforts
fannie mae and freddie mac play a vital role in our housing finance market yet for far too long these companies have been playing by their own set of rules
fannie mae and freddie mac have 16 trillion in combined assets 14 trillion in retained mortgages in portfolio 15 trillion in outstanding debt and 15 trillion in notional derivatives
in addition outstanding mortgagebacked securities guaranteed by fannie and freddie but held by third parties total 17 trillion
mr chairman in the absence of a worldclass regulator to oversee these institutions we are truly playing russian roulette
creating a new regulator is not about punishing the gses it is in fact vital to the safety and soundness of our nation s housing market
i want to address a few key issues surrounding this legislation and share my thoughts on what i hope is ultimately included in the bill that is sent to the president
currently fannie mae and freddie mac are the only two publiclytraded companies in the fortune 500 that are exempt from regulation by the sec
the only reason fannie mae and freddie mac were forced to reveal their accounting errors is because in july 2002 under pressure from congress and the administration the two companies finally agreed to comply with certain reporting requirements of the securities exchange act of 1934
fannie mae followed through and registered in 2003 but failed to file a report in the third quarter of 2004 and is now in the process of restating those reports it did file
regarding the powers of the new regulator due to the enormity of the gses holdings it seems to me we should go even further in empowering this new office
finally regarding the affordable housing fund despite my concern that creating this fund will only deepen the perception the gses are backed by the federal government those concerns are outweighed by the pressing need for more affordable housing in connecticut and around the country
nonprofit organizations and social service providers in connecticut do an amazing job and are continually finding ways to do more with less
it s time we empowered housing organizations with additional resources to build more affordable units including in the gulf coast region devastated by hurricanes katrina and rita
i want to thank the chairman and the ranking member for including in the bill when it left our committee language proposed by the gentleman from california mr gary g miller xz4002770 and myself to raise the conforming loan limit in certain areas
since the beginning we recognized that a middleclass family can not find a home in alaska and hawaii at the same amounts with the same level of mortgage as in the other 48 states
we now must recognize that in los angeles new york and certain other areas housing prices are every bit as high as in some parts of alaska and hawaii
and that is why the bill that we need to defend from the garrett amendment provides for a conforming loan limit that is either as high as it is in alaska and hawaii or such lower amount as equals the average home price in that area
we have middleclass families in my district a police officer married to a teacher trying to get a home
it was a bill that even some people who had not wanted to support it went along with because in the final analysis it was going to bring about reform of the gses
we do not want them carrying debt that is not shown that we do not understand because we do not want these humongous general services enterprises to somehow get in trouble and we have to bail them out the way we did with the s amp ls
after the bill left committee they decided that they were going to try to put some unconstitutional boundaries on nonprofits and i guess profitmaking organizations alike that would not allow them to participate in the production of low and moderateincome housing no matter what the need no matter what the crisis if in fact they exercised their constitutional rights to assist people and lead people in doing voter registration
this government has shown that it indeed supports reaching out to the citizens of this country to encourage them to be involved in voting and participating in this democracy
we have the motor voter act which says motor vehicle departments all over the country when people register their vehicles encourage them to vote give them voter regulation slips do whatever you can to get them involved in the political process
we know that we have gone through some terrible terrible times recently here in this country down in florida where there were databases that were developed of people supposedly who had been incarcerated and committed felonies that were supposedly not allowed to vote
mr chairman despite the divisiveness of the term faithbased most americans are united in their support of religious organizations
across the country these organizations do great work feeding the hungry caring for the sick and in many cases providing affordable housing to those most in need
that s why it s surprising that the republicans are using an otherwise worthy effort to reform government sponsored enterprises like fannie mae and freddie mac to throw a wrench in the relationship between government and the religious community
yet language passed in the managers amendment stops that money from flowing to faithbased organizations
today in brooklyn and queens alone catholic charities operates 3 000 units of affordable housing including 2 090 units for senior citizens 480 units of family housing and 377 units of supportive housing for formerly homeless individuals
but the church the largest nonprofit provider of low income housing in brooklyn and queens will be shut out of the new program
i believe that is exactly what republicans have done in order to take the teeth out of a program designed to help those most in need
that is exactly what the affordable housing fund would have allowed faithbased organizations to do in partnership with the federal government until republicans inserted their limiting provisions
in the words of the most rev
nicholas dimarzio bishop of brooklyn in a letter to the speaker dated october 3 there are ample ways to write safeguards into the legislation to prevent the diversion of affordable housing funds to uses other than what they are intended without requiring recipients to forego their constitutionally protected rights as a condition for participating in affordable housing fund programs i include the bishop s letter for the record
as i noted in my june 10 letter to the house of representatives the catholic community through our charities agencies dioceses and parishes serves tens of thousands of men women and children who struggle to maintain adequate housing
proposals that would limit eligible recipients to organizations that have as their primary purpose the provision of affordable housing would effectively prevent catholic dioceses parishes and catholic charities agencies from participating in affordable housing fund programs
similarly proposals that would prohibit recipients from engaging in voter registration and lobbying activities with their own funds during the period they are utilizing affordable housing funds would force catholic agencies to choose between participating in affordable housing fund programs or engaging in constitutionally protected voter registration and lobbying activities with their own funds
i urge you to oppose inclusion of these kinds of unnecessary limitations and prohibitions in hr 1461 as it moves to the house floor for the bishops statement putting children and families first notes many families can not find or afford decent housing or must spend so much of their income for shelter that they forego other necessities such as food and medicine
the catholic bishops support housing policies which seek to preserve and increase the supply of affordable housing and help families pay for it we must put in place a sustainable source of funds to build affordable housing and this new fund would do that
as i said in my june letter this legislation presents congress with a genuine opportunity to make the shelter needs of extremely lowincome families a national priority
we pay a lot more in taxes than we get back in fact the median home price is approaching 1 million
they want middleclass families in their area to be able to secure a gse loan
they want teachers firefighters and policemen who serve and live in areas of the country where the housing market is soaring to be eligible for an gse loan
we must preserve the section of the underlying bill that allows for raising conforming loan limits in high cost areas
mr chairman i rise in opposition to the leach amendment
hr 1461 clearly stipulates that the new regulator for fannie freddie and the home loan banks has the authority to increase the minimum capital levels to the extent needed to ensure that the regulated entities operate in a safe and sound manner this is a broad grant of authority to this new regulator
the leach amendment however begins to limit the discretion of the regulator by adding several competitive issues in the determination of the minimum capital
one of the things that we need to make sure of is that if we are going to form a worldclass regulator for these entities and that we are going to put in place people to manage that process and to regulate these entities we need to give them the discretion that they need to make sure that as they set those capital levels that they are considering the economy the state of the markets at that particular time and have the ability to regulate to those entities and not try to make those entities something that they are not and these entities are not banks
mr chairman i rise today to strongly oppose the paul amendment and the civic engagement restrictions in the manager s amendment we previously debated
thousands of floridians are living in shelters as thousands of homes in the state were severely or completely destroyed
people in florida texas the gulf states and across the country have been affected by these storms and have real life issues to deal with food shelter clothing fuel lines for 2 and 3 hours to get fuel
maybe some folks are listening in their offices
why was it taken up in the first place
this has nothing to do with whether or not there is some rational process that has been undertaken and everybody in here knows it
they were going to close a facility up in maine and the people in maine in their panic said do not take us take pearl harbor instead
we need every shipyard facility that we can get in this country
we are going to be going back out to guam soon because of what is taking place in the pacific right now and having to recapitulate everything that got put under the water out there in guam billions of dollars is going to have to be put back into guam in order for us to be able to protect and project our strategic interests in the pacific
we are under a review right now in the armed services committee and we do not even have the courage of our own convictions under our own jurisdictions in our committees
when you come over here search your conscience and for once let us live up to what people expect of us in this congress
they want to be able to look in the mirror at night and recognize somebody with a little bit of integrity and walk into their homes justified
if we are going to justify our job everybody knows in their heart that we should not be voting for this regardless of our good friends being on it like mr hansen and mr bilbray for example who are colleagues and personal friends to many of us here
mr chairman i rise in support of h j res 65 to disapprove the recommendations of the base realignment and closure commission brac
closing surplus military infrastructure makes sense but only if it is done in a proper strategic context and through a rational deliberative and fair process
secretary of defense rumsfeld proposed this brac in 2001 before september 11 and our occupation of afghanistan and iraq
i voted against this brac in 2001 on the grounds that it presumptively put infrastructure decisions before force structure decisions
at the time i said that with uncertainty about our future military needs in the new security environment i believe that this is not the right time to add a new layer of uncertainty to our military communities in maine by approving a new base closure round my view has been validated by the statements of the base realignment and closure commission itself
in its final report the commission faulted the department of defense dod for making infrastructure decisions prior to conducting a comprehensive review of the underlying strategic issues that is to be set forth in the 2006 quadrennial defense review which may have better informed and assisted the commission in making its final recommendations the commission also criticized dod for failing to provide necessary source data on its proposals for as long as a month after the dod list was submitted
why are we building new bases in iraq while closing them in america
will our troops in iraq and afghanistan have the right facilities to come home to
for example the commission voted to keep open the submarine base at new london ct and the portsmouth naval shipyard in my district
in addition i object to this brac list due to the inexplicable and unwise closure of the brunswick naval air station nasb
this facility is the last remaining fully operational military airfield in the northeast
its loss will hamper our capability to perform homeland defense and maritime patrol missions in the region leaving a vulnerable flank for the entire nation
it failed to explain how or at what monetary or mission cost the military could perform essential maritime patrol missions in the northeast without brunswick
in closing nasb the commission appeared to deviate from its own charter
it justified closing the base merely in order to reduce excess capacity and result in significant savings despite its own directive to seek a balance between the goals of realizing savings and rationalizing our military infrastructure to meet the needs of future missions
i was pleased that the commission listened to the arguments put forth to them and voted to reject the closure of two facilities in maine the portsmouth naval shipyard and the defense finance and accounting service in limestone where the commission also agreed to double the number of jobs
despite these positive outcomes however the unjustified closure of brunswick affirms my opposition to this brac list as well as the underlying fact that this was the wrong time in our nation s history for this brac
let s put its savings in perspective
the 20year savings approximately 800 million from the closure of brunswick naval air station is the equivalent to half a week of operations in iraq
the entire projected 20year savings from the brac list 36 billion are exhausted by just 6 months in iraq
the entire savings is also merely half that of the president s proposed tax cuts this year 70 billion and minuscule compared to the 4 trillion in federal revenue losses from upperincome tax breaks passed since 2001
in a time of uncertainty we risk losing national assets we can never recover
mr chairman i appreciate the gentleman s courtesy in permitting me to speak against this resolution
we were in the crosshairs in my community and some of the issues that were raised earlier about the friction within the pentagon the inability to appropriately focus on the value of the air guard and there were some other issues that were at work here
the brac process in our case allowed us to make the case
we were able to document that the transfer of the air guard actually would end up costing the taxpayer money and we were able to demonstrate that it would leave a whole sector of the northwest united states vulnerable taking away critical air support that has loomed larger as we deal with the role of homeland security in our national defense
i would hope that our friends on the armed services committee would focus on adjustments that may need to be made to the brac process to allow a higher priority attached to homeland security in these decisions in the future
indeed the mather air force base in california in sacramento closed in 1988
i think in the main brac has worked
mr chairman many of us who have been privileged to serve in this great institution for some time have been through this process many times
i have been through that before with a magnificent air force base that dissolved back as a result of the 1993 commission report and in 1995 it actually closed down with a couple of exceptions
and there were some people in the community at large who wanted to write the economic obituary for that community rome new york and the surrounding areas
today that oncevibrant military installation griffis air force base is now a very vibrant business and technology park with upwards of 4 000 people gainfully employed there but part of that installation involves an air force research laboratory which was set off as a containment area as a result of the decision to close the base in 1993 and the people at dod and everywhere were wondering would this work
it has worked in spades and now the air force research laboratory incidentally operating out of a 25 million stateoftheart new facility is the center of excellence for the entire air force in command control communications and intelligence technology
so brac looked at that and made the decision that some operations that had been located there should be transferred elsewhere in line with the overall scheme of the air force to consolidate like operations at a central facility
some moved out some moved in
that did not really make a heck of a lot of sense and when all was said and done when the brac looked at that they recognized that maybe the answer was somewhere in between
influence down here did not make much difference in this process
what they listened to were the facts and the facts are that when they examined all of the dfas operations in 16 measurable categories where you could quantify where you could measure where you could compare the output of one against the other this installation was at or near the top
mr chairman i rise in reluctant support of the resolution to reject the recommendations of the base closure and realignment commission
in my view the commission ignored a number of important factors
the activities conducted at this site for the navy air force missile defense agency and others can not be replicated anywhere else in the nation
moreover the base s sea range is linked with other inland ranges in california providing an unmatched capability to the defense department
the effect of this would be immediately felt in iraq and afghanistan
i urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the resolution of disapproval
i think the fault lies originally with the pentagon recommendation because they simply did not take into account one of the best flying units in america
a political calculation on the part of the pentagon that because tennessee had a great air unit in memphis with c5s and a great air unit in knoxville with kc135s that therefore nashville had to lose one of the best air guard units in the country
they took the air out of the air national guard in nashville tennessee
then they did not take into account the fact that we had some of the newest and best facilities in all of our military the number one best hangar in america brand new barely opened and it will probably never see an airplane
it won the top air force award for best hangar in the country so why did american taxpayers pay 55 million for that hangar never to see it used
will that save the american taxpayer money when we already had one of the top units in the country in nashville performing perfectly
if you ask secretary rumsfeld he knows about the men and women from nashville who have flown him wherever he needed to go in the middle east or other places in the world
so i am in an ironic situation
i believe in the brac process
we can not just all protect our local bases but the pentagon s recommendation has to be based on sound military judgment and at least in this one small case it was not
unfortunately the brac commissioners did not have the temerity to override in this case at least the pentagon recommendation
if members talk to top folks in the pentagon they will tell you that from the expected savings from the brac round they are virtually gone because the brac commission did interfere in a lot of other bases and some services so 70 to 80 percent of the expected savings are not there
mr chairman i rise today in favor of h j res 65 which would reject the recommendations of the defense base closure and realignment commission
let me briefly discuss these flaws using the 118th air wing aw stationed in nashville as an example
the decision regarding the realignment of the 118th aw one of the premier c130h flying units in the united states illustrates the nature of the flawed recommendations that grew out of a closed process
next consider the airmen and airwomen left behind in enclaves
the direct and indirect personnel costs of realigning units like the 118th aw do not appear to have been considered in the brac process
for example in nashville we have spent over 55 million over the last five years on military construction to include a new state of the art hangarmaintenance complex that won an air force design award
yet it appears much of this new construction was not considered in the evaluation of the 118th aw s military value consequently these excellent facilities will remain in limbo neither closed nor fully operational
where is the efficiency cost savings or operational advantage in this arrangement
i feel that insufficient attention was paid to the role each individual base played in the united states national security and more importantly the homeland security
the recommendations seem to be based much more on bean counting than strategic value nowhere more so than in the case of ellington field in houston texas
ellington field is currently home to the texas air national guard s 147th fighter wing who just got back from iraq and showed themselves to be exemplary not just in their efforts before going to iraq but in iraq itself
they were absolutely exemplary in their efforts and in their service
we appreciate them in everything that they do
its national and homeland security facilities should be plain to anyone as in need of more personnel greater maintenance and better military assets
yet the brac commission has chosen to realign ellington removing its f16 fighter wing and leaving the gulf coast to my mind in many ways more vulnerable than it is now
it is the only region in the entire united states that has all nine of those targets
i join with the proponents of this resolution and for that matter the two brac commissions including chairman principi who voted to save ellington in their frustration
this round of recommendations in my view does not accomplish that goal
mr chairman today i rise in support of h j res 65
i expected the dod and the commission to follow the criteria outlined in the brac legislation
the brac commission recommended realignment of installations in the 17th congressional district of illinois but failed to base its decision on military value criteria
rock island dfas was rated number one in military value but the commission recommended consolidation at facilities rated substantially below rock island columbus 7 indianapolis 9 cleveland 12 limestone 17 rome 19
the brac decisions regarding not only bases in illinois but throughout the nation are extremely frustrating because the commission recognized the military value and cost savings provided streamlining of bases already undertaken on a local level
mr chairman i want to thank the gentleman from peoria illinois who has done an outstanding job in fighting this battle
mr chairman i rise today in opposition to h j res 65 a resolution disapproving the recommendations of the defense base realignment and closure commission
it is clear that we have too much military infrastructure in this country whose operations and maintenance compete for scarce resources needed by our warfighter and modernization efforts
i am pleased that the commission recognized the importance of keeping the operations and sustainment systems group ossg at maxwellgunter afb in montgomery alabama
the brac decision was due in large part to the worldclass combat operational support provided by the ossg to air force bases and dod agencies around the world from montgomery for more than 30 years
it did not need to be moved in order to continue to perform this critical national security mission
the disa presence along with the ossg enables testing of enterprisewide combat support software applications in an operational environment
with its extensive background experience and expertise this organization is truly a one of a kind national resource and belongs in montgomery
specifically i have trouble seeing the logic in overturning dod s recommendation to move the aviation logistics school to fort rucker
as the premier rotary wing aviation training center in the united a second notable absence from the brac recommendations is consolidation of rotary wing pilot training at fort rucker
although dod did not make this recommendation i believe a thorough review of the facts would have led the commission to include this in its final list
in addition when colin powell was chairman of the joint chiefs of staff he testified before the house armed services committee that he supported this consolidation at fort rucker
in the mid90s there was an effort made within the pentagon to move the attc out of fort rucker
as is the case now i was very disturbed by this and began to investigate in an effort to determine if this would be best for the army highlighted by a personal meeting with the thensecretary of the army togo west
this culminated when my amendment was included in the house version of fiscal year 1996 national defense authorization act hr 1530 which blocked the army s proposal to relocate the attc until an outside independent study at fort rucker the attc is able to have their fleet of approximately 40 test aircraft maintained by the large maintenance and logistics operation that supports the training mission on post
this irreplaceable natural asset can not be duplicated in huntsville
while i do not agree with all of the recommendations included in the commission s report i do recognize that the brac process must go forward
at present dod has excess infrastructure which needs to be realigned or closed in order to achieve the billions of savings which will result from the implementation of these recommendations
as costs of weapons systems crucial to winning the war on terror continue to rise it is important that we explore all avenues in order to find the money necessary to give the warfighter everything he or she needs to complete their mission
in conclusion i would like to thank all of the commissioners and their staffs for their tireless efforts on one of the most thankless jobs in government
ellington is in his district but i am the next closest member
this is the most illadvised illtimed round in base closure history
we currently have men and women fighting in two countries and we passed three large supplemental requests and the fourth likely in the next few months
we are in the process of closing bases overseas and bringing them home
houston is the fourth largest city in our nation
the houston ship channel in the port of houston handled more foreign tonnage than any other port
one of the most vulnerable targets in the area is the petrochemical complex along with these other assets
an attack on a chemical plant could result in a hazardous release and thousands of casualties
currently our 147th air wing provides air security in the area and the solution from the pentagon is rotating several planes to fly on alert out of ellington which provides a much smaller deterrent than having a full squadron
this is the most illadvised and illtimed round in the history of base realignments and closures
we currently have men and women fighting in two countries we have passed three of the largest supplemental requests in our nation s history with a fourth likely in the next several months and we are in the process of closing bases overseas and bringing troops home
like many other communities across the country the district i represent was affected by the defense department s plan to consolidate air national guard units leaving one of the largest metropolitan areas in the country less prepared to respond to a terrorist attack
houston is the fourth largest city in the nation and is home to a petrochemical complex that accounts for nearly half of the nation s base petrochemical production capacity
one of the most vulnerable targets in the area and possibly the country is the petrochemical complex a tremendous complex that stretches the length of the houston ship channel and continues along the coast through beaumont texas
we have seen in the aftermath of katrina and rita the negative effects caused by disruptions in our oil supply and refining capacity and leaving this area unprotected is leaving the door open to a terrorist attack on this critical infrastructure
the port of houston is the second largest petrochemical complex in the world and the largest in the western hemisphere which produces over 35 percent of the nation s gasoline at a great many refineries
an attack on a chemical plant could result in a hazardous release with thousands of casualties
currently the 147th fighter wing of the texas air national guard provides air security in the area and could respond to a threat on the complex or at the port in minutes because of the close proximity
rotating several planes to fly on alert out of ellington provides a much smaller deterrent than having a full squadron permanently stationed there and would not provide enough planes to respond to multiple attacks on multiple targets in the area
meanwhile the closest full squadron would be in san antonio and would take approximately 23 minutes longer to respond to a threat than the f16s at ellington can currently provide
in addition to providing security for the houston area the 147th is capable of providing precision strikes close air support offensive counter air defensive counter air and suppression of enemy air defenses
the savings estimated in the dod s brac report are minimal and do not justify moving the f16s away from ellington while it is estimated that retiring the f16s will save dod 36 million over 20 years an attack on any of the possible targets listed above especially the petrochemical facilities and port of houston would cost our national economy billions of dollars
mr chairman this round of brac is illadvised and illtimed and i urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this resolution
mr chairman i rise to join chairman hunter and ranking member skelton in opposing house joint resolution 65
each year i would offer an amendment in the armed services committee to put off the brac for many of the reasons that the gentleman from illinois has stated to put off the brac for 2 years until we could see where we are about bringing troops home to see where we are on our war against terror
each time it would pass overwhelmingly in committee it would pass overwhelmingly in this house and we would be shot down in the conference committee by the senate and the white house
in doing so they validated our belief that our military should not give up the ability to surge to meet future crises in times of war and peace allowing this ability that is fundamental to our nation s security
in balance mr chairman i feel that this may have been the best brac process that we have had in all of the brac processes we have had
to those of my colleagues who still may be on the fence about today s vote i would point out that disapproval of the brac 2005 recommendations would guarantee yet another round of base closures in the very near future
whether or not you support any given closure or realignment within brac 2005 i hope that all of my colleagues will recognize that the alternative which is another round of brac in the near future would be even worse
we did not close a major base in this country from the 1970s until the brac process began
but i would remind my colleagues again that if we vote for this resolution and this resolution passes today and we turn down this brac process we will be back here in this room a year from now or 2 years from now probably more like a year from now we will be back in this room dealing with another brac process and we will have the same arguments as we are having here today
mr chairman i rise reluctantly in support of this motion
i have been here through three of these and i always thought they were well reasoned before win lose or draw and by the standards of win lose or draw i probably came out okay in a lot of ways in this because four out of five facilities in my area did well
the army did well in this brac
i am going to read something here in a minute about that
that is what troubles me in this one because the air force set out on a plan to arrive at a number and they destroyed in my opinion much of what one of their components does best and that is the air national guard
let me tell you the soldiers that were in the dome shortly after katrina were ohio army guardsmen
they were flown there in 130s out of mansfield
the soldiers that were in mississippi from ohio were flown down by 130s from mansfield
the soldiers that were in texas from ohio were flown in by 130s from mansfield
so how many days are we going to wait to come in and pick those people up and bring them down
if you look at the chart that shows the support in the hurricane by the air national guard it is far superior to what the air reserve did or especially the active duty in response to these hurricanes
we put in over 85 million to make this a firstclass flight school
we put in a 10 million pad
now i find out there is another mission available for flight school but they want to take it and possibly put it in another place someplace else and spend the money again and take these airplanes
i am upset because they always did this by the numbers in the past
we thought we had this won until the air force went to the commissioners at the last moment and said hey you have got to change this because they were going in the right direction the day before
i think this happened in more instances than just mine and that is why i am so upset about the way this was done
so i am just hoping the people will vote in support of the resolution
however i can not in good conscience accept a process that was fundamentally flawed and very unfair in the decisions made with regard to our country s national guard and reserve
we testified at hearings in buffalo and washington dc and briefed brac commissioners and staff during site visits to dscc in columbus and to wrightpatterson
we also worked together in reviewing the numbers used by the pentagon in making their brac recommendations
mr chairman i think that i can speak for other delegations when stating that our efforts in getting information from the air force during this brac round did not start well
first of all the brac analysis material stated there is only one f16 formal training unit in the air national guard
i was the chairman of the appropriations subcommittee for military construction at the time and i agreed to support the air force in this effort
more than 75 million in federal funding has been invested in the springfield base to support its f16 training mission
over the years we have put in a new ramp to accommodate the plane a flight simulator a dining hall an operations building and a new control tower that is still under construction
in fact the commission actually concluded in its report that dod s recommendation to realign the springfield base should be supported even though the military value criteria were flawed and the realignment will be a cost instead of savings to the pentagon fourth the air force lacks sufficient training capacity for f16 pilots
if we further reduce this capacity through this proposed realignment it even further diminishes this capability especially since this unit is the highest f16 pilot production unit in the guard
the brac analysis on springfield shows that operational personnel will begin to leave the base in 2007 while there are student pilots scheduled for training in 2008
like some of my colleagues i think it is fair for us to consider what these brac recommendations will mean for the future of the national guard in responding to emergency situations
as we saw in the days following the recent hurricanes in the gulf coast region and on 911 the air national guard was a critical resource in transporting troops supplies and protection
for example the mansfield ohiobased 179th airlift wing flew over 50 missions in support of hurricane katrina relief efforts
overall i was very disappointed in the process by which the air national guard decisions were made particularly the flaws in the air force analysis
i pointed out that there was no discussion when by the numbers we had demonstrated the flaws in the pentagon s proposal
finally in early september i wrote to the president requesting the same information and for his consideration to send the recommendations impacting the air national guard back to the brac commission with instructions to use programmatic changes to reshape our state militia forces
unfortunately for the men and women in the guard and reserve i am still waiting for a reply
in columbus the defense supply center will maintain its 6 000 jobs and is scheduled to receive many highpaying jobs
but mr chairman i think that in the years to come when the recommendations regarding the guard and reserve are set in motion people will realize that this latest brac round was flawed and consequently the wrong thing to do
mr chairman i thank the gentleman from illinois both for introducing this resolution and for yielding me some time to speak in support of the resolution
of course we should take steps even if politically difficult to cut waste and improve efficiency in the military
also the overseas basing commission noted that the pentagon had not factored in the impact of the return of tens of thousands of personnel from europe to the united states in its brac recommendations and even now we are proceeding with the brac process before the pentagon has even completed its periodic force review which is supposed to be the blueprint for what we need for the 21st century
so we will be closing bases losing key personnel diminishing critical capabilities even before we have determined which of those capabilities we need in order to meet current and future threats
i certainly can find fault with some of the specifics in here
i am very familiar with the excellent work done by the people at fort monmouth in central new jersey where they do electronics command control communications computers
they have taken the lead in developing countermeasures to detect and disarm roadside bombs in iraq
in the end however the commission produced a series of recommendations that could not be right because the whole thing was flawed from the beginning
in the resolution before us today we have the means to stop this flawed and dangerous process and it is apparent that the commissioners knew that they were not getting it right
in the case of fort monmouth for example in their recommendations they charged congress not that they are able to charge congress but nevertheless they did to review their results with respect to fort monmouth to say do not go ahead with them if it might hurt the capabilities that we need to fight terrorism around the world to support our troops in the field and iraq and afghanistan
they actually said that in their recommendations
for those of us with military installations in our districts the brac process is a trying one
in addition by a vote of 43 to 14 the armed services committee reported this resolution adversely to the house with a recommendation that it do not pass
as such i intend to vote against house joint resolution 65 today thereby allowing the brac commission recommendations to stand and i would urge my colleagues to join me in doing so
since their appointments this spring the commissioners visited more than 170 installations conducted 20 regional hearings and 20 deliberative hearings and participated in hundreds of meetings with public officials
tony principi took on another tough one in chairing this brac commission
it is a commission in which you get beaten up lots of times secondguessed a lot and crossexamined a lot
also we had on our committee two former members of the armed services committee who were on the brac commission jim bilbray and jim hansen and mr chairman they have served us well as senior statesmen in again what amounted to very very difficult roles
i stand here in opposition to that resolution and support the brac process
i also understand that the brac process assists the department in maximizing joint utilization of defense resources and reallocates military personnel from supporting and operating unnecessary and underutilized infrastructure
however i believe that the brac process should remain a fair process allowing for every facility to be evaluated in a clear and consistent manner
let me state that i am extremely pleased that on august 26 2005 the brac commission decided not only to reverse its decision to close the defense finance accounting service in cleveland ohio but to expand and add jobs at this facility
this facility has earned the right to remain open and continue to provide aplus services to its executive clients and most importantly the men and women serving in afghanistan iraq and around the world
dfas cleveland is an integral part of the nerve center that supports our troops on the ground in iraq and worldwide
in addition i would like to thank the gentleman from ohio mr latourette xz4002350 who is seated on the floor and his staff for all the work they did in supporting dfas as well as the gentleman from ohio mr kucinich xz4002270 for his tireless efforts
through our collaboration we were able to outline to the commission the various discrepancies in the initial recommendation and make a good case for reversing the recommendation for removing the cleveland dfas office
in the city of cleveland we have lost so many jobs over the past 4 years
again i vehemently argue in opposition to h j res 65 and thank my colleagues for their support
mr chairman i rise in opposition to this resolution because i believe the brac commission has performed its job admirably
it wisely chose to remove from the closure list the defense finance and accounting services in cleveland which was scheduled to lose 1 028 jobs
this came after a very strong community effort in cleveland that was led by the greater cleveland partnership and attorney fred nance whose brilliant presentation at the brac commission hearing was quite persuasive
the gentleman from ohio has demonstrated that a bipartisan cooperation and partnership can be quite successful in helping to strengthen a community s economic position
we worked together along with the gentlewoman from ohio mrs jones xz4002081 other federal officials and local officials to ensure that we made the best case possible as to why the people who do an admirable service at dfas in cleveland should be permitted to continue doing their work
the brac commission reversal wound up adding 475 jobs in addition to saving the current jobs
the brac commission showed independence from the pentagon which is a rare feat in washington dc
this shows all of us why independence in our government s decisionmaking process is a crucial ingredient to ensure that the right decisions are made
the commission accepted the argument that the pentagon should not move jobs from cleveland a city with one of the highest poverty rates in the nation to other cities which ranked much lower in poverty
so in all i believe that the brac recommendations represented a very thoughtful wellreasoned set of recommendations
mr chairman i would like to claim the 1 hour in support of the resolution
mr chairman the reason that i introduced this resolution is because i feel very strongly that we are in a position in the house to send a very strong message of support to those who are doing the hard work in iraq those who have done the hard work in afghanistan and those men and women who we call our citizen soldiers and a big debt of thanks for what they have been doing in the work that we have asked them to do
and no politician can take credit for what has taken place in afghanistan
and no politician can take credit for what has taken place in iraq
i have supported president bush on every request that he has made before this house for the money to support our troops and now we have more than 135 000 troops and many men and women working in the state department and the embassy there trying to help stand up a democracy help stand up a police force and help bring about democracy in iraq
these hardworking men and women have done the job that we asked them to do and that is the reason that we have seen such great success in afghanistan and in iraq
the governors should have a say in what bases are closed
so i say to those in the house that today is not the day to send the kind of message that we will be sending if we do not approve the resolution that was considered by the armed services committee and being considered here today
i know what the chairman said about those who served on the brac but i am not sure that we were quite as well served by some of those members as we could have been in some of their deliberations
i urge the house to adopt this resolution in support of those that have done the hard work in support of those who are citizen soldiers who come from the communities that we represent and say to them we thank you for your hard work
we thank you for helping stand up a democracy in iraq and we are not going to eliminate the bases from which you come or realign them
we in congress spend quite a bit of time proclaiming that we are doing all we can to care for our troops
unfortunately we live in a different world today and we face challenges that we as a nation could nt even imagine in the late 1980s
this brac commission was asked to do a very difficult task in a very uncertain environment
the brac commission noted in its report to the president that the list of recommendations that were released by the department of defense on may 13 contained more proposed actions than all previous brac rounds combined
in its report to the president the brac commission was very critical of the department s methods
there was apparently no interaction between the pentagon and other federal agencies that share assets and installation space such as the department of veterans affairs and the united states coast guard agencies that could be now left in serious financial straits if the burden of maintaining these facilities falls completely on them
i am proud to say that i represent 2 flying units of the illinois air national guard in my district and i have seen firsthand the vital roles they play in our nation s defense
we ask our guard to make extraordinary sacrifices and become masters of a wide range of issues from fighting against terrorism in iraq and afghanistan to rescuing victims and providing relief to those who are impacted by natural disasters here at home
these guard units under the purview of the governors of the states are now being closed or enclaved without the consent of the governors and without title 10 of the united states code prohibits the closure or relocation of army and air national guard units without the consent of the governors of the states in which those units are located
many states have filed lawsuits in federal court demanding that the pentagon and the brac commission follow federal law
the speaker senator durbin and i brought this provision to the attention of the secretary of defense in a letter dated march 24
on july 14 the brac commission s own deputy general counsel issued an opinion that not only are the proposed air guard moves in violation of federal law they may be unconstitutional
a figure of 35 billion in savings over 20 years seems to be popular in the media
we are a nation at war the timing is wrong the savings are not there and guard units are being moved out of their states in violation of federal law
i thought there were going to be some other members that wanted to speak in favor of the resolution but until they arrive let me just talk for a minute or two about some of the costs
these costs do not disappear they simply shift from one base to another and those folks are still in the military and we still have to pay for them
and in the case of the air national guard end strength it remained mostly the same
and there is also a quote from the commission on page 330 of their report in fact the commission is concerned that there is a likelihood that the 2005 brac round could produce only marginal net savings over the 20year period mr chairman i reserve the balance of my time
mr chairman i yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from illinois mr evans xz4001260 who represents one of the largest military installations in our state
he has an air guard unit returning to ellington air force base to a slap in the face to essentially being told you have done great work thanks for what you did in iraq oh by the way we are closing your base
that was my point earlier on in my opening statement
i ask members to consider this to the people who are doing the hard work in iraq the people that did the hard work in afghanistan this is not the way to say to them job well done
it is not the way to say to them you did a great job in standing up for democracy in afghanistan and doing the hard work in iraq
is that the message we want to send to the people who do the hard work to the 130 000 140 000 people now serving in iraq the citizen soldiers that have left their jobs and their families and left their communities
this is our opportunity in the house to speak up and speak out
as i said earlier i have supported the president and this administration and the secretary of defense who is a friend of mine from illinois in everything they have wanted to do in afghanistan and iraq
mr chairman i rise today in support of h j res 65 a resolution of disapproval of the 2005 base closure and realignment recommendations
i am proud that my state delegation commonly referred to back home as team connecticut was successful in saving sub base new london from closure
the members of the 2005 brac commission were given an extraordinary responsibility and performed their duties in a thoughtful and responsible manner
since 2002 i have voted in the armed services committee and on the floor to either repeal or delay brac 2005 because i have felt all along that the process had serious flaws
with 150 000 of our men and women in uniform serving overseas in the middle east continued operations in iraq and afghanistan and failures to meet recruiting goals now is not the time to close or realign major portions of our military infrastructure
we should not be closing and consolidating bases and infrastructure here in the states now when in another two years we may be bringing a significant amount of troops and equipment back from europe and other forward deployed locations and we would have to spend more money again to reopen or recreate space for them
rather than conducting an inclusive process as in the case of the army national guard recommendations the pentagon chose to craft their air force proposal by shutting out the very people that both the law and common sense dictate need to be included in changes to state guard units
as a result the final air force recommendations disproportionately impact the air national guard with 37 of the final 42 air force recommendations making changes to air guard units in states across the nation
although the commission ultimately approved a scaled down version of the pentagon s air national guard plan crafted in the final days of their work the final brac report states that the lack of coordination between the pentagon governors and adjutants general unnecessarily cost the commission additional time and resources and damaged the previously exemplary relationship between the air national guard and the air force this misguided recommendation hits home in my district and state where the 103rd fighter wing at bradley air national guard base is slated to lose their a10 warthogs leaving connecticut as the only state in the nation without an air national guard flying mission
in presenting our case to the commission our message was simple the pentagon not only used flawed data that did not take into account many of the unique capabilities of bradley but failed to consult our governor in major changes to our state s militia
while adjutant general thaddeus martin the staff of the 103rd and the state delegation made a strong case for bradley the base was unfortunately included in the final realignment plan
in late august 2005 i joined connecticut governor rell attorney general blumenthal and senators dodd and lieberman in filing suit to prevent the realignment of the bradley air national guard base
we should not be closing and realigning our bases at a time when our nation is engaged in the middle east and faces unprecedented threats from abroad
rejecting brac 2005 is simply the right thing to do for our men and women in uniform the security of our nation and for the future of our air national guard
in one of the few times since 1995 when we arrived in the house together i am going to disagree with the gentleman from illinois and will vote against this resolution today
i understand why the gentleman from illinois has brought this resolution here today because i remember the shudder that can go through a community when 1 200 jobs are being discussed in some cases more some cases less
in cleveland s case they were jobs that pay an average of 54 000 a year
you are also talking about individuals who have made lives whether it be in cleveland indiana colorado missouri or other parts of the country
i had one grandmother who came up to me in lake county ohio after the decision was made to keep the facility open in cleveland and she said i want to thank you because it means my grandchildren will not be going to some faraway place
i can understand the shudder and as the gentleman from colorado said maybe we should reexamine how we engage in this
it was good to see the labor community and the business community in cleveland all come together because sometimes they have disagreements
anthony principi and the brac commissioners and the professional staff and hats off to marilyn wasleski in particular they took the time to look at the numbers and figure out that when the pentagon came up with its original proposal they had the numbers wrong
they considered the value of the 1 100 people that work in that building the celebrezze federal building in the city of cleveland and they said to those federal employees you have value you have worth
they recognized what they have accomplished in becoming centers of excellence and they were rewarded for that
the last thing i want to say we have some force protection issues antiterrorism protection for federal properties are coming up in 2009
i understand that when it comes to the men and women who are serving in the active military but the cleveland facility is made up primarily of accountants
and i want to protect our men and women in uniform but the folks in the cleveland building are accountants by and large
an integrated military force able to communicate and coordinate effectively in response to conflict remains crucial to national security and the war on terrorism
i am concerned by technical errors and the overall process used by the pentagon and the base realignment and closure brac commission to reach the recommendations before us this evening and it is my hope that in the future significant improvements will be made on the current model when realignment and closure decisions are made
for instance the pentagon and the brac commission rightly highlighted the key role that hanscom air force base located in my congressional district plays in our national security efforts
hanscom will clearly play a central role as we transform our military in the coming decades
in its decisions on hanscom the brac process recognized that the success or failure of a base in fulfilling its mission relies on the availability of skilled and experienced personnel and the connections that develop in intellectual clusters
when the brac commission held their new england regional hearing in boston on july 6 i submitted testimony to the commission arguing that the decision to realign the afrl at hanscom was inconsistent with other aspects of the pentagon s analysis of hanscom and could disrupt key programs operating there
the relocation of afrl s sensors and space vehicles directorates will result in significant costs with few gains
while i strongly protest this decision i am pleased that overall the commission s recommendations on hanscom reaffirmed the value of the regional human capital capabilities in science and technology and i am encouraged by the commission s indication that the air force will look to expand the mission at hanscom outside of the brac process
with respect to the overall brac process i am concerned by flaws in the current model that led to a number of errors
these questions resulted in lawsuits against the pentagon and the brac commission by a number of states including my home state of massachusetts
the pentagon must ensure that the department of homeland security and other relevant stakeholders are appropriately included in their process and that our nation s homeland security needs are fully evaluated
when the list came out 5 months ago all of maine s three facilities were in great jeopardy and few believed that we had a chance of saving any of them
but the entire delegation the governor and the communities came together and presented the best possible arguments in all three cases and as a result maine did better than anyone thought we could
we saved portsmouth naval shipyard and in a victory that would have been unthinkable only a few months before we actually grew dfas limestone bringing jobs to an area that desperately needs them
indeed if this resolution were to pass today and the brac process were to be reopened from scratch there would be no guarantee of saving brunswick but portsmouth could be closed and limestone with its planned increase in jobs could be lost
in my congressional district there are almost 23 000 people being displaced because of brac
the latest analysis tells us that it is actually going to save only 151 billion over 20 years about 700 million per year which incidentally is about as much as we spend in a day in iraq now
and in fact even this savings estimate is suspect because as the gentleman from illinois mr lahood xz4002280 has explained it is based upon personnel savings and all we are doing is moving the personnel around the country
in fact what is going to happen based upon the surveys we have taken of the personnel that are going to be displaced from northern virginia as many as 5075 percent of the employees are going to decide not to move to leave the government
in other words this is going to cause a brain drain and it is one that we can ill afford at the federal level
as many of you may know because it applies to most urban metropolitan areas with the cost of housing both spouses have to be in the workforce and it is very disruptive to tell families that one of the wageearners has to move hundreds of miles away
in this case the missile defense agency is a good example
now i like alabama i like the gentleman who represents that district but the reality is not all of them are going to move because they like our schools their children are in the school system their spouses have jobs here and most of them have security clearances which means they are going to be picked up by the private sector in a new york minute
is this in the national interest
i do not think it is in the national interest
we were supposed to take people that were in facilities that were overcrowded and move them to surplus facilities in other parts of the country
we are going to in fact have to spend billions of dollars on building new facilities and the fact that that money is going to have to come out of the military construction quality of life appropriations subcommittee where we need to be conserving money to pay for veterans health care for the thousands of veterans that are coming back from the iraq and afghanistan war defies common sense
i do not think this is in the national interest mr speaker
you can not do any of the things that you have to do in a metropolitan area like northern virginia or the washington metro area even though we have buildings that are right on the sidewalk that are just as important in florida and texas that were not touched
but in northern virginia they made the decision to implement these building standards as they apply to any dod agency no matter how unlikely a terrorist target that agency might be
in fact i question why we would have published the location of all of these defense agencies when terrorists did not know where they existed could not even figure out the acronyms for the agencies
but we have very different inconsistent building security standards one by the general services administration which has the authorizing responsibility for building federal buildings and another by dod which is not supposed to be building its own buildings but are requiring enormous restrictions that preclude a location in a metropolitan area anyplace in the country and that are going to cost such a premium to build they are going to make them prohibitive for any other activity to be in those buildings
it is going to cause a brain drain in terms of many of the agencies that we rely so much on for technological superiority and intelligence
that is what i would urge my colleagues in this body to do to vote for the resolution of disapproval that has been offered by the gentleman from illinois mr lahood xz4002280 so as to have the administration go back and tell us ways they can in fact save money ways they can in fact improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our military mission
mr chairman i rise in support of the bill before us to reject the brac recommendations and i thank the gentleman from illinois for his work on this bill
while this process has proceeded during a global war many of us in congress including me have taken issue with the timing
the brac list hit my south texas district hard with the closure of naval station ingleside in san patricio county
it was a base into which the taxpayers of nueces county and the state of texas plowed 50 million to assist the navy in bringing the base there
the main thing that worries those of us in south texas and elsewhere along the gulf coast is that after brac the gulf of mexico will be a less safe place for all of us
for these reasons and many more we must have a navy presence in the gulf
after brac there will not be a single surface navy base in the entire gulf
the gulf holds the nation s bread basket and is the primary provider of petrochemicals and refined products to power the nation s cars heaters and other machines we depend upon hourly in our daily lives
now the other concerns i have deal primarily with how the south texas community i represent will recover from the economic devastation that is part of a base closure in local communities
as brac chairman principi said in an early statement this will be a tsunami in south texas
we are increasingly concerned about the enormous task before us in the coming years how to deal with depressed property values after the base is to close
and how our schools and housing market can recoup the losses we will most certainly feel in the coming years
that will be the challenge before us in south texas for probably the coming decade if the house today fails to adopt my colleague s bill to disapprove the brac recommendations
mr chairman i stand in support of house joint resolution 65 disapproving the recommendations of the base realignment and closure commission
i support the brac process as a whole as a reasonable and apolitical method for evaluating our nation s defense infrastructure needs and recognize the necessity of this first brac round in a decade
but while i salute the hard work of the brac commission members in their deliberations and recognize the difficulty of their task this brac round took place in the context of flawed methodology as regarded air national guard bases
it was my expectation that the department of defense would solicit input from all relevant sources in evaluating our air national guard requirements most importantly the adjutant general of each state
but at no time in the pentagon s development of its air force brac recommendations did it ask the adjutant general of ohio or any of the other 53 adjutants general for input
members of the airlift wing have served more than 195 000 days just since 911 in support of homeland defense and the global war on terror
relief missions such as this are nothing new for the men and women of the 179th who have answered the call during past hurricane relief missions in florida and other states and have assisted with vital defense operations in iraq saudi arabia afghanistan kosovo and elsewhere
i was disappointed therefore at the inclusion of the 179th on the pentagon s proposed closure list in may
as i said in a letter to president bush last month in support of the 179th the unit has always stood ready to accept any flying assignment and represents a wealth of expertise and professionalism that ohio and the nation can ill afford to lose
contrary to national trends the 179th has consistently excelled in recruiting and retention currently standing at 105 percent of assigned strength
in just the last few years all mansfield aircrew members have flown combat sorties in the middle east and asia and have received 116 air medals for their bravery courage and skill
in its final deliberations the brac commission found that closing mansfield was not supportable and recommended instead that a contiguous enclave be established at mansfield lahm
had there been consultation better decisions could have been made about air guard infrastructure in view of our national defense and homeland security needs
in short the air force would have done well to follow the army s brac model which stood as an example of good consultation among parties
when the joint systems manufacturing center located in lima in my congressional district was placed on the brac list with a recommendation to reduce manufacturing space by 27 percent top army officials working on the brac staff made themselves available to meet with representatives of jsmc and the community
the jsmc delegation explained that such a reduction would impede operations at the plant resulting in a higher cost to the government for the weapons systems the plant produces
in just the last 8 years more than 20 million has been invested in the 179th s facilities at mansfield lahm
mr chairman let me say initially i do not believe in the brac
i have opposed every brac initially from the very beginning and i have been here in congress 18 years
the reason i do not believe in brac was somewhat articulated by the previous speaker
i also want to say in this particular round in 2005 i strongly disapproved of the brac even more so than in the past because we are in a war in iraq
you do not shut down in my opinion military infrastructure at a time of war
i think this brac in particular is poorly timed and ill advised
now the 2005 round of brac also was done hastily in my opinion with very little regard to the actual warfighter
a number of bases with great functional value are being shut down in the name of savings
in the case of fort monmouth which is the installation near my district a lot of the people employed there live in my district
we successfully proved myself the two senators and several other congressmen including the gentleman from new jersey mr holt xz4001840 we successfully proved to the brac commission in my opinion that the army substantially deviated from six of the eight brac criteria
but even so even though the brac was supposedly an independent commission tasked with ensuring that the dod s recommendations would not hurt the warfighter even though they admitted there was a serious concern about the warfighter and how in the days of fort monmouth the communications and electronics functions crucial to iraq might be seriously hampered they still decided to include it on the list
mr chairman i appreciate the opportunity to discuss this important legislation as i make a final push to keep forts gillem and mcpherson open by voting in support of a joint house resolution to reject the president s approval of the 2005 round of base realignments and closures
gillem and fort mcpherson and i have tried to make a strong case in their defense at every opportunity available to me including directly addressing members of the brac commission and urging president bush to consider their unmatched military value and unique strategic readiness for homeland defense
mcpherson remained on the brac list for closure despite the vital role they continue to play in coordinating the deployment of troops abroad and federal response to national disasters like this year s string of devastating hurricanes
mr chairman i have long supported the base closure process as a way to eliminate excess infrastructure in the department of defense
even though i support the brac i would like to take this opportunity to comment on the process that was used in this round of brac
in the last three brac rounds the defense department demonstrated that it could successfully close bases and reduce infrastructure through a measured and deliberative process
in this round however neither the department of defense nor the brac commission in my opinion has lived up to the high standards that we set for them
mr chairman i might point out to the gentleman that we in congress did pass the basic brac law which we are following today
first let me thank the brac commission head anthony principi and all of the panel members for their hard work for listening to all of us both at the regional hearings and in person and with the staff and the department of defense who worked with so many of us in these very difficult decisions
i rise in opposition to my colleague from illinois s resolution but i share some of his concerns
in the state of indiana the previous round of brac i was legislative director for the junior senator from indiana when we watched all of our active military bases get wiped out in the state of indiana one of the number one recruiting states in the united states
my hometown in fort wayne indiana is one of the major centers of defense electronics in the united states with itt aerospace with raytheon defense electronics based there making many highly classified electronics defense systems with general dynamics with a huge facility there with bae systems with a huge facility there with ussi with a huge facility there with northrop grumman with a large and expanding facility there
we have defense electronics and a very patriotic one of the highest if not the highest congressional districts in america in military recruiting for army navy air force and all of the various guard and reserve groups
we have an air guard base there in fort wayne indiana that is gaining under this process
it was a very difficult process as to how we deal with the guard and particularly the air guard and it was a very stiff competition with the gentleman from illinois air base and the air base in terre haute and we can argue the relative merits
they have won national outstanding unit award three times by the air force and recipient of the national guard number one air guard unit in the united states
but i also heard from the people in the capital region air guard unit and the people in the terre haute guard unit
in fact they were all high in recruitment and they were all high in national awards
the f16s are aging and declining in quality and disappearing from our defense system and the air force plans are to reduce the number of fighter planes by twothirds
where does it leave us in homeland security
the gentleman from illinois mr lahood xz4002280 raised a very difficult and interesting question that worked through the courts in this process that it is pretty clear that the department of defense can not close an air guard base but they can move the airplanes
so we had one court ruling in pennsylvania that said they could not close the base but we have other rulings that said they could move the airplanes
i believe there will be other types of defense systems in homeland security that hopefully will be located in terre haute and will be located in springfield illinois very important cities to homeland security and our national defense
i believe the brac commission made the right decisions but this does not necessarily give us much guidance as to where we are headed and how we are going to integrate and maintain the defense structure we have in the united states with our air guard army guard and all of our reserve units around the country if we do not have an adequate base structure if we do not have adequate training places and ways to do this
i hope we can find in addition to the fighter planes that are located in fort wayne and the expansion of our base for which i am very thankful ways to work with springfield illinois with terre haute indiana and other bases around the united states because we need all of those pilots
i hope this brac commission report while i strongly support it will also be a launching point as to how we are going to work and build and keep this very diverse armed forces system in the united states
we followed that up with a very simple question in the three previous rounds of brac can you name one weapons system that you have bought with those savings
what people miss in all of this is that when a base is closed the local communities then come to congress as they should and say look you have just put all my folks out of work
and in every instance congress has given that property back to the locals so there is no savings of selling off the property
in my frantic calls to them in the aftermath of the storm begging for their help their first response was where can i put my people
every time you lose a base you lose a place to put those people in the event weather whether it is a tsunami in the pacific a hurricane in mississippi a flood or earthquake on the west coast a flood in the midwest you lose a capability to help the american people
goodness gracious we have 140 000 americans fighting and dying in iraq
we have another 20 000plus in afghanistan
the truth of the matter is in my time in congress we have had a war in panama that no one saw coming we have had two wars in iraq that we really did not see coming we had a war in bosnia that no one saw coming
right now our nation is buying 30 000 acres in north carolina and some people in north carolina think it is a great idea and some people think it is a terrible idea
we are spending a heck of a lot of your money buying land in north carolina so we can build a base to land f18s the newest version of the f18 when they come off the carriers
all of these things cost money and we are going to build all these things in north carolina at great expense to the public
we had all those things that we are getting ready to buy and build in north carolina in jacksonville florida
so please proponents of this tell me how we are saving the taxpayers money how we are making the nation more secure and above all if the service secretaries can not name a single base that they think is worthy of closing why are we going to close so many bases in one fell swoop
i will be voting today in favor of h j res 65 because i believe the brac commission s recommendations should be overturned
however i believe that now is not the time to implement a brac round considering the number of operations our armed services are currently engaged in around the world
i am also concerned about the commission s recommendation to place cannon air force base in enclave status
this decision places cannon in enclave status until 2009 or until a new mission can be identified for the base
this is a rarity in today s air force as more bases experience increasing encroachment
this unparalleled airspace is in the process of being expanded making the base even more valuable
i strongly believe we will be able to identify appropriate missions for cannon air force base to minimize the amount of time during which the base will remain in enclave status
nevertheless cannon is too important to our national defense for it to be placed in enclave status
mr chairman i rise today in strong support of the resolution and join the growing chorus of the members of congress who are coming down to the floor today disappointed in the recommendations of the base realignment closure commission
i can not understand why in a time that we are fighting a global war on terror a war where we are actively engaged on two fronts and obligated to also increase domestic defense against terrorism here at home the department of defense has suggested in fact recommended that we close bases across the nation
more troubling is the fact that the department of defense has moved ahead in this brac round by applying a cold war model to a postcold war security environment
the willow grove joint reserve base directly borders my district in pennsylvania
it serves as a fema alternative site providing a staging ground so federal resources can be distributed in the event of a natural disaster or a terrorist attack
and the base realignment recommendations fall short because they call for the closure of naval air station joint reserve base willow grove a military installation that plays a vital role in our nation s security
americans are frustrated by the majority s corrupt habits of ramming through legislation in the middle of the night without an opportunity to read or amend proposed legislation
mr speaker i am planning to speak in opposition to the bill but i thought that i heard the gentleman say a minute ago that he planned to oppose it
i rise in opposition to the bill
we passed a bipartisan campaign finance reform act 3 or 4 years ago to close huge loopholes in campaign spending including the soft money loophole
according to some surveys 37 percent of the adult population and 61 percent of americans use the internet to determine how they would vote in an election
in the absence of this compromise we have to depend on the fec for regulation
because if we do not and if this bill passes we will in effect have an exemption to bcra that will allow for unlimited advertising and advocacy over the internet
mr speaker today i rise in support of hr 1606 legislation that will exempt blogs email and other online speech from campaign finance laws
when congress passed campaign finance reform in 2002 the legislation did not identify political speech over the internet as a target of the new regulations
but in april a federal judge sided with campaign finance reform zealots and ruled the fec can not completely exempt online speech from the requirements of the campaign finance reform law
thomas jefferson was right when he said the basis of our government being the opinion of the people the very first object should be to keep that right mr speaker this legislation will protect in its infancy what could be a powerful medium or media for the opinion of the people to be heard
the way our nation communicates today is almost unrecognizable for those of us that were in washington dc during the 1970s
we have seen the innovation and democratization of the internet in just the last decade
the internet through such safe havens of individual expression and opinion like blogs has put the power in the hands of the people where it truly belongs precisely where thomas jefferson wanted it
mr speaker i rise today in strong opposition to hr 1606 the online freedom of information act
this controversial bill purports to protect the freedom of speech of internet bloggers but instead creates a major internet loophole for soft money in our federal campaign finance laws
the internet has increasingly and rightly been used as a powerful political tool in recent elections but it is negligent that we would permit it to be a safe haven from our campaign finance laws
and these contributions would never be disclosed in campaign finance records
mr speaker the constitution is clear congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech unfortunately the us supreme court ruled to the contrary that in this instance in political speech congress may abridge the freedom of speech and it may do so under the guise of preventing corruption or the appearance thereof in campaign activities
heaven help the average american if they fall under a regulation similar to what any candidate must now undergo for federal office because that would basically mean that you would have to check with your accountant and check with your attorney before you engage in the internet communication that might at all be perhaps close to whatever the line would be
in other words it would have a chilling impact on people s exercise of what we believe should be their free speech rights
unfortunately the big government campaign reformers found that intolerable filed suit in federal court and were vindicated with the judge ruling that indeed the law required the fec to regulate
in the absence of our passing this kind of legislation the internet will be regulated
now is the time to draw a clean clear bright line and say if you are engaging in speech over the internet you do not have to check with your lawyer or your accountant
you are a free american and you have the opportunity to engage in free speech over the internet
apparently people here believe that james madison thought that there should be free debate except in the congress of the united states
this must have sprung like minerva from the forehead of zeus in perfect form and here it is
and of course the assumption is that people who agree that we should not be restricting the free use of the internet will be so intimidated by the fear that if they voted no they will be criticized that they will fall in line
i think the american public is smart enough to know that the end does not always justify the means and that the irony of purporting to defend free speech by shutting it down in the congress of the united states is too bizarre
they will spend way more than 40 minutes twisting each other s arms in private rather than allow us to have the debate time
they are going to destroy the village in order to save it
i would be glad to yield to any advocate of free speech who can tell me why it has become inapplicable in this bill
apparently all we get in defense of this is free silence
i highly esteem my colleague from california with whom i disagree in this case
but the notion that her imprimatur is in itself a substantive defense of failing to follow the regular procedure does not meet the argument
i will not support the diminution the continued reduction of democracy in the house
and i think yes there could be a lot of free speech but not by shutting it down in the house
i rise in strong support of hr 1606 the online freedom of speech act
without this legislation i fear that the cold callous and clumsy hand of federal regulation may stifle political speech in cyberspace
the newest battlefield in the fight to protect the first amendment is the internet
in fact if one has access to the internet at home or a public library it can be free absolutely free
it is one of the most democratic forms of speech that we know today and it is an outstanding opportunity for all individuals across our nation to participate in our democratic process and impact public policy
today thousands and thousands of americans run blogs that are focused on politics and millions of viewers visit their favorite bloggers web sites for commentary often not found in the mainstream media
that would only leave the wealthier participants in this blogosphere and undermine public access to information and the chance for smaller groups to participate in our democracy in this fashion
yet the fec itself could not see the threat of corruption that is present in a medium that allows almost limitless inexpensive communication across the broadest crosssection of the american population let those who cry corruption cite examples and carry the burden in this debate to abridge the first amendment rights of our citizens
in 2002 before i came to this body congress passed a sweeping new campaign finance law and in a rare moment of restraint nowhere in the new law did congress impose restrictions on the internet
indeed it is mentioned in other parts of the legislation
despite congressional silence on this matter in 2004 a federal court instructed the fec to regulate internet communications and that process is under way
in the other body the distinguished senate minority leader has partnered with my friend senator coburn to defend american freedom of speech online by introducing this identical language in the other body
over 200 years ago in this house of representatives james madison stated the people shall not be deprived or abridged of their right to speak to write or to publish their sentiments today congress finds itself debating the very same rights under far more modern realities
this bill opens a huge loophole in the campaign finance laws
the gentleman from massachusetts mr meehan xz4002690 and others have been bulldogs in moving us toward a more perfect democratic union by keeping government of and by the people not of and by some of the people and by special interests and this act would not add protections of freedom of speech on the blogosphere as it is purported to do
rather it would bring large amounts of money back into deciding who can buy the largest microphone in a federal campaign
these individuals find themselves in jeopardy because an activist court decided to radically expand the meaning of a law beyond what congress intended
the court decided that the fec the agency in charge of regulating our election laws was in error when it decided it did not have the authority to require the regulation of free speech on the internet
as a result of this ruling all computer users and bloggers now stand to see their first amendment rights thrown out in the name of freedom
what is disturbing and dangerous to me and to the constituents i represent in this house is the ease with which so many advocate government regulation of speech
mr speaker bloggers do nt have to spend millions of dollars on printing presses nor do they have to invest in tv or radio broadcast towers
they are our neighbors friends and coworkers who want to be able to share their ideas without asking permission from a gatekeeper in the mainstream media and certainly not from a government official
and i never have felt so powerful in the minority as i do today
i do believe that in coming from silicon valley especially so that the ability to use the new technology to promote the viewpoint of individuals is essential to the growth of democracy
we have seen everincreasing numbers of people participate in elections
it would not reduce in any way the prohibitions found in 441 b any more than a corporation could use its funds to buy lawn signs or political signs they could not pay for ads either
and so i do think that it is worth noting that for the record i would just like to say that in this case the bloggers have got it right
mr speaker i rise today in opposition to house bill 1606
this legislation under the guise of protecting bloggers actually undercuts the progress made by the bipartisan campaign reform act and reopens the floodgates of corrupting soft money in federal elections
i also rise in opposition to this legislation being considered on the suspension calendar when it is so clearly a controversial matter on which there has never been a committee markup for members to offer amendments and under the rules we can not offer amendments here today
that is why the new york times editorialized yesterday in opposition to hr 1606 and they argued that the bill uses freedom of speech as a fig leaf
this congress could pass that bill in the middle of the night and then members of congress who passed the bill could actually ask those same pharmaceutical interests to write sixfigure checks for campaign ads for them to appear on the internet
the judge in that case colleen kollarkottelly wrote that the provisions would permit rampant circumvention of the campaign finance laws and foster corruption she went on to say that the provision would severely undermine the campaign finance law
just days ago a cnn poll found that the american people believe that corruption in government is the second most important issue facing this nation after the economy
we are considering today a bill that flies in the face of public concerns about corruption and is likely to create new corruption and new scandals
for example the national party softmoney loophole started as a minor blip in the 1980s and exploded into a half a billiondollar binge by the 2000 cycle
that is why the washington post editorialized this week that this would be carving a huge cyberloophole in the soft money ban
this bill is to protect political bagmen not bloggers in protecting bloggers we need to approach this the right way and this bill is the wrong way
under this legislation communications over the internet by individuals on their own web sites would be treated the same as they are in hr 1606
it is not a place to create new loopholes in the campaign finance laws
in fact i sponsored legislation that would exempt bloggers from fec legislation
mr speaker i yield 1 minute to the gentleman from delaware mr castle xz4000700 who has been a courageous hero in the fight for campaign finance reform
mr speaker in this time when a cloud of scandal hangs over washington when the chief of staff to the vice president of the united states has been indicted for perjury making false statements when a top white house official is led away in handcuffs indicted on charges of making false statements related to an investigation of his dealing with lobbyists at a time when a top republican lobbyist and fundraiser has been indicted for fraud when that investigation is the subject of a department of justice investigation and today over in the other body there is a hearing going on looking into possible other misdealings at a time when the american people have indicated that they are fed up with scandals how can this house support a bill that would open up new avenues for corruption to enter the political process
mr speaker the advent of the internet age has brought about a host of new ways for citizens to participate in the political arena
when congress passed the bipartisan campaign finance reform act in 2002 the law apparently was unclear on what impact it would have on political speech on the internet
the bill s sponsors disagreed and they sued the fec in the courts
in testimony before the fec and before the committee on house administration both liberal and conservative bloggers expressed their support for this exemption
senate minority leader reid has introduced a companion bill in the us senate and written to the fec to express his belief that the internet should not be regulated
in addition the internet is not an invasive medium
in other words the recipients of communication are exposed to the communication only after they take deliberate and affirmative steps to find a particular web site
further the internet has generated a surge in grassroots involvement in the political process
there is however ample evidence that the internet has had a positive effect on our political system by encouraging young people a whole new generation of people to get involved in our political process
in fact mr speaker these complex regulations if enacted would actually increase the influence of big money and politics because then only the wealthy could afford to hire election attorneys to be certain that they were abiding by these very complicated regulations
unfortunately hr 1606 goes far beyond exempting bloggers and allows federal candidates and political parties to again make use of soft money in federal campaigns
if this law were to pass a member of congress could simply go to a large donor corporation or union and control their spending of 1 million in soft money to pay for political advertising all over the internet
this is precisely the type of behavior prevented when congress passed the bipartisan campaign reform act in 2002
by all accounts the law is working despite concerns about the law being the death knell of the parties the parties were strengthened as they raised more in hard money in 2004 than they raised in hard and soft money combined in 2002 and greatly expanded their donor base
mandatory minimums have been studied extensively and have been proven to be ineffective in preventing crime
with more than 21 million americans currently in jail or prison roughly quadruple the number individuals incarcerated in 1985 it s hard to see how anyone can continue with such a deeply flawed strategy
thanks to mandatory minimum sentences almost 10 percent of all inmates in state and federal prisons are serving life sentences an increase of 83 percent from 1992
in two states alone new york and california almost 20 percent of inmates are serving life sentences
in the end the few grants that this bill purports to offer in the area of witness protection and court security ca nt make up for its two fatal flaws
on friday we will not be in session as members know so that there will be an opportunity for all of us to participate in veterans day ceremonies that take place in our districts
mr speaker if the gentleman will yield i will tell my colleagues that the state i represent is nearly 3 000 miles away and we are having a very important election in our state
i did that just this week and sent my ballot in
so let me say that we do want every member to participate in those elections but i suspect that in light of the fact that we will have so much work to do here that members should plan to be in washington during the day on tuesday
mr speaker if the gentleman will yield as i said in my remarks earlier today the chairman of the appropriations committee the gentleman from california mr lewis xz4002401 has done an absolutely phenomenonal job in moving these measures through
all three of those bills that i mentioned the energy and water conference report and the science state justice and commerce conference report and military quality of life they are all in conference as we speak
it is our hope that those conferences will be completed and those conference reports will be filed in the house
mr speaker if the gentleman will yield as i think the gentleman heard in my announcement i announced that it is our anticipation we anticipate that we will consider what we call the deficit reduction act of 2005 and it is a measure which we will be working on next week
late next week or the middle to the latter part of next week we anticipate a vote here in the house on that very important measure that is designed to try and reduce the deficit and reform government and ensure that we can do the very important work that the american people sent us here to do
they are working with the department of the treasury and members in the leadership of the banking committee on the other side of the aisle and we do hope very much that we will be able to put together a legislative package that can be considered before that very important december 31 date to which my friend referred
mr speaker i rise in support of the motion to instruct conferees on the patriot and terrorism prevention reauthorization bill
this motion to instruct would take the most contentious provisions of this bill and sunset them in 4 years
egregious law that robs the civil liberties of law abiding americans should be reviewed sooner than later therefore i strongly support these sunset provisions proposed in this motion to instruct
my constituents agree that the american people should not have to compromise their civil liberties in order to combat extremism
voices in the congress echo voices of people across america
my amendment adds language to the witness protection grants provided in this bill to allow their use by youths who are trying to leave a criminal gang or to prevent initial gang recruitment
in san diego police department records count no fewer than 3 750 gang members on the street
during the first six months of this year gang violence resulted in eight homicides in san diego nearly a third of the total of 23
for example mara salvatrucha also known as ms13 has grown from a gang that once numbered a few thousand and was involved in street violence and turf battles in southern california into a gang that operates in at least 33 states with an international membership in the hundreds of thousands
three thousand jurisdictions across the us are estimated to have had gang activity in 2001
in 2002 32 of cities with a population of 25 to 50 thousand reported a gangrelated homicide
furthermore it is estimated that there are 840 000 active gang members in the us operating in every state of the union
these gangs are effective because they bind their members to loyalty and create fear throughout the community in which they operate
this fear most noticeable in children prevents residents from cooperating with law enforcement officials and testifying against gang members
my amendment while not a panacea for the gang problem is a step in the right direction
it is i think a very clear statement to make that we have faced extensive violence in our courts in recent times
recent events including the killing of a fulton county judge and other court personnel in atlanta the murders of united states district judge joan lefkow s family members outside chicago illinois and the murders immediately outside the tyler texas courthouse have underscored the increasing significance of the problem
according to the administrative office of united states courts there are almost 700 threats a year made against federal judges and in numerous cases federal judges have had security details assigned to them for fear of attack by members of violent gangs drug organizations and disgruntled litigants
with such tragic incidents mr chairman we are in collaboration if you will on hr 1751 at least the premise the secure access to justice and court protection act of 2005
in fact i am very gratified to have secured an amendment that will allow state courts to establish a threat assessment database similar to that of the us marshals where they will be able to determine the threat status or situation against a respective court and then of course to hopefully have an amendment that would pass that would provide grants to the highest state courts to be able to disseminate those moneys to create that database and that threat assessment database
in addition i would say that this hard work and commitment of democratic members on the committee have also now provided for offers of grants to state courts so they can make meaningful enhancements to courtroom safety and security
mandatory minimum penalties have been studied extensively and the vast majority of available research clearly indicates that they do not in many instances work
among many other things they have been shown to distort the sentencing process to discriminate against minorities in their application and to waste valuable taxpayer money
but the real emphasis is although we are here today to protect our court systems and our court officials and our law enforcement officials we are also here to recognize the discretion necessary for our courts and in many instances the judicial conference itself has indicated its desire to have more discretion in sentencing
if heinous acts against our federal courts have been perpetrated then that judge hearing that particular case would then have the discretion to yield or to render along with a jury and a jury trial the highest sentence but the mandatory minimum would not be there in place of a judge s discretion
as i was saying the federal sentencing system the judicial conference has said and the mandatory sentencing undermine the sentencing guideline regimen established by congress to promote fairness and proportionality and destroy honesty in sentencing by encouraging charge and fact plea bargains
in fact in a recent letter to members of the crime subcommittee regarding hr 1279 the gang deterrence and community protection act of 2005 the conference noted that mandatory minimum sentences create the opposite of their intended effect
far from fostering certainty in punishment mandatory minimums result in unwarranted sentencing disparity and mandatory minimums treat dissimilar offenders in a similar manner although those offenders can be quite different with respect to the seriousness of their conduct or their danger to society
i might add that i hope that we will have further discussion about lawyers who are engaged in the practice of law in cases where they come under particular threats whether it is in particular the prosecutor who is covered by this or defense lawyers and other lawyers who engage in cases which generate threats against their lives
section 2 establishes a 1year mandatory minimum with 10year maximum criminal penalty for assaulting the immediate family member of a law enforcement officer or judge if the assault results in bodily injury
however just a few lines later in the same section an identical criminal penalty is established for a simple threat
in creating a new deathpenaltyeligible offense for anyone convicted of killing a federally funded public safety officer there is no disagreement in the value of our public safety officer
it is just whether or not in addition to such an offense of death penalty whether or not a substitute of life imprisonment without parole could have equally been used
expansion of the use of the federal death penalty in the current environment seems to warrant consideration
the public is clearly rethinking the appropriateness of the death penalty in general due to the evidence that it is ineffective in deterring crime and is racially discriminatory and is more often than not found to be erroneously applied
i know that for a fact in a recent case we had in texas frances newton a young woman accused of killing her children and her husband a horrific and heinous crime certainly one would suggest that she warrants the ultimate penalty
however unfortunately in petitioning to get a new trial on the basis of real definitive new evidence the courts would not consider such and of course frances newton has gone to her death
i believe that she has gone to her death with raising the question of whether or not she was in fact innocent or guilty
in a 23year comprehensive study of death penalties 68 percent were found to be erroneously applied
among other things they have been shown to distort the sentencing process to discriminate against minorities in their application and to waste valuable taxpayer money
undermine the sentencing guideline regimen established by congress to promote fairness and proportionality and destroy honesty in sentencing by encouraging charge and fact plea bargains in fact in a recent letter to members of the crime subcommittee regarding hr 1279 the gang deterrence and community protection act of 2005 the conference noted that mandatory minimum sentences create the opposite of their intended effect far from fostering certainty in punishment mandatory minimums result in unwarranted sentencing disparity
mandatory minimums treat dissimilar offenders in a similar manner although those offenders can be quite different with respect to the seriousness of their conduct or their danger to society
section 2 establishes a one year mandatory minimum with a 10 year maximum criminal penalty for assaulting the immediate family member of a law enforcement officer or judge if the assault results in bodily injury
however just a few lines later in the same section an identical criminal penalty is established for a simple threat
expansion of the use of the federal death penalty in the current environment is patently unwarranted
the public is clearly rethinking the appropriateness of the death penalty in general due to the evidence that it is ineffective in deterring crime is racially discriminatory and is more often than not found to be erroneously applied
in a 23year comprehensive study of death penalties 68 percent were found to be erroneously applied
for example connecticut has not executed anyone in 45 years
last year a university of michigan study identified 199 murder exonerations since 1989 73 of them in capital cases
i will conclude by saying that we have a long way to go in the criminal justice system and i hope that we will also bring to the floor of the house this whole issue of early release for those who are languishing in prisons
i hope the good time early release bill for nonviolent prisoners in our federal prisons who are over 40 years old will have an opportunity for full debate because they all go handinhand
but his local officials in working with the gentleman has brought this to the nation s attention
i have supported amendments such as this which include language in legislation that i have which deals with rewarding informants in order to get them to tell the facts that would allow for busting drug cartels and others who are perpetrating violence
this provides our courts handson immediate information in order to determine the threats that are waged against these particular courts
this simple amendment rather than include the attorney in essence the change of this amendment would require the attorney general to work through the office of justice programs to make grants to the highest state courts in states participating in the threat assessment database program
let me conclude by simply saying again i remind colleagues i hope that some day we will be able to discuss the good time early relief bill that speaks to the question of individuals languishing in federal prisons who have been nonviolent and would welcome this discussion and this legislation
in essence the change would require the attorney general to work through the office of justice programs to make grants to the highest state courts in states participating in the threat assessment database program
in addition the department of justice has interpreted language giving grants to states as going directly to state executives governors and they have sometimes bypassed the state courts
the state court administrating agencies led by the state supreme courts are in a better position to know about the kind of threats and attacks they experience in a given year
the state court administrating agencies are in a better position to know how to respond to attacks and develop procedures to counter threats to the state courts
i respectfully request that my amendment be made in order
my amendment specifically addresses the problem of violence in and around federal courthouses
the amendment authorizes any federal judge magistrate united states attorney or any other officer of the department of justice who represents the us in a court of law to carry firearms
the need for my amendment was made clear by the recent tragedies involving and we have heard the chairman speak to these issues the brutal murder of family members of us district judge joan lefkow the slaying of judge rowland barnes his court reporter deputy sheriff and a federal officer in atlanta the coldblooded shootings outside the tyler texas courthouse among others
my amendment extends protection from the courthouse to the homes in the areas where the judges and prosecutors live
yes mr chairman it applies only to federal officials who will represent the united states of america in a court of law the voice of the federal government in a court of law
i am working with a piece of language i believe in and i have not looked a federal official in the eye that specifically asked me
mr chairman i rise in support of hr 1751 and in support of the dedicated public servants working in our criminal justice system
the very nature of their work brings them in contact with dangerous criminals on a daily basis
after conviction some of these criminals seek revenge against the prosecutors and judges who put them in prison
as unfortunate as it is we must do more to protect those in the justice system who work to protect all of us
as it turns out hale was not behind the murders but another disgruntled individual with a history in front of judge lefkow was
bart ross a plaintiff in a medical malpractice case judge lefkow dismissed wrote a letter to a chicago television station admitting he killed michael lefkow and donna humphrey and that his target had been the judge
included in the note was a hit list of others he felt had wronged him many of whom were involved in his medical malpractice case
even though matthew hale and his white supremacist group were not responsible for the letkow murders they were vocal in their praise for the killings on the internet
the fact remains that judges prosecutors and their families are often targeted and they can be in danger wherever they go even in their own homes
mr speaker next tuesday is election day in many states and localities around the country
given that we are scheduled to be in session and voting how do you think votes might be structured that day in order to accommodate members who have elections in their states
mr chairman on which day next week might we consider the budget reconciliation bill that calls for more than 50 billion in mandatory spending cuts
this is an important issue that has had broad bipartisan support in the past and action is needed because it is scheduled to expire on december 31
the house was not in order when the gentleman was speaking
mr chairman the entire country witnessed what happened in my district in the fulton county courthouse on the morning of march 11 2005
on that day brian nichols was to appear in a retrial for charges of rape and false imprisonment
as he was escorted from his holding cell to change into civilian clothes for the proceeding he overpowered the female sheriff s deputy overseeing his transfer stole her gun and shot her in the face
mr nichols then proceeded to run through the courthouse complex unimpeded steal another firearm and shoot 3 more people including longtime superior court judge rowland barnes a revered judicial figure in the atlanta area
mr nichols managed to escape the courthouse and evade police for more than two days during which time he used the fire arms that he stole in the courthouse injuring several more people stole multiple vehicles and held one woman hostage before he was finally apprehended
in the aftermath of the security failures at the fulton county courthouse the entire atlanta metropolitan area an area of more than 4 million people was on edge
schools were put on lock down in several counties
if we had proper security measures in place on that fateful friday morning we could have avoided the hysteria and disruptions of normal life that followed
mr chairman i rise in opposition to hr 1751
with several sensational incidents in recent years involving the murders of judges family members of judges court personnel witnesses and other victims we have seen the consequences of insufficient security for our court operations and personnel associated with the courts
mr chairman i want to acknowledge and thank chairman sensenbrenner for making significant improvements in this bill since our initial consideration of the bill in subcommittee by removing a number of the superfluous mandatory minimum sentences and death penalties from the bill
the notion that congress has to direct judges on how to sentence those who harm or threaten judges and their families and others associated with court activities or that congress has to replace the states in prosecution of murders of state judges and other state officials is absurd
accordingly i have prepared an amendment which would remove the provisions allowing the federal government simply on the basis of someone s salary being paid in part by federal funds to take over traditional state prosecutions of state murder cases
i have also prepared an amendment which would remove the mandatory minimum sentencing in federal cases involving judges their family members or other court personnel and replaced them with higher maximums that would allow even greater sentences than the bill allows in cases which warrant it but would not require sentences which violate common sense
in fact mr chairman the federal courts have consistently and loudly expressed their strong opposition to mandatory minimum sentences
through rigorous study and analysis as well as through their everyday experiences in sentencing major players and bit players in crime the courts have determined mandatory minimums to be less effective than regular sentencing
they have found them to be racially discriminatory in their application
the judicial conference has written us often to express their opposition to mandatory minimum sentencing and has just written us again with this bill to state their opposition to mandatory minimum sentences as a violation of the systemic sentencing scheme designed to reduce unwarranted disparity and to provide proportionality and fairness in punishment that idea is violated with mandatory minimums
the judicial conference and everyone concerned supports the grant programs in the bill aimed at strengthening court security and personnel and providing security for persons associated with the courts
i am writing to convey its views regarding several of the provisions contained in hr 1751 the secure access to justice and court protection act of 2005 much of the impetus for portions of this bill arose from the tragic circumstances surrounding the attempted murder of judge joan lefkow of the united states district court for the northern district of illinois
section 14 of the bill is positive in that it will help protect judges from the malicious recording of fictitious liens and is supported by the judicial conference
the judicial conference opposes mandatory minimum sentencing provisions because they undermine the sentencing guideline regime congress established under the sentencing reform act of 1984 by preventing the systematic development of guidelines that reduce unwarranted disparity and provide proportionality and fairness in punishment
the judicial conference believes that the circuit councils of each circuit should retain the authority to establish rules for the photographing recording or broadcasting of appellate arguments in their courts
i appreciate having the opportunity to express the views of the judicial conference in relation to hr 1751 the secure access to justice and court protection act of 2005 if you have any questions regarding this legislation please contact arthur white at 202 5021700
dear representative scott we understand that during consideration by the house of representatives of hr 1751 the safe access to justice and court protection act of 2005 an amendment will be offered by representative jeff flake raz to propose a range of changes in the law governing federal habeas corpus review of capital cases
this amendment proposes a number of technical changes in a complicated area of law without the benefit of hearings or any previous consideration by the house judiciary committee
it is inconsistent with other pending house and senate legislation and its enactment would create more confusion and chaos in a complex area of law
we are particularly concerned about a provision in the amendment that would completely remove federal court jurisdiction for all sentencing phase claims not just those found harmless by the state courts
under this proposal unless the claim goes to the validity of the conviction itself it is not cognizable in the federal courts
if such a profound change in law were enacted there would no longer be a federal forum for claims of ineffective assistance of counsel at the sentencing phase
in short no matter how unreasonable the state court decision sincerely robert d evans
this legislation would create a 30year mandatory minimum sentence for seconddegree murder in federal criminal cases add numerous other discriminatory mandatory minimum sentences as well as expand the number of crimes eligible for the federal death penalty
the house rules committee has made a number of amendments in order for the floor debate on hr 1751 we urge your support for the following amendments 1 scott va 8 this amendment replaces all mandatory minimum sentences with higher maximum sentences
although mandatory minimums were designed to reduce the racial inequalities that too often resulting from judicial sentencing discretion in practice they shift discretion from the judge to the prosecutor
prosecutors retain the power to plea bargain and choose which defendants they will offer plea agreements to in order for those defendants to avoid the mandatory 2 scott va 9 this amendment strikes the death penalty for the killing of federally funded public safety officers
chronic problems including inadequate defense counsel and racial disparities plague the death penalty system in the united states
we urge you to oppose the following amendment 1 flake 2 this amendment would eliminate federal jurisdiction for all sentencing phase claims in habeas corpus proceedings unless the claim went to the validity of the state conviction in a capital cases
for example this would result in federal courts not having jurisdiction to review habeas petitions involving claims in state capital cases that were based on ineffective assistance of counsel or prosecutorial misconduct during the sentencing phase of the case errors that could mean the difference between life and death for the petitioner
in addition this amendment would authorize the us attorney general to determine whether in a capital case a state s indigent defense counsel system passes constitutional muster
the attorney general our nation s top federal prosecutor is not an objective party and therefore should not decide whether states have provided competent defense counsel in death penalty cases
mr chairman i think the amendment is clarifying in nature and i have no objection
mr chairman this amendment eliminates the mandatory minimum sentences in the bill and replaces them with increases in maximum sentences for which a defendant can be sentenced
in each instance in which it eliminates a mandatory minimum sentence it raises the maximum term to which an offender can be sentenced except in situations where they can already get life
but those who are bit players in an offense or those who do not deserve as much time as ringleaders do not have to be sentenced to that time anyway
having the experience of sentencing people on an ongoing basis judges see the differences in activities roles backgrounds of the offenders of crime
having heard all the facts and circumstances in the case they are in a much better position to sentence offenders than congress is in sentencing offenders with no knowledge of the individual case
to ensure a systemic approach in sentencing like offenders in a similar manner we have created the sentencing commission and the sentencing guideline system
the sentencing statistics do not establish that the courts have not followed the guidelines especially when you take into account that most of the deviations result from government motions or acquiescences in sentences and guidelinesanctioned departures
if we do not trust judges to sentence offenders sufficient in other cases the one instance where we should be able to trust judges is in the case where the charge is murder injury or threats to judges
certainly mr chairman mandatory minimums are not indicated in this bill so i urge my colleagues to support this amendment and remove the mandatory minimums from the bill
the notion that the federal government has to replace the states and localities in murder prosecutions against those who would murder a state judge or others associated with a judge or courts is absurd
states have shown themselves quite capable of prosecuting murder cases and in obtaining death penalties where applicable
if a state has chosen to represent the will of its citizens by not authorizing a death penalty why should congress step in and impose it in spite of the state s public policy choice
the public is clearly rethinking the appropriateness of the death penalty in general due to the evidence that it is ineffective in deterring crime that it is racially discriminatory and found more often than not to be erroneously applied
nor is it surprising that with such a sorry record of death penalty administration that several states have abolished the death penalty or placed moratoriums on the applications of their death penalty while studies are being conducted and why some while they have it on the books have not applied it in many years
in recognition of the problems states and localities were having with administering the death penalty congress adopted the innocence protection act just a few years ago
i want to point out more recently she has done further analysis in elaboration of her research and found in terms of deterring murders executions deter murders in six states have no effect on murders in eight states and increased murders in 13 states
mr chairman i ask unanimous consent to claim the time in opposition although i am not opposed
mr chairman reclaiming my time it is my understanding that this was in fact their request in fact their number one request
mr chairman i rise in support of hr 1751 the secure access to justice and court protection act of 2005
the murder of family members of united states district judge joan lefkow the brutal slayings of judge rowland barnes his court reporter his deputy sheriff and a federal officer in atlanta and the coldblooded shootings outside the tyler texas courthouse all underscore the need to provide better protection for judges courthouse personnel witnesses law enforcement and their family members
it will help address the problem of violence in and around our nation s courthouses
according to the bureau of justice statistics 52 law enforcement officers were killed in the united states in 2002 and 56 were killed in 2001
from 1994 through 2003 a total of 616 law enforcement officers were feloniously killed in the line of duty
in 1996 a witness intimidation study by the justice department included that witness intimidation is a pervasive and insidious problem
prosecutors interviewed in this study estimated that witness intimidation occurs in 75 to 100 percent of the violent crimes committed in some gangdominated neighborhoods
finally the bill incorporates key provisions of the peace officer justice act legislation introduced by the gentleman from california mr dreier xz4001150 to bring justice to those who murder law enforcement personnel and flee to foreign nations to escape prosecution and justice in this country
when judges prosecutors law enforcement and courthouse personnel speak in a clear and unanimous voice we have a duty to listen and to act to give their members the tools and resources necessary for their protection
judges witnesses courthouse personnel and law enforcement officers must operate without fear in order to administer the law without bias
in addition the amendment adds indian tribes as eligible entities for court security grants in section 18 of the bill
mr chairman i rise in opposition to the scott amendment
more than 57 000 law enforcement officers were assaulted in 2003 or one in every 10 officers serving in the united states
the executive director of the fraternal order of police noted recently there is less respect for authority in general and police officers specifically
under current criminal law a false statement made to an fbi agent in a terrorism investigation carries the same penalty as a violent assault of a police officer
according to the administrative office of united states courts there are almost 700 threats made a year against federal judges and in numerous cases federal judges have had security details assigned to them for fear of attack by members of terrorist organizations violent gangs and disgruntled litigants
the bill adopts a penalty structure requiring 1 to 10 years for an assault that results in bodily injury such as a cut abrasion bruise burn disfigurement pain or illness 3 to 12 years for substantial bodily injury temporary but substantial disfigurement temporary but substantial loss or impairment and 10 to 30 years for serious bodily injury substantial risk of death extreme physical pain protracted and obvious disfigurement or protracted loss or impairment of the function of a bodily member organ or mental faculty
as revised the mandatory minimums are commensurate with existing federal sentencing guidelines but in the absence of a mandatory minimum guideline system there is too much at risk to leave the sentencing to judges who have already demonstrated their willingness to depart from the guidelines when presented with a case
mandatory minimum penalties are effective for ensuring consistency in sentencing
since the supreme court s decision in united states v booker judges now have virtually unlimited discretion to ignore the federal sentencing guidelines and impose whatever sentence they like all to the detriment of public safety and fairness and sentencing through consistent and clear punishment schemes
once freed from mandatory sentencing schemes federal judges are now starting to ignore the guidelines in one of every 10 criminal cases they are imposing sentences below the previously mandated guideline range
in a recently released report the sentencing commission data confirmed that this trend is continuing and specifically broke out such data by circuits which showed that judges in the second and ninth circuits followed the guideline ranges in imposing sentences in a substantially lower percentage than the other circuits
sentences now for similar crimes are being handed in disparate fashion depending on the region where the offense occurs
this is not equal justice under the law in the federal system
those judges when they go to the supreme court ought to look at the motto that is underneath the roof of the court at the main entrance when they walk in
i rise in opposition to the scott amendment which eliminates the death penalty for the killing of a federally funded public safety officer such as a judge police officer firefighter prosecutor or a family member of a public safety officer
according to the bureau of justice statistics 52 law enforcement officers were feloniously killed in the united states in 2003 and 56 officers were killed in the previous year
in the 10year period from 1994 through 2003 a total of 616 law enforcement officers were feloniously killed in the line of duty in the united states 100 of whom were killed in ambush situations entrapment or premeditated situations
recent events include the killing of an individual with a grenade in the seattle federal courthouse the killing of judge roland barnes his deputy sheriff and a federal agent in atlanta the murders of federal judge lefkow s husband and mother and the murders immediately outside the tyler texas courthouse
these recent attacks follow on the heels of the 1998 bombing of circuit judge robert vance in the 11th circuit the 1998 shooting of judge daronoco and the 1979 shooting of judge wood outside his san antonio home
second under current federal law the department of justice pays survivor benefits to families of first responders who are killed in the line of duty
the federal interest in minimizing these assaults and murders is obvious and costsaving
the provisions do not require federal prosecution but only add another tool in the arsenal to protect law enforcement officers judges and other courthouse personnel
the need for a swift and effective death penalty is significant in the case of violent offenders who assault and kill law enforcement officers judges and witnesses
i think it plugs a hole in the original bill and we certainly want to do whatever we can to prevent people from going into gangs and from being threatened if they are witnesses and are sworn to tell the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth in criminal trials involving gang members
the gentleman from new york is absolutely correct in that there was an oversight in that state and local courts would not be eligible for the four grant programs that the gentleman outlined in his remarks
mr speaker i rise in opposition to the motion to recommit
and he has stated that he is opposed to doing something where there is a crying need given the threats and the murders in courthouses all around the country and not just federal courthouses but state and local courthouses as well
now what does he propose to do in the motion to recommit
profiteering in an illegal manner is already criminal under the united states code
in order to get it passed and signed into law to protect the judicial branch and those who do business and work for it vote this silly motion down and pass the bill as has been worked out on a bipartisan basis
what he is trying to do is to help that young person extricate him or herself and let the courts and law enforcement know aspects of gang crime that are key in convicting our most dangerous criminals on the streets
in my district i think we have exported gang activities around the country and maybe even around the world south central los angeles
and one clear message that has resonated amongst all of them is the dire need to promise our youth that if they are involved in gang activity and remove themselves they will not be harmed or killed by the very gang that they wisely ostracize themselves from
so i thank the gentleman very much for recognizing that we need to have options for the young people that are trying to be responsible in the process
this is a technical amendment that fixes an oversight in the bill that left out four programs that would be helpful for courts court officers and court security personnel to take advantage of the bulletproof vest partnership grant program the byrne memorial state and local law enforcement assistance discretionary grant program the assistance for children s justice act cja grants and state justice statistics program for statistical analysis centers
this web site and we have obviously obscured the url goes so far as to talk about the comings and goings of undercover officers in new york city
this is an example where we find the matrix or perhaps i would call it the conflict of the virtues of the internet how it is a place to bring information far and wide and the ability to use the internet for what is in this case a very pernicious meanspirited and perhaps deadly cause
in this bill we essentially incorporate hr 1710 the internet police protection act that i offered
i know there are going to be things on the internet that are troubling to us and we are always going to be in a tug and a push to try to figure out where we draw the line
in this case the line clearly gets drawn in the following place if people are going to use the internet to harass intimidate or harm law enforcement personnel to harm court officers to harm judges then they should be illegal
courts have come down in different places but one thing we know threatening speech is not protected speech
speech that endangers someone s livelihood endangers someone s life is not protected speech and this provision in the court security act will make that abundantly clear
yes in its current form mr speaker
four years ago on september 11 2001 without warning like missiles from hell two planes filled with the most innocent of victims slammed into the world trade center s twin towers 3 000 dead seemingly in an instant
confidence in public officials and institutions soared
in the wake of hurricane katrina the federal government s response was slow and sluggish sloppy and uneven
we as a nation collectively fell down and hard and against and away from the greater good that is in all of us
mr speaker governmentsponsored nobid contractors at politically motivated firms like halliburton are exploiting our nation s generosity here in america and abroad
in the gulf coast region of this nation and in the middle east region of this world contractors are pillaging the very people whose economic interests we have been sent here to protect
in the midst of war and in the aftermath of natural disaster hundreds of millions in taxpayerfunded relief and recovery are being wasted squandered lost forever
mr speaker the motion i offer today will impose stiff fines and criminal penalties on contractors who knowingly falsify information in order to win approval of government contracts during presidentially declared emergencies
while in this chamber the proper role of government is often debated the one undisputed and unifying principle is that above all else our responsibility to each other and to the american people is to protect the nation from entities who seek to injure and destroy us and from natural disasters that devastate our community
mr speaker the motion i offer today at this defining moment in our nation s history will either reaffirm the promise of our nation s greatness or condemn us from this moment on for failing to live up to our obligations as a nation that deserves and demands only from us fairness and goodness
i appreciate all the assistance in this bill
the chairman has been wonderful in helping with this and making this a reality
mr chairman i rise today in strong support of hr 1751 the secure access to justice and court protection act of 2005
the legislation will work to prevent future attacks in our nation s courthouses such as what happened at my former courthouse in east texas
that tragic day in february we lost a brave man mark wilson who stepped up to attempt to save the lives of innocent citizens at the courthouse and was killed the same day
this bill has garnered a lot of support across the country since its introduction in april and i want to take a moment to thank some of those who have supported hr 1751
her input and support have been extremely helpful in developing this legislation
i have spoken with her personally and again just in the last hour and she is most gracious and also grateful for the overall bill
we also know that her elderly mother and husband were tragically murdered by a disgruntled gentleman who was upset by a ruling she had made in a case
it will open the lines of communication between the marshals and the courts and therefore help with the prevention protection and penalties in this bill
it provides a 30year mandatory minimum to life in prison or the death penalty for killing a federally funded public safety officer
there has been some mention by the gentlewoman from texas regarding mandatory minimums and it should be noted that we removed a number of mandatory minimums in this bill for things like simple assault and threats
it imposes 10 years in prison in addition to whatever the defendant receives
border crimes can be especially difficult to prosecute a witness to a crime along the border may be hesitant to testify if he or she fears it is related to criminal activity across the border in another country
unfortunately despite the tough battle in this institution over the central american free trade agreement very little has changed
when i first ran for congress in 1992 our country had a trade deficit of 38 billion
a dozen years later last year in 2004 our trade deficit was 618 billion
in this year by the end of the year it will probably exceed 700 billion
from 38 billion to 618 billion to 700plus billion in less than a decade and a half
they do not have the environmental protections and health regulations we enjoy in the united states
we know that because they were in the core text of the jordan trade agreement which passed by a voice vote
we all remember in july in the middle of the night we remember passing the central american free trade agreement
the votes were cast in the middle of the night
to pass cafta they had to do that in the middle of the night
more than 200 employees will lose their jobs at an edenton manufacturing plant when the company moves most of its operations to central america in the coming year
we hear the same promises in bahrain as we heard on cafta the same promises on cafta that we heard about china the same promises on china as we heard about nafta
mr speaker i am pleased to rise today in support of the usbahrain free trade agreement
this agreement reflects a bipartisan effort to make a deal that is worthy of broad support both in terms of the process used and the substance of the agreement
i want to thank the gentleman from florida mr shaw xz4003690 for his help in this agreement
i want to thank the gentleman from wisconsin mr ryan xz4003511 for his persistence in keeping us focused on getting this agreement completed this year
i want to thank the gentleman from new york mr rangel xz4003330 for his help with the ustr and with the administration in pointing out the importance of making some additional changes
i thank the gentleman from michigan mr levin xz4002380 for his contributions in regards to this bill
as a result congress gives up a lot of its prerogatives and it is absolutely critical that in giving up these prerogatives that the administration consult and work very closely with the members of congress on both sides of the aisle in negotiating entering into and submitting to congress the implementing legislation
well in regards to the usbahrainian agreement much of the work was done prior to the beginning of this year and quite frankly there was not as close a relationship with congress as i wanted to see
as a result we now have an agreement that incorporates the important provisions that deal with worker rights as well as dealing with the issue of the boycott against israel and i want to compliment the process and the manner in which we have been able to complete this agreement
this is a good model for other agreements in the region and around the world
this should be the template that we use in all negotiations and free trade agreements in that region
the third reason why this is a good agreement is that bahrain has adopted major reforms in its labor code and is committed to making further reforms
in 2002 bahrain enacted legislation that for the first time gave workers in bahrain the right to belong to trade unions and to strike
last month in an exchange of letters with the united states government the government of bahrain made several additional commitments that would ensure its laws are in full compliance with basic international standards
mr speaker let me just point out that the process we use is that we identified certain weaknesses in the operation of the bahrainian reform laws as it related to workers rights
bahrain now is committed by letter and interpretation to comply fully with the ilo standards in four of those areas
bahrain had filed earlier this week two of those laws to make it clear that it is not only going to be the manner in which the government enforces the laws but the underlying laws themselves will be in compliance with ilo standards
we also are permitted under this agreement to use the agreement in the event that we believe that they have not carried out their commitment
we can consider a matter arising under the fta labor chapter if in fact bahrain does not carry out its commitments as spelled out in the exchange of letters
this will allow the united states to initiate formal consultation with bahrain on these commitments on the procedures outlined in article 156 of the agreement
mr speaker i would note that the bahrainian actions stand in contrast to some of the cafta countries that actually weakened or proposed weakening their laws after the cafta agreement was signed
unlike the cafta countries bahrain is a country that is heading in the right direction with regards to labor reforms
it opens up a market in a very important part of the world
it offers us a template for moving forward in the middle east by using economics to bring peace and prosperity to that region which is clearly in the interest of the united states
mr speaker let me thank all of my colleagues who participated in this debate
let me once again remind those who are following this debate that we are talking about a free trade agreement with bahrain a country which is about the same size as the city of austin whose total trade with the united states is measured in terms of a couple hundred million dollars
it is a country with a high standard of living for that region whose economy produces 19 000 plus per capita of gdp which is about 4 times higher than we had in dealing with the cafta countries
i mention that so we can put this agreement in context
many of my colleagues who have spoken of concern have talked about concern on economic policies related to trade here in the united states and i join them on many occasions particularly as they are referring to problems that we are having with trading partners
this agreement in fact removes barriers so that us companies and us manufacturers and us farmers will have greater access to the market of bahrain
in regards to workers rights i agree with my colleagues that have spoken of concern about trade agreements
but i think in judging bahrain we need to use the standard that we have used and that is does this nation measure up to international labor standards
they have passed major reform in 2002
they have issued interpretations to comply with ilo standards and have introduced laws that will correct the additional standards and they have agreed to allow us to use the trade agreement to make sure that in fact these new laws are not only passed but in fact bahrain is living up to ilo standards
that to me is good faith with an ally and one in which we can move forward and should move forward
in bahrain s case i think the evidence is overwhelming
we need to expand opportunities in the middle east
the best chance for peace in the middle east is if we can open up the economic opportunities of that region and bahrain offers us a country that has stepped forward and offered leadership
in repealing the boycott against israel and saying that it wants to have open trade in the region they will now be the fourth nation in that region that we will have a free trade agreement with
so this represents an opportunity to advance us interest in stabilizing a region of the world that has been of major interest to the united states
are they willing to be a good neighbor in the region to advance peace and stability
in each of these instances bahrain passes this test and i urge my colleagues to support this agreement
mr speaker i rise in strong support of this agreement and i want to begin by extending my congratulations to the distinguished chairman of the trade subcommittee for his fine work on this effort and to thank him along with my friend from wisconsin and my friend from texas both of whom are here on the floor and who worked closely with us with our working group to promote the issue of trade
and by the way if you look at the trade relationship between mexico and the united states today there is a third of 1 trillion in crossborder trade between mexico and the united states
the middleclass population in mexico is larger than the entire canadian population
in fact mr speaker i will say that there are more people working in the united states of america today than we have ever seen working
if i could reclaim my time let me just say that it is fascinating to listen to my friends on the other side of the aisle who when we were in the midst of our debate just a few minutes ago on the alternative minimum tax they were very strong proponents of making sure we bring about reform so that people who are in that wage rate that goes all the way up to 342 000 a year get relief under the amt
so i believe that if you look at the jobs that have been created if you look at the wage rates that we have right now in the united states if you look at the standard of living in the united states of america juxtaposed to other countries in the world it is very clear that the united states of america is the single greatest nation on the face of the earth and it is in large part due to the fact that we have over the last several years put together a wide range of trade agreements
a former defense department official said to me when we were talking about the aftermath of september 11 2001 that if we had seen a percentage point or two more growth in afghanistan and pakistan we might have been able to diminish the threat of september 11
because there is a sense that somehow those involved in international terrorism are simply doing this in the name of allah
i recall their being in south florida and las vegas nevada leading up to that meaning the focus on economic opportunity is something that we need to realize can help diminish that kind of terrorist threat there
so as i listen to my friends on the other side of the aisle and i am happy to say this agreement is enjoying strong bipartisan support but as i listen to those on the other side of the aisle who are opposed to this agreement it is very unfortunate that so many of them do not recognize the tremendous growth that my friend from florida the chairman of the trade subcommittee just went through the 43 percent gdp growth a 5 percent unemployment rate 215 000 jobs created last month alone in the aftermath of hurricane katrina and all of the other challenges that we faced that these have come about in large part due to the trade agreements that we have put into place
mr speaker i thank my friend for that contribution showing as i said that the standard of living in the united states of america is strong
and i want to say in conclusion that i am very very grateful that through this agreement we are getting us back to this notion of bipartisanship because it is not a republican or democratic issue
we are happy to provide the lead but every democrat who wants to jump on board in support of the cause of free trade is more than welcome and i am happy the democrats are understanding the critical importance of this effort
so in advance mr speaker i am sure that my good friend and i want to make sure that there is no confusion
chairman dreier pointed out rightly i believe that this usbahrain trade agreement is one of the most noncontroversial agreements of this kind to come before congress in a long time and as i said that may be so but it is also not the point that i wish to carry
we have had several more controversial trade deals come before the house in recent years where we were also given 2 hours of debate time
more recently we saw that in two trade agreements
i ask my friends in the majority to let the house work its will not so much on this bill but certainly any other in the future that comes before us
as to this specific trade agreement as i have already said it comes to the floor with the support from the administration and both parties in congress
while i seriously doubt that free trade with the tiny island nation of bahrain is going to be the rising tide that lifts our flagging economy after all trade with bahrain accounts for only 03 percent of our total trade activity i also will not try to stand in the way
it should be noted however that despite its small size bahrain runs a trade surplus with the united states joining most other countries in the world
this change of heart is purely economic and it happened just in the last month
the fact that the country s parliament has rejected in the last 6 weeks the lifting of the embargo and the kingdom has made it clear that it is not normalizing relations with israel only further proves my point
in fact mr speaker over the past few years prices have dropped for a wide array of goods and services which are produced around the world such as video equipment and toys
maybe we in congress have the power but do we have the right to tell americans that we will not allow them to buy cheaper products because those products may come from other nations
the nation of bahrain is a friend of the united states and an important ally in the global war on terror
i urge my colleagues to once again reject protectionism and instead stand for prosperity stand for freedom and stand with me in voting for this trade agreement
i support this agreement and will vote in favor of the required implementing legislation
i also anticipate this agreement will enjoy strong bipartisan support in congress
in general i have advocated free trade and open markets because i believe that american businesses and workers can compete and win in the global economy
the agreement provides that all bilateral trade in consumer and industrial products will become dutyfree immediately as will 98 percent of us agricultural exports with the remaining tariffs phased out over 10 years
beyond the economic benefits that will accrue to the united states this agreement is an important opportunity to bring increased development prosperity and stability to a key ally and strategic partner in the region
not only has bahrain supported and participated in operations enduring freedom and iraqi freedom as well as the first persian gulf war in 1991 the country has also served as the host to us naval forces in the middle east for more than 50 years
i am confident that these goals will be met with respect to bahrain in part thanks to a number of labor reforms that have been recently implemented by the government
i will consider future trade agreements one at a time taking into consideration the specific labor and environmental conditions that exist in the countries we seek to trade with as well as the provisions included in the agreements to protect workers both here and in the other countries and environmental concerns
mr crowley mr speaker i rise today in strong support of the united states bahrain free trade agreement
bahrain has been a close friend of the united states for over 100 years and this agreement is taking us to a new level in our friendship
this friendship is built on trust and respect for each other so much so that the us navy s fifth fleet operates in bahrain a friendly and secure environment for the fleet that watches over a dangerous region
bahrain continues to lead all gulf nations in political and economic reforms
bahrain conducted its first national legislative elections in over 25 years electing 40 members to the representatives council
women were not only allowed to vote they also became the first women in the gulf to run as candidates in national elections
the strong labor provisions that bahrain has agreed to will help us business thrive in bahrain this agreement provides market access for us industrial agricultural and consumer products
financial service companies will have the right to establish subsidiaries branches and joint ventures in bahrain
this agreement is the first step in the political and economic reforms for the middle east and i strongly believe the us should continue to work with moderate arab nations such as bahrain to help balance out some of the more extreme elements in today s middle east
mr oxley mr speaker i rise in support of the free trade agreement between the united states and bahrain a country which is and seeks to increase its stature as the 3leading financial center for the middle east
mr speaker as you know the united states runs a large and growing trade surplus in the services sector
it was 559 billion in 2002 and 961 billion in 2003
as the most innovative and competitive country in the world the united states has a strategic interest in fostering greater opportunities for our financial firms consultants accountants and other highend service professionals to export their services and products worldwide
the knowledge transfer from increased american exports of financial and other related services will help people in other countries develop more efficient and economically valuable capabilities fostering economic growth abroad as well as an increased customer base for american goods and services
to the extent that capital formation abroad also encourages growth of stock and bond markets free trade in financial services can provide good working experience for how decisions can be taken through transparent decisionmaking processes which are the hallmarks of democracy
this free trade agreement with the leading financial center in the middle east will substantially open financial services markets in the region for american firms
at a time when high oil prices are generating large pools of capital in the middle east we have a strategic interest in making it easier for american financial firms to provide their intermediation services in the region
we also have a strategic interest in making it easier for middle east investors to become more integrated into the global economy
bahrain is also a valued ally in our fight against terrorist financing
bahrain s antimoney laundering law passed in 2001 makes money laundering an extraditable offense
in addition bahrain hosts the newly created middle east and north africa financial action task force which is the key multilateral group that creates standards throughout the region to fight terrorist financing and money laundering
its products include oil products and aluminum products and we know for sure it has lessened its involvement in textiles
but what most members do not know is that 80 percent of the investment of this country has been invested in the united states
it is invested in real estate in banking and other opportunities
i like trade bills that create jobs and i want to thank my friends in the labor movement who have raised concerns about child employment about provisions that should be protecting unions and protecting workers
i am concerned about the fact that most of these provisions are in the side letters
it is unfortunate when the republican administration sat down to negotiate with bahrain they did not sit down and create the intelligent and forwardthinking provisions that are in the letters created by the democratic ways and means members
but these letters i am told will have the same sort of authority as provisions in the trade bill and if they are violated there will be opportunities for consultation in order to ensure that these provisions are made
if the democrats were in control as we had the opportunity in the permanent normal trade relations with china although that is not the best example but i remember the hard work and the heavy lifting of democrats to create a better trade bill
in this instance i think the democrats have worked very hard to make this a fair bill for a partner of the united states who has been a strong partner and a democratic partner
i ask as members consider this legislation to look at the improvements that have been made and the side bar letters that have created the right kind of negotiated document to help the people who would be benefited in bahrain and also help investment here in the united states
mr speaker i rise in support of hr 4340 the united statesbahrain free trade agreement implementation act in spite of my support i do have some concerns
for example as in all other us free trade agreements fta s the text of the usbahrain free trade agreement requires only that the two countries enforce their own labor laws
it is my understanding that in 2002 bahrain completed a major revision to its own labor laws to comply with internationallyrecognized standards and to ensure that working people in its country share fully in the benefits of globalization
these concerns force me to believe that the workers rights provisions in the bahrain fta are somewhat weak
in contrast to the usjordan fta the bahrain agreement contains only one enforceable provision on workers rights which is an obligation to enforce domestic labor laws
before closing let me note that i appreciate the efforts made to negotiate a commitment from the bahraini government to bring its labor laws up to ilo standards in the near future and i hope that this agreement is honored
i must also note that a commitment to improve labor laws in the future is not an adequate substitute for having decent labor laws in place especially when the labor provisions in the agreement raises concerns
unfortunately if the promise is not honored there is no recourse that can take in the context of the fta itself other than to engage in consultations
mr speaker i rise in opposition to hr 4340 the bahrain trade agreement
however in the 10 years following passage of the north american free trade agreement nafta which i opposed millions of american jobs have been lost threatening entire industries that were once bedrocks of this country
nearly three million manufacturing jobs have been lost since the bush administration took office in 2001
in 2004 the united states had a record 162 billion deficit on goods trade with china and a 617 billion trade deficit on goods and services worldwide
eliminating tariffs and allowing companies to exploit foreign labor has destroyed entire american industries and has resulted in the highest american trade deficit ever placing america at a huge economic disadvantage
mr speaker i urge my colleagues to vote no on this free trade agreement with bahrain and any free trade agreements in the future until we can create an american trade policy that is in the best interests of the american people
mr speaker i rise today in support of the united statesbahrain free trade agreement implementation act
as a cochair of the new democrat coalition i have long believed that when instituted correctly and fairly trade agreements open up foreign markets to us goods create new opportunities for companies and their employees and lift the standard of living for people in the country with whom we are trading
us goods exported to bahrain totaled 302 million in 2004 constituting 03 percent of total us merchandise trade in 2004
of that total wisconsin exported over 4 million in goods last year to bahrain with the majority of the exports in machinery and manufacturing
one hundred percent of bilateral trade in consumer and industrial products will become dutyfree immediately and 98 percent of us agricultural product exports to bahrain would be immediately duty free with 10year phaseouts for the remaining items such as alcohol and tobacco
bahrain has been a strong and stable state in the persian gulf region and a friend to the united states
the us navy s 5th fleet is based in bahrain and the united states has recognized the importance of our relationship with this country by establishing a joint usbahrain defense cooperation agreement and designing bahrain as a major nonnato ally this fta strengthens relations with one of our proven strategic allies in an unstable region
bahrain has committed in writing and with a clear and immediate timetable to amend all provisions of its labor laws that are not consistent with basic international labor organization ilo standards
in addition the united states trade representative has committed to report periodically to congress on bahrain s fulfillment of its agreement and is prepared to invoke article 156 procedures if bahrain fails to carry out these commitments
it is in our best interest to engage bahrain and complete this bilateral free trade agreement
bahrain is an important political economic and military ally and in the years since 911 has been a valued partner in the war on terror
the usbahrain free trade agreement will strengthen this key relationship and bolster the important reforms currently taking place in bahrain
as a commander in the navy reserve i fully appreciate the value of bahrain s willingness to host our fleet in this strategic region
in the face of the arab league s efforts to intensify the boycott bahrain has taken a bold and symbolic step towards peace in the middle east
mr speaker i rise today in support of hr 4340 the united statesbahrain free trade agreement implementation act
this agreement is an example of the success that bipartisan engagement on trade issues can generate and this agreement should be a model a starting point for how we can achieve success in the future
during consideration of this agreement in the ways and means committee democrats expressed their concern about the treatment and application of international labor standards in the agreement
since that time both the administration and bahrain have worked at our urging to include bahrain s commitments to begin applying international labor standards immediately in their county as well as their timetable to bring all of their laws into ilo compliance as conditional and enforceable elements of the agreement
in other words as we argued during the cafta debate workers rights should enjoy the same level of protection we place on goods and intellectual property rights a balance that was sorrowfully left out of the cafta agreement
in addition to this the bahraini government has demonstrated its world leadership by recently becoming one of the first arab league nations to remove its boycott on israeli goods and services
workers rights matter to the rules of competition negotiated in trade agreements
in order to make globalization work and i emphasize this its benefits must flow broadly among the majority of the population not flow to the top and merely trickle down to the rest
it is a view of how to expand trade in a way to spread its benefits among the population stimulate where it does not exist a strong middle class necessary for a nation s stability and yes the development of its democracy provide us workers with a more level playing field and create markets of consumers with the income of other countries to buy our products
unfortunately the bush administration has insisted on using a misguided cookiecutter approach as to the basic standard on worker rights saying to our trading partners simply enforce your own laws where internationally recognized standards of workers rights were wellestablished in law in practice in a nation s history so that there was unlikely a retreat many of us voted yes chile singapore morocco
but we always warned that enforce your own laws as a standard was fundamentally an inappropriate approach and would be subject to misuse and abuse if adopted in the future under very different circumstances
that was vividly true in cafta regarding the rights and position of workers
there were major gaps in the laws in actual practices and in the socioeconomic dynamic of those nations
so we in the democratic party overwhelmingly voted no
we insisted that an unbalanced framework for expanded globalization would in central america lead to further poverty further insecurity and hinder democratic development
when the administration began to negotiate an fta with bahrain it was clear that there existed issues unrelated to economic globalization which if negotiated effectively would militate in favor of approval of an fta
those included the end of the boycott of israel and its impact on the movement towards security and potential peace in the middle east and american diplomatic relations with a nation moving faster than many others in the middle east towards democratic processes
while the code was more advanced it is true than in many middle east nations it still fell short in several important respects
so in view of all these circumstances as the gentleman from maryland mr cardin xz4000640 has mentioned a number of us chose to work with and press the bahrainian government to bring their laws up to basic international standards
that started an intensive process where the negotiating parties did work in good faith and where the ways and means committee at a hearing agreed across party lines that promises were not enough but that there must be concrete action on major gaps in labor laws
the bahrainian government has now introduced concrete legislation as mr cardin xz4000640 has announced to fill these gaps in their labor code
they will apply to both citizens and to the foreign workers who are there in large numbers
bahrain is a small nation 667 000plus people with over 235 000 nonnationals with a per capita income far higher than is true in other nations where the majority of citizens in those nations live in poverty and with a constitutional monarchy whose written support of these labor reforms provide confidence that the formally introduced reforms will become law
our experience here and i emphasize that does not diminish but only reinforces our insistence that as we face far different circumstances when achieving a positive result from expanded globalization confronts very different dynamics and that is true in negotiations with latin american countries and others our nation must do for the rights of workers what it does for all other provisions of trade agreements
it must negotiate to place these international standards squarely in the body of the trade agreement with enforcement
only then can we be confident that globalization will help workers in other nations uplift themselves create a vital middle class in those nations so important to those nations move towards international competition so that trade as now increasingly being verbalized by president bush is both free and fair
only then can we be confident that competition with our workers from other countries will not be based on who can most suppress the rights of other workers and that for our own businesses in this day and age as mentioned of our massive trade imbalances there will be increasing numbers of middle income residents in other nations to buy our goods and services
mr speaker continuing my support for an overwhelming majority of free trade agreements i cast my vote in favor the usbahrain free trade agreement fta
in the past i have expressed serious concerns over copyright provisions contained in some free trade agreements negotiated by the bush administration that arguably constrain the ability of the united states to modernize our laws to reflect the realities of technology
i am also pleased that in other areas of the usbahrain fta the president finally followed democratic recommendations to ensure the adoption and enforcement of internationallyrecognized basic standards for the people of bahrain
mr speaker i rise today in strong support of the bahrain free trade agreement
but beyond that it will strengthen relations with one of our most steadfast friends in the middle east
the bahrainis have taken difficult but important progressive steps that will elevate standards in bahrain and help promote stability in the middle east
in addition bahrain has made significant improvements to its labor laws and has dismantled its arab league boycott of israel
we have made sure that we are more interdependent upon one another and it is good to be interdependent because with that interdependence we as a nation begin to depend on others in this world
mr speaker i think working out the details in this bill is a classic example as to how we can be bipartisan when we really try
and the gentleman from maryland mr cardin xz4000640 made up his mind that we were going to stick to it to make certain that some of our concerns about the basic protection of workers was going to be included in the bill
and while the language is not specifically in the bill in talking with the representatives from the bahrain government especially the ambassador that showed us a sincere desire to make certain that he accommodated not republicans or democrats but his respect for this body we were able to persuade most of the members on our side that this was something worth doing not only because of economic reasons but because of the courageous acts that were taken in the middle east by this very small country
mr speaker in closing though i would also like to point out that the gentleman from wisconsin mr ryan xz4003511 a junior member of the committee spent considerable time working with us and working with us through the united states trade representative in order to make certain that we reached this conclusion and i will be supporting this piece of legislation
i rise in strong support of the usbahrain free trade agreement
it also reflects a broader commitment to an ally that hosts the fifth fleet of the us navy and has assisted us here in the united states in our pursuit of al qaeda and other islamic extremist organizations
additionally it highlights and rewards bahrain s reform efforts thus far as illustrated by the elections held in 2002 in which women fully participated and by bahrain s consistent rating by the heritage foundation as the freest economy in the middle east
to affirm this commitment and establish a positive precedent for the future of ftas with countries in the region rejection of the arab league boycott of israel is incorporated as a provision of the usbahrain fta
mr speaker according to the 911 commission report economic reforms will be vital in transforming the middle east into a region which rejects despotism and terrorism and instead embraces freedom and democracy
mr speaker i think this is a very important step in the right direction for our country
what we are accomplishing here is the first trade agreement in this region since the 911 commission published their findings since we launched the middle east free trade area initiative since 911
now let us just say it is controversial what our country is doing in iraq
we believe that freedom and democracy are the best ultimate tools in the war on terrorism
we believe that our children and grandchildren will be more safe and secure here in america and around the world if other people are free if other people have the ability to determine their own destiny and their own futures
a trade agreement with the united states with these countries with bahrain in particular helps secure that future
by seeing the leadership of bahrain the first country in the gulf to do this gravitating and taking the leadership for rule of law transparency in its legislature changing its government to a constitutional monarchy having a directly representative parliament giving women the right to vote given women elected positions in government giving woman elected positions in the ministry in the cabinet level having the rule of law having transparency all of those things are the necessary and key foundations and building blocks to freedom and democracy
is this trade agreement in and of itself a good deal for us
the bahrainees have already shown leadership in their region in this area
in 2000 they passed a very sweeping labor reform law
this is a country mr speaker that has really shown leadership in this region against the grain against pressure from their neighbors across the causeway in saudi arabia and elsewhere in the gulf
this is a country that has been our friend and ally for over 100 years that has hosted our 5th fleet naval base from which we do all of our naval operations in the iraqi theatre in the afghani theatre come from bahrain from our 5th fleet
this is a country that has stood with the united states through thick and then in helping us stop money laundering for terrorists in helping us with our military in standing with us for democracy in the middle east
that is why i just want to say one more time how thankful i am to the ranking member of the ways and means committee the gentleman from new york mr rangel xz4003330 for working very hard to meet this agreement and the gentleman from maryland mr cardin xz4000640 as well for working hard to meet this agreement so that we can stand here today as republicans and democrats in favor of this very important trade agreement
when you look at our nation s trade deficit we enjoy a very large surplus in services and our trade deficit comes from a trade deficit in manufactured goods
our 5th fleet is located in bahrain
what this agreement proposes to do is put american people in contact with bahrainee people put americans in contact with muslims put americans in contact with arabs in the gulf so we can better understand each other
trade is about individuals combining to join in mutually beneficial behavior and activity and business arrangements to help their families and help create jobs and grow their economies
we need a better understanding of people in the arab world
this is important because of the climate we face in the world
that is why it is important that we pass this agreement so that the american people can join and bond in friendship with the bahrainee people in the gulf coast in the middle east so we can have a better understanding of each other
mr speaker i thank the gentleman for yielding and along with millions of american workers in the aflcio i rise in very strong opposition to this flawed agreement
mr speaker in 2004 we had a trade deficit of 617 billion and by the end of this year that trade deficit is expected to top 700 billion
industry after industry has been decimated in this country by unfettered free trade and we have lost millions of good paying manufacturing jobs to china to mexico and to other lowwage countries
in fact after losing millions of good paying blue collar jobs we are now on the cusp of hemorrhaging millions more of white collar information technology jobs
when there are virtually no decent jobs left in america
well you are doing a good job in that effort
in the last 5 years alone we have lost almost 3 million manufacturing jobs more than 17 percent of all jobs in that sector
corporate america comes in here and they say we do not want to pay working people a living wage we do not want to respect environmental standards we do not want to provide health care to our workers so give us the opportunity to move to china to other lowwage countries please pass these trade agreements
congress says yes boss that is what we are going to do and this is in fact what has happened
today at 143 million we now have the fewest manufacturing jobs in this country since the 1950s and these manufacturing jobs are the jobs that pay workers a living wage with good benefits
what is going on in our economy today and what is destroying the middle class is that we are losing good paying jobs in manufacturing and information technology and we are replacing those jobs with low paying service industry jobs that provide low wages and minimal benefits
let me say very clearly that if we do not turn this trend around including totally rethinking our trade policies our kids for the first time in the modern history of the united states of america will have a lower standard of living than we do
mr speaker in america today the middle class is shrinking poverty is increasing and the gap between the rich and the poor is growing wide
in 2003 the last study done by the irs showed that 99 percent of americans had an income which did not keep pace with inflation
i am pleased my friend and ranking member of the trade subcommittee mr cardin xz4000640 as well as mr rangel has joined me in supporting this agreement
it is tremendously important that our trade agenda remain on track and that we seek bipartisan support in accomplishing this goal
this agreement takes a key step in moving towards this goal
political and economic progress continue to take shape in the middle east
the office of the united states trade representative has negotiated an agreement that in my view will serve as a model for the region
it will allow for immediate dutyfree access for united states agricultural exports in 98 percent of the agricultural categories with a few remaining categories phased out over the next 10 years in addition the commitments to this agreement relating to services are the strongest in any united states free trade agreement to date
in addition to these actions by bahrain i am also pleased with the commitment that the us trade representative made to me during the committee s consideration of this agreement to report annually on the status of the arab league boycott and efforts to dismantle it in bahrain and all other countries where it has been applied
mr speaker i submit for printing in the record a letter from bahrain s finance minister to ambassador portman relating to this issue
i look forward to meeting with you soon to discuss our mutual interest in strengthening trade relations between the kingdom of bahrain and the united states
following a decision of the arab league in 1963 and prior to bahrain s independence the bahrain government issued law no
in 1994 the kingdom of bahrain eliminated all aspects of secondary and tertiary boycotts which extended to businesses which had relations with israeli companies and businesses
in the hope of advancing peace and regional cooperation the kingdom of bahrain recognizes the need to dismantle the primary boycott of israel and is beginning efforts to achieve that goal
bahrain has no restrictions whatsoever on american companies trading with bahrain or doing business in bahrain regardless of its ownership or relations with israeli companies
finally it is bahrain s sincerest hope that our free trade agreement with the united states will enhance efforts to achieve a real and lasting peace in the middle east
yours sincerely ahmed bin mohammed al khalifa mr speaker the united states needs allies in the middle east
bahrain has stepped up to the plate in so many ways
as the home of our united states navy s 5th fleet as a key ally in the war on terror and by promoting an open and transparent market that will benefit our overall bilateral relationship
open and free trade with bahrain will prove beneficial both in the short run and especially over time
as cochairs of the usbahrain congressional caucus they educated and provided key information to members and staff in anticipation of this floor vote
we must ensure that we support our allies in the middle east
mr speaker i yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from wisconsin mr ryan xz4003511 who i referred to in my opening remarks a member of the ways and means committee
mr speaker the gentleman from california mr stark xz4003870 mentioned that we were trying to reward our friends in some way
and we hear from the gentleman who just left the well about cafta and going back and rehashing cafta talking about votes in the middle of the night
there is nothing in the world wrong with that and we should do that
i would also like to point out when he was talking about votes in the middle of the night it is now 3 40 eastern standard time the sun is shining brightly and it is a beautiful day
in quick response to the gentleman from vermont our economy is growing jobs at the rate of about 200 000 a month
the economy is strong in the united states
it is lower than it was in any of the previous decades
we can not be protectionists and retain the strong economy that we have in a world that is going free trade
and if we are going to compete in the global economy we need to move towards free trade and we need to be careful in negotiating these agreements one after the other
mr speaker i want to add another provision there that over the last 3 years hourly wages have increased in the united states by 8 percent
when the history of the middle east is written i think the historians will view this trade bill as an important stepping stone towards the development and imposition of democracies and stability in that part of the world which is very much in our best interest
bahrain has been a great ally through many many years of troubling times and times when it was not necessarily easy to be friends with the united states if you are in the middle east and if you are an arab country
this is an important ally in which we are going to have a free trade agreement
this has been drawn and approved in a bipartisan way
congress can not operate without staff and i would like to thank them for what they have done in putting this agreement together
if we are rewarding an ally for helping us in iraq where i understand there are no bahranian troops but we have got a navy base
why do we not throw these guys in
i think we have got a big base in cuba where we are torturing prisoners so why not toss them in if that is the reason for going into this free trade agreement
until the core international labor organizations standards and strong environmental protections are included in the text of the agreement we should all vote against these free trade agreements
but i think recent experience in the war in torture and other instances have shown us that those assertions are subject to question by reasonable people
it does nothing to assure us that we will have environmental safety in bahrain should they god help us ever run out of oil
look at the footage when our delegation was in china and the hands that went in front of the cameras as china prohibits free and open press coverage of what goes on there
mr speaker i yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from ohio mr brown xz4000501 a colleague nominated for the nobel prize in literature for his best selling book the myth of free trade also an author who understands that the king of bahrain was not elected
and if my good friend from wisconsin had suggested that we could take our troops out of iraq immediately and substitute this cockamamie free trade agreement i would join with him in that but i am not sure that that is what he thought
he is right bahrain is a flea on the elephant when it comes to the difference that it will make in economic impact to the united states
but if we really wanted to help in the middle east maybe we would have sold parts for c130s to iran and saved 100 people from dying because of our embargo on selling aircraft parts to a country that could not maintain safe aircraft because the united states refused to deal with them
maybe we ought to question whether this vote is really whether you trust the administration an administration that many people think lied to us about getting us into war in iraq in the first place
i think that the real issue is if we do not get it in writing if we do not have enforceable rules can we trust the administration or will the administration continue to sell out to the pharmaceutical industry which will harm the people of bahrain in repayment for campaign contributions
mr speaker it is with some hesitation that i rise in support of the usbahrain free trade agreement or fta
while i am disappointed that the saudi arabian government refused to take the same action in the process of its accession to the worid trade organization i am hopeful that future trade agreements will be an effective mechanism to make this unfair and illegal discrimination a relic of the past
in addition bahrain has taken significant steps to adopt laws that reflect the five core standards of the international labor organization and the ustr has agreed to periodically review bahraini compliance with these laws
labor laws should be enforceable in every fta
while the issue should have been dealt with inside of the agreement rather than in a side letter the bahrain fta highlights the missed opportunities on labor protections in our trade agreements with chile singapore and central america
provisions such as these which have been included in the intellectual property chapter of a number of recent agreements are a serious mistake
they undermine the doha declaration which was adopted to make it easier for countries to respond in the event of a public health crisis
they do not reflect the careful balance in us law between the protection of innovation and access to affordable medicine
health care in bahrain is delivered through a system of public hospitals and clinics that are available for free to bahraini citizens and accessible to foreign residents for a nominal fee
in contrast colombia ecuador peru and bolivia have a combined population of nearly 100 million and more than 200 000 patients suffering from hivaids
health care coverage in these countries is available to few and many live in extreme poverty
yet the ustr is adamantly pursuing a one size fits all approach that would require the andean nations to adopt the same pharmaceutical protections adopted in bahrain
the damage in bahrain may be limited but the consequences elsewhere may be severe
mr speaker i rise in support of the rule and the underlying bill the usbahrain free trade agreement implementation act
through cooperation democrats working alongside republicans on the ways and means committee who then coordinated with the administration we have before us a strong trade package that will open markets advance free trade and cement america s ties to a strategically important ally in the middle east
it is my hope that in the future these worker protections will be incorporated into the core of trade agreements rather than through side agreements
the united states leadership on trade is being tested here in congress and in geneva
i hope that this agreement receives broad support and that july s contentious and meanspirited cafta debate is the low point only to be seen in the rearview mirror
because in the long term the only way for america to continue to lead the world forward on trade is for us to work across the aisle here in the house
i urge my colleagues to allow today s debate to serve as a first step toward reviving the bipartisan consensus on trade policy that has served this congress so well in the past
those with incomes above 1 million one in 500 households will get 53 percent of the cuts an average of 38 000 per year
tax cuts to millionaires have dropped revenues from 209 percent of the gdp in 2000 to just 163 percent while spending has increased 14 percent
mr speaker since i first came to congress i made it a priority to restore sales tax deductibility for my constituents in washington state
accordingly i applaud both the democrats and the republicans for including in their packages a 1year extension
nevertheless i am concerned at a time of war in the aftermath of this country s most devastating natural disaster how we can in good conscience support a tax bill that will add at least 20 billion to our national debt to provide a tax break that goes predominantly to the wealthy and by that i mean the capital gains and dividend tax cut
i have to say i just had five town halls in my district the american people do get it
you have not chosen to put the amt fix in your bill
the difference is this when republicans talk about choices the choices they are talking about is whether the most wealthy people in this country will choose to take their earnings or winnings from capital gains or dividends
the poor people in this country have to choose between heating their houses and providing food for their children
understandably i heard how worried they are about skyrocketing energy prices our lack of progress in iraq rising health care costs and the recently passed budget cuts that predominately hurt the poor
in my home state of wisconsin the wealthiest 1 percent of taxpayers those with an average income of more than 13 million would receive 43 percent of the tax benefits or an average tax cut of 18 523 in 2009 and 2010 combined
let us be clear these 50 billion in budget cuts were made solely to pay for these tax cuts for the wealthiest americans
in wisconsin 91 000 children lack health insurance up over 7 in just the last year
yet today this congress again turns a deaf ear to those concerns not to reduce the deficit not to pay for the war in iraq not to help the hurricane and tornado victims of 2005 but simply to satisfy those whose greed has no bounds
mr speaker hr 4297 is a sad indication of who house republicans are fighting for in this congress
mr speaker this has been an interesting debate as it always seems like it is these days in this house
in 2003 i actually thought we did some very good things with the tax cuts we implemented and i thought we did them for families back home in all of our districts
now i think linda jones the owner of area rentals back in westminster colorado will be delighted to understand that she is a member of a special interest and must surely be rich by definition because she got a tax break
what she did with that was in 2003 she used 57 000 of the allowable expensing limits to purchase some additional equipment that she rents in her store
and because she saved a little over 7 300 in tax expense and that came the same year she got a 30 percent increase in her employees health care costs she was able to maintain coverage for health care for her employees
the very next year she used an additional 64 000 of the expensing allowance to purchase even more equipment to expand her store keep jobs and in fact increase jobs
ron lautzenheiser must be among the rich and the special interests too except he runs a big old tire center back in fort collins
when he did his calculations wanting to expand the increase in expensing limits contained in section 179 allowed him to figure out how to do that
he added two new stores and went from one big old tire center employing but a handful of people to now employing 50 people in three stores
if we recall the words of a famous president this country had a man of heroic proportions harry truman he said the buck stops here and unfortunately we are forgetting the words of harry truman because today it seems like the mantra of the leadership in this house of representatives is the buck stops with your children or perhaps your grandchildren because we are in a portion of our nation s history where we have run up national deficits bigger than we have ever seen in our life
we run up deficits in 1 year that it would have taken 200 years of presidents to run up in the history of this nation
mr speaker in a time of disasters rita katrina on and on in a time of massive deficits and in a time of war it is irresponsible to run up the nation s debt
it is irresponsible to then give money to run up this debt and give it to the wealthiest americans in this nation
mr speaker it is irresponsible to put debt on top of massive debt when we know at the end of the horizon there is still more debt that will come in the years to come 27 000 is what each and every man woman and child in this country owes as a result of our nation s debt
it is irresponsible mr speaker to take social security surplus money which the president said back in 2001 he could protect and never touch as he moved forward with these tax cuts
in essence we are gifting the social security surplus moneys contributed by working americans we are gifting that to the wealthiest americans in this country through these tax cuts
mr speaker it is irresponsible to move forward with these tax cuts at the same time that we are telling american families mostly middle class that rely on student loans so they can send their young men and women to college their young daughters and sons are going to have to pay 5 000 more a year in their student loans so we can take care of the 1 percent wealthiest americans in this nation in these bills
it is irresponsible mr speaker to move forward in that way
it is irresponsible to take 5 billion out of a child support system that says to deadbeat dads that we are going to take money from them we need to enforce that to take 5 billion make it into cuts and therefore make it more impossible for us to get those deadbeat dads to help the mothers who are taking care of their sons and daughters in this country
mr speaker it is responsible when we have a democratic substitute as mr rangel xz4003330 has that says we are going to cut taxes but in a targeted way for the middle class in a responsible way by making sure we pay for it so we do not increase the size of the deficit
she is going to talk with us about her time on the road this week with the president as the president visited in her area in north carolina and she had the opportunity to not only talk tax reforms with the president but to listen to her constituents in north carolina and to hear what was on their mind as they enjoyed that visit and as they had prepared for that visit
mr speaker i thank the gentlewoman from north carolina and i thank her for taking the time this week to look at how workers continue educating themselves and preparing and participating in a changing economy a changing job market
the gentlewoman from north carolina spent her time in education
ms foxx xz4006430 came to us after working at postsecondary education and looking for avenues to best encourage individuals to become lifelong learners to continue improving and honing those skills so that they were productive in the job market and i thank her for her leadership
i thank her for the time spent with the president and with the north carolinians this weekend as they were able to showcase their facility and showcase what they are doing to be a leader in being competitive in a global economy
we know that federal tax revenues increased in fiscal year 2005 by 274 billion
now this is the reason that we are seeing such a change in what the deficit is
what happens with small business when there is more money left at the end of the month and they can get in there and say you know we want to do some things
reinvestment in the business that you own
that is men and women that believe in what they are doing
if the gentleman will yield let us talk about some of these provisions that are in the bill that is going to be before us
because we do not want the democrat tax increase to take place and that is why the leadership in this house is working to be certain that we pass our tax relief extension reconciliation act
i think they would like to see some of the provisions that are in here
the gentleman from texas and i have worked long and hard on one provision which is in here which is continued deductibility of state and local sales taxes from your federal income tax filing
in my state of tennessee that is something that is mighty important because we are one of those great states that does not have a state income tax
we have fought hard in tennessee to be sure that we stay incometax free and we are
but that sales tax deductibility is something we encourage everyone in this body everyone who is in a state that does not have a state income tax to support this legislation tomorrow because it is so important to the individuals in our states
it is estimated that in tennessee this is worth about 1 billion a year to the state of tennessee
if the gentleman will yield yes for those of us in nonincome tax states that means that you are voting to take that deduction away from them
extending that deduction for our nation s teachers is included in this bill
the abovetheline deduction for higher education expenses as i was saying earlier the research and development tax credit now that is something that is so important to our companies in this country
when you talk about the bioshield projects biotech developments in agricultural products in pharmaceuticals when you talk about technology and the needs that we have there for our nation s first responders for our military all of that comes in research and development
when you talk about looking at what businesses are investing in as they are working our small business manufacturers whose output is up for the first time in a couple of decades they are investing in this research and development to build a better mousetrap
at this time of year coming in and voting a tax increase voting a tax increase on our nation s small businesses voting a tax increase on our nation s families
we know that the rate of economic growth in this nation the jobs growth has shown that the tax reforms that have been passed work and they yield results
another provision that is included in this bill is the welfaretowork tax credit
as the gentleman from texas was saying individuals who may not have had a job are able to get a job because of the growth we are seeing in the small business sector
the 15year depreciation period for restaurants and for leasehold improvements for that industry that is included in this bill
i know in so many of my towns in the 7th congressional district in tennessee this is very important to these small businesses
they would be voting against that for all of our constituents in tennessee and texas and washington state and wyoming and other states across the nation that enjoy that sales tax deductibility
the gentleman from georgia is exactly right that is something that is included in this bill the provisions for our nation s teachers
mr speaker there are over 91 million americans who own shares of stock in companies in this country 91 million americans who have invested in that capital creation process invested in these companies
what we are seeing is that 51 percent of our taxpaying senior citizens are claiming dividend income and 47 percent of total dividend income earned in america is by senior citizens
it is the tax relief extension reconciliation act and it is called the tax relief extension because these are reliefs that were passed in 2003
we are seeing regularly that there is jobs creation that is taking place in our communities
i love it when i am out in my community and i know the gentleman from texas has the same experience and you are driving down the street and all of a sudden you see an entire group of new stores that are going in
there is so much of that happening in this nation s small businesses
as people have seen their rate of taxation reduced they have had a little bit more income left with those businesses that they can go back in and reinvest in those businesses or gather that capital together to start that business or start that small manufacturing plant
talking about your district and the way this bill tomorrow will affect your district in this bill hr 4297 tomorrow there will be a technical correction in there that affects this nation s songwriters which of course so many of them live in my district and i do believe that they are definitely some of the most creative people and such an important part of our creative community
and a correction that we will make tomorrow will affect so many of those songwriters that are in memphis and nashville and down in austin and in those areas because it will allow those catalogs to be sold and those individuals to pay a capital gains tax like other small business owners there again leaving more money and more of that nest egg for them as they retire and as they are seniors and allowing them to look at how they do things better how they grow those small businesses
in october home sales reached 71 units in october
and the thing that is so interesting is that is just off the historic high of home sales which was in june of this year when there were 73 units that were built or were sold
so whether it is new homes being built whether it is existing homes the home sales how amazing that we are seeing home sales reaching such high numbers in both the new construction and the existing home sales category
we saw that 41 percent growth with the quarter that ended in september of 2005
we did not bury our heads in the sand when that happened
mr speaker i encourage all members of this body to join us in supporting hr 4297 tomorrow
and this is the reason why my state tennessee has seen more than 250 million in taxpayer savings a year from the sales tax deduction we passed in 2004
mr speaker i do not know how many different ways we are going to have to talk about this economy and the fact that it is booming jobs creation home sales up productivity soaring but some never let facts get in the way of their political agenda
one important thing the federal reserve noted since we passed these tax relief measures in 2003 american households have increased their nest eggs their retirement security their savings by 105 trillion 105 trillion net worth development by american households
as chairman of the congressional songwriters caucus we worked to correct an inequity in the tax code that penalizes them when they sell their life s work
mr speaker i am in opposition to the substitute because i am for the underlying bill and i am for the things it has done for our economy
one of the great changes that this bill showed in what happens in the federal government is a belief that people are better at solving economic problems than government is
when the tax structure that we are voting today to extend was put in place the determination was made that we were in a difficult economic time and the way to get out of that difficult economic time was to trust the people not to come up with some big complicated government program but to trust the people to let them keep more of their money to put some minor incentives in the tax code to do whatever they wanted to do sooner rather than later but no incentive in the tax code to do a specific thing
just because income to the federal government increased last year at a rate three times the projection the highest increase in federal government ever without a tax increase how did that happen
it happened because more people had jobs that 100 billion that came in in the fiscal year that ended september 30 that we did not anticipate did not come i was listening to the debate earlier and so much of the debate earlier was about wealthy americans
all americans benefit from this in their own way
in the reduction in the capital gains rate one out of five people that take advantage and benefit from the capital gains rate has an income below 50 000
the dividend tax six times as many companies are paying dividends to people that own the company today as were paying dividends in just 2003 when we made that change
i appreciate my colleague from michigan his leadership in helping boost our economy extend this tax relief
the substitute takes a step backward in how we treat our soldiers and how we treat our families small businesses that are affected by the alternative minimum tax compared to legislation that this house passed just yesterday we treated soldiers better by providing them immediate cash refunds on their tax treatment
i do not want to step back from that today in the substitute
and the original bill provides three provisions that are really helpful for a lot of families in this country
it extends for 1 year the sales tax deduction which provides every family in the country a choice to deduct either their state and local income taxes or their state and local sales taxes
these are the usually small amounts of money that go to people many seniors who have invested in a company and these are the dividends that help ease their retirement
what we did under this legislation is we said to the companies prove that you have a solid profitandloss statement you have real assets show us the money pay it out in dividends we will lower the cost lower the taxes on those dividends
since we created this tax legislation now fortune 500 companies one out of four that did not provide dividends in the past are now providing real money to real people who have invested in them
in other words we have changed the culture from what is good this quarter and what is good for my stock price to what is the best long term real growth solid businesses in america
we need businesses that are in it for the long term that pay cash to real people that when my mom or your mom or some other senior invests they know they are going to get a chance for a solid dividend that they can actually keep because they invested
i support keeping in dividend relief both for our seniors and our investors and to keep wall street honest
i just want to point out to the members that yesterday the house passed the gulf opportunities zone act 4154 which dealt with many items to help gulf coast area residents who had been hurt by the hurricane incentives to help rebuild housing investment to provide depreciation and expensing for small businesses bonding authority so that taxexempt bond authority could help rebuild devastated infrastructure in the hurricane zone
much of the relief in this bill is already in current law and will expire next month
the tax relief in this bill goes directly to the issues of poverty and education that the gentleman from new york mentioned
employers will be eligible for incentives for hiring lowincome americans transitioning from welfare to work getting on that first rung of the economic ladder and states and local governments will continue to be able to qualify for tax credit bonds to help repair schools purchase school equipment and train teachers in economically distressed areas
it is a valuable tool in promoting us businesses to innovate
when i hear about distressed manufacturers in michigan one of the main issues they are competing on is to innovate and find the newest technology to remain competitive in a global economy
the manufacturing sector in the united states is the highest user of the research and development tax credit
michigan for example is one of the top 10 states in reported research and development activity with more than 1 300 companies performing research and development in that state
it helps small and lowincome businesses and working families as well as helps our manufacturers to rebound and also our hightech community to stay competitive in a global economy
in our legislation we did not choose to raise taxes as the gentleman s substitute does to the tune of 40 billion
when i hear so many on the other side of the aisle talk about highincome earners i remind members that many small businesses in the united states file as individuals
according to the treasury department 80 percent of the people affected by the 40 billion tax increase in their substitute are small and entrepreneurial businesses
that is the engine of job creation in america and that is why our economy has recovered because we have helped those small businesses
mr speaker and the 40 billion in taxes in the democrat substitute certainly will not give many americans a break
mr speaker the current rate structure of the amt was created by the democrats in 1993 with no republicans supporting the bill
actually in a few minutes we will have a vote on two tax bills and we have heard a lot of debate this afternoon about the two approaches the bill takes and i certainly appreciate my friends on the other side for recognizing the need for tax relief
in fact in many important ways these bills are very similar
twentytwo provisions in our underlying bill were taken by my friends on the other side and put into their bill
what the democrat substitute does not include is the extension of a saver s credit for lowincome families the expensing for small businesses so small entrepreneurs can grow their companies buy the equipment increase their businesses and hire more people cleaning up brownfields sites so we can continue economic development in so many small towns and communities in our nation as well as helping our domestic manufacturers finance those large equipment sales overseas so we can export more
that tax provision that benefit has helped 24 million american families in this country
forty billion dollars in tax increases
i urge a vote against the substitute and in favor of the underlying bill
mr speaker i rise in opposition to the substitute and in favor of the underlying bill
i want to talk about some of the allegations that have been brought up in this debate
one is the fact that perhaps by continuing the tax policies or extending the reduction in tax rate especially in the area of tax dividends and capital gains tax that somehow we are aggravating the deficit
i think that the evidence is pretty conclusive that we have seen a tremendous stimulus and tremendous growth in revenues because of this tax policy
if i could quote the chairman of the federal reserve board back in june of this year he said i do think that there are parts of the existing recent tax changes especially with respect to eliminating part of the double taxation of dividends which i think enhances economic growth enhances the tax base and therefore tax revenues and that it is good economic policy the second point that i think is being made in favor of the substitute and opposing the underlying bill is saying that the extension of the reduction in tax rates on cap gains and dividends somehow is a tax cut for the rich
and in fact our own joint committee on taxation on the amt extension s impact compares the two the one that we acted on yesterday and the one today
and per the most recent irs data 96 percent of taxpayers hit by the amt in 2003 had adjusted gross incomes in excess of 100 000
the rangel substitute deals with other inequities in the tax code correcting them and getting them done right
we have huge deficits and where do you think we get our money in order to pay the bills
money is coming not from foreign investors or us investors it is coming primarily from foreignowned banks who are buying our currency not because it is a good investment they are buying it in order to have a favorable exchange rate with the us dollar so that they can send more products here into the united states
the concord coalition a nonpartisan group that is only interested in trying to deal with the national debt said that tax cuts need at a minimum to be offset that we should not add to the deficit through the tax bills
it not only provides relief in the tax code that we need to provide for the taxpayers of this country it does not burden this nation and the future generations
our deficit hurts growth in this country
the rangel substitute is sensitive to the need for us to make sure that we are on the right glide path to create jobs in our economy
we want to provide tax relief but we should do it in a way that does not burden our children and grandchildren
mr speaker imagine if we could bring a piece of legislation to the floor of this house that would over the next 30month period of time result in benefits that every american could share in
increase tax receipts by 274 billion over a 12month period of time a 15 percent increase the largest in 25 years
mr speaker it would be hard to imagine that we would not all support that but i guess it is not hard to imagine given the conversation here today but that is exactly what this body did when we passed tax relief in 2003
mr speaker i rise day in opposition to hr 4297 the tax relief extension reconciliation act
the tax cuts contained in hr 4297 overwhelmingly benefit affluent investors in the wake of the house cutting programs for the poor by 50 billion in the name of deficit reduction
we continue to spend over 6 billion per month in iraq and cut taxes while asking the least well off to pay for it
we must take stock and look at the reality of our fiscal situation deficits are rising with no end in sight while the poor the sick and the elderly pay the price
i believe tax cuts can be part of a reasonable approach to the federal budget but that we have reached a point with our deficit and debt where we must exercise extreme caution in using them
as robert bixby of the nonpartisan concord coalition was quoted in today s washington post if they republicans want to cut taxes fine but they are going to have to cut spending by at least that much to help the deficit and clearly they are not willing to do that
they republicans have to start looking reality in the face the 56 trillion surplus that existed in 2000 has been squandered
the republican tax cut bill is bad policy and i urge my colleagues to join me in voting no on hr 4297
let us just look at one of the elements of the not raising taxes today it would be let the tax cuts in dividends on stocks
in fact their tax cuts average now that is not even talking about the dividend tax
this bill will extend the cut in dividend taxes
now they have a newfound concern about the sea of red ink they have created the 60 percent increase in our debt in the last 5 years
in the morning that cut things like student financial aid medicaid health care to poor people dumping that burden on the states foster care longterm care the school lunch program
the largest projected surpluses turned into the largest projected deficits with 42 trillion more debt in 2008
the commitment to any fiscal discipline is in full retreat
under this bill the few individuals making over 1 million per year are rewarded on the average with over 50 000 in tax breaks
our children will pick up the tab in the form of endless national debt and with cuts to child care cuts to assistance to abused and neglected children cuts to child support enforcement and cuts to student financial assistance
the taxwriting body in this chamber has truly become the committee on greedy ways and shifty means and this will be remembered as the cutandrun congress cutting taxes greatly for the few while running trilliondollar deficits for the rest of us
mr speaker i rise in strong support of this rule and i thank and congratulate my great friend from florida such a hardworking member of the rules committee and i thank all those involved in this effort which i hope at the end of the day will be bipartisan
and mr speaker 30 percent 30 percent of the members of the investor class earn less than i will tell you that if you look at the arguments that were made and i listened to my good friend from rochester ms slaughter in her opening statement in which she talked about investing in all these important things of course we all want to invest in the future
but she said do not invest in the rich
but i met with a number of people in new zealand and i raised with them the prospect of establishing a capital gains
they said that they did a study in new zealand and found that the mere establishment of a capital gains tax would be devastating to the economy of new zealand
mr speaker we know as we look at the arguments that were provided in 2001 2002 2003 that our wonderful colleagues on the other side of the aisle regularly said the following things number one if you put into place these tax cuts the economy is going to head straight into the tank
and i listened to my friend from oregon go through the herbert hoover argument and i thought we had sort of beaten that one back in the 2004 campaign when in the last 3 years we have seen the creation of 4 12 million jobs under the payroll survey guideline and 5 million jobs under the household survey guideline
we in fact have had a reduction of 94 billion in the deficit simply because of economic growth simply because of the enhanced flow of revenues to come into the federal treasury
now obviously we are not going to see probably the best improvement in the deficit number next year because of hurricane katrina and other costs that we have faced and we are doing everything we can so many of us to try to rein in mandatory spending with the reconciliation process we have gone through and to try to do what we can on both discretionary as well as mandatory as i said
but the fact of the matter is mr speaker the single most important thing that we can do to deal with the challenges of investing in all those things that ms slaughter xz4003780 mentioned is to make sure that the economy continues to grow
so if you believe in bringing unemployment down even further if you believe in seeing the already record level of minority home ownership go even higher if you believe in enhanced productivity and incentives for that it is absolutely essential that this rule and this legislation be passed
so that is why we should have democrats join with republicans in doing the right thing here
mr speaker i rise in strong support of this very modest tax relief proposal and the rule that brings it to the floor and especially in support of the deduction for state and local sales taxes which is so very important to my home state of tennessee and many millions of people throughout this nation
every dollar we can keep in the private sector helps to create jobs and lower prices
it contains breaks for our veterans and those who have been and are in combat at this time
mr speaker i rise today in strong opposition to this republican plan for the wealthiest americans
that is what they refer to as new math in america
with all the problems facing middleclass americans soaring energy costs coupled on top of skyrocketing health care costs educational expenses and flat incomes 5 years in a row what is the solution offered by this republican congress
it is time for a change in new priorities rather than that same old tired failed policies that got america to where it is today
and what do they do in return
since 2003 when much of the current tax policies were enacted our gdp has seen its fastest growth in 20 years averaging a robust 44 percent growth per quarter
this growth mr speaker is attributable in part to reduced rates on capital gains and dividends
i would like to highlight who in the real world is receiving these reduced rates and therefore whose taxes we will be raising if we fail to extend these existing policies
mr speaker 54 percent of those families receiving dividend income had incomes of less than 75 000 and they received an average of 1 400 in dividends
today families with incomes under 100 000 have more than 20 billion in dividend income
in 2005 an estimated 103 million families in the 10 and 15 percent tax brackets will save on their taxes because of the existing tax policies
not only would the lapse of the reduced rates impose a tax increase it would particularly discourage equity ownership among working families among whom we have seen a 91 percent increase in stock ownership
to turn back the clock on our tax policies that have benefited american workers and encourage more american workers to own a stake in their future is simply the wrong thing to do
mr speaker i rise in strong opposition to this latest wasteful republican tax bill and in strong support of the rangel substitute
i am tremendously proud that in my first term in the us house congress and the white house worked together in a bipartisan manner to balance the budget for the first time in a generation
that responsible budget helped usher in a period of robust broadbased economic growth and produced record budget surpluses
unfortunately the current white house and republican leaders in congress replaced that budget discipline with record deficits exploding national debt and unbalanced budgets in perpetuity
furthermore hr 4297 the tax reconciliation bill raises the taxes of nearly 17 million middle class families in america by leaving out a provision to extend the higher amt exemptions that expire in a few weeks
in contrast the rangel substitute would exempt from amt increases every family with taxable income under 200 000 per year
it includes 42 billion in tax cuts over five years targeted to spur economic growth through the research and development tax credit small business expensing and other initiatives
finally the rangel bill keeps our word to the families of our soldiers in iraq and afghanistan by maintaining their eligibility for the earned income tax credit
three is basically a reflection of what our inflation rate is at four for the percentage of which our economy is growing on an annual basis and five for unemployment rate that exists in this country with historic lows
so whether you are a small business owner in staten island or a small business owner in san francisco you are able to put more people to work and we watch our economy grow and grow and grow
one is if you are sitting at home for example and you are waiting for your retirement and in several years when your nest egg is about a half a million dollars which is not that much money anymore for some folks i know living across the country if the democratic substitute prevails you are looking at basically sending another check for 25 000 to the federal government
in addition if you happen to be receiving dividends and i know many people across the country in socalled investor class receive dividends on a regular basis if the democratic substitute prevails you will be paying upwards of 20 percent more in taxes to the federal government
not to mention the fact that the amt which penalizes upwards of 80 percent of the people i know who filed in staten island and brooklyn are getting punished by the amt the democratic substitute does not adequately address what the house passed yesterday
in conclusion if we are for a progrowth economy if we are for bringing the unemployment rate down even further if we are watching for our economy to grow even greater if we are basically placing our faith in the american people and the entrepreneurs and the small business owners across country let us not punish them with higher capital gains rates and dividend rates
in fact today s reconciliation package includes extensions of tax incentives that provide work for many lowincome americans such as the welfare to work tax credit and the work opportunity tax credit that encourages businesses to hire and pay people and families on public assistance highrisk youths qualified veterans and people who receive food stamps
no ifs ands or buts those who vote against this bill are voting in front of the american people to raise taxes
in conclusion i would like to encourage my colleagues to support this rule and the underlying tax relief extension package for the sake of economic growth and for the sake of the american taxpayer
mr speaker i rise in support of hr 4297 because this legislation will ensure that our economy will continue to expand
if you would listen to those on the other side of the aisle you would think that we are in a shrinking economy
however since the capital gains and dividend taxes were reduced in 2003 we have seen ten straight quarters of what is it
i spoke recently with an entrepreneur group back home women who started businesses in their homes
preventing a tax increase on these entrepreneurs who one by one are creating new jobs in our economy
in the 10 quarters prior to the passage of this legislation we averaged just 12 percent of growth never exceeded 29
in the 10 quarters since we have averaged 33 percent of growth and have averaged over 4 percent
in a district like mine where we need new jobs and i know some members on the other side of the aisle apparently have more jobs than they need we need jobs
we have seen in fact unemployment go from 61 percent down over 1 point to 5 percent
now if anybody at the end of august and the beginning of september expected that we would see 215 000 jobs created in the united states in the last month i do not think you are telling me the truth
mr speaker i rise in opposition to the democrat substitute
it does not allow a provision that provides tax benefits to those who clean up brownfield sites to encourage new job creation in some of our older towns
mr speaker i rise in strong support of the legislation precisely because of the challenges outlined by my friend from mississippi
as my friend from mississippi knows brother rex yancey the pastor of first baptist church in pascagoula is my wife s uncle
just as brother rex and everyone in mississippi and on the gulf coast are facing challenges we need to work together to make sure the climate of economic opportunity exists for all
it does this house no service to come to this well no matter the challenges confronted and try to claim either class warfare or crass political opportunism in a quid pro quo
as my friend from mississippi knows the most philanthropic state in the union where people step up to help neighbors in need that example does not fall on deaf ears
there may be some who always want to fill in the blank as follows tax breaks for the blank tax breaks for the rich
and not only has there been some 69 billion in immediate hurricane relief given by this congress and this government to the storm victims but the promise of future help and economic prosperity as the people of the gulf coast get back on their feet
mr speaker i certainly thank the gentlewoman for yielding and certainly appreciate her leadership in this body on helping promote policies that promote economic growth in jobs and being a true leader in trying to help reform government programs that too often take away from family programs because they are wasteful they are duplicative they are inefficient there is no accountability
she is one of the true leaders in congress on these issues
yet this republican congress has been bold in enacting new energy legislation to help address that
families still have challenges in the high cost of health care but this republican congress is doing things to help bring down the costs particularly for small businesses and to make it easier to see a doctor in america as opposed to sue a doctor in america
but although we still face a number of challenges as we have just have come away from our great thanksgiving holiday we need to remember the things that we need to give thanks for and all the good things that are happening in america
the american people do not realize or perhaps not enough of them realize that in washington dc spending is forever and tax relief is temporary
i hold in my hand here the latest report from the us treasury
it starts in east dallas and goes through great communities like mesquite
it takes in rural east texas which is a wonderful place to live and raise a family but sometimes a tough place to make a living
i went to visit a business small business called jacksonville industries in my congressional district located in jacksonville tx
and that is one small business in one rural part of texas but that is happening all over the nation
think about this one example in jacksonville industries
that is five americans who are putting a roof over their family s head and start putting money in the college fund
again you can not have the benefits of capitalism and job creation without that capital in the first place
since i was quite young i have held a number of jobs in my life
frankly my first job in life was cleaning out chicken houses
later i bussed tables at the holiday inn in college station texas
i used to load windows at a window factory in bryan texas
i was an officer in two different corporations
and guess what in all of the jobs i have had no poor person ever hired me
it was somebody who had managed to amass some capital and he or she went out and risked that capital in a business enterprise that succeeded and because of that i got a job
mr speaker over half of americans are invested in the stock market
those are the 401 k plans to help them in their retirement years
that is over half of americans in just this one provision
as i said earlier this evening how proud i am that i have the honor of representing the fifth congressional district in texas
he has been in business for 8 years
his company specializes in the leasing and purchasing of right of ways for different corporate clients
but thanks to the tax relief package they got jobs in a business that was growing
there is a gentleman in my congressional district named eddie alexander
but thanks to the boom in the economy brought about by tax relief and we have not even talked about the fact that we have the highest rate of homeownership in the history of america and each and every one of those homes needs electricity since the economic growth package with tax relief was passed he went out and hired two fulltime employees
he hired a gentleman by the name of jarad who was unemployed and he hired a gentleman by the name of john who was also unemployed in henderson county texas
again over 4 million new jobs created in this economy since we passed tax relief
i talked earlier about the fact that we are enjoying the highest rate of homeownership in the history of the united states of america
and one of those gentleman is in my congressional district back in texas a gentleman by the name of gil travers of travers and company
four million new jobs in the future that have been created
compassion is not measured by the number of welfare checks that are printed in washington
real disposable income for our working families is up since we passed the tax relief package in our economic growth legislation
and manufacturing which has faced many many challenges in recent years manufacturing production is continuing to expand
we have increases in productivity and the list goes on and on and on
mr speaker let me tell you about a few of the jobs from my east texas district that could be lost if the democrats succeed in their tax increase plan today
let me tell you about hugh dublin who owns east texas right of way in tennessee colony texas
he specializes in the landleasing business
they were unemployed but now they are able to start new careers in a growing business
eddie alexander owns triple s electric in henderson county texas
for the first 3 12 years he was in business it was just him and one parttime helper
they are a home building company in athens texas
mr speaker let me tell you just about a few of those jobs that could be lost in my east texas district if the democrats have their way in raising taxes
hugh dublin owns a small business called east texas right of way in my district
he specializes in the leasing of land
eddie alexander owns triple s electric in henderson texas an electrical contracting business
gil travers owns travers amp company a home building company in athens texas
in addition the bill before us includes a measure that i have long supported to facilitate greater small business growth
the section 17 extension in this bill will enable small businesses to write off new capital investment up to 100 000 per year spurring further economic growth and helping to generate new jobs
in 2003 alone 46 million small businesses used 441 billion of section 179 expensing
according to the national federation of independent businesses november report 61 percent of small business owners reported capital outlays over the past 6 months including new equipment and vehicle purchases furniture purchases existing facility expansion and improvement in new facility construction
small business expensing works and it helps drive job creation in areas like my own northern california congressional district
just before thanksgiving the republican majority cut investments in education american competitiveness and programs for the needy
i believe it is immoral to cut 50 billion from medicaid food stamps student loans child care payment enforcement and foster care in order to pay for a 56 billion tax cut for capital gains and dividends
i have supported tax cuts in the past and i have worked with members on both sides of the aisle to achieve them
with this package republicans knowingly and deliberately have removed the amt correction and thereby will increase the taxes on more than 17 million middleclass working families next year by failing to extend the higher exemptions for the alternative minimum tax amt that expire in several weeks
in 5 short years the republican party s failed economic policies have instigated 157 trillion in budget deficits and added 3 trillion to the national debt
and the comptroller general of the united states david walker recently stated anybody who says you re going to grow your way out of this problem deficits and debt would probably not pass math even the president s council of economic advisers admitted in 2003 although the economy grows in response to tax reductions it is unlikely to grow so much that lost tax revenue is completely recovered by the higher economic activity that is why we have 175 trillion in additional deficits in 5 years and 3 trillion of additional debt
so my republican friends can stop pretending that the tax cuts in this bill will somehow magically pay for themselves
you are suggesting cuts twice as large as you were prepared to cut in spending
mark twain is probably the most famous constituent from my district and i think it was his quote that said there are lies there are damn lies and there are statistics i would say probably folks that are back in my district are home from school today because we had snow
i do not know what the middle class is in los angeles or cleveland or new york city or baltimore or seattle but i think that at least in my congressional district if a family is making about 50 000 a year they probably think themselves to be middle class
government revenues have increased 10 percent a year since the reduction in the cost of capital
earlier we heard from the chairman of the democratic congressional campaign committee and in his usual acerbic way brought up the specter of politics
the chairman of the dccc talked about politics with his usual acerbic and yet what i find interesting as we get close to the conclusion of this debate there has been a very concerted effort by my friend from maryland to reach out to the business community in an effort to make some political gains in the 2006 election
and the underlying bill which in fact continues to reduce the cost of capital so are we going to deny enhanced expensing for farmers and manufacturers
an estimated forty percent of the tax cuts will go to families with incomes of 1 million or more and 84 percent of the major tax cuts in this bill will go to the richest 20 percent of families
in fact under this bill over 17 million middle class americans will face a tax increase next year from the alternative minimum tax the amt
they ca nt find any money for tax relief for those affected by hurricane katrina in the gulf coast
they could nt find the money because they are choosing to extend the dividend and capital gains tax cuts for the richest in our country
this is not how we take care of our own in texas and this is not how we do things in the united states
the republicans are launching an unabashed attack on the american way by ignoring the neediest in our country to give tax cuts to the richest
the priorities in this bill are misguided
congress should not be providing tax cuts for the rich in a time of war
in the end this tax bill will either exacerbate our already large federal deficits or will force even deeper cuts in critically important domestic programs
mr speaker because the republican tax bill raises the deficit 3 trillion and because of the valuable aspect of the substitute deductions for state and local retail taxes and other provisions for working americans i rise in support of the substitute and oppose the underlying bill
an estimated 40 percent of the tax cuts will go to families with incomes of 1 million or more and 84 percent of the major tax cuts in this bill will go to the richest 20 percent of families
in fact under this bill over 17 million middle class americans will face a tax increase next year from the alternative minimum tax the amt
they ca nt find any money for tax relief for those affected by hurricane katrina in the gulf coast
they could nt find the money because they are choosing to extend the dividend and capital gains tax cuts for the richest in our country
they also choose to pass the burden of paying for these tax cuts on to our children in the form of a huge deficit
this is not how we take care of our own in texas and this is not how we do things in the united states
the republicans are launching an unabashed attack on the american way by ignoring the neediest in our country to give tax cuts to the richest
the democrats have instead offered an amendment in the form of the substitute that is much more fiscally responsible and equitable
the priorities in the republican bill are misguided
in the end this tax bill will either exacerbate our already large federal deficits or will force even deeper cuts in critically important domestic programs
mr speaker i rise today in support of the tax relief extension act
unless congress acts individuals will pay higher taxes on their savings businesses will lose valuable incentives to provide research in the united states small businesses will lose the ability to expense new equipment essential to the support of new employees
according to the irs in my home state of connecticut there are 550 000 taxpayers who receive dividend income 153 000 of those have incomes below 30 000 a year
in 2008 lowincome taxpayers will pay zero taxes on dividend income
mr speaker we remain a world leader in patents and discoveries but other nations are closing in
advances in technology and innovation are what drive growth and ultimately create higher standards of living for all of us
we need to ask ourselves do we want the next major scientific breakthrough to happen in germany or china
do we want other countries to be the leaders in the patents for the next generation of technology
when we first adopted this provision we saw investment in equipment skyrocket go right straight up
lowering the cost of capital encourages small businesses to invest in machines trucks and other equipment and hire new people
mr speaker i am pleased to rise today in support of this bill and the resilient american economy
and keeping tax rates low so people have more of their hardearned money in their pockets is the right way to go
in texas we like to say no new taxes we finance our spending through a sales tax
in 2004 we made sales taxes deductible from federal taxes again but that deduction expires in just a few weeks
many companies in our districts will be able to use this new alternative simplified credit
if you work with me you could understand that with that 507 billion 12 571 089 people could have health care coverage 959 230 elementary school teachers could be paid 7 331 106 head start places for children who need a head start could go back to school 32 565 528 children could receive health care and more importantly we could build 6 514 new elementary schools in these united states
but instead we are going to extend taxes beyond this year when we are still at war in iraq and we are spending billions of dollars a day to give the iraqi children what we will not even give our children right here at home
the wealth in this country is being transferred upward and as wealth accelerates upward the quality of our democracy is deteriorating
we need to take stock and assessment of what these tax policies are doing to undermine people in this country of what these tax policies are doing to make it impossible for a middle class to survive of what these tax policies are ignoring in terms of trying to protect america s manufacturers
mr speaker today i rise in strong support of the rangel substitute to hr 4297 the tax reconciliation act and in opposition to the underlying bill
instead of stopping a tax increase for the middle class in 2006 republicans have chosen to keep taxes low for the wealthiest americans in 2009
what kind of priorities favor the wealthy in the future over working families today
without a change in fiscal policy future generations will be buried under a mountain of debt created by congress
in fact i am a cosponsor of a bill to make the research and development tax credit permanent as it keeps american companies competitive and provides a strong incentive for businesses to invest in the future and create jobs
i also support other provisions in this bill that help make college more affordable to millions of students and allow teachers to deduct outofpocket expenses
nearly half of these tax cuts will go directly into the pockets of the 1 in 500 taxpayers who earn more than 1 million per year
the contrast is stark those who earn less than 40 000 will see an average tax cut of 7 while those earning more than a million will save an average of 32 000 in taxes
in addition we will spend billions more in iraq and afghanistan as well as rebuilding the gulf coast in the wake of hurricanes katrina rita and wilma
the rangel substitute includes all the noncontroversial tax extensions i mentioned earlier and also contains three important provisions not found in hr 4297
first the substitute drops the capital gains and dividend tax cuts in order to fix the alternative minimum tax amt
in addition the substitute extends the taxfree status of combat pay
the rangel substitute will revive the economy relieve the tax burden on working families encourage companies to invest in the future and create jobs
i urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the rangel substitute and opposing the underlying bill
mr speaker i rise in support of the democratic alternative to hr 4297 tax relief extension reconciliation act that would provide real tax relief to working families and help the economy grow
the president s policy of stay the course is not working it s not working in our foreign policy domestic policy budget policy or tax policy
the democratic measure would also provide 42 billion in targeted tax cuts including deductions for state and local retail sales taxes deductions for college tuitions expenses a research and development tax credit a small business expensing tax credit and a larger earned income tax credit for the families of those serving in iraq
the truth is that more than onehalf of all taxpayers would get less than 30 in tax relief from this bill while those who make over a million dollars a year would get an average tax break of 32 000
however in reality households with incomes between 100 000 and 500 000 would receive 87 of the benefit of amt relief compared to 62 of the benefit for capital gains and dividends tax cuts
i urge my colleagues to join me in rejecting the underlying bill and supporting the democratic alternative that would provide real tax relief and strengthen our country
we have 45 billion in extenders on which there is basic agreement
we have a reduction in the capital gains and dividends tax which continues for the next few years
so here is their choice extend the dividends and capital gains reduction that continues in any event extend it to 2009 and 2010 even though over 50 percent goes to people making 1 million a year
their second choice is budget cuts cuts in student loans cuts in child support
it is 4 to 5 dollars for every dollar we provide in administrative support
their choice also was to leave out the amt from this bill but then they bring up a bill yesterday do not pay for it and it can be objected to in the senate and may not happen at all
mr speaker once again i rise in disbelief about what the house is about to do today
and in the process of robbing working families to give to the rich we are ballooning the debt saddling our children and grandchildren with the bill
how long but oh how long will we continue to take care of those at the very top and not those in the middle and those at the very bottom
mr speaker i rise in strong opposition to this 56 billion tax break mostly for millionaires in our country
fortyfive percent of this tax break goes to the ultra rich in our country the top 1 percent average getting 32 000 apiece in tax breaks out of this bill
the amount of money that they were cutting on food stamps and medicaid and health care services and student loans is exactly equal to the amount of money they are giving in tax breaks to millionaires
in other words every dollar that when they cut student loans the money comes from kids and it is going over here to millionaires
cut poor people cut children cut medicaid benefits cut the money that we are going to be giving to seniors to keep them in nursing homes with alzheimer s and with parkinson s disease just keep cutting it
the priest goes up into the pulpit on sunday and he says on wednesday father obrien will lecture on the evils of gambling in the church hall
on thursday in the church hall bingo
every millionaire is a winner in america under the republicans plan
but the money is all coming from the poorest people in our country and it is going over into the hands of those who need it least
vote no on this republican atrocity in our country at a time when the poor need it the most and the rich need it the least
and that goes only to lower income families in this country
generally those on the other side of the aisle harp about the i will not say evils but the excess profits some of the bad things that big business does in this country and yet they leave out the tax benefit for small businesses in this country something known as section 179 expensing to help small businesspeople cope with the costs of keeping their businesses up to date modernizing their businesses so that they can compete so they can compete in the market place sometimes with those big bad businesses
what that means is this particular tax provisional allows companies in this country who conduct financial operations to compete on a level playing field with their competitors overseas
the joint tax committee the committee that is vested with crunching the numbers in this congress has produced these statistics for the capital gains tax one in five americans who claims capital gains on his tax return has income below 50 000
one in four 25 percent of americans who have dividend income have incomes below 50 000 59 percent have incomes below 100 000
and the rich people need 100 billion in tax cuts
and you put that in the sock the stocking of the rich
we do not want children who are in divorced families to get money from those deadbeat dads
we will take it away from the children in divorces and put it in the rich people s stocking
why there is 10 billion we can take away from poor people s health care and put it in the rich people s stocking
way down here in the bottom of the sock
we have taken these children away from a family we have accepted responsibility for in this foster care payment and we cut it and we give it to the rich folks
the poor people better save that lump of coal because there is nothing in here for their heating bills the liheap program has not been expanded and all they are going to have to heat their house is the lump of coal that the republicans put in the poor people s sock
that is the authority of the majority in this house
now the difference between what happened yesterday and what is happening in the gentleman from new york s bill is very simply this
you sent a message out up into the ether knowing absolutely knowing it would not pass because it is not protected in the senate
you can confuse the people but you can not confuse anybody who knows what is going on in here
the fact is that the gentleman from new york s proposal is one that puts it in law and protects it so that we can do something about the amt
it was put in in 1986 because there were people at the top of the scale who were not paying one single penny of tax
so it was decided in this body that everybody who benefits from the united states of america should pay some taxes for a civil society
and we know that it was intended and you know it was intended to tax everybody in this country
in addition to which he talked about the deficit with a straight face
they have rolled up the national deficit 22 trillion we are in the hole
let me say this and i think it is very important to point out mr speaker the republican majority now says as they did yesterday with a straight face incidentally well the democrats did not do anything about the alternative minimum tax when they were in the majority
in 1994 and i hope that anybody who is listening to this will write this number down when the republicans took control of the house of representatives there were approximately 200 000 people paying amt 200 000 people
i would like to think as the gentleman from new york has indicated that i have had some consistency on the issue of alternative minimum tax not only in the committee but here on the house floor
in this institution we hear well the social security trust fund is going broke
it is going broke because they took 2 trillion out of it in tax cuts during the next 10 years
the rangel motion to recommit is about two things truth in budgeting and truth in borrowing
in almost 14 years now on the ways and means committee we have spoken of addressing the alternative minimum tax issue
and you are going to hear in a couple of seconds well yesterday we took up the alternative minimum tax
you can in a few minutes cast a vote on really doing something about alternative minimum tax
now the next thing we are going to hear today is this the democrats were in charge for 40 years and did not address the alternative minimum tax issue
in 1994 a couple of 100 000 people paid alternative minimum tax in america
now this congress had time in the last 5 years to repeal a series of taxes on the american people all by the way for upper income groups
you can in the next couple of minutes choose between fixing amt or extending dividends and capital gains cuts for the wealthiest among us
but most importantly give those 193 million americans next year some much needed relief in alternative minimum tax
i thank you and our colleagues on the committee on the democratic side for the excellent work you did in putting forth the democratic alternative today
so bad was this bill in terms of it not representing the values of our country that the religious community gathered in the rotunda of the capitol of the united states and they prayed that this congress would make the right decisions and reject the republican budget proposal
they asked some questions about why we would be giving tax cuts to the wealthiest people in our country while taking food out of the mouths of america s children
they said they were going to draw a moral line in the sand because a budget should be a statement of our national values and what we care about in our country should be reflected in that budget
so embarrassed were they by their own budget and so embarrassed were they by this tax bill that they had to have 3 weeks come between the two of them so that the american people would separate the cause and effect of what they were doing with their budget bill that was poor in its values poor in its priorities and increasing our deficit because of this tax bill today
yesterday they engaged in another sham which was to pretend that they were giving alternative minimum tax relief for middleclass families in america
if they cared about middleclass families in america they would have put that in this bill today which has the full protection as it goes over to the senate
they know that that bill they passed yesterday has no weight in the senate
it does not have the protection of the parliamentary process on the senate side and the same applies to what they did to try to give the illusion that they were helping our men and women in combat so that they would qualify for the lowincome tax credit
if they cared about them they would have them in the bill today
america has always cherished the value of opportunity and one place where that is possible for more americans is in the issue of education
taking these two bills together we are giving tax cuts to the wealthiest people in america while we are putting a burden on our young people by saying that they will pay 5 800 more in their student loans so that we can give tax cuts to people making over 1 million a year
we see that during the last 5 years these 5 years of the bush administration 7 million more people in our country go to sleep hungry without adequate food because they can not afford to buy food
seven million more people an increase of 12 percent and what does this combination of reconciliation in order to give tax cuts to people making over 1 million a year that cuts food stamps and takes many tens of thousand of children off the school lunch program do
we are not putting adequate resources to cops on the beat or anything else in order for us to give these tax cuts at the high end
let us take the value of responsibility personal responsibility fiscal responsibility which should be the order of the day in this conversation here
the combination of their tax bill and their budget bill in reconciliation which i do not blame them for separating by 3 weeks because it is a total embarrassment with that they are increasing the deficit
they are increasing the deficit by 20 billion in order to give tax cuts to the wealthiest americans
they are putting the burden of debt on america s children individual debt with their student loans and fiscal debt in terms of our national debt and what our kids will be burdened with
coming out of that administration we were on a trajectory of 56 trillion with a tr dollars in surplus
in the years of the bush administration that has been almost fully reversed over 4 trillion in deficit a swing of around 10 trillion an incredible burden on the future a tax on our children s future
our democratic substitute reflects the values of community by shielding the middleclass americans from the alternative minimum tax in a bill that really counts not in some suspension of yesterday that has no weight in the conference with the senate and it provides tax relief the democratic alternative does for our soldiers in combat in the bill
our democratic members on the committee have eloquently made an indictment against this budget which is immoral because of the 70 billion in tax cuts mostly for america s wealthiest
the number of people without health insurance has increased 4 years in a row
they are cutting 45 billion in medicaid a health insurance program that is mostly for america s poor children many of them katrina survivors
alexis de tocqueville talked about community in america
if america ever ceases to be good he concluded america will cease to be great this is a moment that no one in this body wants to hasten
mr speaker much of the rhetoric coming from the majority in defense of this sinful package is pure fiction
so let us discuss it in those terms
and we know that in the course of this beautiful story the ghosts of christmas past help him reflect upon the paucity of his life and in the end he has a new spirit of community helping others including the cratchett family with the crippled son tiny tim
it is probably going to be titled a christmas carol ii revenge of the scrooge and in this christmas carol scrooge sitting in his mansion contemplating his wealth wants more
this shows that we are north of 8 trillion in accumulated debt that the average share is 27 000 of debt per american
you know another christmas story talks about naughty children getting a lump of coal in their stocking
existing tax code makes the very provision that they are talking about in 2006 in 2007 and in 2008
they are talking about driving us deeper in debt today cutting programs that help people today so that we can deal with something that happens in 2009 and 2010
well in looking at who gets what under this bill you know most of the people in this country 55 percent earn less than 40 000
so in this christmas season we are hammering on programs that help those who need help
we are passing a tax package that gives nothing virtually to most under this capital gains dividend tax cut provision and we are absolutely loading it up for the wealthiest few in this country
well the fact is the very tax cuts that she is talking about remain in place
they are in existing law for 2006 for 2007 for 2008
and in this environment the majority in bringing this bill to the floor today after yesterday s vote will be passing 87 billion in additional tax cuts that are not paid for
he was quoted in november saying we should not be cutting taxes by borrowing
earlier in the month of december just last week he says an expected deficit casts an ever larger shadow over the growth of living standards
in the end the consequences for the us economy could be severe
the dirty little secret in this budget reconciliation plan is that it increases borrowing authority for this country nearly 1 trillion from 750 to 780 billion of additional debt they will be authorizing to fund the tax cuts that they want to commence
mr speaker in april congress passed a responsible budget that called for spending restraint reduction of the deficit and by slowing the unsustainable and automatic growth of mandatory spending programs and extending tax relief to families and small businesses we have successfully accomplished the first two
in 2001 2003 and 2004 congress enacted responsible tax relief to help create new jobs grow america s economy and put more money in the hands of workers families small businesses farms and ranches
following this tax relief unemployment dropped a full percentage point to 5 percent and we have experienced 10 uninterrupted quarters of real growth in our economy above 3 percent the longest stretch since the 1980s
a key part of the american jobs creation act of 2004 was a return to fairness for those who live work and raise families in states with no state income tax
the state and local sales tax deduction is particularly important to those in my home state of florida and nine other states because it gives every taxpayer the opportunity to deduct state sales tax from his federal tax bill something that other highertax states have enjoyed for some time
this provision is set to expire in 3 weeks
in an effort to encourage savings and stable retirement security this tax bill allows lowerincome families that contribute to individual retirement accounts and pension plans to continue receiving a federal match in the form of an income tax credit for the first 2 000 of annual contributions
the labor department reported that employers added 215 000 jobs in november after adding 44 000 in october and 17 000 in september in the wake of devastating hurricanes
the economy grew at an annual rate of 43 percent in the third quarter much stronger than expected
november s increase in payroll the largest since july was broadbased
employment in professional and technical services rose by 22 000
manufacturers added 11 000 jobs last month following an increase of 15 000 in october
housing spending came in at 84 percent
the democratic substitute does not extend enhanced small business depreciation expensing so it increases taxes on small businesses the very engines of innovation and growth and employment in this country
at a time when concern is growing about foreign investment in the united states the democratic substitute throws up barriers to americans investing in america
many of these individuals are small businesses who do much of the hiring and buying in this economy
mr speaker the republican tax reforms of 2001 2003 and 2004 have created jobs strengthened our economy and increased federal revenues in the process
they quantifiably aided in shortening and curtailing the severity of the recession of 2000 and 2001
failure to pass this bill would result in higher taxes on seniors savers small businesses and farmers
i would remind the gentleman that amt relief is not in our package because it passed yesterday in the house by a vote of 4144
that is why it is not in this package because it passed yesterday
we all talk about what we do here in washington as it relates to the economy
a lot of them are getting up before the sun comes up and not getting home until the sun goes down bringing in food and fiber from our fields manufacturing the devices that we take for granted each and every day in our manufacturing facilities and working hard in an expanding and robust services economy going into classrooms going into hospitals building houses that are part of the american dream for more and more americans
in fact a record number of americans now have achieved that piece of the american dream through homeownership
so it is ordinary americans doing every day what they do best that is allowing this economy to move forward and our role in that is to create the climate that allows them to maximize that opportunity to put in place policies that keep inflation in check keep interest rates low and reduce the tax burden in their lives
in fact there has been a 69 percent increase in s amp p 500 companies that pay dividends
it is not only wealthy people that are benefiting from dividend taxes being cut and the corresponding increase in companies paying dividends
in fact it typically is your retirees who are owning those stocks that they have invested in their whole lives that are paying the dividends to supplement their retirement income
prior to us changing that policy the number of companies paying dividends over the last several years had actually gone down by 45 percent and since the change in the tax that lowered the dividend tax it went up almost 70 percent
that is a clear indication that what we did here in that small policy changed behavior in the business world to the benefit of all americans poor americans seniors middle class professionals people who make six figures people who make five figures
in fact disproportionately seniors benefited from that
would we like to put policies in place that do that
this is not a classwarfare argument 91 million individuals own stock in america
this bill puts in place a policy that encourages more americans to invest in america
and the gentleman in reference to his concern about the deficit which is legitimate and shared by all of us about the growth of the deficit failed to point out that the deficit has gone down over 100 billion in the last year
they want to pick and choose the winners in american society and we want everyone everyone on equal footing to have the opportunity to achieve their piece of the american dream
we do not propose to pick winners and losers in economic policy and tax policy
we say everybody has got a shot at making the most of their opportunities in this country
everybody has got a shot at paying less in taxes on capital gains
everybody has got a shot at paying less in taxes on dividends that are paid by companies that support all americans
everybody has got an opportunity to go to college through the tax incentives that are in there for higher education opportunities
the democratic substitute does not include the savers credit for low income families those low income families who are contributing to iras and pension plans scrimping and saving every day every week every month to put aside money to prepare for their own retirement to lt center gt lt pre gt page h11233 lt pre gt lt center gt why are they silent on the point of assistance for small businesses allowing them to increase section 179 expensing so that they can get that new piece of equipment add the new line which means more employees more growth more purchasing and a better economic ripple effect in the community
here you have americanbased companies doing everything they can to trade in an increasingly complex globalized economy and you leave them out of your substitute
why is it only about the wealthy and not about every one of those 91 million americans who own stock who are trying to invest in america who understand that markets offer them an opportunity to grow and create opportunities that they may not have had otherwise
why are all of those 91 million americans who participate in our capital market so bad
we believe that you can use the tax code to encourage businesses to go into areas that formerly were environmentally damaged sites and clean them up and create jobs and opportunity in otherwise blighted areas
the amt relief bill moved through here in an expeditious manner on a bipartisan basis
ten states that do not have a state income tax that want the same tax treatment that hightax states have this expires in 3 weeks unless we pass the bill
just one of several important components in this tax relief package
and that is why we were so disappointed that the republicans by party line rejected the democrats when we were doing the bill in the committee from not being included in the reconciliation bill
as a matter of fact people should know that it may appear to be a technicality but the only way that this alternative minimum release bill that we passed yesterday in the suspension calendar is that not one of the 100 senators over there objects
if the republicans were so concerned about these people who got caught into this trap in getting the alternative minimum tax treatment it would be placed in the reconciliation bill
it is true that you have decided that those people who want relief on capital gains taxes and corporate dividends even though they do not get hit until 2009 that you are prepared to have the people who get by the amt this year or next year rather in their tax burden to get hit at the expense of those people that are much richer and much smaller in number
so i really think that in this holiday season we are doing enough damage without distorting the truth
you have had your priorities in terms of protecting the amt people or protecting the group that is going to be allegedly protected today even though they do not need any not today not next year and not the year after
so those are the facts and i thank the gentlewoman from new york for affording us the opportunity to at least in this holiday season whether we like the bill or not let truth prevail
mr speaker i welcome the opportunity to join with the republicans to send this holiday message to millions of americans that will be affected by this bill especially to the fraction of 1 percent that would be the beneficiaries of a substantial reduction in capital gains and corporate dividends
it is true while this only represents 20 to 25 percent of the bill it should be made abundantly clear that these benefits would not be effective until sometime in 2009 and 2010
and if they do not think that we are moving forward fast enough then they ought to really listen to the president as he shares with us the great economic recovery that has happened in iraq and if they are just a little patient things will get better here in the united states
now we all know that whenever we give this type of tax cut that there is going to be a tremendous revenue loss and in the last few days that revenue loss has been something like 100 billion
and in this holiday season i just want to join them in letting people know where these cuts are going to take place
what i do not understand with all of the opportunity that we have had to take care of economic growth why do we wait until this time of the season and target the least among us in order to do the budget cuts
it is not as though we do not have 2 or 3 billion in terms of expenses in iraq which if you did not know lately you should know that victory is in sight and we are winning that too
so we do not want you to lose confidence in all of government
if you find out that this bill rewards the richest of the people in the united states whose income is not going to be adversely affected or their tax is adversely affected for 3 or 4 years but we have to do something to target the poor today then you have to have some trust in the republicans because they say we have got to have victory in war we have got to grow the economy and this is the best thing that ever happened to you
now the democrats are not just saying vote no we will have an opportunity for members to vote yes and unlike the republicans we thought enough of the alternative minimum tax to include it in reconciliation
it is in our bill
and so my friends in this holiday season you may find it very difficult if you are unemployed if you are concerned about the economy or the cuts that we have including medicaid which is only a 10 billion cut but you must trust the majority and the republicans in this house because they like the president of the united states say the economy is booming
we are going to have victory in the middle east and this is going to make it easier for you if not today if not tomorrow then sometime in the future
mr speaker i would just like to say briefly if the chairman of the ways and means committee is saying that the alternative minimum tax is in the other body s bill then he must be saying that the tax cuts that we are talking about today are not in the other body s bill
the house republicans passed both of them one on the suspension calendar that is not protected here but is protected in the other body and this bill which provides for relief for the taxes for corporate dividends and capital gains which is protected in our bill but is not in their bill
the tax cut that we are talking about is the 20 billion in capital gains and corporate dividends
does that not expire in 2009
because there seems to be some degree of urgency in this and unless it is a projected gift then these things do nt expire this year or next year
there is no urgency in this
mr speaker i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from massachusetts mr neal xz4002910 to answer some of these important questions a distinguished and acknowledged expert in this on the ways and means committee
nobody would be adversely affected until 2009 and unless the gentleman does not believe he will be in the majority in the next few years i do not see why he would have to say that people who are out of work who are looking for work who have lost their pension should believe that this tax cut that will continue to 2009 is going to help them
mr speaker we have now come to the conclusion of this debate and i want my colleagues to know that if you are looking for some of the things that are worthwhile that are in the majority s bill we have an opportunity in the substitute to take care of it
but if you really believe this is the time for america to give a 20 billion tax cut to these people who will not be affected until 2009 why would they want to give this incentive to less than 5 percent 1 percent of the richest people that we have in our country and do it in this christmas season
you can take care of the wealthy in years ahead since this does not expire this year or you can do what they have not done and that is to take care of those people who find themselves subjected to an alternative minimum tax only because the majority has not seen fit to give them relief in a decade
and so as this number has increased instead of taking care of them in the bill that is before us they have decided to just send a message over there to tell the senate if you would like by unanimous consent and if no one objects then you can take care of the amt problem
we take care of those things that are important in our substitute
in this holiday season we really do not believe that you ought to take 10 billion out of health care for the poorest people in this country
we do not believe that you should in order to pay for this bill that you should cut food stamps
so we ask you to really consider in this holiday season these families that have kids in foster care these families that are having their benefits not being received because we are letting them down
you just weigh this and ask is there any equity involved in this
the people who died in hurricane katrina did not die because of their color
mr speaker we have a democrat substitute that really is not in sharp conflict with the republican bill
many things we tried and include and did suggest in the brief time we had to work on this bill
yes we voted on the suspension calendar to provide relief for these people not as much as we do in our substitute but people have to understand the suspension calendar in the house is not protected under the other body s rules
why would they not include right in this bill that would be protected on the other side i do not know their political reasons
we do not do it in this season nor do we do it anytime because there is a difference in what we believe in
what i am suggesting is that the major decision of those of you who will have to vote is whether or not you want to give 20 billion of tax relief to people who would not need it until 2009 at the expense not only of the deficit but at the expense of the poorest among us or whether you want to take the good things that we could find in this bill not increase the deficit and not cut the programs for the poor and have a democratic substitute that makes sense to the american people and hopefully to the house of representatives
there must be some chart around to show how many people were pushed into poverty during that same period of time and our wages have been reduced but we have it in the back if any of our members would like to use it
i have all the respect for the majority leader and it is true that he knows some of these people that have gone from upper middle income to become higherincome people and there are other people in this country that have seen middleincome people slip into the rolls of poverty
so in order to have a more wellbalanced bill we concentrated on the middle class by putting the alternative minimum tax into this bill to make certain that when it gets to the body it is protected and we do not have to depend on just one of those people over there rejecting it for this higher tax cut which of course does not adversely affect anybody as the majority leader said until 2009
mr speaker i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from washington mr mcdermott xz4002620 who can explain the difference between what you want to do and what we want to do in this substitute
we have a game called 3 card molly in new york
so they have an opportunity to say that they want to help the wealthiest americans but they like to give a whole lot of talk to those people who through no fault of their own except the ineptness and the inability of the republicans to correct it they got caught in the alternative minimum tax
but when you cover it because you believe in it and put it in the reconciliation bill it means that is what you really want to do
in 3 card molly you do not know what is going to happen
but we will know at the end of this vote something that john lewis knows that they said in the civil rights movement and that is which side are you on
some people might say well it did come up in the house
it was not important enough to put in the reconciliation bill and it was not important enough to allow a lot of debate
mr speaker i rise today in strong support of hr 4297 the tax relief extension reconciliation act of 2005 and in opposition to the democrat substitute
mr speaker as a lead sponsor of the stealth tax relief act of 2005 the legislation designed to prevent massive increases in the alternative minimum tax or amt from sneaking up on millions of unsuspecting taxpayers next year i want to take just a moment to comment on the democrat substitute
together we sent a strong unmistakable signal to our colleagues across the capitol that extending the temporary amt relief that is scheduled to expire in just a matter of weeks is an important priority that must be addressed
to pay for it the democratic substitute increases taxes on families and on small businesses that create so many jobs in our community
mr speaker just yesterday all but four members of the democratic party supported amt relief in the house for our hardworking middle class without increasing taxes
but today just 24 hours later our friends on the other side of the aisle are back singing a familiar taxraising tune one that always leaves families with less money in their wallets on april 15 and small businesses with less money on their balance sheets
mr speaker earlier in this debate a colleague on the other side of the aisle claimed that the republican majority has done little to fight the amt since winning the house in 1994
i would further remind my friends on the other side of the aisle that in 1999 the republican congress sent a bill to the president s desk that would have repealed the amt entirely
unfortunately no democrats in the house supported that bill and president clinton vetoed it
finally i would remind members that in 1993 as an era of the democratic control was coming to an end one of the last things that our friends on the other side of the aisle did was to provide a retroactive increase for the amt without indexing the exemption levels
mr speaker i rise today in strong opposition to hr 4297 the tax reconciliation bill
instead of investing in american families this bill condones massive cuts to essential health education and programs designed to help women and children
and instead of fully funding programs such as those designed to support our emergency first responders in the case of a terrorist attack we are using that money to pay for tax cuts for the super rich
add to this reality a costly war in iraq unprecedented spending for hurricane relief in the gulf and the escalating budget deficit and it is very clear that now is the wrong time for these kinds of cut taxes
it is fair because instead of cutting taxes for the super rich our substitute bill is designed to put hardworking middleclass americans first in line for tax relief
that is a nice step in the right direction
what we are proposing in the budget is that we increase entitlement spending 63 percent instead of 64 percent saving 50 billion out of a 14 trillion budget by rooting out waste fraud and abuse by reforming government
you would think when we cut taxes in 2003 we would have lost revenues
now mr speaker what has happened since we cut taxes is we have reversed the job loss we have reversed the decline in jobs and we have added 44 million jobs to the american economy since the 2003 tax cuts
the deficit projection in 2004 was 521 billion
why is it important that we continue the tax relief progress that would expire in 2008 on dividends and capital gains
i have yet to hear anybody from the other side say that the reduction in capital gains does not stimulate the economy or say that any of these items are bad for the economy
my folks in florida want to be able to deduct state and local sales taxes
people in new york they can deduct their income tax
it keeps us sharp and competitive in the world market
nearly 60 percent of the americans receiving capital gains or dividend income have incomes of less than 100 000 and believe me that is not millionaires and you can even take it down to 50 000 and find one in five will benefit from the capital gains deduction because of incomes under 50 000
very briefly since the tax rate on capital gains and dividends was reduced in may of 2003 the economy has grown at an average rate of 41 percent 44 million new jobs have been created government tax receipts have increased 10 percent annually
now we are coming to a situation in 2008 where the capital gains rate is going to go up to 20 percent dividends go back to ordinary income
if we take away the 50 billion in the budget tax cuts but we add 56 billion in tax giveaways we end up with more debt not less
in fact we end up adding 6 billion to the largest deficit in our country s history the one created by this republican congress
how we control the purse strings in our hands reveals who we work for
of the proposed 56 billion in cuts 50 percent that is 28 billion will go to the superrich those among us who need it the least
at the same time the middle class will continue to be squeezed while workers who make 40 000 or less in other words those who need help the most will receive 1 percent of today s cuts
now the loss of 9 billion in iraq is what i call government waste but there is not a court in this country which could find republicans guilty of enforcing accountability in government
sadly in the face of numerous challenges from both abroad and home this increasingly seems to be the case
let me point out that the 400 000 persons who lost their food stamps in the budget cuts and over 300 000 children who lost their breakfast programs that money is being used today to finance these tax cuts
the pursuit of such an agenda violates the trust our constituents have invested in their elected representatives and it is an abdication of the most fundamental responsibilities of this congress
it has forgotten what made the 20th century the american century which was investment in the middle class investment in society investment in education investment in opportunity investment in the future not investment in the rich
i would like to urge a no vote on the rule a no vote on the bill and say to every member of the house of representatives if they want the amt fix protected the only way in the world they can do it today is to vote for the democrat substitute
by breaking all of those tax cuts into small pieces and by burying them in other bills not tax bills the audit trail very quickly becomes hard to follow
hard to see in the aggregate how all of these different tax cuts add up
so let us look at the revenue scorecard over the last 6 months bearing in mind that every delay of revenues cut is a dollar added to the deficit
because there is a provision in this bill a provision in our substitute a provision in yesterday s bill that indicates something has got to be done about the alternative minimum tax
so the net effect on the deficit is 301 billion in all political reality
so every member here who is in earnest about the deficit should be on notice
here in effect is what your choice is
on the other hand you can take the path that this bill would take and you will be 640 billion in deficit in 10 years
mr speaker i rise today in strong opposition to hr 4297 yet another tax break for the richest among us at the expense of those who have the least
under the tax break package presented today a family of four surviving on 30 000 a year will get an average of 50 extra in their tax return next april
these tax breaks combined with last month s cuts on programs for those in need will rack up 44 billion in new debt
what has happened here in the last several years is we have reduced revenues with bills like this and increased spending
to give you some recent history in 2002 we had to increase the debt limit of money that we could borrow by 450 billion in this country
in 2003 we had to increase it again by 984 billion
in 2004 again by 800 billion
and in the budget resolution it is not in this bill they propose another 781 billion increase in the limit that we can borrow
in 2004 16 of 23 federal agencies could not provide an acceptable audit
16 percent of all the taxes we collect now in this country go to pay interest
this is hard to imagine but so far in this fiscal year we have borrowed 130 billion and spent 39 billion on interest in just the first 2 months of this fiscal year
debt interest grew more rapidly in the first 2 months 38 percent relative to the same rate last year
you let the paygo rules lapse in 2002
and we are getting deeper and deeper in trouble by the minute
last night about 12 000 mississippians went to bed in somebody else s house or in their carport or in their car or in their tent
they had wind insurance and a storm of magnitude that has not occurred in 300 years either destroyed or flooded their homes
it is going to cost about 5 billion to help those folks hang on to their homes and hang on to their mortgage and in 102 days we have not had a hearing or a vote on it
you are looking for your fellow americans to help you out while your kids are serving in the mississippi national guard over in iraq
but out of the 188 democrats who voted aye i just have to point out that my friend who just finished speaking who is on the ways and means committee protesting the amount in this vote voted aye
if one is a millionaire in massachusetts it seems we want to protect them
if one is a millionaire in new york we want to protect them
it merely retains those structures supported in committee for example in a bipartisan way to allow people to continue to utilize current tax privileges
i have a hard time when i listen to the rhetoric associated with the description of this bill when one of the provisions for example is the authority to issue qualified zone academy bonds for school modernization equipment in highpoverty areas
abovetheline deduction for higher education expenses in opposing this bill i guess they are opposed to that
for example the work opportunity tax credits for hiring individuals who face barriers to employment in addition to the extension
my concern is if they are going to produce the kind of rhetoric they are producing on a piece of tax legislation which simply extends current law what are they going to do when we have to rethink the way in which we tax people today to make sure that we do not destroy the economic engine in this country that produces the quality of lifestyle for each and every american
mr speaker perhaps the gentleman from new york mr rangel xz4003330 is not aware that the senate has included the alternative minimum tax in their reconciliation tax package
if the gentleman from massachusetts mr neal xz4002910 voted yes on this alternative minimum tax bill yesterday he either was protecting the very rich in massachusetts
either he was voting to protect the incomes of the very rich in massachusetts or he exercised a futile procedure
that is the single largest tax increase since they were in the majority in 1993
mr speaker i rise in opposition to the motion to recommit
in 1993 they passed the largest tax increase on the american people and had a chance to adjust it again then
in fact there was an editorial recently that said it is between the rich and the very rich
and on page 2 of the motion to recommit for purposes of this paragraph the term threshold amount means 100 000 and 200 000 in the case of a joint return so 200 000 is now middle income
the reason in 1994 that there were so few people who fell under the alternative minimum tax is because the regular tax was so high
what has happened in 2001 2002 2003 and 2004 we have driven down the rates
today they are back with part two pushing almost 60 billion in tax breaks for americans who need help the least
this bill grows the deficit and it turns a blind eye to the tax increase the middle class will face in just another 23 days
california is hit harder by amt than any other state in the country
it changes more than 25 different tax provisions but somehow our friends in the majority could not find room for amt relief 16 million new families impacted 23 days until expiration zero regard for the middle class
brownfields are found in every state and in every congressional district
the expensing extension is a tool businesses can use to invest in urban redevelopment
in fact it is estimated that brownfields redevelopment could generate as much as 12 billion annually in new tax revenue for american cities
i urge my colleagues to support this important issue and vote in favor of hr 4297
the result just in time for holiday parties will be a fullbodied onetwo punch
as i said there are good things in this bill and i support them
the substitute would have exempted every family making less than 200 000 from the alternative minimum tax something that should be a priority but that is not included in the bill before us
the substitute also included 42 billion in tax cuts over five years targeted to spur economic growth by extending the most pressing tax provisions that are now scheduled to expire this year
but the senate has passed a quite different tax measure and differences between that bill and this one will have to be resolved in conference
in act i we learned who the majority felt most deserved to bear the brunt of their spending cuts poor citizens who rely on medicaid hungry people who turn to food stamps and families trying to afford college
now in act ii we are learning where they propose that money go for tax breaks that are targeted primarily to benefit the top 1 of the wealthiest americans
let me be clear in a properly prioritized budget i believe there is room for targeted fiscally responsible tax relief
and that s precisely the kind of tax relief democrats are offering in our substitute today
by contrast when considered in its entirety the republican reconciliation package will actually increase the deficit at a time when the nation s debt is already running over 8 trillion
mr speaker during a time of war in the aftermath of a catastrophic hurricane with 45 million americans lacking health insurance and skyrocketing home heating costs projected this winter this majority is proposing to take from those with the least give to those with the most and tell our children they will have to pay for it all later
in fact i would submit that in this season above all seasons we are required to do better
it is good to be in the house doing something that is pretty basic
i would note that if you vote no you are actually voting to increase taxes because this is legislation simply extending current law that expires in the coming year
i also want to point out a provision that is very very important in districts like mine in areas like the chicago suburban area because it is legislation that addresses the need to revitalize old urban areas to recycle and to use old abandoned industrial sites
i have worked over a number of years with chairman thomas and others and we have worked in a bipartisan way to find ways to encourage reinvestment in old abandoned industrial sites
you will find in many cases that these old industrial sites have environmental contamination and because of that investors would much rather go out and buy a cornfield a greenfield site and create an industrial park which consumes five to six times as much land creates urban sprawl and also costs the taxpayers more because you have to replace the water and the sewer and the infrastructure and the roads
well in the coming year the environmental cleanup provision for brownfields that tax incentive expires
and really the recent occurrence of katrina highlights it because we have often heard about the petroleum contamination in the new orleans area and the need for cleanup
this is a chart i know the gentleman is familiar with and it shows the current deficit that we have and it shows a decreasing deficit in fact a significantly decreasing deficit with the deficit declining 138 billion
that is 138 billion in the last 18 months and that is at the same time that we have seen tax relief
i wonder if the gentleman would mind commenting about that and how it is that tax relief can result in deficit reduction
mr speaker i appreciate the gentlewoman s pointing out the increase in tax revenue and the gentleman from texas pointing that out because it is lost on some folks
it becomes enthusiastic in its zeal
this is a chart that shows the tax revenue total tax revenue for the nation in 2003 of 178 trillion
as the gentlewoman and the gentleman from texas so clearly stated now we have tax revenue of 214 trillion in 2005
so what we see is a decrease in tax rates for individuals and corporations and an increase in tax revenue
and as has been so clearly stated if we allow if congress allows the democrat tax increase that they are planning on this week if we allow that to occur then what we will see is a decrease in revenue and a decrease in the vibrancy of the economy
if the gentlewoman will yield i want to get this straight because i think it is incredibly important for the american people to understand what is going to happen this week in the house
as i heard the gentlewoman say if an individual in this chamber votes no on hr 4297 that means that they want to see the american people not be able to deduct sales tax state and local sales tax
i served in the georgia state legislature and we worked for years to try to get tax deductibility for teachers for their outofpocket expenses
i do not know a single teacher that does not spend some of their own money to kind of fill the hole to provide some of those items in the classroom especially in the elementary grades that make so much more valuable the education that our children receive
the first half of the budget reconciliation occurred last month when the majority passed a series of devastating spending cuts to health and education programs in order to free up funding for these tax cuts
they are paid for by throwing 300 000 people off food stamps when hunger in this country is on the rise
in fact this package increases the deficit because it reduces spending by 50 billion and cuts taxes by 56 billion
in other words this socalled deficit reduction package actually increases the deficit to the tune of 6 billion
but i refuse to pass this bill and saddle the elementary school children in jamestown and buffalo with that debt
but there is a proper time for everything and at this juncture when we are running record budget deficits when we are funding our troops in iraq and when we are incurring huge costs to recover from hurricane katrina at this juncture we can not cut taxes to the rich and increase the burden on the middle class
we are grateful to you for the leadership you have provided in these special orders in trying to get the truth out about the issues
mr speaker this past monday i had the great honor and privilege to host president george w bush in north carolina s 5th congressional district
the president came to discuss our country s impressive economic growth at the john deerehitachi manufacturing plant in kernersville
it is an honor to have many flourishing companies like deerehitachi in the 5th district
i am proud of this facility for being a model of how us manufacturing companies can compete successfully in the global economy
employment at deerehitachi recently doubled in size to over 750 direct employees
a portion of deerehitachi s growth has been fueled by the localization of models that were formerly produced in asia to kernersville north carolina
the dnc s remarks were a slap in the face to many hardworking men and women who work for successful north carolina manufacturing companies manufacturers like dell sara lee american emergency vehicles vaughnbassett furniture reynolds american weyerhauser and so many more that i can not begin to name them all
american workers are the best in the world
we have gone through a recession that began in the previous administration the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 many terrible natural disasters and more
in a report issued last week by the bureau of labor statistics our economy created 215 000 new jobs during the month of november
more americans are working than ever before in the nation s history
this is due to the hard work of the american people and sound republican policies such as lower taxes legal reform and less government influence in the lives of our nation s entrepreneurs and small business owners
in addition to our nation s job growth our us economy is showing other signs of expansion
the gdp growth in the third quarter is one full point above the 33 percent rate
further our country is at the lowest rate of core inflation in more than 2 years
the increase in the rate of inflation was lower than initial expectations with the price index of consumer spending rising 42 percent compared with initial estimates of 37 percent
in addition the sales of new single family homes should be the largest 1 month gain in 12 years
sales of new single family homes increased by 13 percent in october and pushed sales to an alltime high of 12 million units
as we work to pass the tax relief extension reconciliation act of 2005 i hope our democratic colleagues will join us in supporting this commonsense bill
i look forward to working with president bush and the rest of my colleagues in congress to make tax relief permanent exercise spending restraint and cut the federal deficit in half by 2009
again i want to thank the gentlewoman from tennessee mrs blackburn xz4000320 for her leadership in letting us present the facts to the american people not the stories that are being told by our democratic colleagues
mr speaker as we begin debate on additional tax cuts hr 4297 we must consider them in the larger context of the challenges this nation is facing and the impact these tax cuts will have on our ability to face these challenges as well as future challenges
over the thanksgiving recess i participated in a program in my district that sought to increase early literacy by incorporating reading into doctors visits
are we being wise stewards in choosing to pass another tax cut on top of the nearly 2 trillion in cuts we have already passed
yet we are still financing the war in iraq and the reconstruction from the war in afghanistan
and we have only just begun the rebuilding efforts in new orleans gulfport and other gulf coast cities struck by hurricane katrina
there are many positive provisions in this bill
so we are at war we are in debt and yet again we are cutting taxes without fully paying for it
just the tax cuts in this bill will add at least 6 billion to the deficit and it seems more may be added outside this reconciliation process
sadly it seems the only americans asked to sacrifice are the brave men and women in uniform fighting in the middle east and our children and grandchildren like my anna who will bear the burden of our massive debt
i urge my colleagues to embrace the principle of shared sacrifice and reject this tax reconciliation package in favor of the responsible democratic substitute
mr speaker i want to put this debate in some perspective
president clinton had the first white house conference on the oceans out in california in 1997
there is a bill in his committee it has been there for almost a year and they say we need more time
there has been all the work done and it has been put in a bill
we do not need to spend more taxpayer money and more time in our house trying to decide what to do we just need to do it
now we created a commission after 911 and after the recommendations came back yes there was debate on it but in the same year we adopted it and we took the recommendations
if we want to have some leadership on this can you give us a date when the oceans21 bill will be heard in your committee
this is the first time in any of the debates we have not been an equal number in leadership and work
their expertise and diverse fields are in marine economics coastal and estuarine issues atmospheric issues gulf of mexico issues and the whole array of problems with hurricanes fishery science coastal development physics of ocean currents oceanography
they presented this report to the us congress in september of 2004
in this report there are 31 chapters
seven of the 31 chapters come under my jurisdiction in this ocean subcommittee
and it is important to get this task force so that all those other committees in this house can view this commission task force from the specific recommendations that the task force will assume from the ocean commission report
what i would like to do is explain to my colleagues the ocean commission task force makes recommendations in the following areas which are outside the jurisdiction of the ocean subcommittee
those are the congress should establish for better leadership and coordination a national ocean council and a nonfederal ocean council of advisors to view the full range of issues in the departments the agencies and the executive branch and what goes on in the states and the tribes and the international arena regarding oceans
they make recommendations to improve noaa epa the corps of engineers the department of interior usda and the states in their regional coordination
they recommend structural changes in nasa the corps of engineers the coast guard the us navy the national science foundation aquaculture health and human services department of justice department of state department of labor department of transportation and the united states agency for international development
and a year ago a year and a half ago in the commission report they predicted right down to the letter what could and eventually did happen to new orleans to coastal louisiana to mississippi
managing sediment flows 30 states contribute sediment in the mississippi river that eventually goes through louisiana mississippi and the gulf of mexico
techniques for cost benefit analysis is in this report
marine commerce and transportation across the oceans the estuaries and the rivers in this country
watershed monitoring in 1974 we had 500 stations across the country that monitored the quality of water
how to deal with invasive species with ballas water marine organisms major problems in the great lakes the mississippi river and many estuaries around the country
creating a national strategy for increasing scientific knowledge in ocean science technology and understanding the oceans ecosystem
we have dealt in that ocean subcommittee with our jurisdiction regarding the ocean commission report which is marine debris fisheries management marine mammals coral reefs agriculture ocean observing system coastal habitats and so on
leon panetta who headed the pew ocean policy commission s report is in favor of this task force
admiral watkins who worked on the oceans commission s report is in favor of this task force
as a matter of fact both of those men leon panetta and admiral watkins are urging my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to vote in favor of this
we think instead of fragmenting this all over again because 30 and 40 years ago we went through this with the stratton report and there was not any single entity in the house of representatives that took a critical and analytical view of the stratton report we want to do that now
i will tell you this mr farr the aspects of oceans21 in your bill that is subject to the jurisdiction
in 6 months june 30 this bipartisan task force made up as a reflection of the ratio of democrats and republicans in the house which is standard practice for all committees will issue its comprehensive report legislative recommendations so that each one of the fragmented committees will not have to deal with these issues that they have very little expertise with in any way
it brings people in democrats republicans
it brings people who work in all the various marine industries into the process to evaluate to analyze in a very clinical manner the ocean commission recommendations
i urge my colleagues to vote in favor of the task force
this bipartisan task force will have members appointed by the speaker and minority leader who will focus on the final report of the united states commission on ocean policy entitled an ocean blueprint for the 21st century while the task force will have no legislative jurisdiction it will put in place a mechanism to allow the house to look broadly at the question of caring for our oceans
mr speaker i rise in opposition to this resolution for many of the reasons that my colleagues have cited
if there are five other committees most of their budgets are larger than ours so you are approaching almost 100 million in public moneys that are available to deal with this issue
we have the expertise in the committees
we have done that in other cases
it requires a national commitment to protect the oceans and the republican congress is not interested in doing that
mr speaker in 2003 the pew ocean policy commission put out a comprehensive report telling us that our oceans were in serious trouble
and lo and behold last september that commission came to the same basic conclusion that our oceans are in peril from degraded waters compromised resources and conflicts between man and nature and that immediate action is needed
what we have done instead is to hold a random assortment of hearings on a few areas that are mentioned in the commission s report but without getting into any of the commission s recommendations
now today in the face of the republicans consistent refusal to comprehensively address ocean issues we are now handed the emptiest of promises that this oceans task force would mean real progress in dealing with the commission s recommendations
its task will literally be to write a report on a report that itself is already quite prescriptive in its instructions to congress
well why are we wasting another 400 000 in taxpayers money on a task force that does not even have any legislative responsibility
he said that there is no legislative jurisdiction in this task force
let me tell you the house republican leadership has no problem even ignoring committees and writing a lot of legislation in the rules committee when they want to get something done
i respect my colleague but do nt tell me that this republican leadership needs another task force to write a bill because i have seen bills written in the rules committee and come to the floor directly without even going to committee
i want to say that my democratic colleagues have specific recommendations that they have put in legislative form and some of them are here on the floor
the fishermen the beachgoers the coastal business owners in my district they know this
again the pew commission us oceans commission they have sounded an alarm and it is time to do something to save our oceans and what is in our oceans
mr speaker as one point of clarification regarding the claim made by the gentleman our chairman that no select committee was formed to consider the stratton commission recommendations i believe that the gentleman from maryland was in fact wrong on that
the senate specifically established a national ocean policy study in the commerce committee for that purpose
so again it says in the resolution this is nothing but a report on another report which is already 500 pages and 10 million of taxpayers money has been spent on it
the bottom line is that this house republican leadership has taken bills as i said many times written them in the rules committee
that report the first of its kind in over thirty years handed the congress an action agenda to finally address the degraded condition of our ocean and coastal resources
the commission was filled with highly credentialed professionals with expertise in policy economics science technology and resource management drawn from both the public and private sectors and academia
for the congress to assert that it can do a better job in six months time than the experts appointed to the commission did in three years is absurd
moreover the ocean commission s report echoed similar findings and recommendations to those made in the 2003 report released by the independent pew oceans commission chaired by our former colleague the honorable leon panetta
unfortunately rather than rolling up our sleeves and working in a bipartisan fashion to begin a process of genuine oversight to evaluate the merits of the ocean commission s work months have been allowed to lapse with little if any meaningful oversight without the development of any joint strategy and absent any leadership by the republican majority
my legislation for example addresses fisheries management including how the various fisheries management councils can perform in a more transparent and effective manner
mr speaker i rise today in support of the resolution to create a house ocean task force
during the more than 20 years i have been here in the congress i have made it a priority to promote protection of our oceans and effective conservation and management of the living marine resources
but as highlighted in the more than 200 recommendations contained in the us commission on ocean policy report released last year much remains to be done
and as mr gilchrest xz4001490 just pointed out a bipartisan group to coordinate this activity is necessary given the fragmentation that has existed in the committee system as it relates to ocean issues for more than 50 years
as a chief sponsor in the house of the legislation to establish the us commission on ocean policy i feel it is important to follow through and ensure the recommendations are effectively implemented
we need to build on the momentum generated last year by the release of both the us and the pew ocean policy commission reports and accomplish a true sea change in the way we utilize and manage our ocean resources
i feel it is time that we recognize that in order to make progress we need a coordinated congressional focus incorporating policy justifications of each of the standing committees to draft a comprehensive national oceans policy
this task force will enable us to do that and i might say that the republican leadership and i hope the democrat leadership is committed to help in this effort in a very direct way
mr speaker i would just like to point out to my friends on the other side of the aisle that mr gilchrest xz4001490 has spent a great deal of time in working with leadership on this issue recognizing that there is a process problem here in that the oceans21 bill that we all want to see passed is in the jurisdiction of quite some number of committees
if we do not do that the sure bet is that this bill in this term is going nowhere
there is already a standing house committee to deal with ocean policy that professional staff already have in place
in fact no action at least none that i am aware of has been taken beyond the simple introduction of this measure
in that circumstance there may well be a need to coordinate efforts in an efficient manner
however in this case the primary issues fall within the jurisdiction of the resources committee
in fact there is a subcommittee on fisheries and oceans chaired by the gentleman from maryland mr gilchrest xz4001490
the second reason is i think conference will finally be the forum where some very serious flaws in the bill can be addressed and renegotiated
mr miller s substitute which unfortunately was not made in order under this rule addresses those flaws
second i think the law ought to make it clear that there can not be bias or favoritism in favor of highly compensated people at the expense of the rank and file
these and some other issues i believe need to be worked out in the conference
mr speaker the income security of americans has been under constant attack by the administration and congress this year especially those families who have not had the good fortune to earn a living that places them in our highest income brackets
it is clear that the pension benefit guaranty corporation must be strengthened and that rules must be put in place to ensure companies adequately fund the promises they make to employees
additionally this bill does nothing to help the struggling airline industry that has already seen united airlines employees and retirees lose over 3 billion in earned pension benefits
mr speaker reclaiming my time i think the gentleman is well aware that there is a crisis in america when it comes to the issue of protecting people s pensions
and i think all of us on both sides of the aisle have a responsibility to work hard to develop legislation that will in fact protect american workers and retirees in the pensions that they have been promised
we have worked with members on both sides of the aisle in order to develop this legislation
and thirdly to the pension benefit guaranty corporation that ensures that these pension payments will be made we need to strengthen the financial condition at the pbgc to avert a possible taxpayer bailout in the future
it will in fact ensure that there is more money contributed to these pension plans whether it is restricting the use of credit balances whether it is using a more accurate interest rate to determine what those obligations are whether it is closing down the amount of averaging that goes on
the second part of this is to reduce the longterm exposure to the pension benefit guaranty corporation that is in fact facing a deficit
we not only increase premiums paid by employers to the pension benefit guaranty corporation as part of strengthening them but long term by requiring companies to fully fund their plans at 100 percent we will in fact reduce the exposure of the pbgc long term to a taxpayer bailout
we have a very good sound bill that we are bringing to the floor supported by many employer groups supported by virtually every major labor group in america as well
there is a finely tuned balance in this bill and i do in fact believe that it will pass today with broad bipartisan support
as the gentleman knows in the rules committee last night and in a letter to the rules committee yesterday i asked them to make a substitute in order
and i said i would support not only amendments but also a substitute as long as it did not contain tax issues in there that were unrelated or dealt with the tax side of this bill
but all i can say is that there is no one in this house who has argued more for a fair open debate than i have
i have been in the minority
i have been in your position
i have made the arguments that you are making and i do believe that when we stymie debate in the house we short circuit our constitutional responsibilities
whether there are tax issues involved in what you were offering i do not know
today we have an opportunity to change this by voting for the most comprehensive reforms to worker pension laws in more than a generation
the pension protection act is the outcome of one of the most thorough and remarkable legislative processes i have seen during my years in the house
it is a balanced approach it is comprehensive in nature and it is a benefit to american taxpayers
in short our bill aims to shore up the traditional defined benefit pension system to which we and our parents have grown accustomed so our children and grandchildren might have a chance to be part of it as well
the second major strength of the pension protection act is inherently comprehensive in nature
as you can see on the chart that is next to me the measure would ensure that pensions are fully funded to restore worker and retiree confidence it has enhanced disclosure requirements so that workers and retirees are no longer kept in the dark about the health of their pensions it would improve the financial condition of the federal agency charged with ensuring some 30 000 private pension plans it would reform outdated laws that deny workers access to professional and secure investment advice while providing even more workers with 401 k type plans and it would end sweetheart deals like those we have seen at some airlines and other corporations that have terminated their plans in which executives enjoy a windfall of cash while workers and retirees are left wondering about their futures
as you can see on this second chart the pension benefit guaranty corporation which ensures nearly 30 000 private worker pensions is in dire financial condition
with some 450 billion in pension plan underfunding among financially weak companies looming on the horizon the pbgc s debt could balloon even further than its current 23 billion
and even after my democratic friends voted present that is right they did not vote no they voted present when our committee approved the bill back in june i was hopeful that they would join us and the evergrowing coalition of labor and employer groups in support of these reforms
however some of my colleagues have offered nothing more than rhetoric based on quirky accounting schemes and purposely skewed modeling in an effort to characterize the pension protection act in a negative manner
a primary component playing into the equation of legacy carrier viability is the pension systems currently in place
with these concerns in mind i would ask the chairman to agree to work with me and the gentleman from minnesota mr kline xz4002240 to develop a process as the senate has done to provide airlines with the flexibility needed to fund their defined benefit pension systems over a long amortization period
i believe it is critical that we join with the senate in this effort and through the conference process to develop final legislation that contains industryspecific reform for the airlines
madam speaker reclaiming my time as has been the case all year the lines of communication between those of us that are interested in this both on and off the committee and those on the other side of the aisle as well the lines of communication are open and will remain open
as we move into conference the process i remain committed to ensuring that the concerns of all stakeholders involved are addressed in a bipartisan fashion as we complete action on comprehensive reforms in an expeditious manner
madam speaker reclaiming my time i would say to my colleague that i agree with his comments regarding the importance of shutdown benefits to workers who may suddenly find that the plant for which they have worked for 20 years in your father s case happens to be closed
i think the gentleman knows that i am troubled by the fact that shutdown benefits are often paid from a company s pension plan despite the fact that they are not technically retirement benefits in the true sense of the word
my colleague from ohio correctly notes that we still have work to do on this issue of shutdown benefits specifically as it relates to the steel industry and as such i pledge to him and other members who may have an interest in this as well that on this issue we will continue to work on this matter throughout this legislative process
now if the rules were not strong enough i would not have had virtually every employer in america who has a defined benefit plan beating on my office door complaining about the rules we were proposing
if they are in the 8090 percent range it is good enough
but then as soon as the market turns down or the industry has a bump in the road it is not long before they are under 60 and in deep trouble
we want to give companies time to go from the current rules to these more responsible rules and if we do not have a sufficient transition time what is going to happen is that we are going to create real havoc in the marketplace
beginning to restrict the use of those credit balances will in fact strengthen these plans
not only did we deal with singleemployer pension plans but we have not talked much about multipleemployer pension plans that you find traditionally in the trucking industry the food industry and others
and while they have not been talked about much today in this debate and the administration did not propose changes there are serious changes to the multiemployer pension system in this plan that will help strengthen that system
those plans by and large are healthier than singleemployer plans and we have labor and management on both sides in the multiemployer sector come together to put rules in place so that their plans can never get into a very weakly funded position
i am glad they are in the bill
many in the management sector in every large business organization is supporting this bill
why would all of the labor organizations and the business organizations all be on board in support of this bill
is everything perfect in the bill
our commitment is to deal with this in conference
we need to provide legal certainty for those who have converted to a cash balance plan so that we do not put in jeopardy the 7 million americans counting on benefits from those plans
mr speaker i rise in opposition to the motion to recommit
mr speaker the debate today on the floor is about the massive underfunding in worker pensions and the need to change the status quo
first the motion to recommit preserves the status quo by requiring employers and union leaders to fund their plans at 90 percent or in some cases only 80 percent instead of the 100 percent funding requirements that we have in the underlying bill
second they are preserving the status quo by continuing to allow employers to take up to 30 years to erase any funding shortfall in their plan
we know that the credit balance rules that are in place today are irresponsible public policy
and to allow those rules to stay in place again does not pass the straightface test
the modified yield curve in the underlying bill presents a more accurate picture of the liabilities that these plans have and should in fact stay in the bill
mr speaker i rise today in strong support of hr 2830 the pension protection act of 2005
i rise today to also thank chairman thomas for his inclusion in the pension protection act of legislation i introduced related to the waiver of a 10 percent federal tax penalty for public safety employees our nation s firefighters police officers and emergency medical personnel
they will vest in their regular pension plans and even if they participate in one of the new deferred plans and remain on the job longer will be eligible for retirement before they reach age 55
for example in houston the average firefighter begins his career at age 23
after 20 years of service now age 43 the average firefighter is fully vested in the regular pension fund and can retire and begin receiving benefits immediately
today the firefighter can participate in the deferred plan for up to an additional 10 years
if the firefighter participates for the full 10 years and then elects to retire he or she will be age 53 and in general will not be able to take distributions prior to the age of 59 12 without triggering the 10percent penalty
the effort began in 2002 when my texas colleague congressman gene green introduced hr 4796
mr speaker in closing i want to applaud my house colleagues and particular ways and means chairman thomas to whom i would like to express the deep gratitude of our nation s firefighters police and emergency medical service employees for including section 905 in the house bill and moving the issue forward
in fact the pension benefit guaranty corporation pbgc the government insurer of pension plans estimates that single employer plans are underfunded by up to 450 billion
the bill strikes the right balance in ensuring the plans will begin to be more appropriately funded while not being so strict that the companies providing pension plans are in danger of having to terminate them
to that end hr 2830 provides transition relief to employers giving them time and flexibility to get their pension funding in order
in addition the ways and means committee incorporated into this package a number of tax incentives to increase retirement savings for americans
included in hr 2830 are provisions to make permanent the savers credit and the increased contribution limits for iras and other 401 k plans
the bill also increases savings opportunities for our men and women in combat and provides increased pension flexibility for public safety officers including firefighters policemen and emergency medical service employees
hr 2830 makes permanent bipartisan pension improvements established in 2001
mr speaker i yield myself 30 seconds just to say that we had several hearings on this pension bill in the ways and mean committee including the select revenue subcommittee which i chair
let me just say that the pbgc s analysis shows that funding contributions to this end up being lower only in the short term but actually starting in 2010 contributions to pension plans will increase
and that is because the funding reforms in the bill are phased in over 5 years
it is critical for congress to address this issue and step in and fix rules that no longer work
it is time for congress to step in and reform singleemployer pension plans multiemployer plans improve disclosure and enhance retirement savings
approximately 1 600 multiemployer plans cover about 98 working people in the united states
this motion to recommit leaves current pension funding rules in place which ends up weakening the funding rules in the underlying bill
the motion to recommit also has a 53 billion surtax contained in it on small business
the passage of this bill in my view will set up a conference report that will come back to us that will accelerate the termination of wellfunded and managed traditional defined benefit plans
that in and of itself will act as a disincentive for continuation of these plans
third we continue to allow companies to go into bankruptcy in order to dump their costs onto the pbgc once again affecting those wellfunded plans that are going to be asked to pick up the tab
madam speaker i want to point out that there are provisions in this legislation that are very good
the provisions dealing with the defined contribution provisions are needed and as it was pointed out in the ways and means committee contain many of the provisions that were worked on through the portmancardin process as well as legislation presented by mr emanuel xz4001200 and mr pomeroy
it includes automatic enrollment the split refunds where tax refunds can go partially into retirement savings the extension of the savers credit the ability for individuals to roll over funds and keep them in retirement funds longer
however when you look at this bill in balance we do need to pass legislation but on balance this legislation will cause more harm than good and i urge my colleagues to reject the bill
mr speaker first let me yield myself 30 seconds to point out that i wish we did have provisions in this bill to deal with the airline industry because i think we should
it would be better to have a corporate bond rate and i am sorry that is not in the legislation
mr speaker i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from north dakota mr pomeroy xz4003230 one of the leaders in the ways and means committee on pension issues the former insurance commissioner from north dakota
mr speaker i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from illinois mr emanuel xz4001200 whose provisions are in this bill concerning split refunds and automatic enrollment and other issues that he has brought to the table
so if you have a plan that is wellfunded and you are now being told it is going to cost you more to stay in that plan there is an incentive for you to freeze your plan or to leave
but we are told we are going to do that in conference trust us
why have we not brought in those provisions
and i have nt heard anyone talk about how we are going to correct the problem of an industry going into bankruptcy in order to save their costs
i listened to a lot of my colleagues talk in favor of this bill telling me things they do not particularly like about it things that will be they hope corrected in conference and now we have a motion to recommit that does exactly that
so if we are sincere in wanting to move the process forward so that we can get to conference let us speak to what we want to get from the conference report
but it also deals with the issue of the airline industry directly not on a promise that we will deal with it in conference and it deals with the revolving door of bankruptcy which if we do not correct we are going to have other problems in addition to the airline industry
i would also like to congratulate and thank chairman boehner and chairman thomas for their hard work in getting us to a point where we can make meaningful and necessary reforms to our pension system
first many workers and retirees in recent years mistakenly believed that their pension plans were well funded only to receive a shock when the plan was terminated
second when pension plans are underfunded and worker retirement security is in jeopardy excessive executive compensation packages can add insult to injury by heaping lavish benefits on executives while workers and retirees wonder if they will have any retirement benefit at all
united pilots plan was severely underfunded yet the company was not required to make cash contributions to that plan in 8 years prior to its termination
mr speaker in texas gray skies could mean a twister a hurricane or just a lot of rain
in addition to the many other problems identified here today by my democratic ways and means colleagues this bill lacks a pension disclosure requirement that would empower workers to understand just how strong or weak their pension plans really are
having to wait until a retirement fund s bankruptcy is announced in the newspaper is a little too late for employees to take any remedial action to be able to protect themselves
i think it is important that we not leave the employees in the dark with corporate employers blocking the light switch
madam speaker i rise today in support of house resolution 602 the rule for consideration of the pension protection act hr 2830
in recent years lowinterest rates the stock market decline and the increasing number of retirees have left many definedbenefit pension plans underfunded
in particular the aviation and manufacturing industries have been hard hit by these and other financial difficulties and the penalties under the current pension law are creating tremendous financial burdens for already struggling employers and in fact encouraging them to go into bankruptcy so they can get out from under the burdens of the current pension law
it makes the most comprehensive reforms to our nation s traditional pension system in more than a generation
i would note that the manager s amendment includes compromise language that will ensure that uaw retirees pensions are protected something very important in my district and indeed in all of michigan
in fact i believe it is a very good bill and it is designed to address the problems that he outlined
i understand that chairman boehner intends to support airline pension provisions in the conference committee and i strongly support him in his efforts to include airline pension provisions in the final version of the conference report
i urge my colleagues to support this excellent rule and also encourage them later in the day to support the pension protection act when it is considered
for approximately 38 percent of the households in america the only savings plan they have is social security
but in doing that they have added the provisions on the defined benefit plans
the pbgc and the congressional budget office have estimated that in fact 9 billion in defaulted plans would be left on the taxpayers
we started 3 years ago with the pbgc which guarantees all retirement plans in this country with a surplus
as the old saying goes when you are in a hole stop digging
what comprehensive pension reform must do and what this bill does for the first time in a generation is to significantly shore up pension funds through tough funding rules but without pushing employers into termination bankruptcy and a multibillion dollar taxpayer bailout of the pbgc
while defined contribution plans such as 401 k s have seen increases in participation since their inception our national savings rate now is well below 1 percent
a study by the vanguard group projected that enacting the automatic enrollment provisions in this bill would boost participation to create 55 million new participants in 401 k plans
mr speaker i rise to speak on behalf of 7 000 current and former ibm employees who live in my district
it could however affect millions of americans that are currently vested in defined benefit pension plans
unfortunately the committee did not rule my amendment in order
i would hope protections like the amendment i tried to offer will be incorporated in the final version
while i am voting today to move the bill forward into conference with the senate in the hopes more worker protections can be added i reserve the right to oppose a report that fails to correct this glaring omission
without their urging this bill would not be on the floor today and this bill is so extremely important especially to constituents in my district
in this bill fair consideration is given to those plans which need to catch up but funding shortfalls must be made up within 7 years
in addition the bill encourages greater transparency so that employees know the status and financial health of their own company s pension plan
these requirements will create more stability and certainty in these pension plans
us airways executives walked away with 35 million in executive compensation after running the company nearly into the ground and dragging concessions out of their employees including reductions in pension benefits for pilots and leaving other employees in the dark about the funding of their pension plans
this is unfair to the hardworking employees of these companies and this bill would prevent such a travesty in the future
the bill makes permanent provisions passed in 2001 to increase annual contributions to iras and qualified pension plans and catchup contributions for individuals over 50
i hope my colleagues will support this legislation because it finally gives employees what they need stability in their retirement
madam speaker mr mcgovern my distinguished friend from massachusetts my good friend the distinguished gentleman from the state of washington and i were in 6 hours of hearings yesterday on something called border security antiterrorism and illegal immigration and we came here this morning at 7 am ostensibly to pass out the rules necessary to hear that bill
i ask my colleagues in the majority where is this terribly onerous atrocious bill
what i want to say is we are getting ready to create fear and confusion and there is substantial confusion on the majority side in light of the fact that they are shifting from this bill to that bill and not dealing with the things we need to do and get on out of here
madam speaker house resolution 602 is a closed rule providing for 90 minutes of debate in the house on hr 2830 the pension protection act as amended to be equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the committee on education and the workforce and the chairman and ranking minority member of the committee on ways and means
in lieu of the amendments recommended by the committees on education and the workforce and ways and means now printed in the bill the amendment in the nature of a substitute printed in part a of the report of the committee on rules accompanying the resolution shall be considered as adopted
in recent years we have seen participants mistakenly believe that their pension plans were well funded only to be surprised when their plan was abruptly terminated
the pension protection act encourages workers to increase their personal savings by permanently extending several provisions to enhance pension participation and retirement savings that are currently set to expire in the year 2010
the bill also encourages lower income workers and families to plan and save for their retirement by permanently extending a federal match in the form of an income tax credit for the first 2 000 of annual contributions to an individual retirement account or qualified pension plan
madam speaker the pension protection act implements a comprehensive and bipartisan investment advice proposal that allows employers to provide workers access to qualified investment advisers who can inform them of the need to diversify and help them choose appropriate investments while including safeguards to ensure that the advice is solely in their best interest
one provision madam speaker i am especially pleased was included in this bill was to allow employees who participate in taxpreferred flexible spending accounts to carry forward up to 500 of their unused balances each year
i would just simply point out that there will be a motion to recommit which has always been part of what the republican majority has suggested on every major piece of legislation since we have been in control
throughout the 1990 s in american workplaces a dramatic shift from traditional definedbenefit plans to definedcontribution plans occurred
rather than being able to count on a regular pension check of a specified amount each month for the rest of his or her life many workers must now put money in a mutual fund or other investment and take what comes each month for as long as it may last
the decision of united airlines to force the pbgc to cover its pension obligations resulted in reduced benefits for its employees and retirees and shifted its burden to fulfill pension promises on to the american taxpayer
as a result of united airlines action the pbgc was forced to absorb 8 billion in guaranteed benefits and employees and retirees lost 3 billion in their earned pension benefits
northwest and delta airlines as well as companies such as delphi are also on the verge of following in the path of united airlines
this will undoubtedly increase the pbgc deficit and further jeopardize its i also believe that the provisions in the bill that legalize cash balance plans will hurt millions of workers
with the dramatic increase in hybrid plans and defined contribution plans employees are now faced with making multiple investment decisions that will have a profound impact on their retirement security
i can not tell you the number of individuals in houston and the surrounding areas and other areas that were impacted lost their lives actually died because of the absolute oppression and outrage and the impact of what happened to them
and then we speak to the pensions and the investment of course in company stock
this does not encourage investment in your pension plans
it also denies the necessary flexibility and relief for airlines that unfortunately did not get in this bill but is in the senate bill
and so if you want to look into the eyes of despair just follow the track of enron when those particular employees who had bought into the seriousness and the depth of commitment called family that enron represented and in a matter of a pen in the matter of 48 hours they were not only dumped their pensions were dumped and they had nothing
what we should be doing in this instance is then ensuring and shoring up those liabilities or the potential of those liabilities and the negative impact it would have on people who work so very hard
and in the name of those who we pretended to be concerned about not only the enron employees who spent almost 2 years with us here in the united states congress but other employees and workers around america i would ask my colleagues to send this bill back and make a better bill
as a member of both the committee on education and the workforce and the ways and means committee we have been working for the last 2 years to get a pension bill to the house floor and i am proud to rise in strong support of the bill
even with all the red tape that currently binds up these pension plans there still are some loopholes in current law that have allowed companies to run away from their responsibilities and dump pension promises onto the pension benefit guaranty corporation
the pbgc says it is 23 billion in the hole and they say that with expected terminations they are close to 28 billion
this type of pension plan represents the best chance we have at maintaining defined benefit plans in the future
the bill clarifies that in the future these plans are not age discriminatory
in fact we should go further in providing certainty for plans regardless of when they were created but because of litigation we can not
the companies dropping these plans are in two groups
we have seen that in the steel and airline industries
in the many hearings on pension issues we have heard over and over again that companies need predictability and stability in their plans
we need to get this bill enacted so that companies put their money behind their promises so they can plan with certainty in the long term
well if it is fixed why are the airlines not included in the legislation
if we are so concerned about them why is it not in the legislation
secondly if we fixed it why is it unclear what happens with cash balance plans that are already in place and the irs has not given them a decision
in the city of cleveland there are four companies that went into a cash balance plan and cash balance plans are the wave of the future
i want to encourage mr boehner mr thomas mr camp xz4000580 and everyone else do not tell us we are going to fix it in conference
put it in the bill
i would like to see it in writing
i want to see it in red black blue brown whatever color you want to give it to me
our promises are idle if it is not in writing
employers who went into a plan they even paid up for their employees to deal with the issue of wearaway and they can not get clarity on the programs that they have in place right now
i ask the chairman to work with me in conference to increase the threshold to at least 80 percent so that we encourage executives to take their pension funding obligations more seriously not leave their defined benefit plan beneficiaries and indeed the pbgc and taxpayers on the hook
mr speaker i rise in reluctant support of the pension protection act of 2005 hr 2830
key stakeholders in michigan s 13th congressional district support the bill that we will consider today
the workers employed in local plant sites throughout the nation feel their future income security is threatened because their pensions are dependent on the financial health of companysponsored plans
all in all this bill strengthens funding for employer pension plans and includes reforms advocated by companies and unions who participate in multiemployer pension plans
therefore i vote for this bill with hope that it will move the process forward to address the pension concerns of the airline industry and airline employees and the concerns of our steelworkers who take exception with shutdown provisions of the bill to address the pension needs of companies in total shutdown status
throughout this process i have worked to ensure that we address this issue in a way that does two critical things one make sure airlines can continue to afford participation in their defined benefits system two support the policy priorities of our committee the education and the workforce committee in our efforts to protect employees by making sure the promises they have been made are backed with wellfunded pension plans
mr speaker i rise in opposiiton to the socalled pension protection act and in support of the democratic motion to recommit
mr speaker today s legislation is the latest in a series of attempts to privatize profits and socialize losses
we need to strengthen and to save defined benefit plans in this country
and i think the answer is basically in all likelihood it will not strengthen and preserve but it will weaken and over time eliminate
and the president in this chamber used those terms when the real purpose was not to save and strengthen social security
there are four key factors at play in this bill
as to just one of them the yield curve provision in this bill the people who work with these issues the chief financial investment people 60 percent say essentially that most of the pension plans are going to either be frozen or they are going to be eliminated
what you are going to be doing essentially is putting in place rules that will make it difficult for pension plans to exist and therefore they will be withdrawn if not frozen
so this is the basic issue whether in this country we want to try to preserve defined benefit plans
most of them are not in trouble
many of them would be placed in trouble through a combination of the provisions in this bill and in the senate bill
what you have said to a few of the people is we will make some adjustments here in this bill but there is no assurance that those adjustments will prevail
so in a word what you are trying to do is not protect defined benefit plans but through these provisions and those in the senate bill with the help of the administration you are going to accelerate their demise
it is worthy of debate and it is worthy of your giving us a substitute that would make sure that defined benefit plans can survive in the united states of america for the workers of this country
mr speaker in a few words what we need to do is to reform our pension system but not to undermine it
we have had in this country in the private sector a system of guaranteed monthly benefits under defined pension plans in the private sector for millions and millions of people
what i think is going to happen if this bill becomes law and if it were to be combined in conference with provisions in the senate is essentially to undermine defined benefit plans and move us towards what are called defined contribution plans so more and more everybody will rely on a 401 k instead of the guaranteed benefit in the private sector
that shift was tried in social security by the majority
if you look at the chief financial officers 60 percent of them who deal with pension plans essentially say that this yield curve of the administration and there is a modified version of it in this bill would lead to benefit cuts and termination of defined benefit plans and that would affect manufacturing as well as other industries
various people have scrambled to try to reduce the potential undermining of defined benefit plans through this provision on credit balances but i want everybody to know that that is not likely to work out in the main because this republican bill would discourage companies from doing the responsible and sensible thing advance funding their pension plans to free up resources in years when they needed to make big expenditures like rolling out a big product line and penalize those who would do it any way who would advance funds
all i can say is look at the history of conference committees in this institution in recent years
i think this house should stand up and say let us stand up for a defined benefit system in this country
mr speaker i rise in opposition to the socalled pension reform bill today on the house floor
the democratic substitute would stabilize existing pension plans by extending for 2 years the corporatebondrate used to determine pbgc liabilities encourage employers to maintain defined benefit plans without cuts in workers pension benefits and protect older workers during cashbalance conversions
in may 2005 the securities and exchange commission sec released a report examinations of select pension consultants that revealed significant conflictofinterest and nondisclosure issues within the pension plan consultant industry
the findings included in the commission s report are particularly disturbing for pension plan beneficiaries whose benefit payments are dependent upon their plan management s diligent performance of its fiduciary duties and for the federal government which is faced with an enormous deficit at the pension benefit guaranty corporation pbgc as a result of a series of massive corporate bankruptcies that have resulted in pbgc assumption of severely underfunded pension plans terminated when the corporations entered bankruptcy
i am hopeful that the pension legislation considered today by the house will be greatly improved during the conference with the senate so that we can have a vote on pension reform legislation that actually addresses the real problems that exist in the current system
additionally i look forward to gao s work in the important area of pension fund consultants
the ongoing crisis in the pension fund marketplace requires a thorough independent review to identify problems with government regulation and enforcement and recommend improvements
we decided a long time ago in this country that there was strength in numbers
the republican vision articulated in this bill is that america is a sinking ship and the shout is for every man and woman you are on your own
there are not enough lifeboats in the water and we know that and everybody is jumping off the ship
in 1980 40 percent of employers provided a pension
now that is a 50 percent reduction in 20 years and the pensions that are provided fewer provide a guaranteed benefit than they used to get
imagine living in the united states on 15 000 after working for 45 years
the people without any savings are disproportionately poor have nothing except social security and the republicans as i say tried to take that away earlier in the year
madam speaker millions of americans who work in the private sector are relying on having an employersponsored pension plan when they retire
madam speaker pension security is an important issue one indeed which should be addressed by this congress but pension security must be addressed in the right way and it deserves to be addressed in a democratic way
bankruptcies in the airlines steel and the auto parts industries for example are straining the abilities of the pension benefit guaranty corporation or the pbgc to guarantee the private pensions of workers in these industries
now while there are real problems in some industries like the steel industry there are also serious cases of pension dumping where a corporation claims it can not fulfill its obligations and dumps its pension onto the pbgc
the net effect is a real strain on the pbgc and ultimately a crisis in the pension system
it is this looming crisis in america s pension system that brings us here today
now no one believes we should sit and wait while america s pension system crashes around us but we need to address this problem in the right way and regrettably madam speaker the pension protection act the republicans have concocted is not the right way
both the congressional budget office and the pbgc estimate that the pension protection act will actually lead to an increase in pension plan terminations and an increase in the pbgc s liabilities by billions of dollars
clearly that simply can not be what anyone in this chamber really wants
there exists in this country a culture of corporate corruption where companies like enron and worldcom squander billions of dollars in retirement funds and this legislation does not do anything nothing to fix that
this report shows that pension plans are underfunded by 450 billion that the pbgc is 23 billion in the red with more obligations coming in every day and that the current pension and bankruptcy laws allow companies to dump their unwanted pension obligations on to the pbgc
the substitute also reforms the bankruptcy laws so that corporations can not hide behind bankruptcy in order to dump their pension obligations onto the pbgc
in addition the millerrangel bill addresses a serious inequity where rank and file pension plans are at risk of being dumped onto the pbgc but somehow the corporate executives continue to receive golden parachutes
a ceo should not receive millions of dollars in bonuses and other incentives if they have terminated the pension plan for their rankandfile workers
those of us on this side of the aisle believe we have a better approach one that is fair to millions of americans and their families who get up every morning put in a hard day s work and are the very backbone of america s economy and our communities
the republican leadership in yet another display of arrogance and disrespect decided to close the process to gag us to use the rules committee as a weapon to stifle debate
now let me say with all due respect to my friends on the other side of the aisle it is the majority that is responsible for creating a climate in this house that is devoid of bipartisanship and civility
they saw what happened at enron and worldcom and at other companies where billions of hard earned investments by employees disappeared forever in only months due to corporate fraud and mismanagement
today employees and retirees are watching as some employers like united and usair have rushed to dump their pension promises onto the taxpayer and other employers at the expense of employees and retirees who face billions in uninsured pension promises
the agency that insures traditional pension plans the pension benefit guaranty corporation is 23 billion in the red and is facing billions more in possible claims from companies such as delta airlines delphi and northwest airlines
many employees and retirees face severe reductions in their promised pension benefits as their plans are turned over to the federal government or frozen by companies when their sponsor falls behind in their obligation to fund promised benefits
employees and retirees in such cases are not only cheated out of promised pension benefits but sometimes suffer further injury and insult by company executives who cut their own sweetheart golden parachute deals
now delta and northwest are in bankruptcy and very well could dump their pension plans onto the pbgc
the pbgc loss would be 84 billion and the employees and retirees would lose 22 billion in promised benefits
delphi auto parts has filed for bankruptcy the largest such filing in the history of the auto industry
the hit on employees estimated over 10 billion in uninsured losses would be the largest ever
that tops the 6 billion in worker losses that pbgc estimates occurred from its 4 previous largest pension plan terminations
the pbgc s 35 page study released on october 26 2005 analyzed detailed information of 400 pension plans representing 50 of the liabilities and underfunding in the pension system
the pbgc estimates that more than 50 of a sample hr 2830 fails to reform pensions in several other respects
employees should never have to wake up one morning and read in the papers that their pension plan has failed
prohibiting company executives in charge of underfunded pension plans from entering into sweetheart retirement deals while they re moving to dump their employees pension plan on to the taxpayers
without urgent decisive action by congress millions of americans face the loss of billions in irreplaceable like savings due to the broken promises of their plan sponsor
the republican answer to this crisis is to hasten the unraveling of pension plans by allowing companies to skip out on over 75 billion in contributions over the next 10 years and increasing pbgc s red ink by billions of dollars
madam speaker the gentleman from georgia just gave a nice speech but nobody on that side has explained why on this very important issue that the democrats and people with alternative views should be entirely locked out from participating in amending this bill
the gentleman from indiana tells us we should all be happy because the education committee deliberated on this and there were votes in that committee
the gentleman gets all upset when mr miller xz4002781 talks about the fact that it is important for us to be an example to iraq about what democracy is and that there are elections in iraq and you know here we are engaged in an undemocratic process here today
at least in iraq everyone has an opportunity to vote
this has become the norm in this house and it has to stop
however we can not support legislation that would clarify the legal status of cash balance pension plans without providing protections for older longservice workers involved in cash balance plan conversions and without including a prohibition on all discriminatory age based wearaway we are also deeply concerned that this bill would for the first time permit defined contribution pension plans to provide investment advice subject to inherent financial conflicts
cash balance pension plans aarp believes that cash balance plans have a role to play in the private pension system if and only if they are designed and adopted in a manner that protects the millions of older workers who have given up wages in exchange for traditional defined benefit pensions
cash balance pension plan conversions change the rules in the middle of the game and older longerservice workers are at considerable risk
hr 2830 does not protect older and longerservice workers that are involved in cash balance pension plan conversions
hr 2830 would not only lower the bar for transition protections for older workers set in the administration proposal but would lower it substantially below the best practices followed by companies involved in conversions over the past few years
the approach advanced in this bill would for the first time permit plans to provide advice subject to inherent financial conflicts
in fact most large financial service providers have already developed alliances with independent advisors to make such advice available
congress should clarify that the employer would not be liable for specific investment advice so long as the employer undertook due diligence in selecting and monitoring the independent advice provider
it is in the best interest of both the plan and participants to enhance the independent advice market and we urge congress to adopt this approach
aarp urges you to stand with us in opposition to these critical provisions in hr 2830 in order to provide protections for older workers that are necessary reasonable and fair and to ensure that employers provide quality investment advice without the potential for conflict
this bill does not stop companies from dumping pension plans in bankruptcy or protect the united airline employees and retirees
we think that this bill should not only be much better but in fact this bill as it stands will be harmful to american families
and there will be a debate about that but absent from the debate will be what we want to propose what others in this house want to propose what other ideas may be
in fact you are usually wrong
and when it comes to workers you are usually wrong in protecting workers rights
to allow a bill this important to come to the floor without a single amendment being made in order to allow this bill to come to the floor and shut us out and gag us is unconscionable
we should be able to work them out in a deliberative way on the house floor
this has become the norm in this house
you are going to be in the minority again hopefully sooner rather than later
madam speaker i rise in strong support of hr 2830 and i thank chairmen boehner and thomas and johnson for their great work in getting us to this point
in recent years our important retirement security system has come under strain from the increased aging of the workforce and from dishonest employers who made promises they could not keep
in addition this bill is important to protect taxpayers from a multibillion dollar bailout of the pension benefit guaranty corporation
in fact in november the pension benefit guaranty corporation reported a longterm liability deficit of 228 billion
mr speaker i rise in strong opposition to the pension protection act of 2005
in fact this bill places the future of today s american worker in jeopardy
even worse this bill places those who have put in the years and worked hard at the mercy of bad management decisions
pension programs are an important factor when workers choose a job and it plays a large part in financial planning
instead they place earnings into their pensions as much in the short run as they will need in the future
without a guaranteed source of retirement income it is almost impossible for these women to stay in the employ of the airlines and worse yet many of these women have already put in years of hard work and have already lost upwards of 75 percent of their pensions
so many people in my district have worked a lifetime to secure a good pension to help them in their retirement years
in michigan we have so many workers in the airline industry because of course detroit is the hub for northwest airlines
in fact it is also supported by the affiliated unions of the building and construction trades department of the aflcio the bricklayers and allied craft workers the transport workers union the united brotherhood of carpenters and joiners and the united food and commercial workers union
any bill that acquires the support of business and labor must be doing something right in today s economy and this climate
let us get it into conference with the senate and let us get on with the job of ensuring that workers are secure in the knowledge that the pension that they have worked so hard to get will be there when they retire
it is rather interesting and mr mcgovern xz4002630 has alluded to this a number of times but it is interesting today as we watch with great anxiety and anticipation and a sense of celebration as iraqis run the gauntlet of violence to go out and vote for democracy at the same time the republicans in the house of representatives close down democracy in the people s house
that is the death of democracy in the people s house
so let us applaud it in iraq today but let us understand what is happening here the gradual glacial process of destroying debate on the floor of the house of representatives and the right of members
mr visclosky wanted to talk about people who were being impacted by these policies who were losing their jobs and losing their workplace and losing their retirement benefits but he was not going to be allowed to offer those amendments to have that amendment because of the autocratic nature of the republican leadership in this house
this republican pension bill is the greatest assault on the middle class standard of living in the history of congress because this bill accelerates the process by which millions of american workers will lose the retirement nest eggs that they were counting on
this is about millions of americans who do not have the benefit of a union who do not have the benefit of collective bargaining because in a survey of the major employers by the benefits association 60 percent of those people say that this bill will cause them to freeze their plans freeze their retirement benefits
so we have made the problem worse which is the solvency of the pension guaranty corporation and that is a corporation that protects pensions that now is anticipating hundreds of billions of dollars of potential liabilities in the future
yesterday in usa today united airlines announced it is coming out of bankruptcy and a couple of hundred executives are going to take 15 percent ownership in the company and they are going to leave bankruptcy with 285 million in their pocket in their pocket
but the fact of the matter is that this bill makes things worse in many ways for many pensioners in this country and many future pensioners
the speaker who was just in the well said there was some 23 billion in deficit in that plan
so while we narrow the deficit in fact we see that we increase this agency s deficit problems
maybe some of them will not come because of this bill but many of them will come because of this bill because this bill in fact makes it easier makes it easier to terminate plans
those workers had given back billions of dollars in wage concessions retirement concessions to try to keep that airline afloat
yesterday we learned that the top executives of that corporation have now petitioned the court to distribute 235 million in stock to those very same executives that ran this corporation into the ground that they are going to get 235 million in stock
it treats those in the corporate suites entirely differently than it takes care of the workers on the shop floor or on the airlines or in the repair facilities
that is the problem with it is that we see that this plan simply does not provide the kinds of protections necessary the kinds of protections that are necessary for those employees who have worked so terribly long for those corporations who invested their entire lives in these corporations
that means that these people are going to have less of the kind of retirement that they had anticipated because of the acceleration of the terminations because of the acceleration of the freezing of the plans and because of the ease which you can now go and apparently the acceptability in the business community of entering bankruptcy
we changed the personal bankruptcy laws in this congress because we said people were using it as a convenience
if united airlines is the model the only losers will be the workers and the retirees in those corporations
madam speaker we are facing a serious pension crisis that has already cost employees across the nation billions of dollars in lost benefits benefits they were told were ironclad
if you calculate just the losses employees suffered in the nation s four largest pension terminations it exceeds 6 billion in earned defined benefit promises
exploiting loopholes in our pension and bankruptcy laws clever lawyers have turned a federal agency that was supposed to be a last resort for companies that were closing shop into a dumping ground for companies to ditch unwanted promises to reward investors at the expense of employees and taxpayers
so powerful is this gaping hole in our pension protections companies can now exact major wage and benefit concession by merely threatening to terminate their pension plan
if you want to further weaken employees hand in the battle for fair wages and benefits this is your bill
last summer thousands of united airline employees mechanics flight attendants and pilots lost billions in irreplaceable pension savings that changed their lives forever
these families denied the courtesy of even a single hearing before the education and workforce committee participated in an online hearing democrats sponsored
over 1 000 participated in this unique online hearing and their powerful voices were heard
listen to kenneth schmidt a longtime employee of united from goodyear az who wrote dear congressmen i had worked for united for 38 years when i retired in february of 2003
this was what i chose to do in life and i did it with no complaints
this is a sad time in this country for all the workers who are relying on a pension to ease their lives and make this time relaxing and enjoyable
the stress that is being created by this turn in events is not healthy for anyone
how can it be that tens of thousand of united airlines employees like ken schmidt lose billions of dollars in promise benefits and we do nothing
mr chairman the sponsors of hr 2830 have referred to it as a pension reform bill they say it will reform the pension benefits guaranty corporation that s already 23 billion in the red and going up
and they say it will turn around 450 billion in underfunding reported by the nation s pension plans
in truth this bill not only fails to tackle pension reform it actually hastens the unraveling of the pbgc and defined benefit plans
it means that older workers will face up to what the gao calculated would be up to a 50 percent cut in their benefits
these angry constituents will be calling the offices of members of congress in droves just like thousands of ibm employees who spent years seeking to rectify deep cuts in pension benefits from a cash balance conversion
they will ask why congress permitted companies to slash their benefits with no transition protections no option to stay in the traditional plans with no legal recourse
this bill gives a sweetheart deal to investment houses by allowing them to offer conflicted investment advice to employees so long as they disclose to them that fix is in
rather than encouraging companies to keep their defined benefit plan in place it encourages companies to freeze downgrade or drop their pension plans altogether
and it does nothing to address the urgent crisis of our airline companies and employees where jobs and the hardearned retirement benefits of hundreds of thousands of americans hang in the balance
mr speaker when united airlines announced it was going to go into bankruptcy the democratic members of the committee on education and the workforce planned an ehearing so those people who were most affected by the termination of that plan and the bankruptcy of that company would have an opportunity to talk to their representatives in congress
mr kenneth schmidt a longtime employee of united from goodyear arizona wrote dear congressman i had worked at united for 38 years when i retired in february of 2003
i worked midnights for many years and in doing so i missed many of my family gatherings and holidays
this was what i chose to do in life and i did it with no complaints
but now i am faced with large cuts in my retirement benefits
this is a sad time in this country for all the workers who are what the problem is is that this legislation does nothing for the kenneth schmidts of the world he and his family
it is about competition and a change in the marketplace
in fact the people from the pbgc wrote and said that they thought the flight attendant plan could be salvaged and in fact maybe the others could
so we have pension plans that could have been salvaged and people who are being punished because of the federal law in terms of their early retirements and this bill does nothing to fix that
we do that in our motion to recommit
we address the concerns of the early retirees and we address the concerns of the airlines but it does not do that in the majority bill because they want to go off and use those people as trading chips the retirement nest eggs of these hardworking americans in the conference committee
mr speaker i ask unanimous consent to yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from maryland mr cardin xz4000640 for his control in this debate
yes i am mr speaker in its present form
mr speaker we offer this motion to recommit to address a number of issues that are not addressed in the legislation before us and to hopefully not do some of the things that the legislation before us does
that is not because we say it that is what the employers have told one another in their associations the expectation that some 60 percent of the employers will freeze or terminate their plans
the motion to recommit would require companies to seek alternatives to the termination and prove that a plan is in fact unaffordable before they can cast it away in bankruptcy as we saw united airlines do that cost the employees billions of dollars in pension benefits
importantly the motion to recommit would actually help the employees of american continental delta and northwest airlines whose pension plans are in danger of being terminated
it talks about doing that in the future
the motion to recommit would also protect 9 million workers who are covered by multiemployer pension plans in the construction food service and transportation industries
we would ensure that workers and executives would be affected equally in pension plans
again the horrible demonstration out of united airlines as the executives walked away with 235 million in a new debtfree company and the employees walked away with wage cuts and benefits cuts and the loss of retirement benefits
finally the motion to recommit would help workers who do not have access to defined benefit plans through the automatic enrollment in 401 k plans and the expanded savers credit
this legislation if it is not corrected is the greatest assault on the pension benefits and the retirement nest eggs of hardworking middle class americans in the history of this congress
one thing this legislation will do if you want to continue to debate social security you will now prove with the passage of this legislation that social security is the most secure retirement system in this country that it is the only one that people can count on because these other plans are in jeopardy
so this bill is now shuttled to the floor barely a word of consideration in the ways and means committee and the republicans on the rules committee would not grant us the opportunity to offer an alternative
the committee on investment of employee benefit assets a group that represents chief investment officers from the larger corporations in the country recently conducted their own survey and concluded that if this were to pass 60 percent of those employers would either freeze or terminate their pension plans
everybody knows the most robust debate in america next year is going to take place over retirement security
mr speaker i rise in strong support of the pension protection act hr 2830 legislation that responds to the many challenges currently facing the financial health of the defined benefit pension system
after all the average working man in rural georgia deserves nothing less than a corporate executive in new york
over the years union leaders have exerted tremendous pressure on employers in every commercial sector by negotiating benefit increases to defined benefit plans that are already underfunded
in addition the compromise measure includes a series of requirements to address critical multiemployer plans funded between 65 percent and 70 percent
mr speaker the number of employer sponsored defined benefit plans are declining by the day down from an alltime high of 170 000 in 1985 to 30 000 today
in particular i was hoping to vote on an amendment protecting united airline retirees from having their pension benefits reduced or terminated even though united expects to make 1 billion in profit within 1 year of being discharged from bankruptcy
madam speaker i see the chairman of the committee on education and the workforce is in the chamber
trying to get this right ought to be a shared purpose and so how dare you participate in a process that does not give us a substitute
there are issues that we put forward in our substitute that were important for consideration by this body
the majority voted to pass a budget reconciliation that added another 56 billion in deficit
this adds an additional 70 billion in deficit
177 billion in deeper deficits
this is the estimate of the chief investment officers in an organization known as civa
now they are after pensions and without question this will dismantle pensions in the very same way they tried to dismantle social security
i was stunned when the chairman announced in a colloquy his lines of communication are open
the democrats had an alternative that had airline relief in it
you think you are going to be treated fairly in conference committee
there is nothing in the bill for airline relief
as my friend from north dakota on the other side of the aisle just pointed out relief for the pension plans of america s struggling airlines is not in the current house bill
northwest airlines is the largest employer in the third congressional district of minnesota and thousands of northwest employees are counting on congress to rescue their pension plan
the demands that are going to be made on employers to reach sometimes the increase of 240 percent in making contributions to these plans will cause many of them to drop the plan and go into bankruptcy
some people will have to make political choices today in terms of support of this because there are some vested interest people that need shortgain satisfaction
if you look at actuaries and people who have studied this they realize that so few pensions are now protected by the pbgc and in the future many less will be protected
many of the bills that are coming to this floor are brought to see which people are going to vote against the title of the bill and pay a price for that at the polls or whether some are secure enough to vote against the substance of the bill that in the long term is going to adversely affect our workers
at this time with the house permission i would like to turn the balance of my time over to congressman ben cardin from maryland who has spent a lot of time on pensions and can share with the house the pitfalls that we have in this bill before the house today
we have a pension system that has some loopholes where companies could not put money in their pension plan when they needed to to make them funded and then we have a system that disincentivizes companies from putting more money in their pension plan to prefund the workers and employees when they have one and they have the will to do so
because of this the issues surrounding credit balances plant shutdown benefits and those things that were raised by the auto sector by the uaw have been addressed in this legislation are being addressed in this manager s amendment
i opposed this bill in committee
mr speaker i rise in strong opposition to hr 2830 the socalled pension protection act
among other harmful provisions this bill would legalize age discrimination in cash balance pension conversions
mr speaker we do not tolerate discrimination in this country based on race gender religion or disability and we must not tolerate discrimination based on age with regard to pensions
according to the aarp we can not support legislation that would clarify the legal status of cash balance pension plans without providing protections for older longservice workers involved in cash balance plan conversions i urge a no vote
we all know that delta airlines is in a bankruptcy fight fighting for its very life and the two most critical issues that they need help on is doing something to lower the high cost of fuel which we have problems with and how we can do it
now i m asking your help to help my people in georgia
one area that remains to be addressed in conference are major airlines pension plans
delta air lines employs thousands of men and women in my district who rely now or plan to rely in whole or in part on retirement benefits provided by delta
without a change in current law that allows delta and other air carriers that have defined benefit plan obligations like northwest continental and american to make their pension payments over a longer period of time 20 years it s certainly a possibility that some or all of these plans will be terminated benefits reduced and liability shifted to the taxpayer
although we are not addressing this specific need today i strongly support continued pursuit in conference of an airline specific provision similar to that passed by the senate extending the payment period for these carriers to 20 years
i want to thank chairman boehner for your hard work in making this reform bill a reality and look forward to working with the conferees
mr speaker i rise again in support of this important legislation
as i mentioned before delta airlines employs thousands of men and women in my district and other airlines in many of your districts throughout this country rely now or plan to rely in whole or in part on retirement benefits provided by delta
without a change in current law that will allow delta and other airline carriers that have defined benefit plans and obligations like northwest continental and american to make their pension payments over a longer period of time 20 years then it is a certainty that some or all of these plans will be terminated
i know that is not the main item on the agenda but this is the only vehicle we have that we can use in conference to fix the situation
the comparison to iraq is just such an egregious misrepresentation of american democracy to anybody in the world who is watching this
we sat in the education committee for days into the late hours of the night taking amendment after amendment
it means that we spent in the areas of the subcommittee and the committee working this for years working through committee and bringing the document to the floor with many compromises in it
now i share some of the concerns of my colleague from california because i have had a frustration in watching people who work their whole life see their pensions reduced or eliminated at the time some of the executives have enriched themselves
secondly as a representative of the number one manufacturing district in america i have more manufacturing jobs and percentage of the work force in my district in manufacturing than any other i was very concerned about some of the provisions and how this might relate to gm
i very much appreciate the leadership of chairman boehner in our committee of working first the process through so that people have the hopes of pension
we have the same problem in social security
we have this in medicare
we have this in any savings program where we assumed there was going to be a huge work force paying in and now it is a declining work force paying into a huge retirement population
that is a pretty big accomplishment to have a pension bill supported by the uaw and gm and i want to commend the leadership of the education committee chairman boehner and the chairman of the ways and means committee for working out this critical thing so that management does not get crippled in their ability to put funds in to strengthen these pensions
if plans are underfunded this bill will force companies to make up their shortfall in 7 years
further by requiring employers that terminate their pensions in bankruptcy to pay an annual premium of 1 250 per participant to the pbgc for the 3 years after they emerge from bankruptcy this bill makes terminating pension plans a less attractive option for employers
mr chairman i have the largest manufacturing district in the country and many union members let me know their concerns with this bill in its original form
the agreement that chairman boehner reached with the uaw requires companies to use all the money in their plan before they can freeze benefits and limit accruals
this will prevent companies from gaming their funded status in order to deliberately trigger these benefit restrictions
mr speaker i rise today in strong opposition to hr 2830 which would be better titled the republican pension destruction act
recent bankruptcies in the airline industry shed a bright light on exactly what big corporations are up to
unbelievably in the same bankruptcy proceedings united airline s ceo glen tilton was allowed to keep his 45 million pension
this is unacceptable and the bill offered today does nothing to prevent ceos from opening these golden parachutes while their employees are forced to take a reduction in their benefits
and in a final slap in the face to hardworking taxpayers the bill adds 71 billion to the deficit over the next 10 years because republicans refuse to be fiscally responsible and pay for their reforms
this republican pension bill undermines retirement security and puts the once guaranteed pension benefits of millions of hard working americans in jeopardy
madam speaker i appreciate the chairman rising to engage me in a colloquy
as you remember back during the committee i spoke about shutdown benefits and appreciate the work that you and chairman thomas have done in the last couple of days to deal with stakeholders in that industry
however the language contained in the bill does not quite go far enough i believe in helping everybody in every industry
mr chairman as i have told you before my father worked in the manufacturing business as an employee for over 20 years
he was a member of the steel workers and one day when i was in high school he came home and was out of a job which is traumatic enough but he was also out of a pension
we spent a great deal of this past year fighting any efforts to privatize social security and making sure that we had that leg in place
with respect to pensions we are in need of serious reform but this moves us in the wrong direction
we have millions of americans who have worked and tried to put their houses in order tried to make sure when they retired they had a dignified and comfortable living but this situation shows us over and over again that companies are now finding it better for themselves financially to go into bankruptcy capsize their pension responsibilities and then sometimes coming out more profitable for the shareholders and for some of the ceos but not for the rankandfile workers
in too many instances these companies are defaulting without first having made every possible effort to finance these pension plans and making them work
workers on the other hand have had decades of working for companies providing loyal service the bargain for which was that in the end they would have a guaranteed pension
this bill does not seem to do anything to discourage the pension plan terminations that threaten workers retirement security and it does not stop companies from dumping plans in bankruptcy
in committee we offered an amendment that would allow the pension benefit guaranty corporation to intervene earlier to work with companies in making sure they first exhausted all their options for making sure the plans survived before permitting them to terminate the plans and go into bankruptcy
we would have gotten a majority of people in this chamber to understand that everything should be done that is possible to prevent a plan from going into bankruptcy before the plan is actually terminated
companies should first have to exhaust every single avenue of creative financing in order to save and restore pensions before they allow bankruptcy filings
for those reasons and many others mr speaker i urge we vote against this bill and hope we get a better vehicle in the future
however the republican leadership has made it impossible for even a single amendment to be considered and the bill s flaws so outweigh its good features that it should not be passed in its current form
and both the congressional budget office and pbgc have concluded that the bill would increase claims on the federal government by billions of dollars which would increase the likelihood of a massive taxpayer bailout as well as the loss of billions of dollars in employee and retiree benefits
i am not prepared to support legislation that would increase the chances of such outcomes especially when its tax provisions would substantially increase future budget deficits and would primarily benefit taxpayers in the highest income groups
according to the joint committee on taxation the revenue effects of the tax provisions primarily benefiting higherincome households would grow from 36 billion in 2012 the first full year affected to 56 billion a year by 2015
but the effect of extending the saver s credit which is most important to lowerincome honseholds would fall from 14 billion in 2008 the first full year affected by that provision to 943 million by 2015
that means that while in 2012 the saver s credit would account for onefourth of the total benefits of all of these provisions by 2015 it would account for only 14 percent of the total benefits
and incorporating regressive tax policy of this nature into a bill that swells budget deficits and opens the door to still more deficitincreasing tax cuts in the future stands sound policy on its head i think they are right
and in addition to badly framed provisions the bill s flaws also include some serious omissions
i am particularly disappointed there is nothing in the bill like the bipartisan senatepassed provisions to protect the pensions of employees and retirees of airline companies
as coloradans know all too well the employees and retirees of united airlines already have lost 3 billion in earned pension benefits
in summary mr speaker while i recognize that there are good aspects to this bill and while i think congress does need to act on this subject i think that on balance the bill as it stands should be rejected so that a betterbalanced measure can be brought forward
madam speaker i rise today in strong opposition to the restrictive rule for hr 2830 the pension protection act and i ask my colleagues to join me in opposition
in terms of the amendments i offered last night to the rules committee the first set essentially said that the funds in retirement accounts are the workers money and employees ought to have a voice in single employer pension plans regarding the management of those moneys
a case in point was in united airlines negotiations the unions of the company were still bargaining and the pbgc came in and unilaterally assumed that pension
adelphi headed by mr smith who also was at bethlehem steel when they went bankrupt and they dumped their pensions over really has no interest in going out of business
mr speaker i rise today in strong opposition to this restrictive rule for hr 2830 the pension protection act and i ask that my colleagues join me in opposition
last night in the rules committee i offered four amendments that i believe would have made this a better bill none of which were found to be in order
furthermore this restrictive closed rule does not even make in order a substitute measure authored by ranking members miller and ran gel
in a time when delphi will be awarding 500 executives bonuses of 30 percent to 250 perce nt of their base salaries workers are seeing their pensions frozen i find it very troubling that the majority refuses to have a full and open debate on an issue so critical to our nation s retirement security
my first amendment would have put employee representatives on the trustee board of single employer pension plans which would ensure that employees have a voice in how their investments are managed
the growing significance of pension plans in the us economy has sparked a continued public debate over the control of pension fund investments
a generation ago congress took action to safeguard pensions in response to an enronlike debacle at studebaker
in order for pensioners to have a more complete understanding of the health of their pension fund it is necessary to provide full and accurate information on a timely basis
my third amendment would make it more difficult for companies to abuse the bankruptcy process in order to dump their pension obligations
this legislation would make it more difficult for financiallyviable companies to engage in pension dumping to increase their longterm profits
in certain instances the maximum amount the pbgc will pay is less than the original amount promised by the pension
my final amendment would have made the cost of the pension payment gap an administrative expense for the company which would make it easier for pensioners to collect the missing funds in bankruptcy court
in cases where the company goes bankrupt and the pbgc payment is less than the original amount promised pensioners deserve to be near the front of the line when it comes to collecting debts from the company in bankruptcy court
mr speaker i rise today in opposition to hr 2830
i am old enough to remember a time when everyone on my block in the glen park section of gary indiana had a pension
the number of defined benefit plans has declined from over 100 000 in 1985 to under 32 000 in 2004
the pbgc is already facing a deficit of 23 billion and could face additional liabilities of up to 100 billion in the near future
in the five years leading up to the closings of ltv and bethlehem steel steel companies in north america were filing for bankruptcy in record numbers using the bankruptcy courts to break their contractual obligations and impose cuts or outright elimination of jobs benefits pensions and wages of steelworkers
in 2000 ltv steel filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy for protection from its creditors including its obligations to its pension plan
in 2002 ltv filed section 7 bankruptcy which liquidated its assets
in addition hr 2830 does not ensure fair treatment between workers and executives
the bill permits ceos to receive executive golden parachutes at the same time employees are suffering deep cuts in their promised retirement benefits
under hr 2830 if an employer does not fund its pension plan above 80 percent then workers can not receive any increases in benefits or take a lump sum at retirement
however employers can get around this prohibition and make promises of future benefits to in closing mr speaker i urge my colleagues to oppose hr 2830
madam speaker i rise in support of this rule and the underlying bill
i believe this piece of legislation is one of the most important pieces of legislation that we will take up in the 109th congress and i do not believe it is getting an adequate level of public attention considering the enormity of the significance
in my 11 years in the house of representatives i have seen more and more the movement of our economy into a global economy where our us corporations are increasingly finding themselves having to compete no longer with other domestic corporations but foreign companies that operate under very very different rules in their domestic country of origin and particularly as it relates to pension plans
what i am getting at madam speaker is that we desperately need to modernize our pension laws and probably most importantly more than anything else we have seen tragically in recent years many workers come to their retirement years to find that their pension plans are insolvent that the company that had guaranteed them a retirement is bankrupt and increasingly that these pension plans are underfunded
but this is moving us in the right direction
i believe this is going to have ramifications for protecting our workers and making our companies more competitive in this global marketplace so we can increasing compete effectively and create jobs and protect jobs and defend the hardworking american people who are depending on these retirement plans to be there in their retirement years
mr speaker i rise in strong support of this rule and of hr 2830 the pension protection act of 2005
i sincerely appreciate the strong leadership today of mr hastings as he is certainly presenting this in a very positive manner
this legislation when enacted will provide the most significant reform of our pension system since the initial passage of erisa in 1974
rather than support pension reform that would aid american workers the democratic leadership continues its cynical and destructive strategy of opposing all substantive legislation in a futile attempt to influence public opinion against the republican congress
in fact they have planned their retirement future on that promise
in fact these workers have quite often given up pay raises or other benefits for their retirement security
madam speaker i rise in support of the rule and the bill
large and small businesses need changes to current law in order to have greater flexibility to help their employees plan for their financial security
this formula does not account for a changing marketplace and it does not result in the most benefit for workers
this pension protection act is a step in the right direction and it is important that congress pass it
i also look forward to the discussion with the chairman of the committee during the debate on the bill itself and highlight the need for reform in the airline industry which in my area and across this nation is so drastically calling out for reform
madam speaker would the chairman engage in a colloquy with me and my colleague the gentleman from minnesota mr kline xz4002240 concerning the difficulties facing the airline industry particularly in terms of assisting airlines and that they fulfill their pension promises to their employees
mr speaker i rise today in strong support of hr 2830 the pension protection act of 2005
this legislation represents a successful compromise that will help protect workers in the auto industry and also protect the major us auto manufacturers against loss of promised benefits or plan terminations
one area that remains to be addressed in conference is the issue of airline pension plans
thousands of men and women in kentucky s fourth district work for airlines
without a change in current law that allows air carriers with defined benefit plan obligations to make their pension payments over a longer period of time 20 years it is possible that some or all of these plans will be terminated benefits reduced and liability shifted to the american taxpayer
although we are not addressing this specific issue today i strongly support continued pursuit in conference of the senatepassed airline pension provision
i urge all of my colleagues to vote in favor of final passage
madam speaker i rise in strong support of this bill
mr speaker i rise in strong support of this rule and the pension protection act
i believe we have done so in this bill
they have spent countless hours in negotiations with employers employees unions and all other parties who have a dog in this fight
this bill strengthens current law and requires more accountability on the part of employers in funding their workers benefit plans
in addition to these reforms the bill ends excessive compensation for executives if an employer plan is severely underfunded
mr speaker like the president s wishful staged declaration of mission accomplished on that aircraft carrier 2 12 years ago or the vice president s declaration that the insurgency was in its final throes this resolution proclaims the desire of congress for victory in iraq
instead of dispatching our troops in adequate numbers this congress made one speech after another
i believe that victory in iraq which we all desire begins with a commitment to championing the truth
our young men and women in iraq and afghanistan understand that but this administration and its congressional followers demonstrate again and again that they do not when they are discussing the real weakness of the iraqi army or fail to do so the strength of the insurgency or the length our armed forces should be deployed
they are so proud of the democratic choices made in iraq this week and so very fearful for there to be any democratic choices on the resolution of the gentleman from california mr lantos xz4002310 and others
they fear a democratic debate in this house because their position is one of complete weakness
they have waved the white flag themselves at the possibility of a true debate in this congress
what we need is a genuine debate about the best pathway for our security in iraq
the president finally conceded over 30 000 civilians have died in this invasion
we have passed 2 000 young brave men and women in the service of america and we are on the way to 3 000
it has abandoned that in favor of a meaningless political victory not a real plan for success for the security of our families
has the president or your resolution been willing to declare that it rejects the idea of permanent bases in iraq
mr speaker given the stated interest in democracy here in the house i would ask unanimous consent to amend the rule to permit for division of the question so that we could express our unanimous support for the various provisions of this resolution except for that on which we have disagreement as to the best way to achieve success in iraq
at this point so that we can have the kind of democracy that occurred this week in iraq of which the majority seems so proud and actually have it right here on the floor of the house i ask unanimous consent for a division of the question on the provisions of this resolution
given his professed interest in democracy i am sure he will yield for that unanimous consent
mr speaker yesterday was an extraordinary day not only in the history of iraq but the history of the world
we saw the third free and fair election take place in the country of iraq and for the first time in the history of that nation we saw the people of iraq choose their own leaders
on january 30 of this year there were many people who thought it could not happen there were many terrorist attacks and it actually was slow in coming
as you will recall the pictures that we saw of voting stations where early on no one voted but ultimately 85 million iraqis voted to put into place a coalition government that was charged with the task of fashioning a constitution a constitution that would work to bring together the very disparate factions that exist within iraq the three that we know of the shia the sunni and the kurdish populations and of course the other divisions that exist in the country
and then we saw the october 15 election rapidly approach and people from all over the world including leaders of the us forces there were uncertain as to whether or not the iraqi people would in fact ratify their constitution
the existence of that constitution called for parliamentary elections to take place and for as i said the first time in the nation s history we yesterday saw the iraqi people choose their own leaders a 275member parliamentary assembly
we thought that there would be wideranging terrorist attacks when in fact there were very few if any difficulties with the election at all when it came to attacks
mr speaker 11 million iraqis voted in this election
and i should say parenthetically that our thoughts and prayers are with chairman hyde right now as he is going through a very difficult situation in his family
but in his absence i know that from the international relations committee our colleague from miami ms roslehtinen xz4003440 came before the rules committee last night and testified on behalf of this resolution and she was joined by the distinguished ranking member of the committee on international relations mr lantos xz4002310
the resolution reads as follows mr speaker expressing the commitment of the house of representatives to achieving victory in iraq
whereas the iraqi election of december 15 2005 the first to take place under the newly ratified iraqi constitution represented a crucial success in the establishment of a democratic constitutional order in iraq
the united states house of representatives is committed to achieving victory in iraq 2
the continued presence of united states armed forces in iraq will be required only until iraqi forces can stand up so our forces can stand down and no longer than is required for that purpose 6
setting an artificial timetable for the withdrawal of united states armed forces from iraq or immediately terminating their deployment in iraq and redeploying them elsewhere in the region is fundamentally inconsistent with achieving victory in iraq 7
the house of representatives has unshakable confidence that with the support of the american people and the congress the united states armed forces along with the iraqi and coalition forces shall achieve victory in iraq
there was no strategy no plan for victory in iraq
i got as i know all my colleagues did this 35page document that was put forward by the president as he began his campaign in the past several weeks to enlighten the american people on what our strategy for victory in iraq is
now there are many who believe that this is some great revelation but the lead page of this 35page document mr speaker refers to a speech that was delivered 3 weeks actually about 3 12 weeks before we began our military engagement in iraq
in february of 2003 president bush said as follows the united states has no intention of determining the precise form of iraq s new government
all iraqis must have a voice in the new government and all citizens must have their rights protected
we will remain in iraq as long as necessary and not a day more now that was stated by president bush on february 26 of 2003 and i commend this document to my colleagues in which it refers to the fact that we have seen extraordinary achievements take place since we began our effort in iraq
the positive salutary effect of what the united states of america the iraqi security forces and our coalition forces have done has had i believe an extraordinarily positive impact on nations like egypt that for the first time in its history held as i was told by the defense minister of egypt because of what we have done in iraq they held multicandidate elections in lebanon where we have seen people because of what we have done in iraq standing up for the cause of freedom say that they will give their lives to ensure that the syrians do not control their country
mr speaker it is also important to note that we continue to live in a very dangerous world and that region of the world is particularly dangerous
we underscore the fact that the iraqi security forces the united states of america and our coalition played a critical role in finally bringing about the selfdetermination which the people of iraq are now enjoying and it makes it clear that the region is still a very dangerous spot on our globe and that any kind of artificial timetable that were put into effect calling for our withdrawal would undermine the tremendous successes that we have been able to see over the past nearly 3 years and i believe could jeopardize the future of these people who are just now getting a taste of the kind of freedom that we take for granted
seventyone percent of the iraqis polled said that their lives were very good or quite good 61 percent reported the security situation is very good or quite good in the area where they reside 64 percent said they expect their lives to be much or somewhat better a year from now
the iraqi president jalal talabani made it very clear in an editorial that he wrote in the wall street journal
mr speaker i yield myself such time as i may consume to respond to my very good friend from california by saying first and foremost there is nothing ugly and divisive about the debate that we are about to undertake that we are in the midst of right now number one
6 clause in the resolution which was the language that i read which says that we can not establish an artificial timetable for withdrawal which is exactly what president talabani said in his piece number one
and number two it underscored the fact that there was a desire from the minority to change the goal of achieving victory to establishing stability in iraq
mr speaker i think it is very important for us to note that there should be in fact complete bipartisanship in our goal to not have an artificial timetable complying with the request of our men and women on the ground there along with president talabani as well as making sure that we achieve victory in iraq
i am convinced mr speaker that at the end of the day an overwhelming majority of the house of representatives will support this because we want to do more than simply pat our men and women in uniform on the back and pat the iraqi people on the back
i will in just a moment
it recognizes the sense of the men and women in uniform who are on the ground there
i do nt know that every republican is going to vote in support of this resolution but this resolution underscores the importance of victory in iraq
i would like to say that in this session of congress more amendments offered by democrats have been made in order than amendments offered by republicans
i would like to share with my colleagues since we are talking about the process of democracy in iraq and the process of democracy here in the united states of america and in the people s house according to the congressional research service they state on simple resolutions simple resolutions express nonbinding opinions on policies or issues the sense of the house or senate or deal with the internal affairs or prerogatives of the house
in the house the rules committee reports its special rules in the form of simple resolutions this is a simple resolution which i believe is going to enjoy strong bipartisan support
democrats and republicans will i believe in overwhelming numbers support this resolution which simply says mr speaker that we recognize the incredible sacrifice by our troops we recognize the incredible sacrifice and suffering that the iraqi people encountered under saddam hussein and the struggle that they have gone through over the past 3 years
and it recognizes what has been clearly stated by iraq s president by our men and women in uniform and by the people of iraq and that is establishing some artificial timetable would undermine the process of democracy
one must look at the letter which has gotten a great deal of attention that was sent from the number two operative in al qaeda mr zawahari to the lead operative for al qaeda in iraq the center of terrorism from zarqawi
and he has said in that letter democracy is coming and there will be no excuse for violence thereafter
if there is controversy i believe that recognizing our strategy for victory in iraq is the right thing to do
people in iraq our men and women on the ground recognize that
i believe it is the right thing to do and i look forward to a strong and overwhelming bipartisan vote in support of this resolution
and it is very very clear that the president of iraq has said that any kind of artificial timetable would in fact jeopardize the prospect of democracy
reclaiming my time i will say that the president has said in that speech that we will remain in iraq as long as necessary and not 1 day longer
there have been 113 rules considered on the house floor in the first session of the 109th congress
we allow for a free floor in debate
more democratic amendments than republican amendments have been made in order
so we are enjoying democracy right here in the people s house and the people of iraq are enjoying the same
mr speaker as i have been listening to this debate which has been taking place over the past hour a name sticks in my mind
blecksmith is a young marine who was tragically killed in one of the biggest battles in iraq a year ago last month
it was the battle of fallujah and since he died i have gotten to know his family and his parents have repeatedly said to me personally have gone on television and said this that in the name of their courageous son who is a marine killed in the battle of fallujah it would be absolutely reprehensible for the united states of america to cut and run for us to leave iraq on some artificial timetable
it simply says while congratulating the iraqi people for this overwhelming success that they had yesterday congratulating our men and women in uniform and the iraqi security forces and the coalition forces it says basically what president talabani of iraq has said in a wall street journal editorial
the resolution says setting an artificial timetable for the withdrawal of united states armed forces from iraq or immediately terminating their deployment in iraq and redeploying them elsewhere in the region is fundamentally inconsistent with achieving victory in iraq
i can not understand why anyone would believe mr speaker that we can not come together with a strong bipartisan vote making sure that the success that we enjoyed on january 30 and october 15 and just yesterday in iraq is sustained
so let us do everything within our power to support this resolution to support our troops to support the sustained victory of the people in iraq
the material previously referred to by mr mcgovern xz4002630 is as follows previous question for h res 619 the rule for h res 612 expressing the commitment of the house of representatives to achieving victory in iraq amendment in nature of substitute strike all after the resolved clause and insert resolved that upon the adoption of this resolution it shall be in order without intervention of any point of order to consider in the house the resolution h res 613 congratulating the people of iraq on the three national elections conducted in iraq in 2005

last night i made the statement in the rules committee that i would not participate in the debate
we come here to advocate for democracy in iraq as rightly we should
i quite frankly am a bit surprised that so many people in the majority who argue that the war should not be politicized have done an act although subtle and nuanced that is as political as most things that we do here
there is no one in this congress that does not support the military of the united states in every aspect of what it has done
there is no one in this congress that wants us to fail in achieving victory in iraq and anywhere that terror exists in this world
we have a vested interest in that
in that light i consider it to be the kind of act that is seemingly becoming the pattern with so many people in this house who represent so many constituents who are not being heard
mr speaker in 20 seconds i put to the chair a simple question if this resolution is so simple and noncontroversial why did it come through the rules committee
mr speaker the odds of success in iraq are not enhanced by congress continuing to act as a rubber stamp for president bush
we need a change in strategic vision in iraq
this resolution says that setting a timetable somehow is a communist plot but in fact the president himself set timetables in iraq when he set timetables to have transitional elections in iraq
he set timetables for elections because it focused the iraqis to demand performance and that is what we should do in setting a timetable to transition to iraqis true sovereignty for three reasons
let me ask you this if there is a young unemployed man who is angry about foreign troops marching on his neighborhood what do you think will make him more angry and more likely to plant an ied the fact that we tell him we are going to leave in a year or so or tell him we are going to stay there as long as george bush says so
the third reason we ought to think about this is that in our briefings we have received we have been told that the iraqi military will be fully trained by next december 2006 and it is realistic it is commonsense it is a measure to focus the iraqi politicians on the necessity of seeking compromise to say that we should begin transitioning next year and substantially conclude by december 2006
mr speaker i rise in sorrow not in anger because this morning could be a morning of unity and celebration and congratulations
yesterday in unprecedented numbers the people of iraq rejected the threats and intimidation of the terrorists and chose a new permanent national parliament the first fully sovereign elected democratic assembly in the history of iraq
mr speaker we all know that there is a spectrum of views on my side of the aisle on how to deal with the difficult situation in iraq in the weeks and months ahead
but the leadership in a rigid unbending almost ruthless fashion refused to take one single word of change or modification in their resolution
it was a takeitorleaveit proposal which is inappropriate in a democratic legislative body where some of us have been attempting to operate in a bipartisan fashion
i introduced a resolution and asked the rules committee to make it in order
instead by rigidly demanding total adherence to the republican formula there will be an ugly divisive debate in this body this morning
this is not in our national interest
the text of my resolution is as follows h res 613 whereas the people of iraq have consistently and courageously demonstrated their commitment to democracy by participating in three elections in 2005 lt p gt amp nbsp amp nbsp amp nbsp whereas on january 30 2005 the people of iraq participated in an election for a transitional national assembly lt p gt amp nbsp amp nbsp amp nbsp whereas all segments of iraqi society actively participated in the approval of a new iraqi constitution through a referendum held on october 15 2005 lt p gt amp nbsp amp nbsp amp nbsp whereas reports indicate that the people of iraq voted in unprecedented and overwhelming numbers in the most recent election held on december 15 2005 for a new national parliament that will serve in accordance with the recentlyapproved iraqi constitution for a fouryear term and that represents the first fully sovereign elected democratic assembly in the history of iraq lt p gt amp nbsp amp nbsp amp nbsp whereas this remarkable level of participation by the people of iraq in the face of dire threats to their very lives has won the admiration of the world lt p gt amp nbsp amp nbsp amp nbsp whereas the iraqi elections could not have been conducted without the courage and dedication of the members of the united states armed forces and the armed forces of other nations in iraq including the members of the security forces of iraq and lt p gt amp nbsp amp nbsp amp nbsp whereas the december 15 2005 election in iraq inspires confidence that a robust pluralistic democracy that will bring stability to iraqi society is emerging now therefore be it lt p gt amp nbsp amp nbsp amp nbsp resolved that the house of representatives lt p gt amp nbsp amp nbsp amp nbsp 1 congratulates the people of iraq on the three national elections conducted in iraq in 2005 lt p gt amp nbsp amp nbsp amp nbsp 2 encourages all americans to express support for the people of iraq in their efforts to achieve a free open and democratic society and 3 expresses its thanks and admiration to the members of the united states armed forces and the armed forces of other nations in iraq including the members of the security forces of iraq whose heroism permitted the iraqi people to vote safely lt p gt there is nt a member in this body who could not subscribe to this
the issue is that the last discussion of iraq in this body will show division bitterness and divisiveness and that could have been avoided with a little bit of flexibility and consideration on the part of the majority for the views of almost onehalf of this body
reclaiming my time it is in the national interest to show the greatest degree of unity in this body and your resolution does the opposite
mr speaker last night and this morning like all my colleagues i watched the news reports about the parliamentary elections in iraq
as has been stated by so many analysts in the news media one of the most important outcomes of this election was the significant participation for the first time of iraqi sunnis in this election many of whom according to news reports were encouraged to vote escorted to the polls or guarded at the polls by armed iraqi insurgents
everyone in the house of representatives is proud of the iraqi people
everyone in this house respects the efforts made by our uniformed men and women to help the iraqi people get to this historic moment
this house could have sent a strong unified message to the iraqi people our troops in iraq and to the international community in support of our troops and in support of the brave iraqi people
but mr speaker once again as it has so often done in the past this republican leadership has chosen to include controversial language in this resolution knowing that it will provoke sharp and divisive debate over iraq
late last night the ranking member of the house international relations committee one of the most respected leaders in this house on human rights congressman tom lantos came before the rules committee with a resolution that focused on congratulating the people of iraq for three successful elections conducted in iraq this year
the resolution further praises our troops for their contributions to peace and stability in iraq
shame on the majority to treat one of the most respected members of this body in such a fashion
mr speaker there are many points of view in this house about how the us should proceed in iraq
i for one believe these successful iraqi elections provide an opportunity for the united states to change course in iraq and begin bringing us forces home
as we pass the 1 000th day of the war in iraq i believe we must begin the transition to putting the iraqis in charge
after 3 years of war the united states claims for better or for worse the elimination of saddam hussein from power and that the united states has furthered the iraqi political process culminating in the passage of a constitution and now the first democratic election and iraq s first constitutional government
at this point plans for a full transfer of sovereignty to iraqis demands a change in course one that puts iraqis in charge
iraq ca nt move forward with 160 000 us troops the largest us embassy in the world and with iraqi public opinion behind a timetable for withdrawal
well the elections in iraq and the other milestones constitute a sufficient reason for the united states to declare that it has done all it can in iraq and it is time to reverse the bush administration s policies
according to a december 8 new york timescbs poll 59 percent of americans disapprove of the way president bush is handling the war in iraq and 70 percent do not believe that he has developed a clear plan to get american troops out of iraq
we have lost more than 2 100 soldiers dead and over 15 000 wounded overstretched our military placed our homeland and those of our allies at greater risk and still this president persists in a useless quest for quote victory
who decides when victory has been achieved in iraq
is it when we have lost 3 000 troops in iraq
how many more iraqi lives must be sacrificed before we decide that while most iraqis are confident in yesterday s parliamentary elections twothirds are opposed to the presence of us troops according to a poll released on december 12 by abc news and time magazine
according to news reports many of the sunnis turned out in such large numbers yesterday because they see it as a means to end the us occupation of their country
arab voices through the cairo process are helping change the dynamic in a positive way and are filling a role that the us no longer needs to play
unlike what is stated in this resolution there is nothing artificial about this approach
we do nt know a lot about democracy in this house because we are routinely shut out of being able to have debates and votes on important issues
i do nt believe it can succeed with the largest us embassy in the world over there
mr speaker i yield 3 minutes to one of the authors of the amendment that was rejected last night in the rules committee the gentleman from florida mr hastings xz4001701 my colleague on the rules committee
mr speaker to suggest that the rules committee respects a deliberative process in this house or that it is somehow democratic or receptive to alternative ideas i think demonstrates to me that the chairman has pretty low standards when it comes to being inclusive
i mean the chairman may be on board with what the president is doing in iraq but there are many of us who have great concerns
and the fact of the matter is the section that is controversial in this bill deserves debate not in the context of this resolution but we should be on this floor debating this for a period of time and let everybody have their chance to present their viewpoint on what our policy should be in iraq
we have spent hundreds of billions of dollars and we do not like to talk about it except in the context of these resolutions that kind of get dropped on us and brought to the floor and we are supposed to praise our troops which we all do
we want to congratulate the democratic voting in iraq which we all do
this administration has a credibility gap in my opinion when it comes to iraq
it is not acceptable to embrace an openended us policy toward iraq that suggests that we put all our faith in the president
we are stuck in a mess
mr speaker i will also point out to the chairman of the rules committee that if you read the front page of today s washington post it says iraqi vote draws big turnout of sunnis underneath subheadline antius sentiment is motivator for many a majority of the people in iraq want us to begin the process of withdrawal and what you are asking us to do is to embrace a resolution that says we will be there for as long as the president wants us and that is unacceptable
the president does not know where we are going in iraq
let us talk about what our policy should be in iraq
let us come back next week or let us come back for a week in january and have this debate
let us discuss what in fact our policy should be in iraq
notwithstanding the fact that we have 160 000 troops over there that over 2 100 americans have died over there and 15 000 americans have been wounded tens of thousands of iraqis have been killed we have yet to have a real policy debate on this house floor about what course we should take in iraq
to bring a largely symbolic resolution to the floor and tuck in it this kind of policy statement give us an hour during the debate on the resolution to talk about everything that is not the way we should be doing business around here
this year in the 109th congress we have had 43 restrictive rules 22 closed rules plus three additional closed rules that were included in one rule h res 351 and we have had 11 open rules as far as appropriations bills
house resolution 613 was introduced last evening by international relations ranking member lantos the democratic leader pelosi democratic whip steny hoyer and the gentleman from florida mr hastings xz4001701 which expresses congratulations to the people of iraq on three national elections conducted in 2005
this amendment was offered in the rules committee early this morning but unfortunately it was rejected
mr speaker regardless of how members of this house feel about the war in iraq i think all of us want to congratulate the people of iraq for holding these historic elections and for getting out to vote despite the significant risks
we all want to congratulate our troops but quite frankly there is language in this bill that some of us consider inflammatory that some of us strongly disagree with and i would urge my colleagues to vote no on the previous question so that we can have a unified message and not a divisive message here in the house
mr speaker we have been in iraq now for over 1 000 days and i believe we must begin the transition to putting the iraqis in charge
our occupation in iraq complicates the transition to democracy
people can disagree with me on this but the fact of the matter is we should be debating this issue of how we deal with iraq not in an h res form but in a binding resolution here on the house floor
we have time to debate merry christmas resolutions here in the house but we never have the time to debate in a real way and in a meaningful way this war in iraq
we have sent thousands of our servicemen and women into harm s way in iraq
we have paid dearly for what the politicians in washington have decided to do
that is not good enough for anybody in this house
i thank the gentleman for yielding and i rise in strong support of this rule and the underlying resolution as well because this house must show our troops the iraqi people and our terrorist enemies that we are committed to achieving victory in iraq
josh serves in the 82nd airborne division with the 3rd of the 504th also proudly known as the blue devils
josh was wounded by an ied while serving with his unit in ramadi iraq
no this american hero wanted to talk to me about the progress being made on the ground in iraq and how well the new iraqi troops performed in the field and how committed the iraqis were to reclaiming their country from the terrorists
his proudest day in iraq was when he provided security in the iraqi election last october
he was disappointed that he was not in iraq right now with his unit providing security for yesterday s election and watching the left flank of his buddies
that is dedication what we expect and what we get from our brave men and women in uniform
yesterday s election was a great victory for the iraqi people more proof of an historic pivot in that part of the world and now is not the time to wave the white flag just as our iraqi allies begin the difficult business of forming a new democratic government
we must not let down all of our brave men and women in uniform who have served so remarkably
we can not let down over 11 million iraqis who yesterday stuck a finger in the eye of the terrorists as they stuck their finger in that blue ink
as a member of the international relations committee i rise in strong support of this resolution and take a moment to express our prayers and good wishes to the author of this resolution who labors at the side of his namesake at this very hour in a hospice in illinois
it was in no uncertain terms a victory for democracy in iraq
and it is my privilege and honor to rise this morning on this floor in support of the rule and the underlying resolution that confirms this great day in the history of freedom december 15 2005 when millions of iraqis defied terrorists to say yes to democracy
i stand also in support of the affirmative statements in this resolution that this house of representatives is committed to achieving victory in iraq and sees this election as a crucial victory for the iraqi people and a defeat for the terrorists in that country
it is also in this resolution an effort to state emphatically the rejection of the wisdom of an artificial time line and also to recognize the extraordinary sacrifices made by members of the united states armed forces and their families
this week at my office in muncie indiana a group of the citizens that i have the privilege of serving came to protest our military presence in iraq to urge the withdrawal as some have done and continue to do of our forces from this nation
and while it is their right to do so let me say emphatically it is my duty to stand with our commander in chief to stand with our soldiers in the field and to stand with the good people of iraq until we achieve a total victory for freedom in this nation
they are the names of the soldiers that i represented until they stepped into eternity who fell in operation iraqi freedom from eastern indiana
it is them and to their credit and to their grieving families that i rise in support of this resolution today
it is the sacrifices of over 2 000 american soldiers who laid down their lives for the freedom that we saw demonstrated in the streets of every corner of iraq yesterday that i support this resolution
mr speaker i am here today in support of the rule and the underlying resolution in very strong support
i am also proud to be the father of a son who served for a year in iraq
we should be proud that chairman hunter his son served in the marines for a year in mosul
mr skelton had a son serve in afghanistan in the war on terrorism
mr taylor xz4003992 of north carolina mr akin xz4000050 of missouri mr kline xz4002240 of minnesota ms roslehtinen xz4003440 of florida and mr saxton xz4003590 of new jersey all of us have had family members who have participated in the global war on terror and we are so proud of their successes
you do not do it in football you do not do it in politics
and you do not do it in a time of war
tens of thousands of german troops secretly were located in the ardennes forest attacked our troops in luxembourg in belgium and in germany itself and we lost 17 000 americans
it does nt change the fact that our troops are sitting ducks for the insurgents who have been emboldened not deterred by our military presence in iraq
if iraq is truly able to selfgovern then we have no business occupying their country and meddling in their affairs
then what is the continued justification for having our troops over there in harm s way
as i ve written to the president in a letter signed by 61 other members of the house the united states must also launch a diplomatic offensive recasting our role in iraq as reconstruction partner rather than military occupier
we must also lead the way in establishing an international peace commission to oversee the postwar reconciliation and coordinate peace talks between iraq s various factions
with the iraqi people having voted once again let s offer the ultimate vote of confidence in their democracy
