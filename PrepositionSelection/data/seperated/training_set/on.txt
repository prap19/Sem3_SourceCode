mr speaker i urge my colleagues to vote no on the resolution so that we do not allow this rules package to become law
it is my understanding that the speaker is reluctant to judge on matters of constitutionality
mr speaker on that i demand the yeas and nays
first i should say that the most important and necessary change regarding governance of the department of homeland security was made 2 years ago when we created a subcommittee on homeland security on the committee on appropriations
almost every activity of every federal agency has some relationship to homeland security and almost every activity of the department of homeland security impinges on the activities of other agencies
i know that it is very easy to denigrate arguments against a single centralized select committee on homeland security as so much turf fighting
mr speaker the chairman of the committee on standards of official conduct is correct when he says that ethics reform must be bipartisan and if the house is to have meaningful bipartisan ethics process changes of this magnitude can be made as they were in 1997 only after thoughtful careful consideration on a bipartisan basis
there has been no effort to look at the rules changes on ethics in a bipartisan manner
in 1997 when i cochaired the committee on ethics reform along with bob livingston the changes that we made were done after deliberation and after democrats and republicans working together came before the house and we did make major changes
yet this rules change which would allow after 45 days inaction to dismiss a complaint makes inaction action and it can be done on a very partisan basis
it guarantees a process will move forward in a bipartisan manner and in fact the committee on standards of official conduct has operated in a bipartisan manner because of the way the rules are configured
if this rule is changed you are making it much more likely that the committee on standards of official conduct will act in a very partisan matter because they will be able to delay for 45 days which does not take a lot of effort to figure out how to delay for 45 days
we have enough lawyers on the committee on standards of official conduct that will be able to figure out that one
and it will be done on a partisan basis that will leave a cloud on the member and a cloud on this institution
mr speaker we are making a terrible mistake here today by changing the rule in terms of the provision that would simply require no action after a 45day period because as the earlier speaker immediately preceding me indicated what we will have done is change a nonpartisan committee that is based on a nonpartisan process into one that provides for a partisan veto over action where the behavior of an individual member or members is at question
and when the american people understand very clearly that we now have a committee on standards of official conduct in which either side has a veto it will undermine the confidence of the people in our ethical process
we have operated on them
we will continue to defend our homeland and prosecute the war on terror without retreat and without excuses
we will provide our military and their families with the resources they need to do their heroic work on behalf of the nation they serve
we will work with our everexpanding coalition of the willing to secure the fledging democracies in afghanistan and iraq and with every political economic diplomatic and military tool at our disposal see the war on terror through to victory
we will continue to take on the threeheaded monster of overtaxation overlitigation and overregulation that cuts the legs out from every sector of our economy
too much is at stake too much depends on the success of this historic 109th congress
to my friends on the other side of the aisle i would remind them all that i know what it means to be in the minority to go into contentious votes certain of defeat to always react to an agenda set by opponents
in the 10 years since that vision was endorsed by our countrymen we have been honored to work with all members of the minority on one issue or the other to develop successful legislative coalitions
so i urge all members to support the rules package before us so we can immediately get to work on behalf of the men and women who sent us here
the source of the honor each of us rightfully feels today is our friends and families who have given us their love the american people who have given us their trust the men and women in uniform who put their lives on the line for us every day and our heavenly creator who knitted us together in the womb
mr speaker as has been the case for a number of years the rules package put forward by my republican colleagues continues to trample on the rights of the minority
it will do nothing to stop the abusive practices in this house such as the 3hour vote on the medicare bill in the middle of the night
i would like to focus on one portion of the package that will create a permanent committee on homeland security
it used a careful process in which a committee on committees was created consisting of democrats and republicans
mr speaker let me respond by saying that the gentleman is absolutely right when he states that the chair does not rule on questions of constitutionality
i would also like to say that on this question that is being brought forward by my friend it is very clear to me based on statements that have been made by a wide range of constitutional scholars that what we are doing in the rules package that we are about to consider is in fact constitutional
in fact before the committee on rules the very distinguished former solicitor general walter dellinger said the following it is simply inconceivable that a constitution established to provide for the common defense and promote the general welfare would leave the nation unable to act in precisely the moment of greatest peril
no constitutional amendment is required to enact the proposed rule change because the constitution as drafted permits the congress to ensure the preservation of government let me further mr speaker say that the committee on rules intends to conduct further examination of the best way for the house to assure a continuity of government during a national emergency and it is our hope that as we proceed with this work that further discussions will take place with the members of that very distinguished panel the continuity commission which included our former colleague senator simpson and speakers foley and gingrich and former minority leader bob michel leon panetta kwasi mfume and i believe we will have a chance to proceed with this but i think it would be very appropriate for us to proceed with consideration of the rules package that we have
during the initial stages of compiling this rules package back in november the committee on rules received 40 different proposals from both democrats and republicans
in addition to that our committee staff has actively sought the input of the officers of the house its committees and its caucuses to get their perspectives on the kinds of changes we can make to facilitate the work of the house
mr speaker i include for the record at this point detail on each of these changes in a sectionbysection analysis
sectionbysection summary of h res 5 adopting house rules for the 109th congress the rules of the house of representatives for the 108th congress are adopted as the rules of the house for the 99th congress with amendments as provided in section 2 and with other orders as provided in section 3 a committee on homeland security
creates a standing committee on homeland security and grants it legislative and oversight jurisdiction
first the committee s jurisdiction includes overall homeland security policy so that it can focus on national policies affecting the federal government
adds to the required list of content included in each standing committee s adopted oversight plan as submitted to the committees on government reform and house administration a review of federal programs with a view to insuring against duplication of such programs
authorizes the chairman of the committee on rules to serve as chairman notwithstanding the prohibition on serving more than three consecutive terms
the rule allows for the house to conduct business with a provisional quorum only after a motion to compel members attendance as prescribed under clause 5 a of rule xx has been disposed of and the following occur in sequence without the house adjourning a a call of the house or a series of calls of the house totaling 72 hours without producing a quorum b the speaker with the minority and majority leaders receive from the sergeantatarms or his designee a catastrophic quorum failure report and shall consult with the minority and majority leaders on the contents of such report and shall announce the contents of such report to the house and c a further call of the house or series of calls are conducted for a total of 24 hours without producing a quorum
rule xxiv clause 8 j 4 gift rule on officially connected travel
expands the category of individuals who may accompany a member or staff person on such a trip at the sponsor s expense to include a relative of the member or the staff person
under a provision of the current gift rule clause 5 b 4 d of the house rule xxv a member or staff person may be accompanied on a privately funded officially connected trip at the sponsor s expense only by either his or her spouse or a child and not by any other relative
provides that no action will be taken on a complaint unless the chairman and ranking minority member of the standards committee or the committee itself find within 45 days that further investigation is merited by the facts of the complaint maintaining the presumption of innocence
currently if the chairman and ranking minority member take no action on a properly filed complaint within 45 days the matter automatically goes to an investigative committee
we are also making the ability to consider suspensions on wednesdays permanent in this congress after the very successful experiment we had with suspensions on wednesday in the 108th congress
and yes mr speaker in a change guaranteed to draw applause from my colleagues on both sides of the aisle the house rules will now allow us to make reference to the senate and its members so long as those references are confined to the question under debate and that they avoid personality
on another topic the package makes a series of changes to our ethics rules
we included two provisions suggested by the chairman and the ranking member of the committee on standards of official conduct number one clarifying the rule on officially connected travel to allow a family member other than a spouse or child to travel with the member at the sponsor s expense and two conforming the rules of the house to current law which allow the use of campaign funds to pay for certain official expenses such as cell phones
by the way we also have included a provision suggested by the distinguished gentleman from connecticut mr larson xz4002330 to conform the rules of the house to current law with regard to the 90day preelection limit on franked mail
let me say that we are going to be hearing from the distinguished chairman of the committee on standards of official conduct in just a few minutes mr speaker
as important as each of those changes are perhaps the most important change in this resolution will be as the speaker said in his very thoughtful opening statement here today the creation of a new standing committee on homeland security
and we saw the need for change over 2 years ago and we responded here first with the enactment of the homeland security act of 2002 and then with the formation of the select committee on homeland security
their final report a thorough and complete study of homeland security jurisdiction as it relates to house rules was transmitted to the committee on rules at the end of last year
i will in no way be responding in a manner which would infringe on that power of the speaker
once again i want to say on all of these issues and especially the last one which was a great challenge in trying to fashion a new committee on homeland security with jurisdiction that emerged from many other committees was not an easy task
i want to congratulate speaker hastert for the leadership that he has shown on this and i want to thank all of the committee chairmen who were involved in this process
i just want to say to the gentlewoman from rochester new york ms slaughter xz4003780 that every single member of this institution democrat and republican alike is very concerned and focused on the integrity of this institution and i believe that that is something which is an extraordinarily high priority for all of us
mr speaker i yield 2 minutes to the very distinguished gentleman from miami florida mr lincoln diazbalart xz4001070 my colleague on the committee on rules
let me say after having heard from two of my committee on rules colleagues that i anxiously look forward to working with them in a bipartisan way to try to proceed with the deliberations in consideration of measures of this house
mr speaker i yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from colorado mr hefley xz4001740 the distinguished chairman of the committee on standards of official conduct
i also will say as my friend said it is very clear that the gentleman from colorado mr hefley xz4001740 chairman of the committee on standards of official conduct has made it clear that he is supportive of this package
i and my colleagues looked at these recommendations all of which emerged from members and former members of the committee on standards of official conduct
mr speaker i am very happy to yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from new york mr boehlert xz4000350 the very distinguished chairman of the committee on science
on federal property is what the law says
mr speaker i ask unanimous consent that the chair may reduce to 5 minutes the minimum time for electronic voting on the motion to commit and the vote on the adoption of h res 5 if the votes immediately follow a 15minute vote notwithstanding intervening proceedings attending the administration of the oath of office to memberselect
mr speaker i ask unanimous consent that all members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks on this rules package
the reason i say it is deserving of bipartisan support is that is the word that has been used by members on both sides of the aisle to describe exactly what we have been doing here and should be doing here
it allows us to deal with the prospect of a horrendous attack on this institution and it allows us to continue this institution s operations so the american people will understand that this institution stands even at a time of great crisis
this rules package allows for the establishment of a new permanent standing committee on homeland security as the speaker outlined in his opening remarks here today
i believe that is something that will allow democrats and republicans to spend time working on that issue
the committee on standards of official conduct is the committee which has the responsibility of working to ensure the integrity of all of the members of this institution
i believe that the statement made by the chairman of the committee on standards of official conduct the gentleman from colorado mr hefley xz4001740 is very clear
in addition our committee staff has actively sought the input of the officers of the house its committees and its caucuses to get their perspectives on the kinds of changes we can make to facilitate the work of the house
while i will detail each of these changes in the sectionbysection that i will place in the record i want to elaborate on just a few of these changes
there are a number of instances where we are conforming the rules to reflect current house practice such as with the designation of leadership members of the budget committee and the taking of recesses in committee to allow flexibility on our schedules
we are also making the ability to consider suspensions on wednesdays permanent in this congress after our successful experiment in the 108th congress
on another topic the package makes a series of changes to our ethics rules
we included two provisions suggested by the chairman and ranking member of the standards committee 1 clarifying the rule on officially connected travel to allow a family member other than a spouse or child to travel with the member at the sponsor s expense and 2 conforming the rules of the house to current law which allow the use of campaign funds to pay for certain official expenses such as a cellphone
we also included provision suggested by the gentleman from connecticut mr larson to conform the rules of the house to current law with regard to the 90day preelection limit on franked mail
as important as each of those changes are mr speaker perhaps the most important change in this resolution will be the creation of a new standing committee on homeland security
and we saw the need for change over 2 years ago and we responded first with the enactment of the homeland security act of 2002 and then with the formation of the select committee on homeland security
the rules committee thoroughly reviewed the select committee s report and recommended a comprehensive and thoughtful reform effort that mirrors the recommendations of the 911 commission the formation of a permanent committee on homeland security
first referrals to the select committee on homeland security in the 108th congress will not be considered a precedent for referrals in the 109th congress
legislative history to accompany changes to rule x rule x and the committee on homeland security lt p gt amp nbsp amp nbsp amp nbsp legislative history overall homeland security policy the jurisdiction of the committee on homeland security over overall homeland security policy is to be interpreted on a governmentwide or multiagency basis similar to the committee on government reform s jurisdiction over overall economy efficiency and management of government operations and activities
surgical addresses of homeland security policy in sundry areas of jurisdiction occupied by other committees would not be referred to the committee on homeland security on the basis of overall homeland security policy jurisdiction
for example the committee on homeland security shall have jurisdiction over a bill coordinating the homeland security efforts by all of the critical infrastructure protection sectors
organization and administration of the department of homeland security the jurisdiction of the committee on homeland security would apply only to organizational or administrative aspects of the department where another committee s jurisdiction did not clearly apply
homeland security oversight this would vest the committee on homeland security with oversight jurisdiction over the homeland security community of the united states
individual committee concerns agriculture the jurisdiction of the committee on homeland security over border and port security shall be limited to agricultural importation and entry inspection activities of the department of homeland security under section 421 of the homeland security act of 2002
the committee on agriculture shall retain jurisdiction over animal and plant disease policy including the authority reserved to the department of agriculture to regulate policy under section 421 of the homeland security act of 2002 and the animal health protection act the plant protection act the plant quarantine act and the agriculture quarantine inspection user fee account
the committee on agriculture shall retain jurisdiction over the agricultural research and diagnosis armed services the committee on armed services shall retain jurisdiction over warfighting the military defense of the united states and other military activities including any military response to terrorism pursuant to section 876 of the homeland security act of 2002
energy and commerce the committee on homeland security shall have jurisdiction over measures that address the department of homeland security s activities for domestic preparedness and collective response to terrorism
the committee on homeland security s jurisdiction over collective response to terrorism means that it shall receive referrals of bills addressing the department of homeland security s responsibilities for and assistance to first responders as a whole
the committee on energy and commerce and other relevant committees shall retain their jurisdiction over bills addressing the separate entities that comprise the first responders
for example the committee on energy and commerce shall retain its jurisdiction over a bill directing the department of health and human services to train emergency medical personnel
financial services the committee on financial services shall retain jurisdiction over the national flood insurance program and emergency food and shelter program of fema and the defense production act
the committee on financial services shall retain its jurisdiction over the antimoney laundering terrorist financing and anticounterfeiting activities within the department of the treasury and the financial regulators
government reform the committee on homeland security shall have jurisdiction over the organization and administration of the department of homeland security the committee on government reform shall retain jurisdiction over federal civil service the overall economy efficiency and management of government operations and activities including federal procurement and federal paperwork reduction
the committee on government reform shall retain jurisdiction over governmentwide information management efforts including the federal information security management act
the committee on homeland security shall have jurisdiction over intelligence the permanent select committee on intelligence shall retain jurisdiction over the intelligence and intelligencerelated activities of all departments and agencies of the federal government including the office of the director of national intelligence and the national counterterrorism center as defined in the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act of 2004
judiciary the committee on the judiciary shall retain jurisdiction over immigration policy and nonborder enforceme4tn of the immigration laws
the science the committee on science shall retain some jurisdiction over the research and development activities of the department of homeland security as such matters are incidental to the committee on science s existing jurisdiction except where those activities are in the jurisdiction of another committee
transportation and infrastructure the committee on transportation and infrastructure shall retain jurisdiction over the coast guard
however the committee on homeland security has jurisdiction over port security and some coast guard responsibilities in that area will fall within the jurisdiction of both committees
jurisdiction over emergency preparedness will be split between the committee on transportation and infrastructure and the committee on homeland security
the committee on transportation and infrastructure shall retain its jurisdiction under clause 1 r 2 over federal management of emergencies and natural disasters this means that the committee retains its general jurisdiction over the emergency preparedness and response operations of the federal emergency management agency fema
bills addressing fema s general preparation for disaster from any cause shall be referred as indicated earlier the committee on homeland security s jurisdiction over collective response to terrorism means that it would receive referrals of bills addressing the department of homeland security s responsibilities for and assistance to first responders as a whole and not over measures addressing first responder communities individually
the committee on homeland security shall have jurisdiction over the functions of the department of homeland security relating to transportation security while the committee on transportation and infrastructure shall retain its jurisdiction over transportation safety
in general the committee on homeland security would have jurisdiction over bills addressing the transportation security administration and the committee on transportation and infrastructure would have jurisdiction over bills addressing the various entities within the department of transportation having responsibility for transportation safety such as the federal aviation administration and the federal motor carrier safety administration
the jurisdiction of the committee on homeland security does not ways and means the jurisdiction of the committee on ways and means over customs revenue is intended to include those functions contemplated in section 412 b 2 of the homeland security act of 2002 and includes those functions as carried out in collection districts and ports of entry and delivery
the secretary of homeland security shall provide a copy of all regulations so approved to the chairman and ranking member of the committee on ways and means and the chairman and ranking member of the committee on finance every six months
however immediately after taking any such action the secretary of homeland security shall certify in writing to the secretary of the treasury and to the chairman and ranking member of the committee on ways and means and the chairman and ranking member of the committee on finance the specific reasons therefor
the action shall terminate within 14 days or as long as the overriding immediate and extraordinary security threat exists whichever is shorter unless the secretary of the treasury approves the continued action and provides notice of such c the advisory committee on commercial operations of the customs service coac shall be jointly appointed by the secretary of the treasury and the secretary of homeland security
this delegation of authority is not intended to create or confer any right privilege or benefit on any private person including any person in litigation with the united states
this delegation is subject to review on may 14 2004
by march 15 2004 the secretary of the treasury and the secretary of homeland security shall consult with the chairman and ranking member of the committee on ways and means and the chairman and ranking member of the committee on finance to discuss the upcoming review of this delegation
mr speaker i yield back the balance of my time and i move the previous question on the resolution
the gentlewoman is correct i currently serve on the committee on standards of official conduct
the logical result is more partisan political pressure on the committee members
america was intended to be a city on a hill with the highest standards for the government in the world and sadly today we are lowering those standards
i do not enjoy serving on the committee
this bill was rushed to the floor ignoring the house rule requiring a 3day review period before voting on conference reports
only after the house voted on the bill careful scrutiny of the language uncovered a provision allowing certain members and staff access to any american s tax return
congress has also been asleep at the switch when it comes to funding for iraq and the war on terrorism
this administration continues to fund the war on terrorism by supplemental appropriations
congress needs to stand up to this white house stand up for honest budgeting and require that funding for iraq and the war on terrorism be made onbudget and through the regular appropriations process
i have had the privilege of serving on the committee on standards of official conduct since 1997 and have had an additional responsibility as serving as chairman since 2001
on the other hand since i joined the committee almost every significant decision i believe every significant decision has been made on a unanimous vote
despite the deletion of the amendment that i found the most objectionable to the code of conduct the rules package includes a number of provisions that would make major changes in the ethicsrelated rules but as to which neither the committee on standards of official conduct nor members outside the rules process were consulted
in 1997 the house through a bipartisan task force carefully studied the committee on standards of official conduct s enforcement procedures made a series of changes
when in 1997 the bipartisan task force report was before the house the house significantly rejected on a bipartisan vote of 181 to 236 an amendment that would have required automatic dismissal of any complaint after 180 days not 45 days
the reason for rejection of that amendment as set out in the floor debate is that such an artificial time limit on the life of a complaint would serve to encourage deadlock within the committee and partisanship among committee members
i could go on and on mr speaker
on this one issue let us act together on a bipartisan basis
we were told the president wants to proceed on a bipartisan fashion in the next 4 years to deal with the important issues that confront our nation
however on this first day the rules package is usually a partisan package
to be sure the american people who elected us to this great body can expect to see sharp differences on this floor over the substance of legislation
the proposed republican rules before us will seriously weaken the ability of the committee on standards of official conduct to enforce standards of integrity by providing that no action will be taken on a properly filed ethics complaint after 45 days unless the committee votes by a majority vote to take action
in sharp contrast however the rule before us will have a concrete demonstrable effect on every ethics complaint filed from this day forward
mr speaker the committee on standards of official conduct is the only mechanism that this institution has to police itself
i think he had the intellectual honesty and integrity on this floor when he spoke
therefore i urge my colleagues on behalf of the american people on behalf of the integrity of this institution on behalf of our commitment to ensure ethical conduct on behalf of the american people that this not be passed
mr speaker in accordance with clause 2 of rule xi of the rules of the house of representatives i am submitting the rules of the committee on armed services for printing in the congressional record
these rules were adopted on wednesday january 26 2005 at a public meeting of the full committee with a quorum being present
rules governing procedure of the committee on armed services the rules of the house of representatives are the rules of the committee on armed services hereinafter referred to in these rules as the committee and its subcommittees so far as applicable
each subcommittee is authorized to meet hold hearings receive evidence and report to the committee on all matters referred to it
pursuant to the authority granted by section 3 b relating to separate orders of h res 5 as adopted by the house of representatives on january 4 2005 the committee shall be organized to consist of six standing subcommittees with the following jurisdictions subcommittee on tactical air and land forces all army and air force acquisition programs except strategic weapons and lift programs special operations and information technology accounts

a the chairman may designate a panel of the committee consisting of members of the committee to inquire into and take testimony on a matter or matters that fall within the jurisdiction of more than one subcommittee and to report to the committee
a each hearing and meeting for the transaction of business including the markup of legislation conducted by the committee or a subcommittee shall be open to the public except when the committee or subcommittee in open session and with a majority being present determines by record vote that all or part of the remainder of that hearing or meeting on that day shall be in executive session because disclosure of testimony evidence or other matters to be considered would endanger the national security would compromise sensitive law enforcement information or would violate any law or rule of the house of representatives
d pursuant to clause 2 g 2 of rule xi of the rules of the house of representatives no member delegate or resident commissioner may be excluded from nonparticipatory attendance at any hearing of the committee or a subcommittee unless the house of representatives shall by majority vote authorize the committee or subcommittee for purposes of a particular series of hearings on a particular article of legislation or on a particular subject of investigation to close its hearings to members delegates and the resident commissioner by the same procedures designated in this rule for closing hearings to the public
a the time any one member may address the committee or subcommittee on any measure or matter under consideration shall not exceed five minutes and then only when the member has been recognized by the chairman or subcommittee chairman as appropriate except that this time limit may be exceeded by unanimous consent
any member upon request shall be recognized for not to exceed five minutes to address the committee or subcommittee on behalf of an amendment which the member has offered to any pending bill or resolution
a voting on a measure or matter may be by record vote division vote voice vote or unanimous consent
a if at the time of approval of any measure or matter by the committee any member of the committee gives timely notice of intention to file supplemental minority additional or dissenting views that member shall be entitled to not less than two calendar days excluding saturdays sundays and legal holidays except when the house is in session on such days in which to file such views in writing and signed by that member with the staff director of the committee

no point of order shall lie with respect to any measure reported by the committee or any subcommittee on the ground that hearings on such measure were not conducted in accordance with the provisions of the rules of the committee except that a point of order on that ground may be made by any member of the committee or subcommittee which reported the measure if in the committee or subcommittee such point of order was a timely made and b improperly overruled or not properly considered
the chairman shall notify the ranking minority member of any decision pursuant to clause 3 b 3 or clause 4 b of rule vii to withhold a record otherwise available and the matter shall be presented to the committee for a determination on the written request of any member of the committee
vote a resounding no on the resolution that is on the floor and i hope that we will come before our peers and recognize that ethics equals integrity
our colleagues on the other side of the aisle would like to completely gut and render ineffective the current rule xi which provides that a properly filed ethics complaint that has not been addressed by the chair and ranking member of the ethics committee gets referred to an investigative committee
the republican proposal would provide that unless the committee votes by majority to take action on a properly filed complaint no action will be taken after 45 days
the proposed rule x amendment to create a standing committee on homeland security on the other hand is a smart one
vote no on this resolution and yea on the motion to recommitt
it would also demolish a 99yearold precedent based on the constitution that a quorum of the house consists of a majority of the membership chosen sworn and living
for each house member deprived of the right to exert an impact on the work of the house either through physical presence in or absence from the chamber the approximately 600 000 persons represented by each member would be deprived of their rights to democratic representation in the legislative body structured to be closest to the american people
there are no other options no matter how inconvenient that fact may be for any faction on the floor of the house during a time of emergency
suppose that the presiding officer decided if a quorum of the majority of members failed to appear within a specified time period that members who were nt present on the house floor or any other designated place of meeting ceased to be members for purposes of determining a quorum
there is no constitutional requirement that a member must appear on the floor to maintain membership or that house membership can somehow lapse
it is surprising that some who only last year during debate on the continuity of representation act hr 2844 spoke eloquently about the status of a house consisting only of members elected by the people are now supporting a proposal to define those elected members out of existence
the house has never expelled or otherwise attempted to remove a sitting member on the grounds of disability
under the provisional quorum rule these members would presumably not be able to appear on the floor and would be automatically excluded from the provisional quorum
even though prospects for passage of a constitutional amendment were extremely slim a substantial debate would have served to educate the congress and the american people on the importance of these issues and perhaps provide impetus in a search for alternatives
mr speaker i plan to urge further action on congressional continuity issues in the new year to work with my colleagues on the committee on house administration to assert our own jurisdiction more effectively and to push other relevant committees to do the same
the conference is where the final compromises are made and the final statutory language on the bill s toughest issues is negotiated and drafted
in fact the case can be made that it is even more important that congress be fully informed and deliberate on that final product since that is the version that will become law because only a restricted group of house members participate in conferences and because conference reports can contain significant policy changes from the houseapproved version of a bill the standing house rules provide members a number of protections against the conference process
conference reports on major legislation run sometimes hundreds although conference reports are privileged and could come directly to the floor for consideration without a rule they are routinely considered under special rules because they are often in technical violation of one or more sections of rule xxii or the budget act of 1974
some of these conference reports reconfirm the truth of the old saying that the devil is in the details chairman dreier made this very same argument when as a minority rules committee member he opposed waiving the 3day layover on conference reports
he wrote the house and senate have been repeatedly embarrassed over the years by conference reports on voluminous pieces of legislation which have been voted on before even properly printed or distributed let alone understood
this provision would make it much more difficult for the committee on standards of official conduct to investigate allegations of wrongdoing by members of the house
under current rules if the ethics committee deadlocks on whether or not to pursue an ethics complaint against a member of the house the matter automatically goes to an investigative subcommittee
under the proposed change a complaint against a member would be tabled unless a majority votes to take action on it within 45 days
there is no doubt that if the proposed rule change had been in effect during the last congress no action would have been taken against the members of the house who were reprimanded as a result of the ethics committee s investigation of bribery allegations raised in connection with the vote on the medicare prescription drug act of 2003
i was listening to the debate on this earlier
why then is the majority leadership pursuing this change when it is opposed by the ranking republican on the ethics committee
the proposed rule change harms the integrity and credibility of the house as an institution and that reflects badly on all of us republicans and democrats alike
i urge all my colleagues to join me in opposing this assault on ethics enforcement in the house
i served for 8 years on the committee on standards of official conduct and it is not an enviable assignment
but members who have never served on the committee would be proud of how these tasks are approached
these rules will undermine the committee on standards of official conduct and the process of using the committee on rules rather than the committee on standards of official conduct to deliberate on the changes is also undercutting the committee on standards of official conduct
and i also want to mention on the homeland security provision of the rule it is a huge mistake to murky up the jurisdiction over cybersecurity
talk about starting off on the wrong foot
today is just one more example of the ethical lapses we have seen in this house a house where major legislation is now written by industry lobbyists a house where members are not even given the courtesy of being able to read bills before they are voted on and a house where bad behavior is not reprimanded but rewarded
that means not dancing around the law and that means conducting ourselves in a manner that reflects credibility on the house at all times
but the speaker s spokesman commented on this flipflop saying that the issue had become a distraction not wrong mind you but just distracting
but while republicans try to pull a fast one claiming that the majority leader fell on his sword for the good of his party the truth is that the rules package for the 109th congress still in a very meaningful way fundamentally weakens the ethics system here in the house of representatives
i urge my colleagues to vote no on this rules package
every house member should vote to put the house on record against ethical and procedural abuses that contaminate this institution
that s not hard to understood no one should be shaping public policy with an eye on a future private sector salary
let s be honest about it 99 percent of the american people outside the beltway will agree with both of these principles no negotiating for new jobs with special interests members should know what they are voting on before it becomes law
in fact a top aide to the republican leadership was quoted last january 24 on cnncom as saying that republican congressman tauzin s negotiation with pharma does nt look very good it does nt look very good today either as millions of seniors face higher drug prices thanks to the tauzin bill and bill tauzin takes office to improve the tattered image of the drug industry
and at the same time let s put an end to the outrageous practice of voting on complex and lengthy bills before congress has had time to read them bills like that prescription drug bill bill tauzin wrote while he was listening to pharma s whispers in his ears
without review by the public must we also vote on secret legislation without reading it without knowing the tax breaks and earmarked spending for special interests that have been stuck in without any review
last year when the ethics committee admonished delay three times it deferred action on another serious charge his role in funneling illegal soft money into texas races through his state pac until after the investigation against him had been completed
i urge a no vote on this unbalanced and improper rules package
mr speaker i would like to address the ethicsrelated provisions that are in this package at the insistence of the committee on rules
i had the honor of serving as ranking member of the committee on standards of official conduct in the last congress
it is true that the most outrageous ethics undermining provision has been deleted from the rules package but other provisions provisions that would make major changes in the way the committee on standards of official conduct handles enforcements of the rules they remain
how could there be a legitimate ethics process that is operated on a partisan basis
and to have a bipartisan process it is absolutely essential that any major changes in the rules be made on a truly bipartisan basis
until today the house has not attempted to make major changes in the ethics rules or the committee on standards of official conduct procedures in a slapdash way with literally only hours of consideration and on a party line vote
it will probably come as no surprise that the materials issued by the committee on rules that attempt to justify these amendments are based entirely on misstatements of the current rules
for example under the benign sounding heading restore presumption of innocence the committee on rules memorandum states currently if the chairman and ranking minority member take no action on a properly filed complaint within 45 days the matter automatically goes to an investigative subcommittee fine
the rules that have been in effect since 1997 clearly provide that at any time that a complaint is before the chairman and ranking member for consideration either one of them may place the complaint on the committee s agenda and when either one of them does that an investigative committee can not be established without a majority vote of the committee
under the heading due process for members the committee on rules memorandum states that under the current rule the chairman and ranking member or the committee may take action against a member without a complaint notice or the opportunity to be heard this statement clearly implies that the committee may determine that a member has committed a violation or impose a sanction without the member having such rights and that suggestion mr speaker is flatly wrong
when you turn to the actual text of the due process amendments you find that what these amendments are concerned with is not committee actions that impose sanctions or determine violations but instead on committee letters or statements that reference the official conduct of a member it may be well that the rules should provide certain rights to a member whose conduct is going to be discussed in a letter or statement that the committee issues publicly but what should those rights be
but one specific right that this proposed rule provides to those members is the right to demand an immediate trial in front of an adjudicatory subcommittee of the committee on standards of official conduct
i had the honor of serving as ranking member of the ethics committee in the last congress and i also served on the committee for 6 years during another time of controversy in the late 1980s
that point should be selfevident how could there be a legitimate ethics process that is operated on a partisan basis
and to have a bipartisan process it s absolutely essential that any major changes in the rules be made on a truly bipartisan basis
until today the house has not attempted to make major changes in the ethics rules or the ethics committee procedures in a slapdash way with literally only hours of consideration and on a partyline vote
it will probably come as no surprise that the materials issued by the rules committee that attempt to justify these amendments are based entirely on misstatements of the current rules
for example under the benignsounding heading restore presumption of innocence the rules committee memorandum states and i quote currently if the chairman and ranking minority member take no action on a properly filed complaint within 45 days the matter automatically goes to an investigative subcommittee that statement is incomplete and therefore misleading
the rules that have been in effect since 1997 clearly provide that at any time that a complaint is before the chairman and ranking member for consideration either one of them may place the complaint on the committee s agenda and when either one of them does that an investigative subcommittee can not be established without a majority vote of the committee
when the house last considered ethics committee procedures in 1997 it rejected on a bipartisan vote an amendment that would have required the automatic dismissal of any complaint that is not acted upon within 180 days
the reason that amendment was rejected is that it was recognized that such a time limit would encourage deadlock on the committee and partisanship among the committee members
i want to close by asking all members including all members of the leadership on both sides of the aisle to give some serious consideration not just today but in the weeks and months ahead to whether you genuinely want to have a meaningful ethics process in the house and what we as members individually and collectively have to do in order for such a process to exist
and in fact the sergeant at arms has been sent to gather members by force on prior occasions
mr speaker we heard the distinguished chair or maybe he is only the presumptive chair of the committee on rules at this point but in any event the gentleman from california mr dreier xz4001150 said a moment ago that this proposed rules change is constitutional because the constitution could not have contemplated that the house could not function
mr speaker i am transmitting a status report on the current levels of onbudget spending and revenues for fiscal year 2005 and for the 5year period of fiscal years 2005 through 2009
this report is necessary to facilitate the application of sections 302 and 311 of the congressional budget act and section 401 of the conference report on the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2005 s con
res 95 which is currently in effect as a concurrent resolution on the budget in the house under h res 5
the term current level refers to the amounts of spending and revenues estimated for each fiscal year based on laws enacted or awaiting the president s signature
chairman the enclosed report shows the effects of congressional action on the fiscal year 2005 budget and is current through january 21 2004
res 95 the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2005
the budget resolution figures incorporate revisions submitted by the committee on the budget to the house to reflect funding for wildland fire suppression and for technical reasons
specifically i oppose the proposed changes to rule x which among other things creates a permanent standing committee on homeland security and grants legislative jurisdiction to that committee
i oppose this grant of jurisdiction not because of some desire to protect existing committees turf but because transfer of these security issues to a new committee divests from the responsibility for those issues from those members who have substantial experience and expertise in some cases developed through decades of work on them
it is not enough to say that members with particular areas of expertise will have an opportunity to be heard on these issues
i take this position on the basis of my 30 years of experience in the house during which time i have given high priority to security particularly the security of our transportation system
developing sound security legislation requires balancing security risks against the economic and safety impacts of such measures on transportation industries and their customers
for example we would not want to install technology on aircraft to protect against missile attacks if that technology would create disproportionate safety risks
in addition security mandates are only one type of requirement imposed on transportation industries
the committee on transportation and infrastructure has the responsibility and the expertise to broadly consider security risks weigh all costs and benefits of proposed requirements and determine the likely effects of such actions on transportation industries their customers and the existing framework of other statutory and regulatory requirements
the aviation subcommittee alone has held 19 hearings on aviation security issues since september 11
i believe that the quality of congressional oversight and legislation on these issues will suffer if these issues are simply transferred wholesale to a new committee
it says a member shall conduct himself at all times in a manner that should reflect creditably on the house of representatives
they went on to make new mistakes to undermine the ethical standard of the house
instead of a bipartisan effort to strengthen the ethical process the republicans have engaged in a completely partisan exercise that should be an affront to every member on either side of the aisle who has served in this body
i served on the committee on standards of official conduct for 6 years and then for a seventh year i served as a part of the bipartisan committee to rewrite the ethics rules
there was a process which was fair to members because as i say as someone who has 7 years on the ethical process that it is very hard to make judgments about our peers
so it was put forth and has been the rules of the house and the committee on standards of official conduct that in order to cease or dismiss a case we had to have a majority of the committee on standards of official conduct
so on a partisan basis there could be no cases that go forward
the point of the committee on standards of official conduct is to have a process in which to deal with ethics complaints against members
the point of the committee on standards of official conduct is not to whitewash or to have a system that says nothing will ever move forward
so as i say on the first day of this new congress the republican majority is publicly demonstrating what has been evident for some time and that is its arrogance its pettiness its shortsighted focus on their political life rather than to decide how we are each of us fit to govern
they did blink on a couple of different scores but the fundamental challenge to the ethical standard of the house being enforced is still in this rules package and it should be rejected
one of them is to remove this change and that would be a vote on the previous question and then on the motion to recommit we address two other abuses of power that should be addressed in this bill
the public has to think and believe that when we are here and we are on the public payroll and we are members of congress that our accountability is to them and not to our next job
as many of my colleagues recall in recent memory there was occasion on the floor when a huge bill of many thousands of pages containing nine appropriations bills seven of which never appeared on the floor of the united states senate came before this house where the matter was overnight passed in the committee on rules came to the floor the next morning without any chance of members being able to read the bill
it was important that day because there was a great deal in that bill that members did not know about that they were voting on and should not they know that but very specifically in that bill and it was not found out until the because of the egregiousness of that and the violation of privacy of the american people i insisted that the members come back to vote on that rather than just have it be done by unanimous consent to remove that provision from the law
so that the american people will know because of the abuse of power in this house ignoring of the 3day rule that members can not even see what they are voting on before they vote on it and something like looking at your tax returns could be sneaked into the bill without any safeguards to protect people from that
the list goes on and on
that is how much it cost to sell the american seniors down the river and i hope that even if you separate yourself from any of the examples and just say i sent you to congress to represent me you do that in what you say there and how you vote and i expect that you know what you are voting on
the message to the american people here this afternoon is a vote for the motion to commit is a vote for members to be able to read a bill before they vote on it
so a yes vote on the motion to commit gives members the 3 days which under the rules of the house they are entitled to
the previous question vote would say no to the republicans in their evisceration of the ethical process of this house by saying that you do not need a majority to dismiss a case you can just do it if all the members of your party on the committee decide to stick with you on it
today is a major departure from that and i guess maybe i have just spent too many long hours for too many long years in the committee on standards of official conduct room trying to respect the rights of members and our higher responsibility to uphold an ethical standard
so i urge my colleagues to vote yes on the previous question yes on the motion to commit and by all means however you vote on those no on this very shameful rules package
the proposals were so offensive that the ethics committee chairman broke with his own leadership on the issue
one of the changes would have permitted members indicted by a grand jury on felony counts to continue to hold house leadership positions
the fact that they ever considered changing the rules of the house in this disgraceful manner is a sad commentary on the ethical compass of this body s leadership
they also planned to eliminate a 30year standing rule that members of congress could be disciplined for actions that brought dishonor and discredit on this house the people s house
mr speaker the committee on standards of official conduct is the only evenly divided committee in the house
as the rule stands today if the five republicans and five democrats on the committee do not reach agreement about the merits of an ethics complaint it is automatically referred to investigators
this one provision gives the republicans an enormous amount of control over who is and who is not investigated by the committee on standards of official conduct
mr speaker this rules package would effectively eliminate the 45day deadline the committee on standards of official conduct currently has to act on complaints
when the dust settled on the prescription drug vote former representative billy tauzin the key author and then chairman of the committee on energy and commerce had himself the republican rules package will reduce this committee to a paper tiger
the american people deserve much better than to have a for sale sign placed on the united states house of representatives
mr speaker i know there are members on the other side of the aisle because i know them who care greatly about the integrity of this chamber and i know that there are freshmen members here today eager to cast their first vote on behalf of the constituents whose trust they hold and the constitution they love
mr speaker at the close of this debate i will be asking members to vote no on the previous question so i can strike from the rules package language that would allow the republicans to run out the clock on serious ethics complaints
immediately following that vote i will ask for a yes on a motion to commit the resolution so that we can add two important rules changes
the first would prohibit members from negotiating lucrative job deals that capitalize on their committee membership
the other would guarantee that members have at least 3 days to read a house report before voting on it
mr speaker i am pleased to yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from west virginia mr mollohan xz4002810 the ranking member of the committee on standards of official conduct
mr speaker i yield 1 12 minutes to the gentleman from texas mr gene green a member of the committee on standards of official conduct
i urge every member of this house to vote no on the previous question
this provision would halt the investigation of properly filed ethics complaints if after 45 days the chair and ranking member of the committee on standards of official conduct have not set up an investigation committee
i urge the members on both sides of the aisle to vote no on this previous question so we can delete this offensive provision
mr speaker i ask unanimous consent to insert the text of the amendment in the record immediately prior to the vote on the previous question
mr speaker after the vote on the previous question i will call for a yes vote on the motion to commit
my motion to commit will prohibit sitting members of congress from negotiating for future employment with any person who has a direct interest in the legislation referred to any committee on which that member serves
mr speaker i ask unanimous consent to insert a statement as part of that immediately prior to the vote on the motion to commit
mr speaker i urge a no vote on the previous question
i call on all members of this house particularly the freshmen casting their first vote please vote for ethics today
vote for this house that you will love and revere as all of us do on both sides of the aisle
please vote no on the previous question and vote yes on the motion to recommit
mr speaker on that i demand the yeas and nays
mr speaker on that i demand the yeas and nays
mr speaker on that i demand the yeas and nays
3 on consideration of h res 5 i was unavoidably detained
this building was occupied and set on fire by a foreign army
mr speaker on rollcall no
mr speaker on rollcall no
in practice however not through statute the committee on financial services requires a twothirds cosponsorship before considering proposals to award medals a practice that the senate has now adopted
it is difficult to get 290 signatures on anything around here
again i recognize the fact that it is a bigger country that there is much more going on in the country and that kind of thing but we are really trying to make sure that this is truly an honor for somebody who does something extraordinary in science or the arts or an elected official or somebody of that nature usually a president i think the only elected official who has ever been honored people in religion people who have just absolutely stood out in their circumstances
my sense is while we can argue here on the floor that it is limiting i think the bottom line is it is not going to end up being as limiting as one might think
i also believe by the way and the gentleman from new york mr crowley xz4000870 said something i thought was interesting and that is it is difficult to get the names on the legislation
the gentleman from new jersey mr payne xz4003120 will always be a hero in my mind because he took it amongst the democrats and got a lot of signatures when i was struggling with it on a bill that i did last year and i appreciate that a great deal
and i am worried about the influx that is going on
even on the business of the commemorative coins a number of the sponsors in the senate have been democrats as well
certainly if a party feels it is being slighted they can say we are just not going to sign on to something
i just think it is sort of a necessary strain on having a political balance on something which is not essential
typically the way you do it is somebody comes to you with the idea maybe it is a thomas edison or somebody of that ilk of that nature and you generally will then go to your leadership or to the leadership on the other side or to the chairman of the committee and say look i am interested in getting this done
i would be dumbfounded if you had five on one side and five on the other
in fact i would be dumbfounded if you had two on one side and two on the other
as the gentleman knows on commemorative coins they can be done in out years
as the gentleman knows from our committee work i do not know of any time where we have actually had to pick and choose at the committee on these coins
i really do not think this is a necessary amendment to deal with that based on what i have seen
mr chairman reclaiming my time technically as the gentleman and i both know we have seen a lot the majority is always going to control ultimately what is going to happen on the floor
in fact the chairman of the full committee on financial services the gentleman from ohio mr oxley xz4003070 who holds jurisdiction over this legislation even requested during his committee on rules testimony last night a more open process for debate on this bill and i thank the chairman for those comments
i would also like to take a moment to specifically thank and welcome our new committee on rules ranking member my friend and colleague the gentlewoman from new york ms slaughter xz4003780 who will serve as a true and tireless fighter for democrats and our rights in the minority on the committee on rules over the next 2 years
and given that the committee on financial services has yet to even hold its organizational meeting for the 109th congress the committee has obviously not yet had an opportunity to consider this issue carefully
in my view we are rushing to act on an issue that does not represent a problem
having said that democrats are open to debating and voting on this legislation
regular order for consideration of gold medals involves the need under the rules of the committee on financial services to gain the cosponsorship of twothirds of the house before the legislation is considered in committee a full twothirds sponsorship of the house before it is considered in committee
my amendments seek to maintain the spirit and process of bipartisanship that has characterized the house s consideration of gold medals the highest honor that this congress can bestow on an individual or group of individuals
stating that though i am dismayed that the committee on rules refused to allow consideration of a key amendment that would strike a section of the bill that only permits the granting of congressional gold medals to individuals
for example my good friend and republican colleague the gentleman from new york mr king xz4002202 offered an amendment in the previous congress which the house passed to honor the officers emergency workers and other employees of the federal government and any state or local government including any interstate governmental entity who responded to the attacks on the world trade center in new york city and who perished in that attack on september 11 with a congressional gold medal
mr chairman an amendment was offered yesterday evening before the committee on rules that would have asked groups as well as individuals
that was not passed in the committee on rules and therefore we are here today working a bill that does not have that provision in it
i mentioned before it takes twothirds of the members of the house the entire body to introduce a gold medal for its consideration in the committee on financial services a bar that i believe is a very very high bar and one that is not easily attained
certainly general washington was an incredible individual someone who was deserving of the first medal that was ever produced and i think he accepted that on behalf of all those men and women who fought for independence from great britain back during the war of independence
not to prolong the debate either because i know we want to move on but since 1999 when we passed the coin act there have been some concerns on our side of the aisle
that is also i think some of the fear in terms of changing the rules for lack of a better word on the gold medal has stirred up consternation on our side of the aisle
i just do not think that we should be limiting ourselves as the house of representatives and as a congress in reducing our leverage or our ability to honor groups of individuals who have done incredible incredible works on behalf of this nation
i believe that members on both sides would prefer the flexibility of having more rather than fewer possibilities to award gold medals to citizens who deserve to be bestowed with one of our nation s highest honors
in fact the existing committee on financial services rule requiring twothirds cosponsorship of the house for a gold medal which by definition represents broadbased bipartisan support prevents the awarding of frivolous and undeserved medals to groups of individuals
i trust that twothirds of the house represents a solid bipartisan consensus of the will of the house and therefore believe that this acts as a check on any effort to award medals to any groups of individuals who in the opinion of the house do not deserve such award
i hope that some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle though do recognize that not only are there compelling arguments that they are reasonable and that it is a reasonable amendment and therefore deserves to be voted in favor of
and i hope that my colleagues on the other side as well as my side of the aisle view it the same way
i therefore believe if we are to limit the number of gold medals and if we are to obtain the bipartisanship that has characterized the process my amendment should be passed by the chamber my fear being that if we limit it to only four then leadership will decide who will sponsor those four and we in the minority may find ourselves on the short end of that stick
that decision will be made based on a political decision that is made within the house and i dare say that outside influence would also come to bear on that decision that was made as well
if we somehow find we have run out of opportunities on our side to introduce legislation i do not think it is unusual to ask a member of the other side of the aisle to sponsor the bill
but the question i have is if we are going to limit this to two per year it could be that five members on our side of the aisle have five individuals they want to recognize
there could be five individuals on the republican side of the aisle who have five individuals they want to recognize
will it be the five on the majority side
but when we limit it to two per year we are putting a cap on it i think we can in the future find ourselves in a situation where all right maybe five on each side is a little much maybe two on each side
i understand that one of my colleagues on this side had achieved the requisite number of signatures for a commemorative gold medal for the columbia 107 in the last congress in the middle of the last congress and that was never awarded
mr chairman i appreciate my colleague on the other side
as i mentioned before if two gold medals were enacted into law by democrats and i had a third that i wanted to get passed i would go to the gentleman from delaware mr castle xz4000700 and say mike we do not have any more room on our side
mr speaker today we begin the 109th congress in earnest and we do so by considering a bill that we do not need to act on for a problem that in our view and in the view of many of my colleagues simply does not exist
we considered this bill today not in the spirit of openness and bipartisanship that should categorize the democratic debate in the house but with a restrictive rule that did not allow us to have a debate on a key issue whether one of the highest honors that can be bestowed upon citizens of our country for their extraordinary deeds a congressional gold medal can be awarded to one individual or more for their collective honorable or heroic actions
i am puzzled why we would act to impose such limits on our own ability to recognize the accomplishments of the citizens that we are elected to represent
unfortunately the bipartisan spirit that has characterized the house s consideration of gold medals in the past has not carried over to the debate on this bill
the committee responsible for legislation on this bill the committee on financial services on which i serve has not held a single hearing on this bill let alone a markup
the limited debate over this bill on the house floor may culminate in the passing of a bad bill unless my colleagues join me in voting in favor of sending this bill back to committee where we can have a meaningful debate and where we can determine whether limiting gold medals is truly in the interest of the public and in the interest of the house
mr speaker the house has become the 109th congress on a bad note we are considering a bill with almost no meaningful debate and it proposes to represent a solution to a problem that simply does not exist a problem the record shows does not exist
i urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to do the right thing to vote in favor of my motion to recommit this bill back to the committee on financial services and to allow this house to take a closer look at this legislation to determine whether it really meets the interests of the american people
mr speaker on that i demand the yeas and nays
11 on january 26 2005
these votes were on amendments to hr 54 the congressional gold medal enhancement act of 2005
10 on the crowley amendment no rollcall vote no
11 on the crowley amendment no
they just spent a week in a refresher course on how a bill becomes a law
then all of the sudden that process has not been followed on one of their first votes
while that might be true the committee on financial services did not act on the bill in the 108th congress and it has not acted on it in this year
the committee on financial services the committee of jurisdiction for the underlying legislation will not even organize itself until next week let alone hold a hearing or markup on my good friend s and he is my good friend the gentleman from delaware s bill
while i intend to support both of these amendments and certainly appreciate them being made in order the committee on rules failed to make in order a third crowley amendment which would have maintained the status quo
the committee on rules also rejected along a partyline vote an amendment to the rule which would have made it open to all germane amendments
mr speaker i am not worried about congress going on a spree to award the medal of honor to unworthy recipients
the rules applied by the committee on financial services to even consider a bill awarding the congressional medal of honor are so stringent that the integrity and prestige of the award will always be protected
on the contrary if today is any indication perhaps we ought to be just a bit more concerned about the integrity of procedure in the house of representatives than about the integrity of a system that is dependent upon bipartisan cooperation
mr speaker i thank the distinguished gentleman from florida and ranking member and the gentleman representing the committee on rules on the republican side and also the author of this legislation
king and mrs king and of course legislation that i proposed to acknowledge the columbia seven that tragically lost their lives on our behalf as astronauts and heroes in space
it speaks to denial and it denies the congress its authoritative right to make decisions on who has represented america in the most honorable way to deserve a congressional gold medal
i agree as well that the committee on financial services has put in place a very effective very effective oversight of this process
i for one believe that we should overwhelmingly vote against the rule and overwhelmingly vote against this intrusion into the objective and the precise and the bipartisan decisions that have been made on ronald reagan and mrs reagan the president of the united states dr
i would ask my colleagues to reconsider this legislation and most specifically because it violated if you will the precise rules that we adhere to oversight by committees the committee on rules involvement in an open rule and the bipartisan spirit in which we honor our heroes and sheroes whether dead or alive
blocking debate on a provision that is utterly unreasonable is disrespectful to the constituents that members seek to honor with the congressional gold medal
mr chairman the angst that i have with hr 54 does not speak to the eloquence that we have heard on the floor about our commitment to honoring our heroes and sheroes
i think that is the crux of this debate not whether or not we have restrictions or nonrestrictions because i believe it is a given that the committee on financial services has done a commendable job in its oversight
as i look back on the numbers in the last four congresses how interesting it is and the good sense of the crowley amendment because those that have been passed by this body only equal to five or six credible rational and reasonable reasoning for awarding for example those who were intimately involved in brown v board of education that changed the lives of millions of americans and today even is a standard for equal education in america
i think we do ourselves an enormous disservice by coming down hardhanded on who has given so much for america
yes there are only a few of us on the floor of the house but we obviously are not able to speak for all of those unsung heroes yet to be brought to the attention of this house
so why we need this restrictive law that has not already been satisfied by the oversight of a bipartisan committee on financial services and the requirement mr chairman the requirement of over 290 signatures and most of these received close to 400
that would have been reflective of members having an opportunity in their wisdom to present their case before the united states congress and the committee on financial services
and his widow coretta scott king or the brave employees and others who responded to the attacks on the world trade center and the pentagon and perished and to the people aboard united airlines flight 93 who resisted hijackers and caused the plane to crash
it is somewhat ironic that after the reforms that were made by the gentleman from delaware where we tightened the restrictions on commemorative coins and for good reason that we then had this increase in the gold medal
i think we can safely say that the gold medal traditionally supports the concept of honoring an individual for service to the country and that the commemorative coin which has been essentially put on the back burner presents a very appropriate avenue for recognizing groups that heretofore have not been honored
i think the gentleman from delaware was right in raising that bar to where it is now because it really does focus one s attention on how difficult that process is
mr chairman the amendment changes the effective date of the introduced version of the bill from after december 31 2005 to instead make the new limitation on the number of congressional gold medals effective on enactment of the bill
if we were to pass the bill but leave the effective date until the end of the session there would be a land rush to enact bills on gold medals that would place members in an awkward position
as the gentleman knows who has served on my committee with great distinction we pride ourselves on the bipartisanship of the committee and the leadership of the committee and we have continued to do so
first of all mr speaker let me point out that this is a motion with instructions so it does not go back to the committee on financial services it would automatically come back to the floor
there is bipartisanship in the existing system because it involves 290 cosponsors so everybody gets an opportunity to weigh in on the importance of the medal
so the gentleman from delaware needs to be congratulated on forwardlooking reforms just as he did in the commemorative coin program
we had extensive debate during general debate as well as the two amendments offered by my friend from new york and so i would ask that the motion to recommit be defeated that we pass this legislation and then get on to the work of defining two medals each year a maximum of two medals each year four for the congress to honor individuals who have had extraordinary contributions to our country
mr chairman on rollcall no
mr speaker by direction of the committee on rules i call up house resolution 42 and ask for its immediate consideration
mr speaker this rule provides for 1 hour of general debate equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the committee on financial services
it provides that the bill shall be considered as read for the purpose of amendment and makes in order only those amendments printed in the committee on rules report accompanying this resolution
this legislation builds on important reforms that my good friend the former governor and now member of congress the gentleman from delaware mr castle xz4000700 has made to the commemorative gold coin program almost a decade ago
the creation of the esteemed medal of honor allowed congress to begin using the gold medal exclusively to recognize individuals that have performed an achievement that has an impact on american history and culture that will be recognized for generations to come
in order to maintain sound fiscal discipline and the prestige of the congressional gold medal program we are here today to approve the commonsense reforms by the gentleman from delaware mr castle xz4000700 our chairman and supported by the committee on financial services chairman the gentleman from ohio mr oxley xz4003070
many of these reforms simply codify what is already an existing practice in the house committee on financial services and the senate banking committee
i appreciate the comments from the gentleman from florida my good friend from the committee on rules and would like to ask him at this time if he would like to consume the time
mr speaker i yield back the balance of my time and i move the previous question on the resolution
a motion to reconsider was laid on the table
mr chairman on rollcall no
it is ironic that an institution whose sole function whole reason for being is based on the free exchange of ideas would then boycott the armed forces the very people who actively protect their academic freedom
such protections as nondiscrimination based on age gender marital status membership in the national guard and sexual orientation are a part of wisconsin s nondiscrimination laws
at no time in recent memory has our country placed more responsibility on the shoulders of our men and women in uniform
we are fighting a war on terrorism on multiple fronts in afghanistan and iraq
the solomon act originally passed in 1995 grants the secretary of defense power to deny federal funding to institutions of higher learning if they prohibit military recruitment on campus
there is no reason not to allow the nation s armed services to make their best case to college students and to do so in the same manner as private sector employers that colleges and universities seem to relish having on campus
the very core of our system of homeland security and national defense depends on young men and women deciding that they wish to serve our country
successful recruitment of the best officers in our military relies heavily on our military recruiters access to the best and the brightest
what is happening on some college campuses is deja vu for those of us who attended colleges in the 1960s and the 1970s
the following quote is from a student typical of the attitude of many of these ivory bastions the day my political science department hires a republican and i am allowed to sit in a class without a number of snickers jeers andor dirty looks when president bush s name is even mentioned is the day i will admit there is progress on today s campus mr speaker congress did not ask for special access for military recruiters
mr speaker by direction of the committee on rules i call up house resolution 59 and ask for its immediate consideration
mr speaker on tuesday the committee on rules met and granted a rule for house concurrent resolution 36 expressing congressional support for equal access of military recruiters to institutions of higher education
the rule provides for 1 hour of general debate equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the committee on armed services
during this time of conflict and the global war on terror it is more important than ever to maintain the ability to recruit quality men and women for service in our military
this decision simply states that congress and the government may not as a matter of law deny funds to universities on the basis of their denial of access to recruiters and rotc units
mr speaker it is disappointing to note that the reserve officers training corps or popularly known as the rotc has been embattled on some university and college campuses since the 1960s
the new purported reasons for not allowing rotc on campus often serves the convenient cover for these antimilitary sentiments
the very least we can do is put the courts on notice as to exactly where the congress stands on this issue
hopefully it will underscore the importance that the congress places on military recruiters having access to the educational institutions that receive federal funds
during this time of war we should insist that institutions who pride themselves on freedom of expression allow the defenders of that freedom the united states military to freely recruit the soldiers who protect our democracy
while i certainly respect his concerns i would like to point out that the measure in question had been on our web site for 4 days and was not suddenly introduced yesterday
frankly on the nature of the rule itself it is the opinion of the majority of the committee this is simply an up or down matter
we should not put that burden on recruiters in the military and subject them to difficult circumstances when they are carrying out important work for our country
mr speaker i yield back the balance of my time and i move the previous question on the resolution
a motion to reconsider was laid on the table
and yet some colleges principally the elitist and elite colleges refuse to even allow military recruiters on their campuses
the hard part is understanding why facilities and administrations of these colleges do nt want military recruiters on their campuses
the least they could offer in return is a booth in the field house on career day
mr speaker it s a shame this issue was ever forced on us at all but the vote on this bill will help to clarify exactly what we each mean when we say we support the troops
for example here in washington dc catholic university does not allow proabortionist recruiters to come and talk on the campus and here you are going to require regardless of what the issue should be that military recruiters have to be allowed on campus
i think the military has historically stood on its own feet to do very well in recruiting without getting congress involved mandating that they have to be on campuses
i would urge congress very carefully to think about this and to vote no until we get a better thought on how we want to mandate democracy in this country
these policies affirm that they do not tolerate discrimination on any number of issues race sex religion age disability social class and sexual orientation
this policy unfairly excludes homosexuals from military service on the basis of their sexual orientation alone
for example numerous military linguists who are critically needed in the global war on terrorism have been discharged under do nt ask do nt tell
mr speaker i am wondering based on that argument in the interest of efficiency whether we might not substitute chat rooms for the floor of the house and if being on the web site is a satisfactory way to bring a bill out
i would urge the majority since this traditional kind of oldfashioned type of democracy does not seem to have much appeal to go right ahead might even save a little more money by cutting back on what thomas jefferson or abe lincoln or one of those people might have thought was an appropriate way to conduct the business of democracy
i think they deserve on the whole a lot of credit for a difficult job
if it is so important to have the opportunity mr speaker should not people on the other side say you can not deny these young people the opportunity to serve in the military
can you not judge them on their merits
military recruiting on university campuses is one of the primary means by which the armed forces retains highly qualified new military personnel and it is an integral effective and necessary part of overall military recruiting
i sincerely hope there will be a strong bipartisan effort of support and i commend my good friends from minnesota and alabama for their leadership on this issue
let us allow the military to be on the campuses
we needed to give the opportunity for the full discussion on discrimination
do my colleagues realize that when we debated the 911 tragedy it was a gay american on one of our airplanes that engaged with others to be able to detour that airplane from the very site that i stand to be able to save lives and to save the capitol of the united states of america
i am glad that rotc programs are still on our campuses
when the house debated hr 3966 which would allow for the denial of federal funds for educational institutions unless military recruiters are provided access to the campuses of these institutions i voted yes on passage of the measure with the understanding that no constitutional contravention would result from its implementation
i want to speak certainly in favor of the solomon amendment and remind my colleagues that it does not apply to institutions of higher education that have had a longstanding practice of pacificism based on historic religious grounds and it exempts federal student financial assistance from termination
and as the chairman of the committee on armed services said there are so many legal issues involved in the military today and to go beyond that to let people look at careers in i would say intelligence as much as anything homeland security there is a great opportunity for students to go into
indeed there are so many prejudices against everyday middleclass values on college campuses and serving in the military and being proamerican just seems to be one of them
and examples go on and on
i think the judicial attack on the solomon amendment is just one of a series of a trend that is against again anything that is proamerican proconservative protraditional values
and so i would submit for the record an article that was an opinion in the wall street journal recently and then something on the academic bill of rights that i think also touches into this same subject
express the sense of congress that the executive branch should aggressively challenge any decision impeding or prohibiting the operation of the solomon law encourage the executive branch to follow a doctrine of nonacquiescene by not finding a judicial decision affecting one jurisdiction to be binding on other jurisdictions
the socalled solomon law section 983 title 10 us code named for its original proponent representative gerald solomon rny is based on the principle that if a college or university accepts federal funding it must permit military recruiters andor rotc access to campus and to students
enacted first in 1994 and added to by congress in 1996 1999 and 2002 and 2004 the solomon law prohibits some defenserelated and other federal funding from going to colleges and universities that prevent rotc access or military recruiting on campus
the solomon law 1 does not apply to institutions of higher education that have a longstanding policy of pacifism based on historical religious grounds and 2 exempts federal student financial assistance from termination
the us court of appeals for the third circuit on 29 november 2004 reversed a district court decision which had upheld the constitutionality of the solomon law by ruling that the solomon law violated the 1st amendment rights of free speech and association held by institutions of higher education
the government also filed a motion on 14 january 2005 with the third circuit court seeking to stay the court s mandate for a preliminary injunction against the enforcement of the solomon law until the supreme court decides the government s petition
the third circuit granted the stay on 19 january
military recruiting on university campuses is one of the primary means by which the armed forces obtain highly qualified new military personnel and is an integral effective and necessary part of overall military recruiting
any reduction in the performance by the armed forces amidst the present national emergency declared by the president on september 14 2001 operates against the national interest
impact on students remarks belittling conservative ideas convey that these views are not accepted on campus grading based on these ideas reinforce this perception
students at wells college were ridiculed by professors for their support on iraq war and their views on feminism
nearly all distinguished doctoral programs rely on matching students with professors who have compatible interests
the ratio of commencement speakers on the left and right was 22615 a ratio of over 15 1 commencement speakers are selected through committees composed of administrative staff faculty and students
there is a lack of intellectual diversity within faculties on college campuses university should be inclusive to all viewpoints without it free exchange of ideas are impaired
it is not our intention to suggest that there should be quotas based on party affiliation in the hiring process at universities we support removing all politics and political affiliation from the hiring process it is our purpose to point out the gross imbalance of liberal vs
so it s a disgrace that some of the nation s law schools objecting to the pentagon s discrimination policies refuse to permit military recruiters to make their pitch on campus relegating them instead to unofficial offcampus venues
today the house is scheduled to vote on a resolution brought by alabama republican mike rogers that would restate the house s support for the solomon amendment
in any event there should be no legal question about congress s right to put conditions on grants of federal funds to universities
mr speaker i yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from alabama mr rogers xz4003411 the sponsor of this concurrent resolution and a member of the committee on armed services
mr speaker i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from texas mr conaway xz4006550 a member of the committee on armed services
mr speaker it gives me great pleasure to yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from florida mr miller xz4002791 my colleague on the committee on armed services
mr speaker i yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from ohio mr boehner xz4000360 the chairman of the committee on education and the workforce
mr speaker i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from california mr hunter xz4001910 the distinguished chairman of the house committee on armed services
mr speaker i yield 3 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from indiana mr buyer xz4000560 chairman of the committee on veterans affairs
mr speaker on that i demand the yeas and nays
i also want to welcome him as a new member of the committee on rules
the underlying bill house concurrent resolution 36 was introduced yesterday has not gone to committee let alone and be reported out of committee and was being taken up in the committee on rules yesterday just about the time that most members planes were touching down in washington
in fact we are not likely to act on this most urgent matter until march
let us start with a little history on this bill
yet every one of these other federal agencies has full access to recruitment on college campuses
all of them have employees on their pay rolls
all of these federal agencies and the us government and the american people benefit from the research and development programs that take place on these campuses some of it carried out no doubt by gay men and women
in november 2003 a us district court in new jersey upheld the constitutionality of the solomon law but it also determined that the solomon law does not give the pentagon any basis for asserting as it has in regulations on implementing the solomon law that universities and colleges must give military recruiters the same degree of access to campuses and students provided to other employers
the us department of justice now plans to appeal the case to the us supreme court and it has asked the appeals court to hold off enforcing the nullification of the solomon law until the supreme court decides on whether to take up the case or not
there is absolutely no lack of equal access for military recruiters and rotc programs on america s college campuses
to this day any other employer public or private that fails to meet a school s nondiscrimination policies is banned from employee recruitment on campuses
mr speaker there is no lack of access to for the military on america s campuses
he mentioned that this resolution has been posted on the web site for 3 days or 4 days
the focus must be on the search for osama bin laden and his terrorist legions not the closet door
the pentagon s snooping after potential gays trumps what every investigative agency in the war on terror has admitted is a crucial shortage of effective arabic translators
the military is right to rely more on its language schools but it can take several years to produce fluent graduates
the servicemembers legal defense network last month sued the government on behalf of 12 gay former military members seeking reinstatement
i urge my colleagues to vote no on the resolution
the government is not asking campuses across america to endorse the war on terror the president s policy or anything to do with the military
our troops are paying with their lives because of the bigotry that this congress has mandated on the military number one
private universities private institutions have chosen to say as part of their free speech that they do not want on their campus recruiters from any organization the military any private company anybody else that discriminates against gay people and lesbian people that engages in an unacceptable to them form of discrimination
we should not have passed the bill that we did but we passed a bill to say that if they do that if a private institution bars military recruiters and other recruiters on an equal basis we will withhold federal funds
we encourage the executive branch to follow the doctrine of nonacquiescence and not find a decision affecting one jurisdiction to be binding on another jurisdiction
this resolution ought to be defeated on its merits
this resolution expresses the continued support of congress for the socalled solomon law a critical piece of legislation originally passed in 1994 which has helped ensure that military recruiters have equal access on our nation s campuses
also we would be encouraging the executive branch to follow a doctrine of nonacquiescence by not finding a judicial decision affecting one jurisdiction to be binding on any other jurisdiction
for example the solomon law does not apply to colleges or universities that have a longstanding policy of pacifism based on historical religious grounds nor does it affect any federal student aid or financial assistance
prior to the november circuit court decision on repeated occasions lower courts have consistently upheld the constitutionality of the solomon law arguing that it does not infringe on any institution s right to free speech or association
a bipartisan vote here today in support of this legislation will help send a clear message to our courts that our military recruiters deserve equal access on all of our campuses
i thank the gentleman from california mr hunter xz4001910 for his ongoing efforts on this issue and i thank the gentleman from minnesota mr kline xz4002240 for managing this legislation
i heard the prior speaker talk about the fact that this may be a dangerous place and there are all sorts of other political ideas that may be at play where you could put a recruiter on a campus or not
i strongly urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this resolution and recognizing that what we do for the private sector in allowing them to put recruiters in law schools or on any college campus ought to be the same that we do for something so important and so critical as the recruitment of the best and the brightest into our military forces
mr speaker last november a federal court said the federal government can not take away a university s funding simply because the school refuses to exempt the us military from its policy meaning the university s policy and that oncampus recruiters not discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation
if this house of representatives votes to support that resolution we will be putting the congress on record as supporting absolute senseless discrimination
they pride themselves on having the brightest in america at their universities particularly the ones in question
i would call on them and if they are really serious about limiting this they are afraid of what our recruiters might say that our recruiters might ask their young men and women to serve their country to place their lives on the line as many of the men and women who today serve our country in those armed forces are doing every day in iraq and afghanistan and other places around the world that we do not necessarily know about but nevertheless they are serving why they are afraid of this message
this bill will also require the completion of a fence on the mexican border waiving environmental laws in california
but this bill is simply a bandaid on the problem that will not provide lasting reform
mr chairman on rollcall no
the saudis continue to declare to the world that they are a progressivethinking nation and they are our partners in the global war on terrorism
this is the same saudi arabia that has the worst record for religious tolerance on the planet the same saudi arabia that exudes racism and antisemitic hatred
i am just going to address the former on the issue of debating essentially an unobjectionable rule that simply allows for general debate and urge opposition on that ground alone
the placement of the bill on this agenda at this particular time is a manifestation of the triumph of ideology over common sense and it is a response to spasms of anger rather than a reflection of sober analysis
but we hear not one word or hint of any intention on the part of the majority in this house in contrast with both the president and the leadership in the senate of ever dealing with the fundamental issue
he realizes that these gentlemen are wrong that this analysis is wrong that this piecemeal approach is not going to do the job and he has repeatedly called for a comprehensive reform of our immigration system because the current system results in diverting homeland security resources to chasing people who are here because they want to put food on their table
senator cornyn the new chairman of the subcommittee on immigration and claims no liberal he realizes that the strategy of the gentleman from wisconsin is a mistake
for that reason more than any other although the fundamental change of the asylum system that is going to keep people fleeing persecution from finding their historic asylum in this country without dealing anything with terrorists who are already eligible for asylum is another reason to oppose this bill and i urge opposition on it
instead the majority because it does not agree with the commission on religious freedom because it does not accept fundamental traditions of people who have a wellfounded fear of persecution based on their political attitudes or their ethnicity or their religion or their gender they do not want to make sure they are able to get asylum they dump a whole bunch of things that have nothing to do with terrorism in here not recommended by the 911 commission report and then try to claim we are simply fulfilling the 911 commission recommendations
the amendment included in the rule would expand that to include consistency on matters that are entirely relevant to the basis of the claim for asylum
it would mean that a woman who has been subjected to gang rape by government armed forces in her country who is too afraid or ashamed to tell the fact to the armed male immigration officer she first encounters at the airport in the united states could if she tells the story later on in the process be denied asylum simply because she was too afraid or too ashamed to tell the story to the first person she encountered
in a system where we rely on translations and statements taken from people in crisis this is a very change in the law
i urge a no vote on the rule and a no vote on the bill
even more troubling is a fact discussed in a report released this week by the us commission on international religious freedom
for example fauyiza kassindja a young togolese woman who fled female genital mutilation fgm would have been denied asylum under this standard with little chance of getting that determination reversed on appeal
relatedly hr 418 would constrain judicial review of a denial of asylum based on an applicant s failure to provide corroborating evidence
the additional burden on asylum applicants created by this provision is impermissible under the international law including the un
convention on refugees to which the united states is a signatory
this is because first current law appropriately makes terrorists ineligible for asylum and second the standard for granting asylum is already so high that applicants are subjected to intense scrutiny before a decision on their claims is made
a person who applies for asylum today is held in detention until an investigation is made on the credibility of their claim and on whether they pose a security risk to the united states
i was disappointed that the conference committee on the intelligence reform bill opted to remove the immigrationrelated provisions approved by the house during its consideration of hr 10 last fall
this bill serves to protect the integrity of our immigration laws by requiring states in effect to confirm lawful immigration status or disclose the lack of confirming identification on the face of cards issued
i thank the gentleman from virginia chairman tom davis for his good work on this issue and i encourage our constituents to read this report and see the importance of the actions that we are taking today
mr chairman i appreciate the gentlewoman s courtesy in permitting me to speak on this and i agree with her very strongly
in fact they are on the line every day providing for the safety and security of our constituents in a much more immediate sense than we are
and with all due respect it is a dangerous precedent that anybody on either side of the aisle should be deeply offended by
i do not think any of them have ever been asked to vote on anything more irresponsible
instead this bill places enormous regulatory and financial burdens on state governments and makes department of motor vehicles dmv employees de facto immigration officers
the pictures that we saw on cnn did not do justice
there was some bad publicity initially surrounding what appeared to be a lack of compassion on the part of the united states with its initial response
we are certainly on a per capita basis not giving more than australia scandinavia germany
i sincerely hope that it is rejected if necessary on a voice vote if not withdrawn
while i strongly support this funding i am disappointed that i must vote no on this bill
in fact on september 11 driver s licenses became weapons of mass destruction
of the 19 terrorists on 911 they had five dozen driver s licenses between them and used those driver s licenses to get on the planes that crashed into the world trade center the pentagon and a field in pennsylvania
this act would require identity documents to expire at the same time a visa expires so that someone who is here on an appropriate 6month visa as in fact much to our amazement some of the 911 terrorists were are not given a 6years driver s license when the documents they do produce say they can legally be here for 6 months
this issue was widely debated on the floor last year
i also want to rise to really express my appreciation to the gentleman from california chairman lewis and the tremendous job he has done in limiting the scope of this supplemental and getting this work done in a quick way and moving forward on the rest of our appropriations process at the same time
he and i visited the current embassy together in december and i think we disagree on the need to go ahead and get this project started now
i appreciate the committee s work on it and i encourage its approval today
the mexican border has long been a porous and unguarded route for anyone wishing to sneak into the united states to inflict harm on our nation and our citizens including terrorists
the time to act on the san diego border fence is now
it is essential for judges to be able to determine asylum cases based on the credibility or lack of credibility of witnesses
i spoke on the floor last december in opposition to the conference report on the intelligence bill because it lacked the provisions that we are actually debating here today
i am very pleased that they made good on their promise that we would be here today providing for the provisions that the gentleman from wisconsin mr sensenbrenner xz4003650 had
when i was in the florida senate i headed up the homeland security committee shortly after 911 and many of the provisions that are in this bill we actually included when we took on the driver s license issue making the driver s licenses only last as long as the person was legally in the country
i applaud the gentleman from wisconsin chairman sensenbrenner and the house leadership for making good on their promise and enacting the recommendations made by the 911 commission
neither the department of veterans affairs nor the house committee on veterans affairs the authorizing committee with jurisdiction over va insurance programs was consulted prior to the administration s submitting the insurance proposals in the war supplemental
i recognize that it placed the gentleman from california mr lewis xz4002391 and the gentleman from wisconsin mr obey xz4003000 in very difficult positions because they always come to the floor to talk about authorizing on appropriations bills but that is what you are doing exactly here
the administration proposed to provide for a retroactive payment to give the same level of benefits proposed for prospective maximum sgli to those who have died since the beginning of combat operations on october 7 2001
the committee on veterans affairs has established a record in this regard
when we increased the sgli coverage from 200 000 to 250 000 with a delayed effective date in public law 106419 then in reaction to the terrorist attack on the uss cole we did in fact make a retroactivity in public law 10714 for servicemembers who died in performance of duty that had maximum sgli at the time of their death
chairman on behalf of the 370 000 members of the military officers association of america moaa i am writing to inform you that after discussing the issue extensively with the committee s majority and minority staff moaa has reconsidered its position on the servicemen s group life insurance sgli spousal consent requirement as included in the appropriations committee s markup of the fy2005 defense supplemental appropriations act
i will work with the committee on appropriations
i do not know why the gentleman would be upset with regard to my remarks on performance of duty because what the gentleman from wisconsin mr obey xz4003000 did is followed what we the gentleman from illinois mr evans xz4001260 and i had also recommended
what i do wish to do as we proceed forward as we go to conference working with the senate is work also with the administration work with the department of defense the va and omb to make sure that we bring a proper identity with regard to service and group life insurance that also subsidizes veterans group life insurance and that is what i want to work with the chairman on
mr speaker i rise today in support of the rule on hr 418
it has failed and we need enforcement to be much more narrowly focused on criminals and potential terrorists
this legislation begins the debate on the enforcement aspects of immigration and addresses the narrow issue of driver license security
mr speaker i intend to vote in favor of hr 418 but while doing so i suggest that enforcement border security and immigration reform must be worked on together
the responsible authorities can focus their resources first on the worst actors
in a study on high school students released this past summer the national foundation for american policy found 60 percent of the top science students and 65 percent of the top math students are children of immigrants
so the next time you hear people whining about what a drain on america our immigrants are it might be worth asking if they consider these marines a drain
our diversity is based on talent cooperation and ability
it would help our security forces stop wasting resources now spent on hunting down mexican waitresses and start devoting them to tracking the terrorists who really threaten us
given the tremendous pressures on president bush and the considerable opposition from within his own ranks the politically expedient thing for him to do would be to drop it
immigration reform a 3legged stool while not a major theme of last fall s campaign a debate on immigration reform will be front and center in the early days of the new bush administration
in the past 10 years more than 20 billion has been spent on adding border patrol agents building fencing and employing technology to prevent border crossings
during roughly the same period however estimates on the net number of undocumented entering the country have risen from about 300 000 per year to about 500 000 per year
the administration plan proposed last january addresses only one leg employment which is insufficient to support the weight on the system
it can be conditioned on any number of criteria including for example sweat equity the undocumented have already accrued through their work in the united states
bringing them out of the woodwork would allow law enforcement agents to focus more sharply on catching those who are here to do harm
mr chairman i congratulate the chairman and the committee on government reform for reporting out this bill that is so important that this congress take action on and take action on now
this is what happened on 911
this is what the 911 commission suggested that we take action on and this is what we are here doing today
mr chairman i thank the gentleman from virginia mr tom davis for his leadership on this and i urge passage of the real id act
mr speaker i rise today to voice my strong support for hr 1268 the emergency supplemental appropriations act for defense the global war on terror and tsunami relief
our troops serving in iraq will have the necessary tools to continue their rebuilding efforts in iraq and to continue the war on terror
this is exactly what several of the 911 terrorists did using drivers licenses to board airplanes and murder thousands of innocent americans on september 11 2001
we in congress have been working on ways to prevent our nation from experiencing another terrorist attack by establishing stronger and more secure national programs
in 2003 the former attorney general of virginia jerry kilgore and i worked together on the driver s license integrity act
due to mr kilgore s leadership on this issue the commonwealth of virginia was one of the first states to clamp down on terrorists abuse of the trust that a driver s license conveys
since the beginning of the war on terror congress has fought daily to ensure that our nation never again suffers at the hands of terrorists
this money will be used on critical projects such transportation infrastructure drinking water business and trade education and democratic and legal reforms
mr chairman on january 9 i was privileged to witness the remarkable palestinian presidential election firsthand
on the critical question of security president abbas is also off to a good start
yesterday here on capitol hill the ambassador of israel sat next to the palestinian ambassador and praised the palestinian authority for their security efforts
the excessive conditions and limitations placed on this package may undermine progress toward peace
president bush and prime minister sharon are helping to strengthen and empower president abbas but at the same time congress will slap more conditions on them than they ever did on arafat
my colleagues should understand this bill puts more restrictions on the president than we ever placed on president clinton
americans for peace now wants us to support this package and remove the excessive conditions that the committee has placed on it
shame on us as americans if we do not do whatever we can to seize this historic opportunity
they have made tremendous sacrifices on behalf of their country and have served longer deployments than expected
the legislation increases the military death gratuity increases subsidized life insurance benefits creates a new insurance benefit for soldiers who have suffered traumatic injuries such as the loss of a limb extends the basic allowance for housing for dependents of soldiers who die while on active duty and provides additional funding for addon vehicle armor kits nightvision equipment and radio jammers that disrupt remotecontrol bombs and mines
congress should not repeatedly rely on emergency spending bills to provide the critical funding resources and equipment for our troops in battle by using emergency supplemental appropriations bills
the us must show enough flexibility in working with our allies to effectively help iraq during this critical transition period so that other countries will pledge both troops and funds to alleviate the burden on our american soldiers and taxpayers
as the ranking member of the helsinki commission commission on security and cooperation in europe which promotes human rights and rule of law in europe i am also concerned about many of the asylum law changes contained in the real id act which again go beyond the scope of the 911 commission recommendations
these provisions may have a harmful effect on true asylum seekers trafficking victims women and children who are victims of domestic violence and others seeking protection against persecution
these groups have reported to me that it is already extremely difficult for legitimate asylum seekers to prevail in their case as they have often left their home country on short notice and do not have documentation of their persecution
under the present system if convicted this person is sentenced to federally mandated punishment but the department of homeland security is not required to put their name on a watch list
when a person is convicted of trying to deceive security to get on an airplane there is serious cause for alarm
it allows the criminal justice system to run its course and it is focused solely on the last line of defense before terrorists board an airplane
the people screening passengers at the gates do their best to make sure terrorists are not getting on these planes
i would imagine and i am putting myself in their position and i am not an expert on this but if you are there and are in the security forces there you are obviously trained in document recognition to some great degree
that is the reason we feel it should be added into the database as it goes on
mr chairman i rise in strong support of the real id act and i want to thank the distinguished chairman of the committee on the judiciary the gentleman from wisconsin mr sensenbrenner xz4003650 for his efforts in this matter
i would like to join in the point that is being made by the gentlewoman from texas to remind all of our friends that when republicans took power in 1994 they made a solemn promise to the states that they would make sure that there would be no imposition of unfunded mandates on those states and today we have a chance to redeem that promise by voting no on consideration of this rule which waives the unfunded mandate requirement
their letter points out that while they commend the gentleman from michigan chairman sensenbrenner and the gentleman from virginia mr tom davis for their commitment to driver s license integrity they find that those bills would impose technological standards and verification procedures on states many of which are beyond the current capacity of even the federal government
hr 418 includes provision after provision limiting the rights of refugees imposing onerous new driver s license requirements on the states unfunded mandates making it easier to deport legal immigrants waiving all federal laws concerning construction of barriers and fences anywhere within the united states and denying immigrants longstanding habeas corpus rights
mr chairman i ask unanimous consent that the gentlewoman from texas ms jacksonlee xz4001990 be permitted to manage the bill on this side of the floor
mr chairman i thank the manager on the democratic side for yielding me this time
and i just wanted to briefly ask the gentleman from texas mr sessions xz4003670 what inspired him to add this to a bill that we already had a considerable number of problems about and have never had any hearings on a provision such as this
mr chairman i just wanted to ask the author of the amendment would he have objected to having hearings on his amendment
mr chairman i want to thank the gentleman from florida mr meek xz4002700 for his work on this
i rise in support of the nadlermeeksjacksonlee amendment to strike section 101 of hr 418 which imposes evidentiary requirements on asylumseekers fleeing persecution and all immigrants who seek withholding of removal from deportation
those who support placing these new insurmountable hurdles on asylumseekers have used examples of known terrorists to allegedly show that the asylum system makes us vulnerable to terrorist attack
gazi ibrahim abu mezer known as the brooklyn bomber for his involvement in a planned attack on the new york city subway in 1997 was never granted asylum
in addition it allows denials on the basis of subjective assessments of an applicant s demeanor a factor that is frequently misinterpreted by us judges due to cultural differences
hr 1268 includes numerous provisions limiting the rights of refugees imposing onerous new driver s license requirements on the states making it easier to deport legal immigrants waiving all federal laws concerning the construction of fences and barriers anywhere within the united states and denying immigrants long standing habeas corpus rights
republicans should want a realtime bipartisan look at what is really going on
six large pallets offloaded from us aircraft beautifully packaged you could tell lots of small boxes on each pallet very heavy to lift
i am happy to join this debate as the chairman of the committee on homeland security and welcome the gentleman from mississippi mr thompson xz4004021 my ranking member
on january 25 1993 mir aimal kansi stood at the entrance of the central intelligence agency and gunned down five people
on september 11 2001 according to the 911 commission report the 19 hijackers responsible for the 911 terrorist attacks carried between them 13 us driver s licenses and 21 stateissued id cards
the important infrastructure assets in the area including in particular the largest naval base on the west coast of the united states and the busiest seaport in the united states makes securing this area even more important
as chairman of the committee on homeland security and a california resident i am extremely concerned by the roadblocks that different bureaucratic groups have used to justify thwarting this important project
mr chairman several provisions in this legislation are of particular interest to the committee on homeland security
first this spending bill will be procedurally consolidated with the real id act which the house approved 261161 on february 10 2005
this multiagency homeland security effort is responsible for supporting the department of homeland security s effort to screen passengers on both domestic and international flights
mr speaker while i have problems with the concept of this supplemental and supplementals and the misplaced budget priorities of the republican party this bill i believe is needed for our men and women who are fighting the war on terrorism
i led a delegation to sri lanka in january and i saw first hand the resources needed in that country multiplied by the effects on other countries and this money will go to good use
this bill provides 50 million in important aid to the state of israel as they embark on the critical disengagement plan and withdraw from the gaza strip
on behalf of my cousin john moran who was killed on 911 a battalion chief of the fire department of new york and the over 400 families in new york city that are affected by this legislation i want to say thank you for this honor that is going to be bestowed by the president in september of this year
mr chairman on september 11th the terrorists did nt just use box cutters and airplanes to attack america they used our own laws against us to help them murder thousands of people
i refuse to gamble with the lives of american citizens rolling the dice on flawed policies that have already failed to protect us against terrorism
if you want to come in on a visa you want to come in to be a citizen support it
there is one strand of wire on the ground where you could just drive from one field to another with a loaded truck and it has stopped a lot of that
take this floor if this was a farmer s field and you had a single strand of wire that was lying on the ground that is what separated the united states and mexico
in 1 year there were a number of rapes and a number of murders by the coyotes and people on the us side of people trying to get across
i did not know when we were on the floor that we had an amendment when i went over there
mr speaker i have been flying wing on the gentleman from pennsylvania mr murtha xz4002860 for about 14 years and he has always got me home safely
the gentleman from california mr cox xz4000830 is working on the abuses of the homeland security money
that is being taken on
many of us have been working on this for years
i support passage of this legislation as i believe it is absolutely necessary to continue to fund the important activities of our brave men and women fighting the global war on terrorism
our men and women depend on having the necessary equipment and systems to be successful in mission accomplishment
however i do not support the inclusion of unrelated projects within this bill and find it most unfortunate that members of congress are forced to vote on such legislation
but the other piece of that and i am delighted that the gentleman from arizona mr kolbe xz4002260 has brought that forward is to be certain that the most sophisticated applications of that technology are used on the border
we can do a far better job on the border than we have done before
i will focus on the issue driving this extreme language completing the 3 12 miles of border fencing including the ocean section in my district
as high as two of the new giant airbuses stacked on top of one another
i want to use my time today to discuss the provisions contained in hr 418 that fall within the jurisdiction of the committee on government reform which i chair security measures for federal acceptance of stateissued driver s licenses and personal identification cards commonly referred to as identity security
one of the most pressing recommendations proposed by the commission and one that fell within the jurisdiction of the committee on government reform appears on page 390 of the 911 commission report
the 911 hijackers relied on a wide variety of fraudulent documents
as chairman of the committee that oversees federalism issues i am mindful of concerns about the federal government imposing burdens on states socalled unfunded mandates
mr chairman may i inquire of the time on each side
i note on page 390 of the 911 commission report it recommends secure identification should begin in the united states
mr chairman i look forward to working with the gentleman from virginia mr moran xz4002831 on this issue as we move forward
mr chairman i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from connecticut mr shays xz4003700 the chairman of the subcommittee on national security
mr chairman i am happy to yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from ohio mr turner xz4004110 the former mayor of dayton and chairman of our subcommittee on technology information policy intergovernmental relations and the census
mr speaker i rise today in strong support of the conference report on hr 1268 and urge all my colleagues to support it
mr speaker i want to especially thank the speaker and majority leader for making good on their promise to get this legislation to the floor signed into law quickly in the 109th congress
finally i would like to thank my colleague from wisconsin for his tireless work and support on this issue last year following passage of the 911 commission recommendations implementation act he and i made a commitment to work together to ensure that the most important provisions not addressed in the final bill would be addressed early in the 109th congress
building upon guidelines and best practices established and accepted by state motor vehicle administrators the federal government s longstanding work on identity security and actions taken by individual states to shore up their licensing process following the terrorist attacks our legislation sets forth minimum document and issuance standards for federal acceptance of driver s licenses and stateissued personal identification cards
this loophole was highlighted on september 11th as nawaf al hazmi and hani hanjour the pilots of flight 77 both obtained licenses and identification cards after the expiration of their visa authorization
mr speaker i want to comment briefly on the 82 billion spending bill that will be approved today for the ongoing us military campaigns in iraq and afghanistan
mr speaker the house will convene on tuesday at 2 pm
any votes called on those measures will be rolled until 6 30 pm
on wednesday and thursday the house will convene at 10 am
mr speaker if the gentleman will continue to yield i would assume that the committee on rules would follow a process similar to the one that they followed for the rest of the 911 commission s recommendations and that is to have a structured rule that allows for a variety of amendments
but i will let the chairman of the committee on rules make announcements on that and reserve decisions for the committee on what those amendments will be
i can tell the gentleman that we are contemplating although actions by the committee on rules will need to be taken contemplating a rule that would merge the border security bill into another bill another mustpass piece of legislation not knowing what that would be
so yes i would hope that the chairmen of the respective committees that have a piece of this bill and i would also remind the gentleman that the committee on ways and means has a very big piece of this bill would reach out to their ranking members and work to put together as bipartisan a bill as possible
but i would imagine that the committee on rules would have the same sort of rule that we have had on this bill for the last couple of years
we are looking forward to working with him on immigration reform
after all mr chairman the war on terror is not being fought in a vacuum
they are risks threats even to the security of our homeland and to our success in the war on terror
this section creates new burdens on those seeking asylum including a corroborating evidence test empowering an immigration officer or immigration judge to deny asylum to a refugee because he believes in his discretion that the refugee should have somehow been able to obtain a particular document when fleeing her country
finally i note that i have concerns about this bill and its unintended consequences on the second amendment rights of gun owning americans like myself
however i am ashamed that this body has taken something as important as securing our troops and attached a hastily considered immigration provision that will result in massive unfunded mandates being passed on to our states
finally i am ashamed that this congress has turned its back on a promise made by our president to the palestinian authority to help improve the situation of the palestinian people and further the cause of peace for all in the middle east
i am concerned that the immigration provisions will force our great nation to turn our back on the thousands of political and human rights asylum seekers who look toward america as their last and best hope
my friends on the other side of the aisle should be ashamed of the fact that mr waxman xz4004250 and i have probably done more on this front from the minority than has anyone with a gavel
reconstructing iraq and afghanistan is too important not to get it right but confronted yet again with evidence of massive fraud and egregious war profiteering my republican colleagues are again choosing to bury their heads in the sand plug their ears and turn out the lights on our duty
instead of allowing president abbas to use american aid to build his security forces to take on terror we instead set him up for failure
it surprises me that the only thing that this congress is capable of bucking and embarrassing this administration on is the prospect of peace
i hope for the sake of peace we can correct this colossal error in judgment and that the president and the state department speak out against congress illadvised policy making on this most tragic conflict
undocumented workers will be on our roads
ironically consideration of this bill coincides with the release this week by the us commission on international religious freedom
mr speaker i rise in strong support of this rule which will simply allow us to consider general debate and in 7 minutes we are going to be up in the committee on rules considering a number of those issues that the gentleman from florida just raised deciding what it is that we will debate here on the house floor tomorrow
this is an issue that democrats and republicans alike can come together on to ensure that we do we do secure our borders
i am supporting this effort on border security in part because i am convinced that we will be able to down the road and i hope soon address the immigration reform question
if we look at the amendments that were submitted to the committee on rules and those that we have made in order it is fascinating
we have really turned ourselves inside out to try and accommodate the wide array of issues that were put forward before the committee on rules
yesterday we had three committees of jurisdiction share an hour and 40 minutes of general debate and we are going to have an opportunity for freeflowing debate on a wide range of issues today
we have had special orders held on this issue
we had a very lengthy hearing in the committee on rules which was available for all of the members we had that streamed online
now the argument that is going to be used on the fence issue and we will be bringing that up in just a little while has to do with the environment
this bird has chosen to nest on part of the fence and for that reason they can not complete the fence and it has allowed people to come in
we are going to have an opportunity for debate on that and an upordown vote on that issue
i will tell the gentleman that i am very proud of the fact that we were able to incorporate many of the ideas that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle offered
we had on our side 10 amendments that were submitted and we have only made three of our amendments in order of the original 10 that were submitted
i have listened to the arguments propounded by my colleagues on the other side of the aisle
in the area of responsibility for the subcommittee on which i serve under the committee on appropriations the military quality of life and veterans affairs and related agencies subcommittee i wholeheartedly support the language and funding in this bill
so i would like to urge the committee chairman the gentleman from california mr lewis xz4002391 the gentleman from wisconsin mr obey xz4003000 the gentleman from pennsylvania mr murtha xz4002860 and the gentleman from florida mr young xz4004391 to work together with us on a bipartisan basis to see that we can add the needed money for the va health care system to see that we do not shortchange these great americans who have risked their lives for our country
the republicans are clamoring in the senate about the lack of up or down votes on judges and today they denied the house not only an up or down vote on the socalled real id act but even a real debate on this issue
they impose onerous restrictions on foreign nationals in the us not to mention upon american citizens and slap a massive unfunded mandate upon the states
shortly after this legislation takes effect i can only imagine that instead of more licensed drivers on the roads there will be less
in the end as a legislator i must vote on the bill in front of me and in this instance i must vote for the vital funding contained in this bill
last year i voted to pass the 911 commission s bipartisan recommendations to reform identification standards and beef up security on our nation s border
i have been watching this debate all morning and i am really concerned about what is happening here on the floor of the house of representatives
i have heard statements here on the floor that the recommendations in this bill are in the 911 commission
this is wrong and i am going to have an amendment on the floor tomorrow to repeal it
i offer this amendment to strike section 102 not to stop construction of the remaining 3 miles of the border fence but to preserve the rule of law that this country was founded on
on october 26 of 2004 the coastal commission staff met with the customs and border patrolhomeland security
customs and border patrol maintained that it still wanted to continue to work with the coastal commission on measures they had agreed to and the coastal commission indicated their continued willingness to work with them despite the overall disagreement with some of the project components such as the smugglers gulch fill
this provision has never to date been used in san diego nor am i aware at any other time the authority has been used on the barrier fence
this bill turns its back on a core principle that distinguishes america from other nations that of being a safe haven for the tired poor and weak
i look forward to the debate on my amendment
as i stated before hr 418 is not a good bill and even more troubling is that we had no hearings or committee debate on it
just earlier this week in meeting with some bureau of citizenship and immigration services employees i was not surprised to learn that workers who were hired to help eliminate the backlog four years ago have been asked to stay on for another year
the act states an alien who is an officer official representative or spokesman of the palestine liberation organization is considered for purposes of this act to be engaged in a terrorist activity in the first place the united states already has a formal congressionally approved mechanism for designating foreign terrorist organizations and imposing sanctions on them
the plo is not on the us list of foreign terrorist organizations
second we are now on the cusp of a historic moment in the middle east peace process
instead of debating hr 418 the house of representatives should be focused on ensuring the successful enactment of the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act of 2004 and working on comprehensively reforming our immigration system so that immigration is legal safe orderly and reflective of the needs of american families businesses and national security
i can not support the process nor the actual policy this bill proposes and i urge my colleagues vote no on hr 418
the opposition on this side is not against the fence it is against emasculating all the laws of the land in order to get there
memorandum lt br gt to house committee on homeland security attention sue ramanathan and house committee on the judiciary attention kristin wells
pursuant to your request on february 3 this memorandum analyzes section 102 of hr 418 the real id act
the most analogous provisions that we located appear to be at least on their face the following 43 usc
2008 allows the president to waive provisions of federal law he deems necessary in the national interest to facilitate the construction or operation of crude oil transportation systems but such waivers must be submitted to congress and congress must pass a joint resolution before the president can act on the waivers
mr speaker i rise today in opposition to the emergency supplemental appropriations hr 1268 on substance and process
on substance this bill fails to provide an exit strategy for our troops in iraq
on process many of the items in this bill should be funded under the regular order in the annual appropriations cycle
i and many others in congress would like to have a rational debate on immigration reform but we are denied the opportunity when the leadership attaches nongermane immigration measures to a funding bill
again a minority of the majority is playing on the fears of this nation to enact a flawed policy that does not actually address the problem it purports to fix
no one can deny that comprehensive immigration reform is a topic on the minds of our constituents but such a critical policy debate should be conducted on its own merits
mr chairman i thank the gentleman from wisconsin mr sensenbrenner xz4003650 and all of those on the republican side who are so concerned about my district
ironically the united nations ramsar convention recently bestowed the prestigious label of wetlands of international importance on this 2 500acre national wildlife refuge and state park that you are going to destroy
here is what our first president george washington said and it has never been done more eloquently the willingness with which our young people are likely to serve in any war no matter how justified shall be directly proportional as to how they perceive the veterans of earlier wars were treated and appreciated by their country mr chairman the morale of our troops overseas depends on how we are going to treat their comrades when they return and how we treat their comrades who served in earlier battles
that is unconscionable to charge the veterans of this nation for their own health care and to balance the budget on the backs of these veterans
the chairman of the committee on veterans affairs was not satisfied with having a 250 enrollment fee
through technicalities through arcane kinds of things he is saying that the veterans of this nation are not entitled to this care because he is using a rule which is not being used for the 81 billion that we have on the floor but is used for this 3 billion that we are trying to use for our nation s veterans
then we will be accused of legislating on appropriations or some other rule will be brought up
the bill on the floor today appropriates a sum of 81 billion and we will be spending over 200 billion
i tried yesterday to put an amendment on the floor that would supplement this supplemental with an additional 3 billion that the veterans groups think and have testified and have outlined is necessary
we know that up to half of the homeless on the streets today are veterans mainly from vietnam because we did not give them the honor the respect the health care the jobs the housing that they needed
and so they are on the street after having fought for this country
mr chairman i wish to be heard on the point of order
it seems to me that the chairman has deeper issues than a blocking of the thing on a procedural ground and feels that the va is not doing its job
in addition the only way i could judge the sincerity of the majority party in these issues is to see what they had done to the chairman of the committee i have sat on for the last 12 years that is the va committee
i hope mr chairman that the gentleman will join me on a mission as i join him on a mission for accountability and efficiency to convince the leadership of his party to put back on that committee members of the committee who actually fight for veterans
we need a good assessment and recommendations made for us to follow through on
also this amendment calls for increased communications better communications between those on the ground and those of us here as policymakers and those who implement the policy
we simply need better information to be able to have recommendations that we can follow up on
mr chairman i rise today in support of the real id act and i thank the chairman for his courage and hard work on this vital measure
it is essential for us to be able to salvage what is going on in iraq for there to be an agreement on the part of the sunni muslims to participate
and here we have the majority in the house of representatives a fairly narrow majority apparently contemplating forcing an upordown vote on controversial legislation maybe allowing one amendment clearly repressing the strong desire of the minority to be able fully to debate it
it is 1 35 on wednesday
this congress created the united states commission on international religious freedom in 1998
the report by the united states commission on international religious freedom an agency created by congress in 1998 describes an ad hoc system run by the department of homeland security that has extreme disparities in who is released or granted asylum depending on whether someone seeks refuge in texas or new york comes from iraq or haiti or is represented by a lawyer
those awaiting a court decision on asylum are also less likely to be freed
one of the experts who examined the centers for the commission craig haney a psychologist who briefed the senate judiciary committee on the subject yesterday said he was shocked by what he found
to cut down on that number the commission recommended that the airport interviewers and not just immigration judges be given the authority to grant asylum on the spot when warranted
since the 1996 change in immigration law critics have complained that the system is subjecting those fleeing torture and repression to harsh conditions in detention that can drag on for years
but this is the first bipartisan examination based on an inside view
preeta d bansal a democrat who chaired the commission said more research is needed especially on the reasons for the sharp drop in asylum seekers
we have been told that in foreign countries the department of homeland security is being employed to prevent people from even getting on board airplanes said ms bansal a former solicitor general of new york state
so we have a bipartisan committee on international religious freedom critical of our denial of asylum rights
for example we often hear leviticus quoted on the floor of the house
i know leviticus gets turned on and off here like an electric bulb but it does now seem to me that kind of cafeteria approach to religion is something the majority has adopted
mr speaker does the gentleman really believe that 20 minutes of debate 10 on each side on these complicated issues is free and flowing debate
why only 10 minutes of debate on each side on these complicated issues
mr speaker hearing the chairman of the committee on rules describe this restricted rule as fair and balanced reinforces the fact that when people on the right in america politically tell you something is fair and balanced you had better ask for another deck of cards
then the chairman said well we do not have to have long debate on these things after all we had a hearing in the committee on rules and it was streamed on line
anyone who thinks that a hearing in the committee on rules that is streamed on line is a substitute for open and free debate in the united states house of representatives or anyone who says that ought to remember i would give just one piece of advice
no one thinks that an online hearing in the committee on rules with a handful of members in a room that has 30 seats substitutes for free and open debate in the house of representatives and particularly when you only give 10 minutes on a particular amendment
i want to talk about the amendment on asylum
the provisions on asylum have evoked overwhelming opposition from the various religious communities in america
i noted yesterday that the commission on interreligious freedom set up by this congress to protect religious freedom in the world put out earlier this week a report saying that our asylum procedures are too restrictive
to make what the commission on interreligious freedom says is a bad situation much worse
can we turn leviticus on and off that way
mr speaker because i do not think that religion ought to be driven from the public square on an issue on which there is such an overwhelming religious consensus i will offer a statement condemning this bill and its asylum provisions be inserted here
requiring unreasonable levels of evidence to prove an asylum claim placing a greater burden on asylum seekers to convince reviewers of the key motivation of their accusers and allowing subjective considerations to guide the review process all send a chilling message to those who desperately seek the safety and protection which they have a right to expect of our great nation
last week we were visited those of us on the democratic side by a representative of the catholic bishops who asked us specifically to oppose this bill and particularly to condemn the asylum provisions
but in any case i do want to stress those of you who have said we have insufficiently paid attention to religious values mr speaker i urge them not to turn their back on the religious community now and not to give the religious communities a broad range of them 10 minutes in which we can make the case that this bill violates biblical injunctions about aliens and undercuts our mission to be a haven for the religiously persecuted
with this legislation congress is acting decisively to ensure that our soldiers sailors and airmen have the resources they need to keep iraq on the road back to the community of civilized nations
every single word of praise uttered on this floor today is justified
they do not have an exact figure as to what we should be spending on longterm needs so we can question whether or not we should be spending that money
we ask families to do it for their budgets we ask businesses to do it for their budgets i think we can find that entire amount of approximately 4 billion of waste fraud and abuse in the entire budget offset it and then we can truly stand before the world and say that when we are making charitable contributions to the tsunami relief victims that it is truly coming from this generation and not being passed on to future generations
when south asia was struck by tsunami waves on december 26 the world s interest in tsunami detection and warning systems was heightened
the impact of these waves was felt around the world and the tragedy of its immediate effect on indian ocean coastlines has painfully exposed our lack of ability to provide early warning and coastal community education and support
however advanced sensors have been deployed only on relatively small scales and the systems that are deployed have not been coordinated into an integrated system that will optimize our understanding of the oceans
most recently the us commission on ocean policy made an integrated ocean observing system a top recommendation in its report an ocean blueprint for the 21st century
the ocean however is often referred to as the last frontier a place where we continue to find new organisms and species and where we still struggle to understand the profound implications for climate changes and more direct impacts of the oceans on our human habitats
mr speaker i thank my colleague on the committee on rules
i remind my colleagues on the other side of the aisle who keep saying we are not given enough time and we are rushing all of these complicated issues that we have not discussed but these provisions i remind my colleagues they were in the original bill that we passed on the house side the intel bill
listen to this if terrorist travel options are reduced they may be forced to rely on means of interaction which can be more easily monitored and to resort to travel documents which are more readily detectable the 911 commission report page 65 all but one of the 911 hijackers acquired some form of united states identification document some by fraud acquisition of these forms of identification would have assisted them in boarding commercial flights renting cars and other necessary activities
she rode on that subway every day going back and forth to work he was quoted as saying i want at least 1 000 to 2 000 to die in a single day and that alien had applied for asylum
mr speaker i am not on the committee on the judiciary
my colleagues and friends on the other side of the isle suggest we stick our heads in the sand and ignore one of the tools used by terrorists to gain access to and remain in our country
terrorists were free to conduct surveillance coordinate operations obtain and receive funding go to school and learn english make contacts in the united states acquire necessary materials and execute an attack so if i am to understand my friends on the other side we are to ignore the problem of asylum abuse and do nothing
the first thing is america will not sleep any more securely with the passage of this piece of legislation as well intended as it may be because i am not going to question the motives of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle
but they all acknowledge that there is not a conspiracy going on here to thwart the efforts at security by these groups
having a uniform policy that relies on common sense will do more to keep america open and free than having a policy that relies on hope
the united states agency for international development issued a regulation on october 19 2004 that ensures religious organizations are allowed to compete on an equal footing with other nongovernmental organizations for usaid funding in the case of this bill funding to help tsunami victims
in addition this section would waive laws requiring consultations with native nations regarding activities on tribal lands grave sites or archaeological and sacred sites
the proponents of this dangerous and divisive bill have mischaracterized and misrepresented it as a measure that focuses on national security
it would force our country to turn its back on women children and victims of religious persecution
the bill would create insurmountable hurdles for legitimate asylumseekers and slam the door shut on refugees who have fled brutal human rights abuses
such a policy will wreak havoc on our streets and highways
the list goes on and on and i consider myself very good company
mr speaker i thank my colleague who ably serves on the permanent select committee on intelligence as well as the committee on rules for the time
mr speaker as the lead conferee on the intelligence reform bill i oppose the rule on hr 418 and the underlying bill because they will not make us safer
mr speaker i wholeheartedly agree that if we want to cut down on illegal immigration we must improve border security
mr chairman many on this side of the aisle also support strong border protection
rather than reaching out to the governor of california a leader in the party on the other side of the aisle to reach compromise on this issue the author of this bill has crafted language that will usurp all of governor schwarzenneger s power regarding the border fence
the 911 commission s staff report on 911 and terrorist travel found that a number of terrorists
the 911 commission staff report noted than an immigration judge held a hearing on rahman s asylum claim weeks before his followers bombed the worid trade center
in 1996 congress approved building the 14 mile long san diego border fence on the mexicous border right next to a major us navy base
under current immigration laws prohibitions on some terroristrelated activities only apply to aliens who are trying to enter the us but not to those who already reside within our borders
as ronald reagan said america is a shining light on the hill well apparently mr speaker today that light is red
we are here today without a final rule because of a lack of agreement on which amendments to allow
let congress work its will on this legislation
to stifle debate on a bill as ill conceived as hr 418 is undemocratic to the core
this is the only bill of substance on the house s agenda this week
we have the opportunity to conduct an open debate on each radical section of this bill
as a country that prides itself on spreading democracy throughout the world we must practice what we preach
the collection of unnecessary personal information by state agencies in an attempt to discern each and every person s immigration standard goes against the very freedom this nation was founded on by immigrants and must be rejected
our nation s security is of paramount importance but in an effort to achieve that goal let us a thriving nation of immigrants not turn our backs on our history and our future
mr speaker i am privileged to yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from massachusetts mr mcgovern xz4002630 my very good friend who serves on the committee on rules with me
mr speaker i am privileged to yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from california ms harman xz4001660 my good friend the ranking member of the permanent select committee on intelligence
mr speaker i ask the gentleman from georgia mr gingrey xz4001510 whether he is on the committee on the judiciary
mr speaker the gentleman from georgia and i are on the committee on rules and we know this measure did not come up until 2 hours just before we went in there
mr speaker i yield 1 minute to the gentleman from california mr berman xz4000250 a member of the committee on the judiciary to give a more exemplary outline of what transpired
mr speaker i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from texas mr hinojosa xz4001790 who lives in south texas and is on the texasmexican border and may have some experiences in this regard
there is a new committee on homeland security that is now permanent rightly so
the gentleman from wisconsin s mr sensenbrenner xz4003650 manager s amendment came to the committee on rules 2 hours before we had an opportunity to see it and i would urge in the house how many have read it even at this point
additionally there are others who are too numerous to mention without great prolixity but i will cite in the record some of the organizations that oppose this measure the aflcio the american jewish committee the antidefamation league the asian american legal defense and education fund catholic charities usa and catholic bishops hebrew immigrant aid society the irish american unity conference the korean american coalition the mexican american legal defense and educational fund and a footnote all of the colleagues in the house that are latino and african american have signed on to a letter opposing this measure the national conference of state legislatures that i just mentioned the national council of la raza the service employees international union the arabamerican antidiscrimination committee
although ncsl opposed this federal mandate ncsl worked with congress to ensure that state elected officials are included on a negotiated rulemaking committee which will devise the federal standards to apply the standards only to newly issued documents and to require the secretary of the department of transportation to identify the cost of the federal standards on states prior to their implementation
ncsl is committed to preserving the congressional intent of the act by ensuring that state legislatures are represented on the negotiated rulemaking committee
ncsl further encourages the secretary to exercise his authority under the act to include individuals from organizations that represent civil liberties and privacy interests on the negotiated rulemaking committee
the expanding number of visas backlogs on applications for status changes and inability to either access or navigate department of homeland security data systems are among the problems requiring resolution so that states can administer noncitizen applications for driver s licenses and identification cards
ncsl believes that states must establish am ore cooperative working relationship on this issue with the federal government
we commend chairman sensenbrenner and chairman davis for their commitment to driver s license integrity however both hr 418 and hr 368 would impose technological standards and verification procedures on states many of which are beyond the current capacity of even the federal government
mr speaker my colleagues on the other side for the balance of these arguments today and during yesterday said very frequently and it was repeated again by the gentleman from texas that the horrible people that were on the airplanes that did the dastardly deed here in america on september 11 had collectively 63 driver s licenses
they were in this country some on expired visas some with visas that had been approved and probably one or two with fraudulent visas
and once again we see debate limited on this legislation for no reason
the bill is the only item on our legislative schedule today yet debate on this bill has been limited to less than 2 hours
only a fourth of the amendments submitted to the committee on rules will be allowed on the floor today and what possible reason can the majority give for limiting debate in this matter
surely given the drastic nature of the changes to our asylum laws contained in hr 418 it is in the best interests of the country to hold an open debate on this legislation
mr speaker last wednesday the chairman of the committee on rules sent out an announcement notifying members as is his responsibility that all their proposed amendments to this bill were due in the committee on rules by noon on tuesday february 8 all members who submitted their amendments republicans and democrats followed this rule all members that is except the gentleman from wisconsin chairman sensenbrenner
it appears to make it easier for an immigration judge to reject on asylum seeker based on subjective and cultural factors that are notoriously unreliable indicators of credibility
it also allows a person to be denied asylum based on any inconsistencies or falsehoods in their testimony whether or not these inconsistencies are relevant to the person s claim
i continue to harp on the fact that it does not protect children who are here and in need of asylum consideration
what is worse is that members today will not even have the opportunity to vote up or down on it
in this age of diminished personal privacy this bill throws around terms such as mandatory facial image capture and electronic storage of identity source documents without fully explaining and it is not explained and i ask anybody to explain it on the majority side certainly for the american public explaining fully how all this captured data will be used and by whom
last night i watched the socalled fair and balanced fox programming and on that programming it happened that the gentleman from wisconsin chairman sensenbrenner was one of the guests
let us not shut out the people here in the house of representatives some 41 who are newly here who have no idea what we did with reference to this matter last year and have not had time in order to be able to review it sufficient to be able to make arguments on behalf of their constituencies in a satisfactory manner
i urge my colleagues to vote no on the rule and this illconceived legislation
but i was in that same process as the chairman was in the committee on rules
threequarters of the amendments that were submitted on time pursuant to the chairman s correct direction to the body are not a part of the debate here
it is not being voted on up or down for the reason that it was made a selfexecuting part of the rule
i do not think any irony is lost on the chairman about the ninth circuit s ruling
tim roemer a former colleague of ours who did serve on the 911 commission and myself and others filed the original legislation leading to the development of the 911 independent commission
and my colleague has cited that commission frequently but i defy him on the subject of border security page 186 to tell me anywhere where it says anything about driver s licenses
they talk about creating an interagency center to target illegal entry and human traffickers imposing tighter controls on student visas taking legal action to prevent terrorists from coming into the united states and to remove those already here further increasing the number of immigration agents to fbi joint terrorism task forces activating a special court to enable the use of classified evidence
and i could go on and on and on in the clark working group and the 911 report and not one word not one word regarding any driver s licenses
mr speaker i object to the vote on the ground that a quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not present
i guess that means they will sell this bill on the altruistic notions of patriotism and humanitarianism in a snide attempt to drum up support
why do nt we just make things easier on everyone by throwing this bill out the window and opening up everyone s bank accounts to the united states executive branch
the amendment makes certain that before an alien is released from dhs detention on his own recognizance pending an upcoming hearing the immigration judge first certify that the alien is not a flight risk and more importantly that he does not pose a security risk to the united states
mr speaker one of the reasons we are here on the floor visiting this issue today is as the distinguished chairman of the committee on rules pointed out while our founders believed that all men were created equal now we have the arcanities and absurdities of certain judicial procedures that allow illegal aliens to enjoy more legal privacy in some cases than do american citizens
in the wake of 911 in the wake of clear and demonstrable evidence that there are those who come to this nation with the intent of harming and killing americans who are bent on the destruction of our nation and our system of government at long last this body should take the steps necessary to preserve our security and our liberty
during the conference with the other body on what became the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act of 2004 the provisions contained in hr 418 were either dropped in their entirety or modified so substantially as to virtually defeat the fundamental purpose of the provision
a majority of the conferees on the part of the house very reluctantly agreed in order to get a conference agreement on the fundamental reform of the nation s intelligence community
the enacted provision requires a negotiated rulemaking process without any absolute certitude that the negotiations on the proposed consensus regulations will be concluded by the date specified in the act
however it would make it more difficult for victims of persecution to obtain asylum impose expensive mandates on the states and authorize the secretary of homeland security to waive any and all laws to construct barriers at our international borders none of which will make this country any safer from terrorists
the 911 commission s immigrationrelated recommendations focused on targeting terrorist travel through reliable identification systems and effective integrated information sharing
this legislation would expand the authority for expedited alien removal without further hearing or review impose stringent restrictions on asylum seekers hoping to be given an interview with an asylum officer and require unreasonable standards of proof for aliens seeking asylum
a report released this week by the united states commission on international religious freedom underscores the dangerous impact these socalled reforms would have on our asylum process
according to the commission the current expedited removal process in the us places victims of persecution at great risk for further trauma while the severity of conditions and deprivation imposed on asylum seekers was shocking rather than address this serious situation in the ways recommended by the commission today this congress would force even more innocent asylum seekers into expedited removal or send them back to their persecutors without an opportunity to appeal their case to an immigration judge
rather than permit local state and federal officials to work together to create minimum security standards for driver s licenses and identification cards as authorized by congress last year hr 418 would mandate statutory standards for states and require them to share personal information on all licensed drivers in a massive national database
our country was founded on the principle of immigration and we must not close our doors to those who lawfully seek to share in the freedom and democracy that americans have always held dear
the gentleman from washington mr baird xz4000110 and i have been working on this issue together and trying to add 13 billion for va health care and reintegration services
the fiscal year 2005 omnibus was 13 billion short in the amount that then secretary principi as well as the house committee on veterans affairs stated was needed to just maintain the current level of veterans health care
currently the terrorists and their supporters can be kept out of the united states but as soon as they set foot into the us on tourist visas we can not deport them for many of the very same offenses
another deficiency in current law is based on a flawed understanding of how terrorist organizations operate
i think the money will ultimately go to bombs and bullets rather than babies or because money is fungible it will free up other funds to be used on terrorist activities the real id act is written so that an alien who provides funds or other material support to a terrorist organization would be deportable unless he did not know and should not reasonably have known that the organization was a terrorist organization
obviously there are some items that are in the energy bill or that are proposed for the energy bill that have significant opposition on one side of the aisle or the other
i would hope mr leader if we could in working with the various committee chairs and i suppose most primarily the gentleman from texas mr barton xz4000180 and the gentleman from michigan mr dingell xz4001100 in this respect to come to as bipartisan an agreement on the substance of that bill so that we could see it not just pass through the house of representatives which may be interesting in terms of the political claim that we passed it but which does nothing for our energy independence which is i think our objective
mr speaker i thank the gentleman for referencing the committee on ways and means but i certainly agree with him that having the gentleman from california mr thomas xz4004010 and the gentleman from new york mr rangel xz4003330 work closely together and perhaps their respective chairs of the subcommittees that might deal with that work together would be very very useful to accomplishing an objective as opposed to simply passing a bill that then languishes in the congress and never gets to the president
if in fact we consider that and it sounds to me like we certainly do not have enough information to determine whether or not the week after next the energy bill might be on the floor but if and when it comes to the floor mr leader would you contemplate the possibility of having an open rule on that piece of legislation given its importance and scope
mr speaker i would hope on that bill because of its great importance to the security of the nation and to all of our consumers of energy which is to say all of us that we would have as broad a consideration of it as possible so that we could get everybody s ideas put on the floor voted up or down and move the bill with as big a consensus as we can accomplish
mr chairman i thank the gentleman from wisconsin and i thank our new chairman and congratulate him on his new position
this congress has a constitutional obligation a duty on behalf of the voters who elected us to serve here to hold the administration accountable for such expenditures
mr chairman as you know we literally hold hundreds perhaps thousands of hours of hearings on the individual bills
i know that even today 2 years after the onset of operation iraqi freedom there continues to be strong disagreement across the nation on the decision to remove the brutal hussein regime as well as the planning and prosecution of our military effort in iraq
however on this point i believe there is unanimity
so we built that first line which was the steel fence right on the border
now i can just tell you as a guy who has worked on this thing from the start my staff went out and found those 79 000 steel landing mats to build this fence
a few miles north of this gap in the fence is the biggest naval installation on the west coast
not only does this bill provide critical support to our military and the war on terror but it also funds international humanitarian reconstruction and economic assistance programs provided by the united states agency for international development
natural disasters are particularly harsh on pregnant women
last year congress passed legislation based on the recommendations of the 911 commission but failed to address vital national security and homeland security issues
the 19 terrorists who attacked america on 911 had obtained over 63 valid forms of identification between them to breach our homeland security
i urge a yea vote on the jackson amendment
line 10 on page 2 of h res 71 states all points of order against consideration of the bill are waived the rule makes in order hr 418 the real id act of 2005 which contains a large unfunded mandate on state governments in violation of section 425 of the budget act
there is overwhelming evidence before us today that this bill which has bypassed the committee process denies members the opportunity to hear expert testimony on the impact of these sweeping changes or to determine alternatives to ensure that all of us are on the same page in the war against terrorism
the opportunity to determine changes to current law or to offer amendments to the proposed legislation was not given to us and it will impose overwhelming costs on state governments already struggling to meet the growing costs of local law enforcement s role in securing the homeland
what we have here today is an assault on federalism in the legislative process
this point of order is about the farce before us that has trampled states rights and inflated the burden on our local governments without their input
i urge members to vote no on consideration of the resolution and stand up for the rights of their home states legislature governor and local governments along with the people of the united states
mr speaker i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from michigan mr conyers xz4000800 distinguished ranking member of the full house committee on the judiciary
i think i can start out by saying that we come from a state that is very diligent and as well very astute on their members of congress supporting unfunded mandates to a burdened and already overworked state budget in a growing state that would have added responsibilities with this enormous burden that this real id bill would exercise against it
we appreciate the cbo but we know what happened and i think it is more important to know what the impact will be on the states on the basis of the national governors association and state legislatures
in 2004 on this very same bill the cbo told what the numbers would be
i would venture to say the competents of the cbo could be put on the witness stand and they would attest to the fact that this is what it was going to cost
so this is not in any way casting aspersions on their good work
mr speaker this violates the rule and it violates the waiver where in essence the republicans indicated in their early beginnings in the majority that they would not allow unfunded mandates to go forward on this floor
the actual merits of the bill mr speaker can be discussed as my colleague has said later on during the day
there is overwhelming evidence before us today that this bill which has bypassed the committee process denying members the opportunity to hear expert testimony on the impact of these sweeping changes to current law or to offer amendments to the proposed legislation will impose overwhelming costs on state governments already struggling to meet the growing costs of local laws enforcement s role in securing the homeland
what we have before us today is an assault on federalism and the legislative process
this point of order is about the farce before us that has trampled states rights and inflated the burden on our local governments
i urge members to vote no on consideration of the resolution and stand up for the rights of your home states legislatures governors and local governments
mr speaker on that i demand the yeas and nays
as i look at the members on the floor of the house each and every one is sincere in their commitment to the war on terrorism
i applaud the chairman of the full committee on the judiciary
a number of members who are here on the floor are committee on the judiciary members
i want to applaud them for the work that has been done on this issue
opposition to this legislation at this time is by no means a reflection on anyone s commitment to the war on terrorism but the real id act should have been subjected to hearings and markups before being brought to this floor
as we stand here on the floor the committee on rules is determining whether the nadler amendment will be admitted that responds to the crisis we face in the asylum laws if this bill is to be passed in its present form
this legislation will force the united states in its national database and in its requirement standardizing id driver s licenses and birth certificates which puts us on that road without hearings without oversight and without question of america s civil liberties
well do you want individuals on our highways and byways that are not licensed
i do believe that we can standardize them by a biometric system but we have intruded on the rights of states when they too can work with the federal government making the system work
mr chairman i am very pleased to yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from california ms linda t snchez a distinguished member of the house committee on the judiciary
mr chairman i am delighted that the gentleman from new york mr nadler xz4002890 has indicated that the amendment has been made in order and i do want to acknowledge that he is the ranking minority member of the subcommittee on the constitution of the committee on the judiciary
mr chairman we are on the floor today because the representation has been made to the american people and to our colleagues that this legislation is legislation that relates and responds to the crisis in the war on terror
this is much easier than the steps required for obtaining asylum which among other things require the applicant to establish a wellfounded fear of persecution on account of race religion nationality membership in a particular social group or political opinion
we need to wait for that information before we consider any bills on revising our asylum laws
the approach in the real id act is to raise the bar on the burden of proof which would result in a denial of relief to bona fide asylum seekers without any assurance that the changes would discourage terrorists from seeking asylum
for instance in addition to showing that the alleged persecution would be on account of one of the enumerated grounds the applicant would have to establish that the persecution was or will be a central reason for persecuting the applicant in effect the asylum applicant would have to establish what was in the mind of the persecutor
the defense to removal on that basis would be to demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that you did not know and should not reasonably have known that the organization was a terrorist organization
the real id act also includes sections on security measures for drivers licenses and identification cards
in contrast the real id act would impose specific requirements on the states now without giving the states and the other stakeholders an opportunity to provide input on what these requirements should be and without an assessment of the benefits and costs of the measures
sheriff timothy bukowski of kankakee illinois has made an important observation on this matter
it would waive all laws including laws protecting civil rights laws protecting the health and safety of workers laws such as the davisbacon act which are intended to ensure that construction workers on federallyfunded projects are paid the prevailing wage environmental laws and laws respecting sacred burial grounds
this view is shared by our colleagues on the senate side
i have heard that he will be working on comprehensive immigration legislation with senator edward kennedy
i invite my colleagues who are supporting the real id act to work with me on comprehensive immigration reform
the reason this is so challenging is that the committee on homeland security the gentleman from california chairman cox and the gentleman from mississippi mr thompson xz4004021 the ranking member have not had a chance to review this amendment
without committee scrutiny we would be compelling the disclosure of sensitive or confidential information to a bonding agent such as medical history criminal investigation notes location of witnesses and information on victims of domestic violence
mr chairman i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from mississippi mr thompson xz4004021 the newly appointed ranking member of the committee on homeland security
we hope however that this amendment will send notice to those who might try to use any false document in trying to get on an airplane for the potential damage it may do
as they say however the devil is in the details i would like a hearing and a markup on this amendment before deciding whether it should be enacted
on the second let me have the gentleman restate it again
because one of the concerns i have on the select committee on homeland security and watching for example tsa formulate itself and work to train certainly very professional employees but the training does not necessarily lend itself to maybe the keenness of eye to see that false document
mr chairman reclaiming my time and i would simply say the comment on this is that i appreciate the distinguished gentleman from delaware being open with his response
i do have to raise red flags on making sure it is not random making sure there is a conviction and in knowing what happens with dhs
clearly this legislation is needed with respect to improved and increased technology but i would also argue that the secure our border act that was offered by the select committee on homeland security democrats in the last congress really speaks to the broader question
so technology is certainly what we need and i hope as we move forward in the select committee on homeland security we will if you will author bills that will give those resources to the northern and southern border
the kolbe amendment is one of the few ideas that have been proposed on the floor of the house during debate on hr 418 that would help secure our borders
lastly while this amendment does add to the debate on border security these surveillance systems still require border patrol agents to apprehend illegal border crossers and contraband
this same employee was also responsible for notifying agents about buried sensor activations numbering from 100150 an hour and running computer checks on all detainees
there is no proof or facts that terrorists have been able to pull one over on us in large numbers
the terrorist choosing this method would have to present himself at a border and then prove in expedited removal proceedings that he has a credible fear of persecution on account of race the approach taken by the real id act is to raise the bar on the burden of proof for everyone who applies for asylum which would result in a denial of relief to bona fide asylum seekers without any assurance that the changes would discourage terrorists from seeking asylum
for instance in addition to showing that the alleged persecution would be on account of one of the enumerated grounds the applicant would have to establish that the persecution was or will be a central reason for persecuting the applicant in effect the asylum applicant would have to establish what was in the mind of the persecutor
then it provides that the trier of fact has the discretion of basing a credibility determination on any relevant factor and it specifies relevant factors that can be the sole basis for a credibility determination
near the end it mentions inconsistencies and inaccuracies or falsehoods in statements without regard to whether an inconsistency inaccuracy or falsehood goes to the heart of the applicant s claim in other words it permits an immigration judge to make an adverse credibility finding in asylum proceedings on the basis of an inconsistency inaccuracy or falsehood that has no relevance to the asylum applicant s persecution claim
this should be done on a bipartisan basis however
but mr chairman i rise today as well as to support those peacekeeping dollars to say that many of the efforts in this legislation the work that has been done by the gentleman from wisconsin mr obey xz4003000 and the gentleman from california mr lewis xz4002391 i can appreciate in this emergency supplemental even though as i have spoken to my good friend and leader the gentleman from pennsylvania mr murtha xz4002860 on this issue it is important that we have an announced success strategy for leaving iraq
i am very disturbed as the ranking member of the committee on the judiciary subcommittee on immigration border security and claims that we have now forced into this bill as a selfoperating part of the rule that hr 418 would be included in the engrossment of the underlying bill hr 1268
we have had no hearings on this real id legislation and i oppose the inclusion of this bill if the underlying legislation is passed and engrossed as set forth in h res 151
hr 418 includes numerous provisions limiting the rights of refugees imposing onerous new driver s license requirements on the states making it easier to deport legal immigrants legal immigrants waiving all federal laws concerning the construction of fences and barriers where we have been told by homeland security experts they will not make us safer anywhere in the united states and denying immigrants longstanding habeas corpus rights
i will offer an amendment to stop the devastating lack of funding on the immigration and customs enforcement section of dhs
of particular concern to me as ranking member of the house judiciary subcommittee on immigration border security and claims is the forced inclusion of hr 418 in the engrossment of the underlying bill hr 1268
we have had no hearings on this bill and i oppose the inclusion of this bill if the underlying legislation is passed and engrossed as set forth in the rule h res 151
hr 418 includes numerous provisions limiting the rights of refugees imposing onerous new driver s license requirements on the states making it easier to deport legal immigrants waiving all federal laws concerning the construction of fences and barriers anywhere within the united states and denying immigrants long standing habeas corpus rights
i will however support the jackson amendment on africa and i as well will offer an amendment to stop the devastating lack of funding of the immigration and customs enforcement section of dhs a real crucial part of the nation s homeland security
i want to commend all of the leadership that is focused on this particularly narrow issue though it may seem
mr chairman let me acknowledge the full committee and the members of the appropriate subcommittee dealing with homeland security and as well the full committee chairman s just recent statement on this issue
former outgoing dhs deputy secretary james loy indicated that in testimony to the house appropriations subcommittee on homeland security that ice the immigration customs and enforcement needed an additional 300 million in order to finish the fiscal year 2004
officer callahan came before the judiciary committee just a few days ago on march 10 and indicated that in 5 days we might see the closing of the operations of ice
now i have stood on the floor of this house over and over again and i have said that immigration does not equate to terrorism
they are given a document to retain to come back to court for a court date and they are released on their own recognizance
immigration enforcement agent randy callahan testified on ice s financial difficulties and i realize that there is still a need to be able to fix the financial problems at ice
we can find common ground on security and immigration
we owe officers who are willing to put their life on the line no matter what way they have lost it to be able to provide them with the resources necessary
in fact the uniforms being used nationwide right now still have immigration naturalization service patches on them despite the fact that the ins no longer exists
mr chairman as the ranking member of the subcommittee on immigration border security and claims i have learned of a budget crisis in the homeland security department s bureau of immigration and customs enforcement ice
at a hearing last week on interior immigration enforcement resources immigration enforcement agent randy callahan testified on ice s financial difficulties
in fact the uniforms being used nationwide right now still have immigration and naturalization service ins patches on them despite the fact that ins no longer exists
they do not have enough money to hold people in custody buy new uniforms and equipment for employees or even issue badges and credentials with the correct department on them
frankly i believe if we are to do our work in iraq whether we agree or disagree with the war in iraq we do know that it is represented to us by the administration to be a war on terror
how can we fight the war on terror in afghanistan and iraq and not fight the war on terror in this country within our boundaries
i would ask my colleague and i would also ask at this moment that if he pursues his point of order whether or not we will have the opportunity whether in conference or as we continue the appropriations process to focus on the lack of funding for the immigration and enforcement officers immigration customs and enforcement officers the border patrol which i think you are aware of and the detention beds
i would like very much to yield to the chairman and on this issue i think we are all in common agreement about the need to secure our homeland
the conference report on hr 1268 provides for emergency fy2005 funds for military operations in iraq and afghanistan tsunami relief efforts foreign assistance programs and domestic homeland security priorities
instead of being united on issues of national security and international relations we are put in a divisive situation with the provisions of the real id act
just last year our colleagues on the other side of the aisle attempted to force these provisions in the context of the 911 intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act hr 10
there have been no hearings or debates on these significant changes to existing law
the immigration provisions that have been forced into this supplemental include numerous provisions restricting the grant of asylum protection imposing onerous new driver s license requirements on the states making it easier to deport legal immigrants waiving all federal laws concerning the construction of fences and barriers anywhere within the united states and denying immigrants longstanding habeas corpus rights
the usa patriot act for which we in the subcommittee on crime terrorism and homeland security of the judiciary are only now holding hearings in piecemeal form already barred terrorists from receiving asylum protection in the united states
i am very pleased to say that this conference report increases the military death gratuity to 100 000 from 12 420 and increases subsidized life insurance benefits to 400 000 from 250 000 for families of soldiers who died or were killed while on active duty beginning from oct
this conference report addresses some of the concerns that democrats have had about the fact that the families of soldiers who were killed while on active duty were not being given the necessary funds to provide for themselves
we talk about public diplomacy with the international world and i firmly believe that the funds appropriated here along with the work of our personnel on the ground help make a great case for the goodness of our nation
all the gentleman is asking for is fiscal accountability on over 200 billion that is being spent far beyond these shores
we do more checking on the books of churches around this country than we do on the expenditure of 200 billion
a recently congressional quarterly article indicated neither the defense department nor private industry says it has exact numbers of how many people are on private payrolls under contracts paid by us tax dollars we should do what is right with the money of the american people
i heard another reference on the radio this morning that iraq is going to be a generational commitment like world war ii was
i was pretty upset when i saw big photos of big stacks of money being handed out on the streets over there
the only reason i am voting for the bill before us today is because it provides much needed equipment for our forces in theater increases death gratuity to 100 000 for families of soldiers who have died or were killed on active duty
the defense department wants to take the money and provide little detail to congress on how these dollars are being used or abused
we in congress must call on the defense department to provide better accountability for the spending decisions it makes
mr speaker when hr 1268 was first considered on the floor in march i reluctantly supported its passage
the funds provided in this bill will enable our soldiers and marines on the ground to uparmor their vehicles
i continue to be frustrated that our war plan still contains no game plan on when we can begin to bring our troops home
the total includes 5 million to support environmental recovery activities 10 million to create new economic opportunities for women and 125 million to support initiatives that focus on the immediate and longterm needs of children
another key element of this agreement with which i take issue is the mandate imposed on states that requires certain identification standards on driver s licenses for federal identification purposes
having traveled to baghdad twice certainly there is a strong case that can be made that we do need to be moving forth on a new embassy but this is how we are going to pay for that new embassy getting back to regular order and procedure around here and how we are going to afford the cost of this new embassy rather than just going into deficit spending
we need to get back to regular procedure and regular order around here and what better place than to start on a nonemergency creation the siting of a new embassy to get it to the appropriate committee for proper oversight and hearings of deliberation and then finding the appropriate offsets to pay for this
mr chairman i rise today in support of the emergency supplemental appropriations act for defense the global war on terror and tsunami relief 2005
the 128th is on their first tour of duty in iraq and is performing well despite several equipment shortages and setbacks the unit has dealt with
the 1158th is on their second tour of duty and is also performing above and beyond their mission
i thank the chairman for leading on this most important issue
on september 11 our nation suffered the most horrible attack ever on american soil at the hands of those with a deepseated enduring hatred for freedom
half a million people are caught there each year trying to get across and that does not include those who get on through
any one of those driver s licenses got them anything they needed to do in america full rights of citizenship for that matter and get on board any airplane
we have made it harder for terrorists to get on airplanes with razor blades
we spent millions of dollars on metal detectors and millions of dollars expanding tsa and putting federal employees in place and we put millions of people in long lines waiting to get through
stand in line with the rest of us where i stand where i see a 75yearold lady going through a spreadeagle search while the young middle eastern male waltzes through with a smirk on his face and we can not close that door
the subcommittee on transportation treasury and hud that i chair has mostly technical items in this supplemental that are not controversial so i would like to focus my comments on the overall bill
i would like to comment specifically on one part of the supplemental that i know many of us are concerned about and that is the 200 million to aid the palestinian authority
we maintain the prohibition on direct assistance to the palestinian authority
we require the administration to provide a comprehensive report on the steps taken by the palestinian authority on good governance economic reforms and dismantling the terrorist organizations
i represent a district that has more apprehensions of illegal immigrants than any other district on the southern border in fact more apprehensions than all the other districts combined
while the national intelligence reform act of 2004 designed a plan to enhance ground surveillance on the northern border a similar program was not designed for the southern border
this is particularly a problem in arizona because more than half of the entire border is covered by tribal organizations tribal units sovereign tribal nations who are not generally covered by most of the federal legislation we have on telecommunication sharing
the amendment builds on the sentiment it builds on the intention of hr 418 and through its enhancement of homeland security helps to ensure the safety and defense of our nation
i want to congratulate the gentleman on this his first bill to be brought to the floor of the house of representatives
mr chairman i want to talk about the funding of programs that are under the jurisdiction of the subcommittee that i chair that is the subcommittee on foreign operations export financing and related programs
the committee s overall recommendation for all the programs under the jurisdiction of the subcommittee on foreign operations export financing and related programs is 12 billion less than the president requested
these programs total 616 million for afghanistan 200 million for the new global war on terror partners fund the new 200 million solidarity fund and 45 million in debt relief for countries affected by the december tsunami
let me say that the funds we are providing in the foreign assistance chapter must be considered an investment in security both in the region and on american soil
we are in complete agreement on our need to take every step that we can to provide not only for a peaceful solution in the area but also to provide for humanitarian relief for the people who live in that region and therefore i am prepared today with concurrence of the chairman of the committee to accept this en bloc amendment and we will take a very good look at this in the conference with the senate and see where we are at that point
we will be a little bit further down the road and have some time to get a better handle on this at that point
which one are we on here at this point
are we on the one that is 3 million or the one that was the larger one that i heard read first
until that happens the only contact the only way to get relief supplies to these little valleys which on the back side has a very high ridge of mountains and no access by road the only way to get supplies to them is by air or by sea a very expensive project
mr chairman i reserve a point of order on the gentleman s amendment and since the gentleman from texas has already spoken i do not know whether he intends to speak again before i make the point of order or whether he is prepared to go forward at this time
i make the point of order as the chairman of the full committee has said on several occasions
mr chairman i ask unanimous consent that debate on this amendment and any amendments thereto be limited to 10 minutes to be equally divided and controlled by the proponent and myself the opponent
so the gentleman from new york is incorrect when he says this is similar to the legislation that was passed last year on the regular appropriation bill
supplemental legislation includes appropriations that are added on top of the regular appropriations
mr chairman i appreciate the gentleman raising this point and i want to make it very clear that religious organizations may compete on an equal footing for usaid funding in this bill as they may for usaid funding in other bills
mr speaker first of all i want to congratulate the chairman of the full committee on this his maiden effort to bring a major supplemental appropriation to the floor as chairman and i congratulate him for the leadership that he has shown in bringing this so swiftly to this floor
the people i represent living on the border are frustrated with the illegal immigration system and we must address gaps in border security now
the senate provide a total of 2255 million 200 million in the solidarity fund and 255 million in the global war on terror partners fund
let me say that the funds we are providing in the foreign assistance chapter must be considered an investment in security both in the region and on american soil
i urge my colleagues to vote yes on the fiscal year 2005 emergency supplemental conference report on hr 1268
the people i represent living on the border are frustrated with the illegal immigration system and we must address gaps in border security now
i am pleased that my colleagues on the conference committee agreed to provide 635 million for border security to hire an additional 500 border patrol agents 50 additional criminal investigators 168 immigration enforcement agents and deportation officers and to fund 1 950 additional detention beds
the house provided no funding for the administration s 400 million solidarity initiative the solidarity initiative request of 400 million for two 200 million funds to be used by the secretary of state as she determines was to offset the costs of those countries that have dedicated troops to the global war on terror as well as economic support to other nations that have provided support
the senate provided a total of 2255 million 200 million in the solidarity fund and 255 million in the global war on terror partners fund
this will provide sufficient oversight of a substantial amount of money for the global war on terror
let me say that the funds we are providing in the foreign assistance chapter must be considered an investment in security both in the region and on american soil
again i urge my colleagues to vote yes on passage of the fiscal year 2005 emergency supplemental conference report on hr 1268
furthermore the bill raises the military death gratuity from 12 000 to 100 000 and increases subsidized life insurance benefits from 250 000 to 400 000 for families of service members who died or were killed on active duty retroactive to october 7 2001
it is long overdue that action be taken on this criminal and mass murderer and i hope all of my colleagues will vote for this amendment
mr chairman as the daughter of a veteran 25 years in the army i want to express my profound respect and appreciation for our brave men and women serving on the ground in iraq
before the war on iraq there was no connection no connection between saddam hussein and al qaeda
mr chairman it is the height of hypocrisy for members of congress to say that they support our troops and then fail to insist on the accountability of how these funds are being spent and whether or not the previous resources allocated were spent to protect our troops
i am especially proud of the extraordinary effort put forth by the committee s members and staff to report a bill that will better permit our troops to prosecute the war on terrorism and will do so with a price tag less than that requested by the president
in addition to our providing these necessary resources for our troops the committee was compelled to fully fund the army s modularity program at this time because of the urgency to address the significant challenges the army now faces in mitigating stress on the current active duty combat force
to meet this problem the army will not only create 10 additional combat brigades all of the current combat brigades will be redesigned to enhance their ability to deploy more rapidly and operate more independently on the battlefield
thus far 45 personnel with the us mission in iraq have been killed including two american citizens who were killed by a rocket attack on our diplomatic compound the day of the iraqi elections
despite the additional needs we have recommended on behalf of our troops the committee s bill is 614 million less than that requested by the president
i have already expressed my feelings about our staff on both sides of the aisle
mr chairman as i mentioned at the outset i am very proud of this measure i bring to you my first measure as chairman of the committee on appropriations
mr chairman i am happy to yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from michigan mr knollenberg xz4002250 the chairman of the subcommittee on transportation treasury and hud
mr chairman i would take a moment to suggest to the gentleman that he may not be aware of it because he does not serve on those subcommittees but there were at least six hearings in a variety of subcommittees and other meetings regarding this matter before we got organized
at this point i see none on the floor
i will make closing remarks on the general debate
having no additional speakers under general debate i would just like to close by saying that the discussion we have had thus far on this very important measure has been very healthy
mr chairman i reserve a point of order on the gentleman s amendment
mr chairman i make a point of order against the amendment because it proposes to change existing law and constitutes legislation on an appropriations bill and therefore violates clause 2 of rule xxi
mr chairman i reserve a point of order on the gentleman s amendment
that is above the purview of the committee on appropriations at least of this chairman of the committee on appropriations
mr chairman i reserve a point of order on the gentlewoman s amendment
i am absolutely certain we can at least clear the air on any remaining problems between now and then
mr chairman i reserve a point of order on the gentlewoman s amendment
mr chairman i reserve a point of order on the gentlewoman s amendment
the committee on appropriations filed a suballocation on budget totals for fiscal year 2005 on july 22 2004
it may very well be in conference on the supplemental that it is appropriate but frankly in some ways we take from peter to pay paul
we will follow through however on the questions that the gentlewoman is asking
mr chairman i insist on my point of order
mr chairman i reserve a point of order on the gentleman s amendment
madam chairman speaking further on the point of order i would simply calmly say to the gentleman that i very much agree as the entire house agrees that we must be responsive to the medical needs of our veterans especially those who are coming back at this very moment
mr chairman i ask unanimous consent that debate on this amendment and any amendments thereto be limited to 20 minutes to be equally divided and controlled by the proponent and myself the opponent
there is only one small hook and that is in order to get a contractor to bid on such a job in this territory the money has to be there in the pot
because of that mr chairman i urge a no vote on the upton amendment
mr chairman i reserve a point of order on the gentlewoman s amendment
accordingly the committee rose and the speaker pro tempore mr pearce xz4003130 having assumed the chair mr gilchrest acting chairman of the committee of the whole house on the state of the union reported that that committee having had under consideration the bill hr 1268 making emergency supplemental appropriations for the fiscal year ending september 30 2005 and for other purposes had come to no resolution thereon
mr chairman i reserve a point of order on the gentleman s amendment
mr chairman i want to say upfront to the house that it is not my intention to speak on the time i have reserved in opposition to this proposition so i am asking for a chance for an exchange here with the gentleman from wisconsin mr obey xz4003000
i have never told the gentleman from wisconsin mr obey xz4003000 this before but i will never forget as a mere member of the subcommittee on defense and a member of the intelligence committee discussing a program that was in the black that i knew about because i happened to be in the back room but a program that the department of defense was not very excited about
mr chairman i reserve a point of order on the gentleman s amendment
yesterday we had a discussion on the floor of the house relative to the gentleman s wanting to ensure there were additional funding flows for veterans
but frankly i am a bit incensed by the gentleman s suggestion yesterday that would indicate that we do not give priority on a bipartisan basis to veterans
we insisted on computerization within that hospital
mr chairman i make a point of order against the amendment because it proposes to change existing law and constitutes legislation on an appropriations bill which violates clause 2 rule xxi
while we are prepared to accept her amendment let me add to that there could be some resistance perhaps on the part of the state department
i think that is a small mistake on their part frankly if they have not
i am happy to accept it and i am happy to be her partner on behalf of small business in america
mr speaker i rise in opposition to the motion to recommit largely because i believe on both sides of the aisle the body recognizes that the reason for this supplemental is to provide as quickly as possible money flows in support of our troops
the best thing that we can do for our troops is to move this bill very quickly and send it on its way for a conference with the senate
so i rise in opposition to the motion to recommit and i urge members on both sides of the aisle to recognize that we must move forward with this supplemental
mr speaker pursuant to house resolution 258 i call up the conference report on the bill hr 1268 making emergency supplemental appropriations for the fiscal year ending september 30 2005 to establish and rapidly implement regulations for state driver s license and identification document security standards to prevent terrorists from abusing the asylum laws of the united states to unify terrorismrelated grounds for inadmissibility and removal to ensure expeditious construction of the san diego border fence and for other purposes
i am pleased to bring to the house for its consideration the conference report on hr 1268 the emergency supplemental appropriations act for defense the global war on terror and tsunami relief
the provisions on asylum border infrastructure and driver s license standards are included
mr speaker i yield 3 12 minutes to the gentleman from arizona mr kolbe xz4002260 my colleague on the committee
i thank the gentleman from pennsylvania for one of the most illuminating but also one of the longest statements i have ever heard him make on the floor
mr speaker i yield 2 minutes to the chairman of the subcommittee on homeland security the gentleman from kentucky mr rogers xz4003401
mr speaker i yield 2 minutes to the chairman of the subcommittee on science state justice and commerce and related agencies the gentleman from virginia mr wolf xz4004350
the greatest difficulty i have with the motion is that at this moment our forces are on gas fumes rather than real gasoline
the bill is designed to take every step that we possibly can on short order to secure our border
at the same time just yesterday the subcommittee on homeland security marked up their 2006 bill to move further down this same pathway
from there mr speaker let me express my deepest appreciation to members on both sides of the aisle who have worked very hard their staffs as well as the members themselves to make sure that this supplemental would arrive on time and ahead of schedule
mr speaker i very much appreciate my colleagues patience as we work quickly on this bill
mr chairman yesterday the us commission on international religious freedom a federally mandated bipartisan commission released a comprehensive report documenting the mistreatment of asylees in america
mr chairman i am pleased to have worked with the gentleman from arizona chairman kolbe to develop recommendations on the international assistance portion of the bill
however i do want to express my concern that we will be expected to fund some of these items on the fiscal year 2006 bill and as i anticipate a 302 b allocation for the foreign operations bill that may cut the 2006 request these needs will be tough to accommodate
we are now into year three of the reconstruction programs in afghanistan yet the administration continues to rely on offbudget emergency supplementals to fund ongoing reconstruction
a small transfer of 3 million to the unfpa would go a long way in making an immediate and tangible impact on the lives of women and children in indonesia sri lanka and the maldives
i am disappointed however that it has taken congress so long to respond officially on behalf of the united states but i am happy that we finally have a robust package of aid to offer affected nations
i just want to point out that regardless of the number of licenses that the terrorists held on september 11 they were all obtained because those individuals were in the country legally on student visas
right now on the committee that i serve with the esteemed chairman we are investing nobid contracts that were given to halliburton
we have millions of dollars in overcharges to the united states taxpayer we have bribery charges and we are doing all kinds of investigation on that nobid
in fact they are and have been on the ground since that tragic day helping save the lives of women children and families
many of my colleagues including the gentlewoman from new york mrs lowey xz4002460 who has worked so hard on helping women and children she traveled to the region early this year and was able to witness firsthand the horror along with the gentleman from new york mr crowley xz4000870 and the gentlewoman from california ms linda t snchez and others and they were able to see the work unfpa has been doing to help these people
in fact they are and have been on the ground since that tragic day helping save the lives of women and children
because the substitute language was not adopted by congress through regular legislative proceedings in the senate committee on small business and entrepreneurship and the house committee on small business but was adopted anew during the housesenate conference the in subsections 6022 a and b the language chosen to replace section 6023 in the conference report directs the department of energy and the small business administration to enter into a memorandum of understanding for reporting small business prime contracts and subcontracts at the department of energy
this replacement language does not change the small business act s clear distinction between prime contracts and subcontracts does not amend the statutory small business prime contracting goal requirements which are binding on the department of energy and does not obviate congressional and regulatory policies against contract bundling
this requirement is for acquisition planning purposes only and shall not be construed as imposing a restriction of any kind on the ability of the department of energy to break out its large prime contracts for award to small businesses
an unmarked plane arrives in the middle of the night carrying men wearing plain clothes and black hoods to take custody of the prisoners cut off their clothes drug them on the spot shackle them and fly off into the night
so here is the sand on which the administration stands at the same time that we exhort the international community to isolate syria for thumbing its nose at un
here is what the state department s annual human rights report says about syria s methods of interrogation administering electrical shocks pulling out fingernails forcing objects into the rectum and the list goes on
and the list goes on
i would also note that in a september 2004 report to the united nations general assembly the un special rapporteur on torture expressed concern that reliance on diplomatic assurances is a practice that is increasingly undermining the principle of nonrefoulement and observed that where torture is systematic the principal of nonrefoulement must be strictly observed and diplomatic assurances should not be resorted to we take pride that even as our nation fought for its survival against the nazis and the japanese empire during world war ii that we did not ask our greatest generation to engage in torture or other war crimes
the legacy of the us then and now as we prosecute the war on terror is that we uphold our commitment to justice even in the face of shadows of terror and war
it increases the military death gratuity to 100 000 and increases life insurance benefits to 400 000 for families of soldiers killed while on active duty in iraq and afghanistan
on a rare occasion the defense secretary admits there is an issue quoting secretary rumsfeld according to some estimates we dod can not track 23 trillion in transactions the pentagon s own auditors admit that the military can not account for as much as 14 of what it spends
there are serious and legitimate concerns with this bill but the chairman of the committee on the judiciary did not hold a single hearing or markup in the 109th congress
in fact the bill bypassed the committee on the judiciary completely
later today the committee on rules will meet again on hr 418 to decide whether the amendment process will be open or closed
i can not believe that the united states government would be that cruel and we would turn our backs on people who need asylum in order to truly be free from torture and persecution
as i said there are other amendments that were offered last night in the committee on rules by both democrats and republicans a total of 14
we can do better and i would appeal to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to urge their leadership to stop trashing the rules procedures and traditions of this house
no matter what our views are on this bill no matter what a person s political party or ideology is all of us i hope can agree that the current process undercuts democracy and diminishes this great house of representatives
that is why congress worked on a bipartisan basis to implement the recommendations of the 911 commission
we are following the people who have focused on this the most the 911 commission and what they are asking for is for us to review and make sure we have good asylum laws in place
why does the administration continue to resort to supplemental funding to pay for this war instead of including the cost in the budget where it will sufficiently reflect the impact of operations iraqi freedom and enduring freedom on our deficit
this 81 billion emergency supplemental funding request for the department of defense s iraq and afghanistan operations comes on the heels of 25 billion of emergency spending already appropriated for this year
i oppose simply because we can not allow continued deception by the administration on every aspect of our engagement with iraq
we were deceived with exaggeration of hussein s weapons capabilities and now we are being deceived about the duration of the engagement and its exact cost on the american purse and the loss of our men and women in uniform
any attempt to usurp that balance of power is a betrayal of the moral fiber of our government and must be taken as an attack on the integrity of this body
in fact the inspector general suggests that thousands of ghost employees were on an unidentified ministry payroll
i could go on and on about the disastrous miscalculations and misleading estimates
mr chairman as one of the conferees on the intelligence reform law enacted last december i want to remind members that it contained 43 sections and 100 pages of immigrationrelated provisions
the bill would repeal the tough minimum standards for driver s licenses called for by the 911 commission and included in the intelligence reform law with provisions that federalize all driver s licenses take away states rights place huge unfunded mandates on the states without advancing the paramount objective of making stateissued identity documents more secure and verifiable
all but one of the hijackers used a stateissued driver s license on that horrific day
even more frightening is the fact that a regular driver s license is your passport to obtain a commercial driver s license from which then of course you can then try to obtain a hazardous materials license an endorsement on your commercial driver s license
our message on this issue is clear if you are not in this country legally then you will not be given legal sanctions on our roads
if you are in america on a visa you will be issued a driver s license but it will expire on the same day as your visa
muhammed atta as has been said came to america on a 6month visa but he was issued a 6year florida driver s license
the treatment that they receive from the moment they are attended to on the battlefield taken to battlefield hospitals transported to germany and stabilized and brought home to the united states for specialized care and rehabilitation is a tribute to our magnificent military and veterans medical system
those who continue to attack our troops and the iraq people have been described in many different ways as the war has dragged on
what happened instead was that we made 300 000 people homeless by flattening their city with little or no impact on the resistance
so today nearly 3 years after 911 we still have no comprehensive policy to support the war on terror declared by the president
if they did they would be honest with the american people about the real cost of war and the lack of progress being made on the ground about the plan for drawing down our troops and about the real reason american soldiers were sent to iraq in the first place
to say that we must remain in the current configuration in iraq because the situation will get worse is to ignore the facts on the ground facts that have been acknowledged by many of our field commanders by members of congress who have visited iraq and by members of the news media covering the war
in addition to the cost of life and quality of life for the brave american men and women who are fighting in iraq the dollar cost of the war is also taking its toll on the american people
in fact today s 82 billion supplemental is the fifth such supplemental congress has passed at the request of the bush administration to fund the war on terror
that s billions of dollars not spent on pressing problems right here at home
this year s deficit is on track to reach a record 427 billion
instead of just signing another multibillion dollar check to the administration is nt it time to develop a real plan to stabilize iraq so we can bring american troops home and concentrate on our problems here at home
mr speaker on february 17 2004 the national debt of the united states exceeded 7 trillion for the first time in our country s history
our current fiscal irresponsibility will eventually land squarely on the shoulders of our children and grandchildren who will be forced to pay back the debt we are accumulating today
the debt tax that we are imposing on our children and grandchildren can not be repealed
we are witnessing on a daily basis the reaction of the global financial markets to our fiscal irresponsibility and as we can see in this conference report congress has not yet gotten the message that deficits and debt matter
budget enforcement rules that apply to only certain parts of the budget will not have a significant impact on our rising deficits as federal reserve chairman alan greenspan mentioned in his recent testimony before the budget committee
this fiscal year alone interest on the national debt is expected to rise to 178 billion and the administration projects that that figure will increase to 211 billion during the next fiscal year
to put that figure in perspective projected interest on our national debt next year will be 75 billion more than projected spending on education public health health research and veterans benefits combined 138 billion
in addition to assuming an everlarger share of our annual budgets the interest on our debt and the debt itself are increasing our reliance on foreign borrowers which will weaken our position in the world and increase the risk that another nation will be able to assert greater leverage over america
mr chairman this amendment is based upon two facts that i think we agree on on both sides of the aisle
on balance it is a good bill and i support it
and it should have been on our desk before this bill was up so that if there was something that needed to be rectified we could rectify it
and i think we ought to get rid of this amendment and get on with the rest of the business on the floor
we found problems so severe that many of the units that were on their way to iraq were c4
the subcommittee i serve on we realize and we have said for a long time they are going to have a recruiting problem as this war gets unpopular and we were trying to figure out how do we overcome that
if we do not start getting some discipline in this body in what we are doing we are never going to get back to where we all want to be and that is what we did in 1997 was start to balance the budget and we were well on the way
asylum law is supposed to be about protecting individuals including women and children from serious human rights abuses it is not supposed to be about seizing on any possible basis to deny a claim or return people to persecution
this provision at least and i am gratified that the committee on rules made the amendment to be in order by me and the gentleman from florida mr meek xz4002700 and the gentlewoman from texas ms jacksonlee xz4001990 to strike this section of the bill and in order for it to be passed tomorrow so that the committee on the judiciary can properly vet this bill or the asylum provisions can be properly looked at and we can deal with it adequately
one other thing i got up on this floor and i said this is going to become boiler plate language in bills and here it is
because current law already places the burden of proof on the asylum applicant and places the applicant in custody until he or she meets the initial burden of proof a terrorist who wishes to enter the united states would most likely attempt to do so by a tourist visa or on fraudulent papers
this section would deny a victim asylum based on an immaterial inconsistency or inaccuracy in a prior statement
it is not supposed to be about seizing on any possible basis to deny a claim or to return people to harm s way
mr chairman i am the last remaining speaker on my side
we did that for instance on the theory that if you are a member of the reserve you are called up to go to iraq but you are killed in a training accident before you can get there that you are just as dead your family is just as much in need as would be the case with someone who went to iraq and then died in an accident
now the gentleman is the chairman of the committee on veterans affairs
dick bolling who was my mentor when i came here and chaired the committee on rules used to talk disdainfully of people who looked at this house through the prism of what he called dung hill politics in other words focusing on jurisdiction of different committees forgetting that we have a larger responsibility to the body as a whole and to the country as a whole
now i make no apology for the fact that the committee on appropriations might have stepped on a few toes in expanding benefits for deserving servicemen and women
but the fact is if the gentleman has objections to what the administration has suggested then i would suggest the majority party needs to get its act together rather than risking these expanded benefits by doing what they almost did in the committee on rules today which is to make these two sections of the bill subject to a point of order which could have lost those benefits for deserving servicemen and women
when i first drafted my first proposal we were told that the committee on veterans affairs itself was concerned that we might have gone too far in providing benefits to people because for instance the example used to me was we do not want to pay someone who was killed in a drunken driving accident because he had five martinis at a bar
i made clear yesterday that based on conversations with andy card the president s staff director i have agreed to withdraw this amendment pending the administration s getting together with the leadership of the committee on appropriations and working out a process by which activities of the department of defense that are classified will in fact be communicated to the congress
if the congress takes seriously its obligation to exercise the power of the purse which is one of only two real powers that we have outside of actual legislating and if the congress feels we have an obligation to this institution that transcends our obligation to the committees on which we serve then the congress will see to it that the executive branch understands that we are not trying to dictate what they do we are simply trying to see to it that what they do is consistent with american values and will not get the country in trouble in the first place
mr chairman i want to make clear that i assume good faith on the part of the white house and i hope we can work things out
after all that country harbored the people who attacked us on 911
we have spent some 240 billion on this entire endeavor since the president first landed in his jumpsuit on that carrier and addressed the country under the banner mission accomplished there has been quite a bit of that mission left since it supposedly was over
it has been brought to us by the same people who thought they were so smart that they knew more than general shinseki when the good general warned us that we would need substantially more troops and boots on the ground than we were scheduled to have if the postwar occupation was to go well
i believe that the entire operation in iraq has been accompanied by incredibly naive romanticism on the part of the white house and on the part of the civilian leadership in the pentagon and that has left the people fighting the war to bear the brunt of the miscalculations that have been made by the civilian leadership of our government
the second thing this bill does is to demonstrate once again how we on both sides of the aisle have had to work doubly hard to overcome the resistance of the white house in adequately funding homeland security operations
and it has taken a bipartisan effort on the part of a wide variety of people in this congress in order to overcome that resistance
the new bill that is going to be offered by the gentleman from kentucky will help fill that gap but that is forced to play catchup because we have met a steady resistance effort on the part of the white house
lastly i simply want to say that while i am certainly no expert on the subject i note that there is being attached to this bill a provision which many experts in the field feel has the potential to construct a nationwide database that could be very harmful in terms of people s efforts to engage in identity theft
i would simply make the point that certainly no one on our committee on either side of the aisle has the expertise that you would hope would be found in the authorization committees and i wish that that provision had been dealt with on a separate bill rather than solving an internal problem within the republican caucus by having it attached to an unrelated bill and i want to make one point about that
i want to serve notice that if the majority feels free to add unrelated authorization bills such as this to a mustpass bill that then i feel fully within my rights in offering whatever authorization legislation we feel appropriate on this side of the aisle and asking that it be attached to appropriation bills
i would note that on march 30 the administration announced it would add more than 500 agents in arizona but those are not new agents
mr speaker i object to the vote on the ground that a quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not present
mr chairman let me thank the gentleman from arizona mr kolbe xz4002260 my good friend for introducing this amendment but i would like to touch on another area that is also very very important
we have another serious problem that i hope that we can touch on and that is what is known as the otms or other than mexicans
after the 2 12 hours they go and take them to the bus station and they give them a little piece of paper that says you are supposed to appear on the 15th of whatever month 60 to 90 days from now
mr speaker i rise in support of the wartime supplemental that includes urgent funding for our soldiers and sailors now prosecuting the global war on terror in afghanistan and iraq
yet that truth does not mean that the congress should skimp on our financial obligations to our fighting men and women
i have been relentless in talking to so many of you about my concerns related to spending on border security matters
so we are releasing on their own recognizance into the population of the united states very large numbers of otms what happens is our border patrol agents routinely call detention facilities and discover there is no room to hold otms so they process these immigrants many times without even getting fingerprints or running them through our national databases to see if they are on watch lists and release them into the general population with a notice to appear at a deportation hearing a few weeks later
mr speaker as the ranking democrat of the committee on house administration i wish to comment briefly on key provisions of this supplemental appropriations bill that touch upon my committee s jurisdiction
finally i wish to comment on something the conferees did not include in this bill namely any funding for up to 132 additional capitol police officers during fiscal 2005
i am pleased that under these circumstances the conferees chose to defer a decision about the need i thank our friends on the appropriations committee for their difficult and prudent decisions on the legislativebranch portion of this bill
i look forward to working with them and with our colleagues on my own committee as the work of the legislative branch forges ahead
the extremists can be isolated and paralyzed if we build on this goodwill and desire for freedom among the iraqi people
to build on this foundation we must offer the iraqi people justice
i would like to close with a quotation which i hope all of my colleagues will allow to settle on their minds for a few minutes voice or no voice the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders
i urge a no vote on this entire appropriation bill which is mostly for the continuation of the war in iraq
as a matter of fact i think it might be worse than just carrying our papers and showing our papers because in this bill there are no limitations as to the information that may be placed on this identification card
so if they would like to put on our driver s license that you belong to a progun group it may well become mandatory because there may be an administration some day that might like to have that information
that technology is already available and being used on our passports
there is no limitation as to what they can put on these documents
the real id act establishes a national id card by mandating that states include certain minimum identification standards on driver s licenses
it contains no limits on the government s power to impose additional standards
republican party talking points on this bill which claim that this is not a national id card nevertheless endorse the idea that the federal government should set standards for the issuance of birth certificates and sources of identification such as driver s licenses so they admit that they want a national id but at the same time pretend that this is not a national id
what is even more disturbing is that by mandating that states participate in the drivers license agreement this bill creates a massive database of sensitive information on american citizens that will be shared with canada and mexico
this bill could have a chilling effect on the exercise of our constitutionally guaranteed rights
there are no prohibitions against including such information in the database as information about a person s exercise of first amendment rights or about a person s appearance on a registry of firearms owners
this legislation gives authority to the secretary of homeland security to expand required information on driver s licenses potentially including such biometric information as retina scans fingerprints dna information and even radio frequency identification rfid radio tracking technology
there are no limits on what happens to the database of sensitive information on americans once it leaves the united states for canada and mexico or perhaps other countries
i urge my colleagues to vote no on the real id act of 2005
if we pass this illconceived legislation we will spend 656 million for tsunami relief 94 million for darfur sudan 150 million for food aid most to liberia and sudan 580 million for peacekeeping overseas 582 million to build a new american embassy in iraq 76 million to build a new airport in kuwait one of the wealthiest countries on earth 257 million for counter drug efforts in afghanistan 372 million for health reconstruction and alternative development programs to help farmers stop raising poppy 200 million in economic aid for the palestinians 150 million for pakistan run by an unelected dictator 200 million for jordan 34 million for ukraine
sadly the stories of abuse on contracts in iraq are everywhere nearly 9 billion spent on iraq reconstruction is unaccounted for because of inefficiencies and bad management
for taxpayers every dollar that is wasted on corruption and that is what this is profiteering on the war is corruption and incompetence is one less dollar to pay down record deficits or to make social security solvent
i urge my colleagues to support this amendment and in doing so to support accountability in government spending and to stop the profiteering on the war in iraq
at the time the war was rationalized on intelligence estimates of iraqi weapons of mass destruction capabilities that were wrong and on suggestions that iraq was somehow connected with the september 11 alqaeda attacks on our country that were never true
and this 75 billion will be on top of the more than 200 billion previously appropriated mostly by the supplemental appropriations process for these military operations
mr speaker i thank the gentleman from wisconsin mr obey xz4003000 our distinguished ranking member the lead democrat on the committee on appropriations for his leadership for his very important motion to recommit
mr speaker before i get into talking about the bill i want to commend both the distinguished chairman of the committee on appropriations the gentleman from california mr lewis xz4002391 and our distinguished ranking members on the committee on appropriations and subcommittee on defense
two years ago this week on may 1 2003 president bush stood on an aircraft carrier under a banner that proclaimed mission accomplished considering the events that followed and what has been disclosed since then if the president were to stand under a banner today it would have to read credibility demolished we are in the war s third year
whatever our disagreement about the policy which brought us into the war whatever our disagreement on the lack of planning to end it it never diminishes the regard that we have for our men and women in uniform
and on any opportunity that many of us have we express that to them personally
although appropriations for iraq approaches 200 billion the president s budget requests no money for the war on the grounds that the cost is unknowable
here we are today on thursday talking about a supplemental with a set amount in it of emergency funding for our troops and we passed the budget last thursday
the risk assessment released by the joint chiefs of staff this week shows the strain on our military is real and unsustainable
we must focus on quality rather than quantity when training iraqi security forces accelerate iraq s reconstruction in ways that give iraqis a major stake in rebuilding their country and step up regional diplomatic efforts to heal the strife on which the insurgency thrives
were conferees able to focus solely on these issues their final product would have been much stronger
these provisions will make asylum harder to obtain for those seeking a haven from persecution and place a huge unfunded responsibility on the states to verify information used to support a driver s license application
bipartisan efforts in the senate do more for border security in this bill and were rebuffed by house republicans in favor of provisions that trample on the rights of individuals and states and may result in the diminishment of the safety of the american people
the gentleman from wisconsin mr obey xz4003000 has been a champion on this issue year in and year out as far as this discussion has been going
i was on the capitol grounds and my family during the school year lives in the washington dc area and like millions of other families in new york and washington dc was imperiled
as the 911 commission report stated for terrorists travel documents are as important as weapons on page 390 of the report they point out that all but one of the 911 hijackers acquired some form of us identification by fraud and that acquisition of these forms of identification assisted them in boarding commercial flights by bringing this legislation today the gentleman from wisconsin mr sensenbrenner xz4003650 is making my family safer in this post911 america and also closing asylum loopholes strengthening our deportation laws
mr chairman during the debate of the real id act of 2005 of which i am a cosponsor i was unavoidably detained and unfortunately missed the opportunity to vote on the amendment offered by representative jerrold nadler
in summary as a cosponsor of this bill i believe that all of the provisions in the real id act are essential in protecting our citizens from future terrorist plots and i would have voted no on the nadler amendment
madam chairman i wish to extend my gratitude on behalf of the entire florida delegation to the gentleman from california mr lewis xz4002391 and the gentleman from kentucky mr mike rogers for entering into this colloquy with us regarding a very crucial issue to florida as well as this congress
i commend the relief efforts on the ground in the immediate aftermath of the hurricane as well as the willingness of congress to step forward and offer meaningful relief to hurricane victims
since coming to congress i have heard a lot about how we need to crack down on illegal immigration in this country but have seen very little action when it comes to providing adequate funding for the kinds of programs that i know work in dealing with the problem of illegal immigration
for instance just this week with the release of the president s budget as my colleague mentioned last august we were tough on the issue of immigration by saying we wanted 10 000 new border patrol agents and we wanted to create 40 000 new detention beds
they are silent on the issue of detention
i am sick and tired of hearing arguments on who is going to do what
let us have a real and earnest debate on what needs to be done to protect this country
mr speaker this motion to recommit provides for restrictions on the information contained in the national database
this bill as it stands requires that the database shall contain at a minimum all information contained on the driver s licenses as well as driving history
in particular this amendment guarantees that the database can not become a centralized storage place for sensitive personal information on nearly every american about whether they own guns what guns they own and whether they have purchased any guns
this motion to recommit would also bar information on the exercise of first amendment and fourteenth amendment rights from being included in the driver s license database
moreover hr 418 places privacy limitations on the use of centralized data
by forcing state governments to maintain and share files on almost every adult in the nation this bill will truly usher in the era of big brother
the database could be used to track americans movements store information on political activities and even store information on gun ownership
as a member representing a district on the united statesmexico border and as the only member of congress with a background in immigration and experience in actually defending our nation s borders i have firsthand knowledge of the kinds of resources that we need to keep america safe
since coming to congress i have heard a lot about how we need to crack down on illegal immigration in this country but have seen very little action when it comes to providing adequate funding for the programs that we know will work in dealing with this problem
meanwhile every day foreign nationals from over 150 different countries who are here in the united states illegally are being apprehended and turned back on to our streets because we lack the space to detain them
the time has long since come to make good on our border security promises or to continue to risk the safety of the american people
this increase is required in order to maintain existing service levels within the va health care system and would bring spending in line with the recommendations of the bipartisan leadership of the committee on veterans affairs
instead it will weaken law enforcement s ability to do its job and make driving on our roads more dangerous
mr chairman while there are many good reasons to oppose this bill as i previously outlined i will focus on the driver s license provision and the asylum provision
it will only make us less safe by having unlicensed and uninsured drivers on our roads
denying licenses to undocumented immigrants will also hurt our national security by depriving law enforcement officials of critical information on millions of adults who are in the united states
i urge my colleagues to oppose this bill and instead focus on implementing the counterterrorism provisions enacted into law just a few months ago
the bill also includes important provisions to increase the military death gratuity from 12 000 to 100 000 and to provide subsidized life insurance benefits from 250 000 to 400 000 for families of soldiers who die or are killed on active duty and we make these important provisions retroactive to the beginning of military operations on october 7 2001
while there has been some improvement i am troubled that the department of defense has not submitted the required biannual report on the military operations of the armed forces and on the reconstruction activities administered by dod in iraq and afghanistan
i know that chairman jerry lewis defense appropriations chairman bill young and ranking members david obey and john murtha as well as my colleagues on the full committee have expressed similar concerns about dod s lack of responsiveness
protecting our troops who are sacrificing so much on our behalf and providing for their families will always be my first priority and that is why i am supporting this bill today
the bill also includes important provisions to increase the military death gratuity and to provide subsidized life insurance benefits for families of soldiers who die or are killed on active duty
in particular the bill includes an assault against the matricula consular cards issued by mexican and other latin american consulates and consequently makes it an assault on our immigrant families who rely upon this form of identification in their daily lives for transactions involving banking housing education and even proving when necessary that they are the parents of their own children
mr speaker this is just one more example of abuse of power by a republican leadership that continues to act irresponsibly on issues of importance to our american society
protecting our troops who are sacrificing so much on our behalf and providing for their families will always be one of my highest priorities and that is why once again i will support this necessary and important conference report today
hr 418 cracks down on asylum fraud by ensuring all terrorismrelated grounds of inadmissibility are grounds for deportation
the circuit has held that if a foreign government harasses an alien because he has been affiliated with a terrorist group the alien is eligible for asylum because he could be persecuted on account of the political opinion of that terrorist group
mr chairman as chairman of the subcommittee on international terrorism and nonproliferation i have to ask who should be in charge of counterterrorism policy
now environmental groups have successfully fought the completion of this fence over the years claiming that it would have a serious impact on everything from the san diego fairy shrimp to the san diego button celery all that in this 35 mile strip of desert along the border
does anyone think we can secure the border and save the button celery by putting up a fence to stop people from trampling on it
it seeks to prevent another terrorist attack on us soil by disrupting terrorist travel
and this legislation uses existing states driver s license systems to ensure we know who is in our country that people are who they say they are and that the name on a driver s license is the holder s real name not an alias
mr chairman on september 11 we were attacked by terrorists who took advantage of weaknesses in our border security
the administration s budget also breaks the promise of putting an additional 2 000 border patrol agents on the job in 2006 as promised in landmark intelligence reforms passed last year and endorsed by the 911 commission
if the real id act is passed today it will deny driver s licenses to those immigrants and slam the door shut on refugees seeking asylum from bloodthirsty regimes
americans deserve better and i urge my colleagues to vote no on hr 418
i like some of my colleagues before me had a chance to travel there and see what the unfpa is doing there and i urge my colleagues to vote yes on the snchezcrowley amendment
i urge you to vote yes on the maloneysnchezcrowley amendment to help the victims of the tsunami
the real id act of 2005 would deny drivers licenses to immigrants and slam the doors on refugees seeking asylum from persecution
this is an unprecedented move on the part of the republican leadership and this concerns me
what hr 418 will do is undermine several key security features that were dealt with responsibly in the intelligence reform legislation which was based on the 911 commission recommendations
mr speaker on rollcall no
much has been and will be said about this bill s impact on making it more difficult for terrorists to get identification to conduct their terrorist activities and the reform of the asylum laws and the plugging of the fence south of san diego
some of the interpreters helped the clients cheat on the tests
now because wisconsin does not require proof of legal residency in the united states in order to get a driver s license whether it is a regular license or a commercial driver s license mr nazov got a license validly issued by the wisconsin department of motor vehicles and 3 days later killed a family of four on a highway in tennessee with a truck he did not know how to drive
mr speaker i submit for the record the story from the milwaukee journal sentinel entitled tennessee deaths bring new charge tennessee deaths bring new charge trucker illegally obtained license here a man who got a commercial truck driver s license illegally in wisconsin killed a family of four on a tennessee freeway then lied about his actions according to a criminal compliant unsealed tuesday in federal court in chicago
the investigation also revealed that in wisconsin at least 600 people from other states cheated on written exams bribed officials administering road tests or lied about their residency to get truck driver s licenses according to court records
he also is wanted in tennessee on reckless homicide charges said randall sanborn spokesman for the us attorney s office in chicago
nazov who has never lived in wisconsin received a wisconsin commercial driver s license on march 4 2003 according to court records
three days later he caused a fatal wreck on i81 near baileyton tenn according to media reports
both probes center on foreign nationals
some of the interpreters helped the clients cheat on the tests
nazov listed an address in the 4200 block of w loomis road in greenfield on his driver s license application according to the charging documents
unfortunately the legislation that was enacted failed to include several key provisions critical to addressing vulnerabilities found in both the 911 commission report and of the 911 staff report on terrorist travel
to that end on january 26th of this year i introduced hr 418 the real id act
the 911 commission terrorist travel report stated that abuse of the immigration system and the lack of interior enforcement were unwittingly working together to support terrorist activities the report further states that members of al qaeda clearly valued freedom of movement as critical to their ability to plan and carry out the attacks prior to september 11th finally the report observed if terrorist travel options are reduced they may be forced to rely on means of interaction which can be more easily monitored and to resort to travel documents that are more easily detectable the real id act contains four provisions aimed at disrupting terrorist travel
american citizens have the right to know who is in their country that the people are who they say they are and that the name on the driver s license is the real holder s name not some alias
the 911 commission staff report on terrorist travel states that once the terrorists had entered the united states their next challenge was to find a way to remain here their primary method was immigration fraud
we will end judgeimposed presumptions that benefit suspected terrorists in order to stop providing a safe haven to some of the worst people on earth
if criminal juries can sentence a defendant to life imprisonment or execution based on adverse credibility determinations certainly an immigration judge can deny an alien asylum on this basis
it is one of the foundations of our system of jurisprudence that juries and trial judges should be able to decide cases on the basis of credibility or lack of credibility of witnesses
this bill will again allow immigration judges to deny asylum claims based on the lack of credibility
the circuit has actually held that an alien can receive asylum on the basis that his or her government believes that the alien is a terrorist
house of representatives committee on the judiciary washington dc february 9 2005
dear chairman barton thank you for your letter dated february 8 2005 regarding hr 418 the real id act as you noted some of the provisions of the bill contained in section 102 fall within the rule x jurisdiction of the committee on energy and commerce
i appreciate your willingness to forgo consideration of the bill and i acknowledge that by agreeing to waive its consideration of the bill the committee on energy and commerce does not waive its jurisdiction over these provisions
pursuant to your request i will include a copy of your letter and this response in the congressional record during consideration of hr 418 on the house floor
james sensenbrenner jr house of representatives committee on energy and commerce washington dc february 8 2005
this legislation contains provisions that fall within the jurisdiction of the committee on energy and commerce
as you know rule x of the rules of the house of representatives gives the committee on energy and commerce jurisdiction over these statutes
in addition the energy and commerce committee reserves its right to seek conferees on any provisions of the bill that are within its jurisdiction during any housesenate conference that may be convened on this or similar legislation
i ask for your commitment to support any request by the energy and commerce committee for conferees on hr 418 or similar legislation
mr chairman i yield 1 minute to the gentleman from ohio mr chabot xz4000710 the chairman of the subcommittee on the constitution
mr chairman i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from indiana mr hostettler xz4001870 the distinguished chairman of the subcommittee on immigration
mr chairman several speakers on the other side said that if this bill was law at the time of 911 it would not have made any difference on what id the terrorists used to get on the planes
what the bill say is that anyone who is admitted to this country on a temporary visa will have their driver s license expire as to the date of their visa
now mohammed atta who is the ring leader of 911 murderers entered the united states on a 6month visa
that visa expired on july 9 2001
he got a driver s license from the state of florida on may 5 2001
had this bill been in effect at the time that driver s license would have expired on july 9 and he would not have been able to use that driver s license to get on a plane because it was an expired id
first of all it says the burden of proof is on the applicant for asylum to prove that they qualify
the burden of proof is on anybody who is the plaintiff or an applicant in any type of proceeding
the burden of proof is on the applicant to establish that the applicant is a refugee within the meaning of the law
now the trier of the fact whether it is a judge or a jury in any other legal proceeding bases determinations on the credibility of the witnesses as to what verdict is reached
one such modification will be to remove the annual cap on the number of aliens granted asylum who can become permanent residents each year
regrettably at the request of the committee on government reform the manager s amendment also removes two provisions that i believe address important issues with regard to temporary licenses
i understand why the chairman of the committee on government reform believes these two provisions should not be included at this time however it is my hope that as this legislation continues to move through the legislative process we may revisit these two provisions
it is not to be used as a crutch for economic migrants who are coming to the united states because the grass is greener on our side of the border
every trier of fact in court makes the determination based on the credibility of witnesses
criminal juries can send someone to their death or to prison for life based on their determination of the credibility of the witnesses and immigration judges should do so also
furthermore the ninth circuit has held that an alien can receive asylum on the very basis that the alien s government believes he is a terrorist even if we agree
and if any jury in the country can convict a defendant based on its determinations of credibility certainly an immigration judge should be able to do the same thing
mr chairman i yield 2 12 minutes to the gentleman from indiana mr hostettler xz4001870 the chairman of the subcommittee on immigration border security and claims of the committee on the judiciary
now that means that all of the jewish people who were turned away on the st
now simply what is stated is that the burden of proof is on the applicant just like it ought to be like it is on our constituents who apply for social security disability
on the day they visited the imperial beach station at the border patrol they asked to see a demonstration of the afis fingerprint system used to identify criminal aliens among those caught across the border
mr chairman i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from california mr hunter xz4001910 the chairman of the committee on armed services and one of the biggest supporters of governor schwarzenegger
mr chairman i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from california mr dreier xz4001150 a close adviser of governor schwarzenegger and the chairman of the committee on rules
it has been very clear from the beginning of the debate on this legislation
what the bill does is it says that a driver s license has to meet certain standards if it is to be acceptable for federal id purposes such as getting on an airplane
what the motion to recommit does is force the states to do something or not do something and that goes directly against the notion of federalism that is contained in this bill and which was drafted by the committee on government reform
the first vote that we had yesterday on this legislation was on whether we should waive the law relative to unfunded mandates
the vote on that was 228 aye to 191 no the author of this motion to recommit as well as the 190 who joined him in saying that we should not waive the unfunded mandate law is now asking the states to have another unfunded mandate
i would urge all of the 191 who voted no on the jacksonlee objection to consideration of the rule to bring this up to join me in voting no on this motion to recommit together with the 228 who voted the right way yesterday
vote no on the motion to recommit vote aye on passage
mr speaker on that i demand the yeas and nays
mr speaker i thank him for his hard work on this conference report
the legislation will also prevent the ability of potentially dangerous aliens to show up under false pretenses on our shores and be granted safe haven while simultaneously protecting those who are legitimately fleeing persecution
mr speaker by direction of the committee on rules i call up house resolution 71 and ask for its immediate consideration
cbo estimates that those mandates would impose incremental costs on state local and some tribal governments above what they will likely spend under current law
requirements for driver s licenses and identification cards public law 108458 created federal standards for issuing driver s licenses and identification cards and also imposed intergovernmental mandates on state local and some tribal governments
based on information from federal state and local agencies cbo assumes that the process for a negotiated rulemaking will give state and local governments the opportunity to help shape federal standards those standards are thus likely to be less costly to implement than the requirements of hr 418
based on information from state representatives cbo estimates that dhs would spend about 20 million over the fiveyear period to reimburse states for the cost of complying with the legislation subject to appropriation of the necessary amounts
based on information from the government accountability office and the american association of motor vehicle administrators cbo estimates that it would cost 80 million over three years to reimburse states for the cost to establish and maintain the database
dhs estimates that it has spent about 30 million thus far on the barrier and that it will cost an additional 32 million to complete the project
estimated impact on state local and tribal governments procedures for processing and issuing driver s licenses and identification cards under current law are in the process of changing due to federal legislation enacted in december 2004
cbo estimates that those enacted mandates will impose costs on state local and some tribal governments over the 20052009 period totaling new mandates with significant additional costs hr 418 would repeal public law 108458 and replace it with several new and more stringent intergovernmental mandates for processing and issuing driver s licenses and identification cards
based on information from federal agency and state representatives cbo estimates that those mandates would impose incremental costs on state local and some tribal governments above what they will likely spend under current law
public law 108458 created federal standards for issuing driver s licenses and identification cards and also imposed intergovernmental mandates on state local and some tribal governments
based on information from state and local government representatives cbo assumes that the process for a negotiated rulemaking will give state and local governments the opportunity to help shape federal standards those standards are thus likely to be less costly to implement than the requirements of this bill
cbo expects however that these requirements would probably not impose significant additional costs on state local or tribal governments
other impacts on state and local governments in addition to the other requirements of the bill states would be required to participate in the driver license agreement an interstate compact to share driver information
estimated impact on the private sector this bill contains no new privatesector mandates as defined in umra
estimate prepared by federal costs mark grabowicz impact on state local and tribal governments melissa merrell and impact on the private sector paige piperbach
however the threshold that was established at that time now as a result of inflation several years later we are aware of and that is why we have made sure to ask the question about what we are imposing on states for this very important issue that is within the jurisdiction of these states but as a result of the needs of this great nation to address driver s license inconsistencies and the integrity behind those
and the committee on rules in a meeting that we had yesterday where we considered this legislation had to understand the implications or some of the implications as it related to this act and we rely upon the current information that has come from the congressional budget office
so i am very disappointed that my colleague has chosen to think that we have placed pressure upon this professional organization that we have fudged the numbers and i would say to the gentlewoman from texas that that i believe is not only an unfair accusation to this member but more specifically to the congressional budget office which i believe is a professional organization delivers a product that they put their name on and makes available to all who might read it
this general debate rule provides for 1 hour and 40 minutes of general debate with 40 minutes equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the committee on the judiciary 40 minutes equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the committee on government reform and 20 minutes equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the committee on homeland security
mr speaker we are here today to begin the debate on fulfilling congress s promise to the american people made in the wake of the tragedy of september 11 2001 that our government will do everything it can to protect them from another deadly attack on our homeland
and this promise will continue again today through the consideration of the real id act of 2005 which has been authored by my good friend the chairman of the committee on the judiciary the gentleman from wisconsin mr sensenbrenner xz4003650
the narrowly constructed legislation by the gentleman from wisconsin mr sensenbrenner xz4003650 accomplishes this goal by focusing on four commonsense areas implementing muchneeded driver s license reform closing the asylum loopholes defending our borders and strengthening our deportation laws
this will prevent abuses to the system like the case of the blind sheik abdul rahman who was able to stay in the united states and force an immigration judge to hold a hearing on the asylum claim only weeks before his followers bombed the world trade center
mr speaker this rule is intended to allow debate to begin on this important legislation and to give members an opportunity to come to the floor and to voice their support or concerns about its contents as the committee on rules finalizes an appropriate rule for consideration of possible amendments
i encourage all of my colleagues to improve america s national security by supporting this rule to begin the debate on this legislation
mr speaker i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from wisconsin mr sensenbrenner xz4003650 chairman of the committee on the judiciary
mr speaker i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from georgia mr gingrey xz4001510 one of the bright new members of the committee on rules
mr speaker i yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from california mr dreier xz4001150 the favorite son from san dimas chairman of the committee on rules
mr speaker i yield back the balance of my time and i move the previous question on the resolution
a motion to reconsider was laid on the table
mr speaker by direction of the committee on rules i call up house resolution 75 and ask for its immediate consideration
this rule provides that the amendment printed in part a of the committee on rules report accompanying the resolution shall be considered as adopted in the house and in the committee of the whole and that the bill as amended shall be considered as the original bill for the purpose of further amendment and shall be considered as read
mr speaker this rule will complete the work begun yesterday on hr 418 the real id act of 2005
hr 418 authored by the gentleman from wisconsin chairman sensenbrenner will improve security by focusing on four main areas number one implementing muchneeded driver s license reform closing asylum loopholes defending our borders and strengthening our deportation laws
this will prevent abuses of the system like in the case of the blind sheik abdul rahman who was able to stay in the united states and force an immigration judge to hold a hearing on his asylum claim only weeks before his followers bombed the world trade center in 1993
mr speaker i do understand that not everybody is in agreement about what we are doing today but for the members that are paying attention the 911 terrorist travel report of the national commission on terrorist attacks upon the united states known as the 911 commission said on page 43 and i would like to quote this september 11 as the hijackers boarded four flights american airlines flights 11 and 77 and united airlines flights 93 and 175 at least six hijackers used us identification documents obtained and acquired in the previous months three of which were fraudulently obtained in northern virginia mr speaker we would have to really not respect this 911 commission if we were not going to follow up on the work that they did
mr speaker i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from wisconsin mr sensenbrenner xz4003650 the chairman of the committee on the judiciary
mr speaker i yield back the balance of my time and i move the previous question on the resolution
mr chairman in august 2004 the bipartisan chairman of the 911 commission testified at the select committee on homeland security that border security combined with the routine and effective enforcement of immigration laws must be a top priority for congress and the administration if our country can expect to secure the homeland and prevent another tragedy like what happened on 911 from happening again here in america
the 911 commission report states on page 384 that looking back we can also see that the routine operations of our immigration laws that is aspects of the laws not specifically aimed at protecting against terrorism inevitably shaped al qaeda s planning and opportunities there is no more basic homeland security function of our legal system than deporting aliens who have been afforded due process and who have subsequently been ordered deported by a federal judge
as a result people entering the country illegally with criminal or terrorist intent have quickly learned that if arrested they can be quickly released on their own word and that they can be confident in the knowledge that they do not have to show up for their hearing knowing they will likely never be deported
the department simply needs guidance from congress on how to best use its existing bond authority to reach the goal of 100 percent repatriation of all aliens ordered deported and that is exactly what my amendment will provide
mr chairman i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from texas mr smith xz4003811 a former subcommittee chairman for the committee on the judiciary
this amendment that i have comes as a result of my paying attention to not only the 911 commission but also my service to the select committee on homeland security in the prior congress
i support this and i hope the members will vote aye on the amendment
they went on to say the federal government should set standards for the issuance of birth certificates and sources of identification such as driver s licenses
they can also use that document to access federal buildings rent a vehicle or get on a plane
we can not let our troops down who are out there on the front line
let me wish our new chairman the very best in his maiden voyage through this body on the floor
i think we can do a better job making sure our troops on the front line have everything they need if we put funding for these operations up front in the fiscal year rather than halfway through it like we are doing in a supplemental like this
many in the administration have said we can not put a timetable on the withdrawal
we can not put a timetable on it
outstanding committees like the committee on armed services on which i am privileged to serve have looked at some issues relating to contracting in iraq and afghanistan
mr chairman i rise in strong support of the nadler amendment and ask members especially on my side of the aisle to join us in striking section 101
section 101 imposes onerous new requirements on the persecuted including those who have been traumatized by rape torture trafficking and religious hate and persecution to prove the persecutor s motive
i can guarantee if this is enacted into law that real asylum seekers will be denied and then the piling on just begins to start
get one of those things wrong and the trier of facts can exclude you based on that single situation
we must continue to do so as long as unfpa insists on supporting the chinese program
today representative maloney offered an amendment to hr 1268 the emergency supplemental appropriations act for defense the global war on terror and tsunami relief and she described the amendment as something that would give 3 million to unfpa
the country could offer its experiences and special expert to help other countries on cbs nightwatch she said the unfpa firmly believes and so does the government of the people s republic of china that their program is a totally voluntary program and sven burmester unfpa s man in beijing gushed over china s achievements in strictly quantitative terms it was the most successful familyplanning policy ever developed make no mistake that china covets unfpa financial and verbal support of their program as a goodhousekeeping seal of approval to whitewash their human rights violations
on july 21 2001 secretary of state powell wrote regrettably the prc has in place a regime of severe penalties on women who have unapproved births
mr chairman this bill is the first step back on the long road to real homeland security
the sessions amendment helps correct this problem by giving the department of homeland security guidance on the use of delivery bonds
mr chairman i would simply like to submit my statement for the record on this particular issue in opposition to the real id act
hr 418 is meanspirited legislation that threatens our national security by depriving law enforcement officials of critical information on many adults who are physically present in the united states
the driver s license real id act will also impose additional requirements on states without providing funding and interfere with what is inherently a state responsibility
i do not understand how supporters of this bill can turn their backs on victims of sex trafficking in the name of protecting homeland security
i strongly urge all members to vote no on hr 418
the real id act has no place on a bill to fund support for our military families and tsunami victims
in fact i voted against hr 418 when it was considered by the us house of representatives on february 10 2005
on behalf of the oppressed people of this world who actually believed president bush when he said the us would stand with them and on behalf of americans who do nt confuse secret databases with security i will vote no on this bill
how is it supporting our troops when we continue to allow the bush administration to spend hundreds of millions of dollars at will on no bid government contracts with no oversight
for all of these reasons i m voting no on the president s 813 billion supplemental request
this is on top of an already bloated 400 billion defense budget
instead of borrowing more from our children congress ought to instead stop wasteful spending on ineffective redundant and unnecessary weapons programs
this message is lost on the bush administration
this is probably one of the most important bills that we will have to vote on in the 109th congress
these are things they have talked about and had recommended and it begins to respond to the pleas of the many families who lost loved ones on that terrible day
mr speaker i urge members of congress to carefully examine the effects that retiring the kennedy and reducing the number of carriers would not only have on our nation but the world at large
after reviewing information from the center on philanthropy at indiana university detailing the level of private american contributions to the tsunami relief i am not sure we need to spend extra taxpayer dollars for that purpose
one of these companies as a matter of fact a company called ch2m hill was one of the first on the scene to provide critical services to victims ever since
the bill focuses on people already in the united states instead of keeping terrorists out
homeland security expert stephen flynn who is a retired commander of the us coast guard and jeane kirkpatrick senior fellow in national security studies at the council on foreign relations testified before the senate foreign relations committee that great powers have been building great walls throughout history
people will not be watching it on tv
we are turning over the department of homeland security s enforcement responsibility to bounty hunters people who have no training whatsoever who absolutely can and possibly will infringe on civil rights of the people of this country
mr chairman according to the congressional research service the 819 billion that is before us today in the supplemental appropriations bill is in addition to the approximately 200 billion that has been spent so far since the 9112001 attacks on combat operations on the occupation and on the support of military personnel deployed or supporting operations in iraq and afghanistan
the report raises the possibility of socalled ghost employees citing 8 206 guards identified as on the payroll at one ministry although only 602 could be verified
the study found that 42 cases were worth 13 million where there were no contracts on file and for 142 cases totaling 40 million where there was no proof that the work was even done
the truman committee was unanimously respected for its focus on factfinding and its refusal to succumb to partisanship and in fact the gentleman from iowa mr leach xz4002360 and i share that view
i think the gentleman from iowa mr leach xz4002360 should be commended for his leadership on this and for pointing out the fact that in fact when harry truman did it years ago he was a democrat and the president was a democrat and he still found it the patriotic and judicious thing to do with respect to the responsibilities of the house of representatives and if we are to maintain the integrity of this congress and our responsibility of oversight of such huge sums of money it would be the appropriate thing for us to do now in a bipartisan way
the gentleman from connecticut mr shays xz4003700 and the committee on government reform has tried but the full committee on government reform has only met four times on related hearings
similarly the house committee on armed services has taken up this issue once in june of 2004 at a readiness subcommittee hearing but beyond that it has not delved into the issue
mr chairman i thank the gentleman for his leadership on this most important issue affecting our country
the loopholes that currently exist in issuing driver s licenses have to be closed to stop those who would use driver s licenses as a tool in committing terrorist acts on our own soil
in fact as we have heard we know that many of the hijackers who attacked our nation on september 11 possessed valid driver s licenses and many other stateissued identity cards
that lack of information is why i voted for an amendment proposed by representatives tierney and leach to create a select congressional committee based on the truman committee that existed during world war ii to investigate and study the awarding and carrying out of government contracts to conduct military and reconstruction activities in iraq and afghanistan
on balance i will vote for it because i think it would unrealistic and irresponsible to do otherwise
as a critic of the bush administration s policy in iraq i did not go there to confirm my opposition to the war but rather to gain knowledge based on facetoface conversations with our military leaders the iraqi leadership an extraordinary group of iraqi women and most important for me with our troops on the ground
several industries in colorado are heavily dependent on the h2b visa program to provide seasonal employees some in the summer and some in the winter
and the current limit on the numbers of visas has made it difficult for many of them to find the people they need
they would actually be detrimentally affected by this provision because they do not rehire the same workers every year and thus do not benefit from the provisions in the conference report that will exempt previously hired workers from the overall limit on the number of visas
i hope that we will be able to build on this foundation in the future so as to protect the interests of both summer and winter industries
its purpose is to reaffirm the authority of states and territories to regulate hunting and fishing by resolving questions that have arisen in the wake of a recent 9th circuit court of appeals decision that held that some arizona limits on nonresident hunting permits had constitutional defects
2002 the federal appeals court for the 9th circuit held that arizona s 10 cap on nonresident hunting of bull elk throughout the state and of antlered deer north of the colorado river had enough of an effect on interstate commerce that it could run afoul of what lawyers and judges call the dormant commerce clause of the constitution
the appeals court went on to find that the regulations did further arizona s legitimate interests in conserving its population of game and maintaining recreational opportunities for its citizens but it remanded the case so a lower court could determine whether the state could meet the burden of showing that reasonable nondiscriminatory alternatives would not be adequate
its immediate effect is on states whose federal courts are within that circuit namely those in alaska arizona california hawaii idaho montana nevada oregon and washington as well those of guam and the commonwealth of the northern marianas
but it could have an effect on the thinking of federal courts across the country
it s also important to note that this part of the conference report is not intended to affect any federal law already on the books or to limit any authority of any indian tribe
section 6036 c is intended to prevent any misunderstanding on these points
section 6036 c 2 similarly provides that the bill is not to be read as limiting the authority of the federal government to temporarily or permanently prohibit hunting or fishing on any portion of the federal lands as has been done with various national park system units and in some other parts of the federal lands for various reasons including public safety as well as the protection of fish or wildlife
we need regular order and that is why the gentlewoman from north carolina mrs myrick xz4002880 and the gentleman from wisconsin mr kind xz4002180 and i are offering this amendment on a bipartisan basis
i want to say it is not an easy task taking on the gentleman from california mr lewis xz4002391
whether it be in an authorization bill that came through this congress the last year or in the omnibus bill or in the president s budget for fiscal year 2006 this bill no matter what train track it is on will not get to the president until may
much of this funding will be spent on contracts for overseas work and most of these contracts will be awarded to large corporations
i would say that it does not surprise me that the department of state would raise a concern because they are the worst offenders when it comes to fulfilling the statutory goals set by congress regarding contracting practices on behalf of small businesses in our nation
i would love to see that the gentleman work with me on behalf of small businesses and make sure that in this 81 billion there is small business participation
no matter what our views are on immigration states rights or a national id my colleagues should carefully review the driver s license requirements of hr 418
simply stated the bill imposes costly new requirements on states that simply can not be achieved in 3 years allotted by the bill and while states may attempt to comply the bill s unreasonable deadlines and inadequate funding will create confusion and frustrate the public
instead of disclosing the actual findings of field reports on contracting audits troop needs or the projected cost of the reconstruction effort the administration has withheld distorted and even deliberately hidden information
i would like to know why unredacted versions of this audit report and the audit reports on nine additional task orders are still being withheld from congress
i would say to the gentleman from new york this is just on this amendment
despite our amendment saying no money can go to saudi arabia moneys were allocated to saudi arabia so they are now entitled to discount on purchasing for our military
i would say they are twofaced except they have so many members of the royal family they are several hundred fahds and the time has come for us to start judging people on what they do not what they say
this amendment will say that we believe that saudi arabia should be treated not as an ally but as an enemy in the war on terror because that is what they have been
mr chairman the bill we bring to the floor today includes 2 billion for funding requirements under the jurisdiction of the subcommittee on science state justice and commerce including state department and fbi needs related to program expenses in iraq
the embassy in iraq 45 people have died in attacks on the embassy in iraq
on the whole issue of peacekeeping there may very well be an amendment to strike the peacekeeping section
to take away the peacekeeping money after the bush administration has done such a good job of bringing northsouth peace to take that away to allow the raping and the pillaging and everything that is going on in sudan would be morally unacceptable
now president bush working with secretary powell and senator danforth has negotiated after 20 years and keep in mind osama bin laden lived in sudan from 1991 to 1996 have negotiated for 20 years and now to strike the peacekeeping money that will send troops in that regard and we do not want to send american troops there troops that will stop the pillaging and put insulation into the peace agreement that has been signed and that will put pressure pressure on ending the genocide that is taking place in darfur
i would beg this congress after the good work of this administration and members on both sides and almost everybody signed dear colleague letters urging the administration to do more on sudan they are now doing it
the bill we bring to the floor today includes just over 2 billion for funding requirements under the jurisdiction of the subcommittee on science state justice and commerce including state department and fbi needs related to program expenses in iraq
since the bombings in nairobi and dar es salaam state has delivered many of these secure compounds on time and on budget
now we have talked a lot and this committee has done a lot on body armor and humvee armor
i will not mention the woman s name blood on the wall of a rocket attack whereby this young woman was killed
i urge a no vote on the amendment
the conference report also includes 2416 million for domestic appropriations to support the war on terror including fbi counterterrorism efforts and for dea a counternarcotics program in afghanistan
finally it includes 172 million to jumpstart the improvement of the united states tsunami warning capabilities on both coasts
who cares if building a wall on our border endangers our environment
once again by funding the war through another supplemental the bush administration is pulling a fast one on the budget and on the american people
the fact that the pentagon depends on an extra 200 billion for its regular operations and maintenance at the expense of our troops in the field is arrogant incompetent wasteful and downright immoral
hundreds of lives could have been saved if our troops had not been left as sitting ducks on the battlefield for over a year without enough body armor and plated armor for humvees that can save their lives during battle
if we are going to spend billions let us at least spend billions on the people who deserve it the brave troops in the field and especially members of the national guard and reserve who are receiving less for their sacrifices
yet we deny them funding choosing to focus on narrow ideological disagreements and not the lifesaving potential of their work
while disagreements about unfpa will certainly remain continuing to ensure this program is there to rely on has never been more important
why are we voting on writing another check for a mission that has been so badly botched
i want to take just a few seconds and comment on the issue that the gentleman from pennsylvania mr murtha xz4002860 raised because we have worked together on this section of the bill from the very beginning along with the gentleman from california mr hunter xz4001910 and the gentleman from missouri mr skelton xz4003770 of the committee on armed services the gentleman from california chairman lewis and the gentleman from wisconsin mr obey xz4003000
but on the subject of accountability there is no reason that i can think of other than the importance of the legislative branch of government that article i of the constitution establishes the legislative branch of government
mr speaker i thank the chairman of the committee on appropriations for yielding me this time
the gentleman from pennsylvania mr murtha xz4002860 the ranking member on our defense subcommittee has explained the bill quite thoroughly as it relates to the war fighters
the increases that we have added in this bill go to the urgently needed items such as ammunition weapons uparmored humvees transport vehicles jammers night vision equipment radios addon armor kits and the list goes on and on
there are many soldiers and marines today who have been wounded so seriously that in previous wars would have died on the battlefield but who are living today in this war because of improved and increased medical benefits and better training and better medicines and the ability to transport from the battlefield to a medical facility
first i would like to thank chairman sensenbrenner and the judiciary committee for their leadership on this bill and for their dedication to securing our borders and protecting americans from terrorists
i think all americans and those of us on both sides of the aisle can agree that the 911 commission identified a number of improvements that will help upgrade our intelligence and enhance america s security
this supplemental provides necessary funding for a variety of military operations and for equipment that will keep our troops safe while they fight the war on terror
we are asking the brave men and women of our armed forces to put their lives on the line in defense of our freedom
as members of congress we owe it to the american taxpayer to ensure any new request for emergency spending is thoroughly reviewed and considered in a fair manner on the house floor especially when essential funding for our nation s armed forces is at stake
in years past when those of us on the subcommittee on immigration confronted this challenge there were traffickers and human cargo and narcotics and the increasing problem of criminal gangs who profit from such enterprises
i would first like to recognize mr lewis mr obey and the appropriations committee for their work on this bill
i hope in the future we will vote on the funding of military operations during the budgeting process
it is time for the congress to send a message to the administration that we must include future funding for the war on terrorism in the federal budget
ms berkley mr chairman first i want to take a moment and commend the gentleman from texas mr edwards ranking member obey chairman lewis and the committee on appropriations for bringing this supplemental appropriation to the floor so quickly
this servicewoman may prefer to name their children as the beneficiaries of her life insurance policy so that in the event of her death the insurance is spent on he children s school clothes and health care
chairman on behalf of the 370 000 members of the military officers association of america moaa i am writing to inform you that after discussing the issue extensively with the committee s majority and minority staff moaa has reconsidered its position on the servicemen s group life insurance sgli spousal consent requirement as included in the appropriations committee s markup of the fy2005 defense supplemental appropriations act
dear representative evans the military coalition tmc a consortium of nationally prominent uniformed services and veterans organizations representing more than 55 million members plus their families and survivors is writing to inform you that after discussions with the veterans affairs committee s majority and minority staff tmc has reconsidered its position on the servicemen s group life insurance sgli spousal consent requirement as included in the appropriations committee s markup of the fy2005 defense supplemental appropriations act
after the war america reflected with shame on how this shining beacon of democracy and freedom turned its back on 1 000 jews who fled for their lives on the ship called the st
regarding driver s licenses the 911 tragedy has been referred to here on this floor referencing the terrorists who obtained driver s licenses
the original truman committee was a special committee formed on march 1 1941 to investigate the national defense program
its specific directive was to investigate the terms of defenserelated contracts the methods of awarding them the effect on labor and the geographic distribution of contracts and facilities
however this legislation says if you are going to use that identification card to get on transportation that is in interstate commerce or otherwise then it is going to have to meet certain minimum standards
i have heard friends across the aisle say that americans have journeyed freely in the past and that this goes against the very freedoms which this nation was founded on
but the truth is try getting on an airplane
as a member of the aviation subcommittee and as a member from the great state of texas i strongly feel we need to put just as much of an emphasis on protecting the skies as we do our land borders
mr speaker i congratulate the chairman on this bill
many of those intent on doing our nation harm claim political asylum as their trojan horse to gain access to our borders
the 19 hijackers on september 11th had fraudulently obtained dozens of american visas passports and driver s licenses documents used to open bank accounts establish residency and yes to fly airplanes
res 35 which calls on the president to do so
mr chairman while i continue to have grave concerns about the president s war in iraq on balance this bill provides funds that will help protect our men and women under fire gives additional help to the families of those who will never return home helps consolidate the tentative gains in israel and the palestinian areas and aids the peoples of other nations who face dire crises abroad
there is no accountability on their part
i urge my colleagues to vote no on s 5
it seems that our colleagues probably are so wrong on this bill they can not even talk about it
we are putting the focus back on justice back on justice in this bill
we have worked tirelessly on this in the house and i urge everyone to support it
any abusive or frivolous class action is a drain on the system and forces innocent defendants to settle cases rather than play judicial roulette with the risk of a huge unjustified settlement
unfortunately instead of narrowly focusing on such abuses senate bill 5 completely reconfigures the judicial system resulting in diminished corporate accountability and fundamental legal rights of individuals
it is essential that we hold accountable the forces that have so much impact on the lives of every american
mr speaker the vote in this house we will take within the hour will leave only one more step the president s signature in this first major attack on lawsuit abuse
i want to express my appreciation to the gentleman from wisconsin mr sensenbrenner xz4003650 and his committee and all the members in fact who have been willing to take on this tough fight but particularly to the chairman for working hard to find a way to get this bill on the floor and to the president this early in this congress
six years ago on this floor we really began the process of attacking this system
the stories go on and on and on to the point that by the time we passed legislation like this in the last congress for the third congress straight members were eager to just simply get a couple of minutes to talk about one of the classes where the people in the class get a dollaroff coupon the people in the class get the smallest possible box of cheerios the people in the class get a 31cent check or the people in the class even wind up having to pay the lawyers of the class additional money because there really was no money for the people in the class that was being determined
i urge a no vote on the substitute
mr speaker i thank the chairman and his committee for their hard work on this effort
there are no restrictions on the substantive rights of plaintiffs
there are no caps on damages
there is no elimination on the rights of plaintiffs to recover
the gentleman from virginia mr goodlatte xz4001540 has exhibited both foresight and patience and as chief sponsor of the bill through three congresses deserves tremendous credit for the success that we are now on the brink of achieving
i also want to commend the gentleman from wisconsin mr sensenbrenner xz4003650 for the wise course that he has followed as chairman of the house committee on the judiciary in permitting the senate to act in advance of our action today
suppose that a california state court class action were filed against a california pharmaceutical drug company on behalf of a proposed class of 60 percent california residents and 40 percent nevada residents alleging harmful side effects attributed to a drug sold nationwide
after all the state laws that would apply in all of these cases would vary depending on where the drug was prescribed and purchased
there is also less likelihood that multiple actions will be filed around the country on the same subject so as to give rise to a coordinating federal multidistrict litigation proceeding
in addition a mass action can not be removed to federal court if it falls under one of the following four categories number one if all of the claims arise out of an event or occurrence that happened in the state where the action was filed and that resulted in injuries only in that state or in contiguous states number two if it is the defendants who seek to have the claims joined for trial number three if the claims are asserted on behalf of the general public pursuant to a state statute authorizing such an action and number four if the claims have been consolidated or coordinated for pretrial purposes only
instead merck continued to sell vioxx continued to spend 100 million a year on directtoconsumer advertising encouraging more and more americans to buy vioxx
there are some people out there who thought the batteries on these things run out too quickly
these are the same class actions asserting the same claims on behalf of the same people
in the columbia house record case the lawyers took home 5 million and the plaintiffs got a coupon for discounts on future purchases of records
mr speaker i thank the gentleman from georgia for yielding me this time and frankly for making that important point that this matter is proceeding to this floor under a bipartisan unanimous vote by the committee on rules and the suggestion that the process was unfair or defective is not borne out by both the nature of the debate in the committee on rules and by the unanimous vote that sent this rule to the floor
madam speaker with the consideration of this legislation the majority begins their assault on our nation s civil justice system
on deck and pending are equally onesided medical malpractice bills and asbestos bills that both cap damages and eliminate liability to protect some of the most egregious wrongdoers in america
the majority s assault on victims and consumers is unprecedented in its scope and stunning in its breadth
collectively these measures will close the courthouse doors on millions of americans harmed by intentional wrongdoing negligence and fraud
it is opposed by the national council of state legislatures consumers and public interest groups including public citizen the consumers federation of america the consumers union the united states pirg a coalition of environmental advocates health advocates including the campaign for tobacco free kids civil rights groups such as the alliance for justice the leadership conference on civil rights the national association for the advancement of colored people and the lawyers committee for civil rights and labor such as the american federation of laborcongress of industrial organizations aflcio
a new york times editorial board just this weekend wrote this about the measure that is before the house today instead of narrowly focusing on real abuses of the system the measure reconfigures the civil justice system to achieve a significant rollback of corporate accountability and people s rights
mr speaker i am pleased to yield 4 minutes to my good friend the gentleman from massachusetts mr markey xz4002530 from the committee on energy and commerce
he has worked with us on many of these issues
mr speaker i am pleased to yield 5 minutes to the distinguished gentlewoman from texas ms jacksonlee xz4001990 a member of the committee on the judiciary and a ranking subcommittee member
secondly this bill closes the door on victims of largescale personal injury cases resulting from accidents environmental disasters or dangerous drugs that are widely sold
finally mr speaker i include in this debate from the leadership conference and the aflcio and the alliance for justice all writing on one letter and they plead with us in the house of representatives to protect working men and women and civil rights litigants by opposing the measure that is before us
dear representative on behalf of the undersigned civil rights and labor organizations we write to urge you to vote against the class action fairness act s 5 which passed the senate last week
for example every state has passed a law prohibiting discrimination on the basis of disability
moreover several states have expanded title vii s ban on national origin discrimination to prohibit discrimination on the basis of ancestry or place of birth or citizenship status
if you have any questions or need further information please call nancy zirkin deputy director of the leadership conference on civil rights 2022632880 sandy brantley legislative counsel alliance for justice 2028226070 or bill samuel legislative director aflcio 2026375320
dear senator our organizations are opposed to the sweepinglydrawn and misleadingly named class action fairness act of 2005 this bill is patently unfair to citizens harmed by toxic spills contaminated drinking water polluted air and other environmental hazards involved in class action cases based on state environmental or public health laws
in such cases a class action lawsuit in state court based on state common law doctrines of negligence nuisance or trespass or upon rights and duties created by state statutes in the state where the injuries occur is often the best way of fairly resolving these claims
some communities and individuals have brought or soon will bring suits to recover damages for mtbe contamination and hold the polluters accountable but under this bill mtbe class actions or mass actions based on state law could be removed to federal court by the oil and gas companies in many of these cases
for example in at least one mtbe class action a federal court dismissed the case based on oil companies claims that the action was barred by the federal clean air act even though that law contains no tort liability waiver for mtbe
we take no position on the act as a general matter and indeed there are differing views among us on the policy judgments reflected in the act
we join together however in a bipartisan request for support of senator mark pryor s potential amendment to s 5 or any similar legislation clarifying that the act does not apply to and would have no effect on actions brought by any state attorney general on behalf of his or her respective state or its citizens
for example in the pharmaceutical industry the states have recently brought enforcement actions on behalf of consumers against large often foreignowned drug companies for overcharges and market manipulations that illegally raised the costs of certain prescription drugs
this often meant several hundred dollars going back into the pockets of those consumers who can least afford to be victimized by illegal trade practices senior citizens living on fixed incomes and the working poor who can not afford insurance
mr speaker i urge my colleagues to seriously consider the excellent presentations made on our side of the aisle and vote against the measure that is before us today
for example every state in the union has passed a law prohibiting discrimination on the basis of disability
mr speaker i am pleased to yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from new york mr nadler xz4002890 a distinguished member of the committee on the judiciary
mr speaker i am pleased to yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from new york mr weiner xz4004260 a distinguished member of the committee on the judiciary
mr speaker i object to the vote on the ground that a quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not present
let me quote their take on this bill the practical effect of the change could be that many cases will never be heard given how overburdened federal judges are plainly that is the goal of the bill
while we have had hearings and markups on class action legislation in the past this bill is quite complex and very different than previous versions
under the guise of deregulation we re watching the wholesale dismantling of health and safety standards environmental protections and longstanding limits on concentration of ownership within the media and other key industries
this bill is but the latest in a series of assaults by those on the other side attacking the ability of individuals to seek relief from the courts
and it is also but the latest in a series of assaults on states rights to provide legal remedies for harm suffered by their citizens
mr speaker by direction of the committee on rules i call up house resolution 96 and ask for its immediate consideration
but this is fair in both senses of that term a fair rule that gives members on both sides of the aisle a chance to discuss their ideas on class action reform
even with that bipartisan support however there are differences of opinion on how to reform our class action system
this chamber has passed class action litigation reform on four previous occasions
mr speaker i would like to again urge my colleagues to support this rule which passed out of the committee on rules without objection and to vote in favor of the underlying bill which will provide this much needed reform
mr speaker i yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from west virginia mrs capito xz4000610 my colleague on the committee on rules
well a recent study examined class actions in the state courts of connecticut delaware maine massachusetts new york and rhode island to determine what effect the bill would have on the class actions filed in those respective states
mr speaker i am proud to yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from tennessee mrs blackburn xz4000320 a former member of the committee on the judiciary and an original cosponsor of this bill in the 108th congress
i want to remind her that the committee on rules voted unanimously in favor of this rule and granted an amendment in order in the form of a substitute that includes each and every one of the provisions that she just spoke of
so to suggest mr speaker that this is something that had not been looked at and we have not talked about i would remind my colleague that it was addressed in the 105th congress in the 106th congress in the 107th congress in the 108th congress and finally we are here and we are going to get this rule passed and this bill passed and on to the president for his signature
mr speaker i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from oklahoma mr cole xz4000770 my colleague on the committee on rules
in response to the gentlewoman from texas the committee on rules has jurisdiction and anybody that knows the history of this body knows and understands that the committee on rules certainly has jurisdiction
house resolution 3789 class action jurisdiction act of 1998 committee hearing and markup held reported from the house committee on the judiciary 17 to 12
mr speaker i yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from pennsylvania ms hart xz4001680 a former member for 4 years of the committee on the judiciary and an original cosponsor of hr 1115
to the extent these provisions are the same the house committee on the judiciary s report on hr 1115 and the senate committee on the judiciary s report on s 274 reflect the intent and understanding of the committee and the sponsors as to the import of these provisions
i would like to ask my colleague the chairman of the committee on the judiciary to provide an overview of the jurisdictional provisions in the legislation and i would like to discuss the various exceptions included in the legislation and the intent of the sponsors with regard to these exceptions
new subsection 1332 d 3 therefore gives federal courts discretion in the interests of justice to decline to exercise jurisdiction over such cases based on the consideration of five factors
madam speaker i would ask that the chairman elaborate on these criteria
thus if a plaintiff seeks to have a class action remanded on the ground that the primary defendants and twothirds or more of the class members are citizens of the home state that plaintiff has the burden of demonstrating that these criteria are met
i hope this colloquy will provide guidance on the very important jurisdictional provisions in s 5 and the sponsor s intent
apparently she has not spoken to her own fellow san franciscan and senior senator from her state dianne feinstein who negotiated the compromise that has brought this legislation to the floor of the house or to senator chuck schumer also a member of the committee on the judiciary on the democratic side in the senate or 16 other democratic senators who voted for this legislation
a number of the folks who have spoken on the other side of the aisle criticizing the legislation have cited total inaccuracies about what the legislation will do
the truth however is that this legislation will have absolutely no effect on vioxx suits
let me tell my colleagues the washington post has repeatedly endorsed this legislation along with over a hundred other major newspapers the washington post the wall street journal the financial times christian science monitor on and on the list goes
mr speaker i thank the gentleman from wisconsin for yielding me this time and i thank the gentleman from new york mr weiner xz4004260 for raising the points on those cases on the class action wheel of fortune because he makes a good point
in not one of those cases was there any wrongdoing found on the part of any of those defendants because all of those were settlements
he and i have been working on this for over 6 years
the truth is however that this legislation will have absolutely no effect on vioxx suits and here is why
since the legislation is not retroactive it would absolutely have no effect on the 75 class actions already filed against merck in the wake of the vioxx withdrawal
take a look at the class action wheel of fortune on this chart
mr speaker i would like to thank the gentleman for the opportunity to speak on this bill today
to use a sports analogy thanks to willing judges personal injury lawyers get to play on their home court each and every time they file a frivolous lawsuit there
at last estimate this outrageous tort tax cost the nation s economy 246 billion a year and by 2006 it will cost the average american nearly 1 000 more each year on their purchases because of defensive business practices
do you want to know why the chamber of commerce is spending 1 billion to lobby on what seems to be a procedural issue
on 911 did we respond to september 11 by taking out city police officers and only having the fbi
on 911 did we respond by not having local fire departments and only having the coast guard or army fire department
it is to walk on this floor and take the final exam
these actions come to our committee the committee on the judiciary and a number of other committees we have opportunity for amendment give and take hearings
it did not see the light of day on the senate side no hearings no markup it did not see the light of day on the house side no hearings no markup
and frankly mr speaker shame on us for we are shaming the process and the american people should rightly be ashamed of this and of us
instead of narrowly focusing on real abuses of the system the measure that is before us today reconfigures the civil justice system to achieve a significant rollback of corporate accountability and people s rights
when this legislation passes on the republican clock i am going to tell you that the doors of the courthouse will be closed to you and if you have johnny jones the country lawyer trying to bring justice to rural america johnny jones will have to take his smalltime practice and mortgage his house to get into the federal court
it is in this light that i rise to support h res 96 only insofar as it allows consideration of the democratic substitute that was ruled in order by the committee on rules and offered by the distinguished ranking member of the judiciary committee mr conyers
we should have an open rule on this important issue however
for real and honest debate to take place on such an important issue as defining diversity jurisdiction in the federal courts for class actions we must have available an alternate option to s 5 the legislation that is before the committee of the whole house
mr speaker it is interesting to hear the distinguished gentleman from georgia mention the committee on rules and i respect the power of the committee on rules
the committee on rules is not a jurisdictional committee
this bill did not go through the committee process on the senate side or on the house side
therefore we are stamping on democracy and this rule and this bill should be voted down enthusiastically
mr speaker i thank the gentleman for the time that he has spent on this legislation
if you happen to be a small state or maybe some state that is not the headquarters of corporate entities like on the east coast for example you will find no defendant so you will be languishing year after year after year trying to get into federal court
mr speaker let me simply say this is a bill on the floor with no problem
there is a wage and hour carveout so that you can file against a company in your local jurisdiction as a class action when you have been violated on the minimum wage
frankly there is a farce going on here
second it cracks down on these couponbased classaction settlements by requiring that attorney fee awards be based on either the value of the coupons actually redeemed or by the hours actually billed by the attorney prosecuting the case
i urge my colleagues to vote yes on the bill and vote yes on the rule
and second it cracks down on these couponbased class action settlements by requiring fee awards to be based on the number of coupons actually redeemed or the number of hours actually billed
mr speaker i urge my colleagues to vote yes on this class action reform legislation
mr speaker i thank the gentleman for his excellent work on this very important piece of legislation
it is protecting the country club members from the responsibility for the harm which they potentially inflict from their corporate perspectives on ordinary citizens within our society
this is where the bush administration then appoints somebody from the industry that is meant to be regulated as the head of the agency knowing that that individual has no likelihood of actually putting on the books the kinds of protections which are needed
mr speaker vote no on this critical bill
vote no on the rule
mr speaker i thank the gentleman from michigan for yielding and i thank him for his leadership on this most critical of all consumer issues before congress this year
so you have all heard now the technical arguments made by the bush administration proponents here on the house floor
so you have heard the bush administration argument on why this is good
the practical effect of the change could be that many cases will never be heard given how overburdened federal judges are which might help limit the number of cases smith barney advised its clients that this bill will be positive in general for the tobacco industry and that tobacco stocks have rallied on this favorable news given that this bill could have a positive impact on tobacco litigation
so if you are out there one of your family members has just found that they have a spot on their lung they have smoked for the last 20 or 30 years what this bill will do is it will make it more difficult for you and the other people in your states who also have found that they have spots on their lungs to get together to sue the tobacco companies
you just watch across the board every single interest that harms the health and wellbeing of america skyrocket as soon as we take the vote on final passage of this bill today because president bush is going to sign this bill with great joy because the oil the chemical and polluting industries are going to be happy
therefore tobacco stocks have rallied on this favorable news given that this bill could have a positive impact on potential future tobacco litigation
obviously president bush has been a big proponent of this type of legislation so we would assume that he would sign it as part of a broader fight that he hopes will lead to limits on awards in asbestos cases and to caps on painandsuffering awards in medical malpractice cases
the firm may engage in securities transactions in a manner inconsistent with this research report and with respect to securities covered by this report will buy or sell from customers on a principal basis
there may be limited information available on foreign securities
in addition exchange rate movements may have an adverse effect on the value of an investment in a foreign stock and its corresponding dividend payment for us investors
despite the rhetoric on the other side this is still a bad bill
every state has passed a law prohibiting discrimination on the basis of disability
consider for example a class action lawsuit brought against a national corporation by employees of a store in massachusetts because that store discriminates on the basis of ancestry place of birth or citizenship status
under this bill except in very rare instances that case would be sent to a federal court instead of state court even though the case is based on a violation of state law
in effect this bill is rigging the system on behalf of the corporations and against the interests of workers
we often hear a lot of lofty rhetoric on the other side about states rights
minority leader on behalf of the attorneys general of california illinois iowa kentucky maine maryland massachusetts minnesota new jersey new mexico new york oklahoma oregon vermont and west virginia we are writing in opposition to s 5 the socalled class action fairness act which will be debated today and is scheduled to be voted on this week
as you know under s 5 almost all class actions brought by private individuals in state court based on state law claims would be removed to federal court and as explained below many of these cases may not be able to continue as class actions
we are concerned with such a limitation on the availability of the class action device because particularly in these times of tightening state budgets class actions provide an important private attorney general supplement to the efforts of state attorneys general to prosecute violations of state consumer protection civil rights labor public health and environmental laws
it therefore is not surprising that organizations such as aarp aflcio consumer federation of america consumers union leadership conference on civil rights naacp and public citizen all oppose this legislation in its present form
that attorney general enforcement actions should proceed unimpeded is important to all our constituents but most significantly to our senior citizens living on 3
moreover while the population of some states may be large enough to warrant a separate class action involving only residents of those states it is very unlikely tbat similar lawsuits will be brought on behalf of the residents of many smaller states
this problem should be addressed by allowing federal courts to certify nationwide class actions to the full extent of their constitutional power either by applying one state s law with sufficient ties to the underlying claims in the case or by ensuring that a federal judge does not deny certification on the sole ground that the laws of more than one state would apply to the action
class action treatment provides a particularly important mechanism for adjudicating the claims of lowwage workers and victims of discrimination and there is no apparent need to place limitations on these types of actions
senator kennedy reportedly will offer an amendment on this issue which also should be adopted
without clear authority in the legislation to more closely examine defendants on issues bearing on the fairness of the proposed settlement particularly outofstate defendants over whom subpoena authority may in some circumstances be limited the notification provision equal access to the american system of justice is a foundation of our democracy
i want to read an excerpt from the leadership conference on civil rights aflcio and the alliance for justice statement
for example every state has passed a law prohibiting discrimination on the basis of disability
for example many states provide expanded benefits based on marital status and i could go on and on and on
leadership conference on civil rights alliance for justice aflcio washington dc february 2 2005
exempt civil rights and wage and hour cases from s 5 dear senators on behalf of the undersigned civil rights and labor organizations we write to urge you to support an amendment being offered by senators kennedy and cantwell to the class action fairness act s 5 which would exempt civil rights and wage and hour state law cases
for example every state has passed a law prohibiting discrimination on the basis of disability
moreover several states have expanded title vii s ban on national origin discrimination to prohibit discrimination on the basis of ancestry or place of birth or citizenship status

she was buried on the very day in september that merck took vioxx off the market
on october 28 2004 her husband monty filed a claim against merck in the superior court of new jersey atlantic city division
in an interview on 60 minutes mr higgins xz4006410 said i believe my wife would be here if merck had decided to take vioxx off the market just 1 month earlier then there is richard dickie irvin of florida who was a 53yearold former football coach and president of the athletic booster association
he went on to play in canadian league football until suffering a careerending injury
and it is ironic and it is almost kind of laughable that the majority which has made it a point to argue on behalf of states right is basically turning its back on what states have done to protect their people
dear senator on behalf of the national conference of state legislatures ncsl i am urging you to oppose passage of s 5 the class action fairness act of 2005 this legislation will federalize class actions involving only state law claims
the effect of s 5 on state legislatures is that state laws in the areas of consumer protection and antitrust which were passed to protect the citizens of a particular state against fraudulent or illegal activities will almost never be heard in state courts
dear senator our organizations are opposed to the sweepingly drawn and misleadingly named class action fairness act of 2005 this bill is patently unfair to citizens harmed by toxic spills contaminated drinking water polluted air and other environmental hazards involved in class action cases based on state environmental or public health laws
in such cases a class action lawsuit in state court based on state common law doctrines of negligence nuisance or trespass or upon rights and duties created by state statutes in the state where the injuries occur is often the best way of fairly resolving these claims
some communities and individuals have brought or soon will bring suits to recover damages for mtbe contamination and hold the polluters accountable but under this bill mtbe class actions or mass actions based on state law could be removed to federal court by the oil and gas companies in many of these cases
for example in at least one mtbe class action a federal court dismissed the case based on oil companies claims that the action was barred by the federal clean air act even though that law contains no tort liability waiver for mtbe
drug companies put new products on the market like vioxx that they knew to be unsafe
because they believe on balance that consumers are going to be better represented in federal courts
and this notion that somehow state courts are going to be more inclined to represent consumer interests rather than federal courts on issues like tobacco and civil rights and so on i do not think history proves that to be the case
on balance i think the judicial system will be far more fair responsible and reasonable under this compromise bill so i would urge my colleagues particularly on the democratic side to support this bill
the substitute also includes a provision which i have advocated for many years which actually was supported by the distinguished chairman and passed the committee on the judiciary a couple of times to limit the ability of corporations settling lawsuits to demand that records that may indicate threats to public health and safety be sealed unless it is necessary to protect trade confidentiality
the substitute provides that when such a gag order is requested and it is normally requested by both the plaintiff and the defendant because in the settlement the defendant insists on this as a condition of the settlement the court then rubber stamps it
on the one hand the bill provides state courts can not hear such cases but when these cases are removed to federal court plaintiffs will find that the federal courts routinely refuse to hear them
i urge my colleagues to vote yes on the conyersnadlerjacksonlee substitute and no on the main bill
this bill also runs counter to the principles of federalism that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle claim to support
in fact 46 state attorneys general on a bipartisan basis have requested an exemption so that they can continue to protect their citizens under the state consumer protection laws in state courts
these families believe merck knew of the danger vioxx was causing but allowed the drug to remain on the market anyway
thanks to the socalled class action fairness act people who have had their civil rights trampled on will no longer be able to bring their claims to state court
the same burden is put on the backs of hourly wage workers who sue for back pay that they are owed
these folks are struggling to put food on their family s table and they almost certainly can not afford the high cost of multistate litigation
i urge all of my colleagues to vote no on the final passage and to vote yes on the conyers substitute
why do we have to always go into federal court on these cases rather than have some kind of choice
it fixes the problem with attorneys general in bringing a case in state court on behalf of not only members of their state but if the injury has occurred to a lot of other people the attorney general might want to bring that case
i have a letter mr speaker signed on this specific issue by 47 attorneys general
it also denies benefits under the bill for tax traitors those who move their corporate headquarters off shore to avoid corporate taxes and it also provides a limitation on sealed settlements that the gentleman from new york mr nadler xz4002890 has been very active in making sure that cases that are settled can not be sealed beyond public view unless if such a sealing would violate public health or other important considerations
we take no position on the act as a general matter and indeed there are differing views among us on the policy judgments reflected in the act
we join together however in a bipartisan request for support of senator mark pryor s potential amendment to s 5 or any similar legislation clarifying that the act does not apply to and would have no effect on actions brought by any state attorney general on behalf of his or her respective state or its citizens
for example in the pharmaceutical industry the states have recently brought enforcement actions on behalf of consumers against large often foreignowned drug companies for overcharges and market manipulations that illegally raised the costs of certain prescription drugs
this often meant several hundred dollars going back into the pockets of those consumers who can least afford to be victimized by illegal trade practices senior citizens living on fixed incomes and the working poor who can not afford insurance
madam speaker i ask unanimous consent that all members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on s 5
we stand on the cusp of sending landmark legislation on civiljustice reform to the president that has been approved by increasing majorities each time it has been considered by the house in each of the last three congresses and which passed the other body last week with an overwhelming majority of 72 votes
we do not have the time in general debate for me to give this statement on the floor so i will insert the statement relative to the intent of the managers of the bill in the record at this point
finally the sixth factor is whether one or more class actions asserting the same or similar claims on behalf of the same or other persons have been filed in the last three years
if other class actions on new subsection 1332 d 4 a is the local controversy exception this subsection prohibits federal courts from exercising diversity jurisdiction over a class action under the foregoing provisions if the plaintiffs clearly demonstrate that each and every one of the following criteria are satisfied in the case at issue
and fourth no other class action asserting the same or similar factual allegations against any of the defendants on behalf of the same or other persons has been filed during the preceding three years
by this criterion the sponsors mean that the fourth and final criterion is that no other class action involving similar allegations has been filed against any of the defendants over the last three years on behalf of the same or other persons
however the sponsors caution that these jurisdictional determinations should be made largely on the basis of readily available information
allowing substantial burdensome discovery on jurisdictional issues would be contrary to the intent of these provisions to encourage the exercise of federal jurisdiction over class actions
by corporate governance litigation the sponsors mean only litigation based solely on a state statutory law regulating the organization and governance of business enterprises such as corporations partnerships limited partnerships limited liability companies new subsection 1332 d 11 expands federal jurisdiction over mass actions suits that are brought on behalf of numerous named plaintiffs who claim that their suits present common questions of law or fact that should be tried together even though they do not seek class certification status
the sponsors also wish to stress that this provision is when all the claims asserted in the action arise out of an event or occurrence in the state where the suit is filed and the injuries were incurred in that state and contiguous states eg a toxic spill case and 2 when the claims are asserted on behalf of the general public and not on behalf of individual claimants or members of a purported class pursuant to a state statute specifically authorizing such an action
the second exception also addresses a very narrow situation specifically a law like the california unfair competition law which allows individuals to bring a suit on behalf of the general public
the sponsors wish to make clear that this restriction on mdl transfers applies only to mass actions as defined in subsection 1332 d 11 the legislation does not more broadly restrict the authority of the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation to transfer class actions removed to federal court under this legislation
the sponsors note that the current prohibition on remand order review was added to section 1447 after the federal diversity jurisdictional statutes and the related removal statutes had been subject to appellate review for many years and were the subject of considerable appellate level interpretive law
the sponsors are aware that some courts especially in the class action context have declined to exercise federal jurisdiction over cases on the grounds that the amount in controversy in those cases exceeded the jurisdictional threshold only when assessed from the viewpoint of the defendant
on the other hand if the class definition and claims appear to follow a natural pattern that consideration would favor allowing the matter to be handled by a state court
the final factor is whether one or more class actions asserting the same or similar claims on behalf of the same or other persons have been filed in the last 3 years
if the other class actions on the same subject have been or are likely to be filed elsewhere the sponsors intend that this consideration would strongly favor the exercise of federal jurisdiction
and from a relief standpoint the real demand of the full class in terms of seeking significant relief would be on the insurance company itself
the third exception addresses a very narrow situation specifically a law like the california unfair competition law which allows individuals to bring a suit on behalf of the general public
i was particularly perturbed listening to the gentleman from massachusetts mr markey xz4002530 who said that the kids who start smoking at 13 and 14 years old are going to be denied their day in court and that the tobacco companies are going to end up cashing in on a big bonanza
well i had my staff while this was going on look at what has happened to altria the parent company of philip morris
the new math behind the substitute amendment rests on the following arithmetic if you add a number of amendments rejected by large bipartisan majorities in the other body last week and combine them with the amendment ideas overwhelmingly rejected on the house floor by a bipartisan vote last year the sum will somehow equal a credible solution
one element of the substitute amendment is the state attorney general provision allowing any class action to be brought by or on behalf of the state attorney general to be in state court
this provision is unnecessary because when state attorneys general sue on behalf of their citizens those actions are almost always parens patriae actions and not class actions and the former will be in no way affected by this bill
for these reasons the pryor amendment in the other body that this provision copies verbatim failed to garner even 40 votes on the senate floor last week
there is also a loophole creating a provision on mass actions and a completely unnecessary public disclosure provision both based on senate amendments in the other body that were offered and withdrawn
finally mr speaker a vote on this substitute is clearly just a vote to further deny or delay meaningful class action reform and a vote on the substitute could not in any way be construed as reform of any kind but rather support for the triallawyerdominated status quo
i urge my colleague to vote no on the substitute and yes on s 5
vote no on the amendments vote no on the motion to recommit and pass the bill
mr speaker on that i demand the yeas and nays
mr speaker i thank the chairman of the committee on the judiciary for yielding me time
mr speaker all americans should thank the gentleman from virginia mr goodlatte xz4001540 and the gentleman from wisconsin chairman sensenbrenner for their leadership on this most important issue
mr speaker while many concessions were made on both sides this is still a very worthwhile bill that contains many good reforms and i fully support it and look forward to its enactment into law and also encourage my colleagues to support it as well
they allow average americans financially unable to launch a judicial battle on their own the means to seek redress for injury or death of a loved one
on each of those occasions i voted no not because i was unalterably opposed to congress acting on this subject but because in my judgment the defects of those bills outweighed their potential benefits
it would have properly focused the legislation on class actions unrelated to personal injuries
also and worse in my judgment no longer will a coherent description of the class be sufficient before the trial on the merit proceeds
under the bill the judge must first know with certainty the absolute number of the plaintiff class because whether he may or must decline to hear the case depends on whether a magic number of plaintiffs are citizens of the state where the lawsuit was filed
but the majority wages countless legislative assaults on the entire system rather than confined deliberative surgical repairs
sometimes during these debates i like to step in to take a perspective of someone on the committee who is not a lawyer but i have to tell my colleagues the previous speaker the gentleman from virginia went to great lengths to talk about the lawyers fees
those of us who are individuals of modest means if we have been aggrieved by a major company if they have done something that has harmed our health or our community or our family we as individuals frankly do not have the ability to take on a major company to stop them from doing the wrongful things to make sure they understand that there is a cost of doing it
we can not frankly pay the lawyer up front so they are paid on contingencies and that is the way these actions get taken
in those cases those parties each and every one of them on the wheel of rhetoric actually was found by a judge or a jury to have done substantial bad things to the community
i love these small government types who believe we have better judgment on these things than 12 men and women in a community then we have to believe that the system in those cases worked
i would say to my colleagues on both sides of the aisle that the conyersnadlerjacksonlee substitute only puts lipstick on a fraud
mr speaker i urge a yes vote on the substitute a no vote on the base bill and i urge us to stop this drumbeat on the other side of blaming average americans for being victimized by big corporations
mr speaker i thank the gentleman very much for yielding me this additional time and i am surprised that such an able lawyer would be unwilling to engage in a debate on his time but i will take 30 seconds simply to rebut what the gentleman said
in every one of those cases on the wheel of rhetoric that the gentleman put up those that were found guilty those who were found to be responsible those who were found to be culpable of doing harmful things to our community admitted it paid a fine paid a penalty that was approved by a judge and that is the fact that the gentleman took cases of people who admitted with their actions there was wrongdoing involved
members should make no mistake about it if we pass this misguided legislation we will have effectively shut the door on civil rights on workers rights and on anyone injured through corporate negligence
this legislation is a fantastic bipartisan effort to reform the legal system and is a good first step toward addressing the costs of litigation on small businesses large businesses and all americans
i encourage my colleagues to support this effort and i appreciate the leadership shown by the speaker the majority leader and the chairman of the committee on the judiciary towards getting this legislation passed through the senate and on the desk of the president
first i must comment on the gentleman s remarks that if things were so good then why is it that we have parents of children with special needs decrying these budgets
it refuses to include any details on the president s privatization plan and it further continues to spend every single cent of the social security surplus reserve on things other than social security
that means over the next 10 years under this budget that we have before us 26 trillion of worker contributions that are supposed to be dedicated to social security will be spent on something other than social security
that is more than 1 000 on the head of each and every man and woman in this country
we can start by saying that 169 billion of social security moneys will not be spent because this budget spends every single cent of the 169 billion coming in this year for social security on something other than social security
i commend the gentleman from iowa chairman nussle and members of the committee on the budget on a good product that addresses several of the concerns that i have had with president bush s budget
i also agree with the increases for our national defense and homeland security to provide for our troops fighting the war on terror and to keep our communities safe
i am pleased that the committee on the budget added an additional 11 billion to the president s request for the functional category encompassing these programs
this budget resolution makes no assumption on the president s proposed communities initiative
vocational ed programs offer many high school students the motivation to work hard in all of their classes and provide job skills who do not go on to college
as members of the committee on rules they are also serving in the very important capacity on the committee on the budget where they have played a key role in fashioning this work product that we are going to see
i am happy this rule has been able to report out every single substitute that was submitted to the committee on rules calling for an opportunity to be considered here in the house
but out of deference to the distinguished ranking minority member of the committee on appropriations we have chosen to make in order an amendment offered by the gentleman from wisconsin mr obey xz4003000
i know the gentlewoman from new york ms slaughter xz4003780 as we proceeded with questions in the committee on rules talked about the gentlewoman s concern over things like tax cuts
one of the points that i think is important for us to make and i mentioned this yesterday in the committee on rules the director of the office of management and budget joshua bolton has on more than a few occasions reminded me and i am sure he has said this to other groups that if we did not have the tragic attack on september 11 against our nation september 11 2001 if we did not have the horrendous cost of the war in iraq with which we have had to contend we would still have a federal deficit
i believe at my core as a republican that the reach of the federal government impinges on individual initiative and responsibility two very very important things that need to be encouraged
if we can couple focusing on economic growth with responsibly reining in federal spending it is very clear that is the most effective way to deal with the deficit
when we had the debates in 2001 and then in 2002 and 2003 and 2004 on the issue of tax cuts we constantly heard the argument from our very distinguished friends on the other side of the aisle that the bush tax cut would ruin the country
i am very happy to report as i know most of my colleagues know based on the projections we had for the last fiscal year because of the economic growth that we saw because of the unanticipated revenues that came into the federal treasury because of the tax reduction that brought about that economic growth we have seen the deficit itself actually reduced by 109 billion over what had been projected
we saw dramatic economic growth as president kennedy brought about a dramatic reduction on capital gains in the early 1960s
under republican leadership we are reining in that growth in federal spending and at the same time we are focused on very important priorities
we also know while people talk about the socalled 2 trillion hole the other night the treasury secretary told me if nothing is done on social security that borrowing level will be even greater than the 2 trillion that those who are critical of the president s proposal argue is out there on the horizon
i think if members look at these very important issues and then focus on what is our number one priority the national security of the united states this budget is one which should enjoy broad support across the board from democrats and republicans alike
when mr greenspan was confronted with this he said i relied on the projections that most people made but he was reminded he was wrong
because it would be under a government managed account and most workers would have to annuitize what was left in their private accounts and there would be nothing to pass on
they say that all options are on the table and that they are open to listening to various ideas
maybe the vote on the previous question will help them
if you believe as i do that we must not privatize social security then you must vote no on the previous question
if you believe in privatizing social security then you will vote yes on the previous question
i urge my colleagues to say no to privatizing social security by voting no on the previous question
everybody on our side of the aisle is prepared to work in a bipartisan way to increase the solvency of social security
we are turning our backs on people who need our help and i think that is wrong
mr speaker while members of this house may differ on what is the best longterm solution to ensure solvency of social security i think we probably all agree that we need to protect the money that goes into the trust fund and that any diversion of these funds must be undertaken with great care
hr 1330 will give us an opportunity to vote up or down on whether we want the social security trust fund to be used to pay for these fiscally irresponsible private accounts
let me make it very clear that a no vote on the previous question will not stop consideration of the budget resolution nor will it change the process by which it is to be considered
so mr speaker i urge a no vote on the previous question
mr speaker i ask unanimous consent that the text of the amendment be printed in the record immediately before the vote on the previous question
mr speaker i object to the vote on the ground that a quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not present
mr speaker i am going to urge a no vote on the previous question and a no vote on the rule
do nt raid those social security dollars now of course given the discussion on this radical overhaul of social security we have the other prospect that these dollars will be taken away from social security and placed into private accounts resulting in either massive additional borrowing to continue social security benefits or very draconian budget cuts
he wants to have this body move immediately to a debate on his amendment which would prohibit the diversion of social security money upon our completion of the budget
there is a lot of explaining to do in my opinion for those who are advancing this privatization scheme on social security and i know the nation would feel an awful lot better certainly those i represent if we conduct this debate having first adopted the preservation of social security
let us move to the discussion on how we shore up and maintain and strengthen social security but not in ways that would cause massive additional borrowing massive benefit cuts
vote no on the previous question
mr speaker by direction of the committee on rules i call up house resolution 154 and ask for its immediate consideration
mr speaker as a member of both the committee on rules and the committee on the budget i am pleased to bring this resolution to the floor for its consideration
this rule provides for 5 hours of general debate with 4 hours equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the committee on the budget and 1 hour on the subject of economic goals and policies equally divided and controlled by the gentleman of new jersey mr saxton xz4003590 and the gentlewoman from new york mrs maloney xz4002510 or their designees
this rule makes in order four amendments which are printed in the committee on rules report accompanying the resolution
it also permits the chairman of the committee on the budget to offer amendments in the house to achieve mathematical consistency
the committee on rules has allowed substitute budgets to be considered on the house floor
since before my time in this body the committee on rules has consistently afforded the minority the opportunity for its alternative to be heard with the only exception being the fiscal year 2003 budget when there was not a budget alternative offered
i am pleased this rule provides a chance for all our members to express their views on how our nation should prioritize its spending
we continue the multiyear plan to enable the military to fight the war on terrorism now and to transform itself to counter unconventional threats in the future
i am proud to be a member of the committee on the budget that this year reported out a historic budget that sets in motion a glidepath to cut the deficit in half both in dollars and as a percentage of gross domestic product in 5 years
the committee on the budget calls for a reduction in total nondefense nonhomeland security discretionary spending
more than half of the government s spending today is on automatic pilot
congress is on its way to losing control over spending priorities as entitlements squeeze the budget more and more
i am proud of the work the committee on the budget has put forward this year
mr speaker i am pleased to yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from west virginia mrs capito xz4000610 my distinguished colleague on the committee on rules
mr speaker i appreciate the concern of the ranking member of the committee on ways and means in regard to the alternative minimum tax
the gentleman will be delighted to learn that this budget makes accommodation for a further amt extension of relief so that middleclass americans are not impacted by that amt provision that originated in the committee on ways and means
the gentleman from new york will be further delighted to know that the budget process allows the flexibility and the discretion for that authorizing committee to make those changes rather than having the committee on the budget direct them for them
mr speaker i yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from california mr dreier xz4001150 chairman of the committee on rules
but coming back to the rule on the budget which is the order of the day it is also good to know that it is more about what reforms we will be taking up later this year are dominating the discussion which i take to mean and assume to mean that the overall and underlying budget itself is a sound one and that the rule is fair
there will be that opportunity this being the rule on the budget but i will engage in a bit of discussion about the social security because i am one who will gain or lose a great deal being someone who will reach that retirement age at that year of insolvency
we can argue over months and weeks all day long but the point is we are not doing anything to take care of that firstyear teacher that firstyear firefighter that firstyear soldier that all of us stand up on a regular basis and claim to speak for
it allows members like the gentleman from new york mr rangel xz4003330 on the committee on ways and means to best formulate those revenue measures that avoid amt taxing that allows members of the committee on energy and commerce to deal with the issues facing medicaid program which all of the governors acknowledge is swallowing up state budgets that allows the committee on agriculture to fund within their committee s jurisdiction those savings in a variety of programs
in fact it is the rule on the budget blueprint for this country for fiscal year 2006 a budget blueprint that does a number of things important to the american people
it puts our soldiers and sailors and airmen and marines and coast guard and reservists and guardsmen foremost fully funding the president s defense request budgeting for the continued global war on terror to the tune of 50 billion prioritizing even making tough divisions something that we are loathe to do often in this process but it is what we are here for making tough decisions about priorities priorities in government priorities in households priorities in our individual lives something every american is accustomed to
it directs the authorizing committees to find savings on the mandatory side of spending discretionary being just over a third of the budget anymore mandatory nearing two thirds essentially on auto pilot
we have led with our chin on this issue and i am very proud of that effort and i am proud of the manner in which we have conducted this debate because it will undoubtedly be an extensive debate occupying a good part of the 109th congress
it is an opportunity for this congress to lead to lead the american people to an understanding of an issue that is at a total insolvency point occurring in 2042 but its impacts on the federal budget beginning as soon as 2008
res 95 the speaker shall declare the house resolved into the committee of the whole house on the state of the union for consideration of the bill hr 1330 to provide that social security contributions are used to protect social security solvency by mandating that trust fund monies can not be diverted to create private accounts
general debate shall be confined to the bill and shall not exceed one hour equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the committee on ways and means
4 if the committee of the whole rises and reports that it has come to no resolution on the bill hr 1330 then on the next legislative day the house shall immediately after the third daily order of business under clause 1 of rule xiv resolve into the committee of the whole for further consideration of that bill
mr speaker i yield back the balance of my time and i move the previous question on the resolution
the president is talking about relieving the tax burdens of working americans and yet there is no provision at all for the alternative minimum tax that is going to grab the middle income people with a tax that they do not deserve and the committee on ways and means and this congress never intended that they have to carry this burden
i am glad that the gentleman from iowa chairman nussle saw fit to put the 50 billion in because it is an indication that they know that a war is going on and i only wish that they would put something in there to help those veterans that are fighting the war
it just seems to me that it is up to us to make certain that we still work for a bipartisan solution and if the president does not believe that his personal and our private accounts are going to help us in resolving this problem then for god s sake let us get on with social security and with the help of the gentleman from california mr dreier xz4001150 a personal friend of the president who listens to him tell him we agree with the president that if it does not solve the problem get out of the way and let us together republicans and democrats solve this problem
what message are we sending about this house when we cut more than 5 billion from farm and nutrition programs slashing the food stamp program that so many americans depend on to feed their children
in 5 short years paying the interest and this is so important i want to repeat this by 2009 the interest that we pay on the nation s debt will cost by itself more than all the domestic nondefense discretionary spending combined
simply put for every dollar we could be spending on roads and schools and putting more cops on the street fifty cents of it will be passed on to foreign countries to finance the deepening debt with which this majority continues to encumber us
that is on top of the debt we incurred earlier today of 80 billion that we are hoping the chinese will finance
i call on any member of the majority to stand here today and tell me we will spend just 50 billion and 50 billion alone next year
rather than show the true cost of their budgetary unmindfulness the majority has chosen to conceal from the public the true cost of their plans and as they prepare to pass this resolution and further cripple the financial viability of our nation the real knockout punch looms on the horizon
social security privatization while not detailed in this budget would have disastrous longterm farreaching impacts on the budget
therefore at the end of this debate i will be asking for a no vote on the previous question so that we can consider legislation by the gentleman from colorado mr salazar xz4006201 our colleague that will prohibit the use of the social security trust fund to pay for the administration s illadvised private accounts plan
whether my friends on the other side of the aisle want to admit it or not the administration plan to divert social security payroll taxes to private accounts will cut future social security benefits and make it nearly impossible to meet the future needs of so many americans
mr speaker i yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from new york mr rangel xz4003330 the ranking member on the committee on ways and means
a retirement fund that relies on the stock market is simply not a secure benefit
i urge my colleagues to vote no on the previous question so that we can protect the retirement security of every american
let me first pay tribute to my good friend and colleague the gentlewoman from florida ms roslehtinen xz4003440 for her work on this resolution and for her outstanding leadership on our subcommittee on the middle east and central asia
i remember going to the bekaa valley to the city of baalbak where among the ancient roman ruins shakespeare was performed on alternate nights in english and french
these crimes have taken place on the soil of what was once the arab world s lone democracy
mr speaker on that i demand the yeas and nays
i for one would admit i personally do not know what is best for the lebanese and the syrians the iraqis or anybody else in the region but i would argue the case that traditionally in this country up until probably the past 100 years we took a different position on foreign policy
the other thing that concerns me is that we lose credibility when we talk about what we want and what we will impose on other nations because when we are claiming that the lebanese can not possibly have elections with the presence of foreign troops at the same time we daily hear the bragging about the great election in iraq where we had these 140 000 troops and total martial law in order for an election to take place
they have had elections going on for you in lebanon without any violence directed against syrian troops as we see daily in iraq
in his memoirs he admits it was a serious mistake and we ought to take advice from ronald reagan on what he said about his misadventure in lebanon
in iraq in january of this year there was some polling done an expression by the people on what they thought about foreign occupation
and we have way too many entangling alliances making these huge commitments which will come to an end not because anybody is going to pay much attention to what i say but they will come to an end because this country is on the verge of bankruptcy
mr speaker i ask unanimous consent that all members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on h con
house concurrent resolution 32 builds on recent developments and calls for the president to instruct the us permanent representative to the united nations to present and secure support for a security council resolution classifying lebanon as a captive nation
calling for syria to depart from lebanon once and for all is in keeping with the post911 approach of forcing terrorists out of their caves and placing them on the run
the us position on syrian withdrawal forces the terrorists to retreat to their own soil and in doing so it seeks to limit their impact so that freedom and democracy can flourish once again in lebanon and throughout the region
mr speaker i would like to thank yleem poblete and paul ostburg sanz long and dedicated hardworking members staffers on our committee on these measures and the work of the subcommittee on the middle east and central asia
thanks to the cooperation of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle we are able to send a clear and unified message to both the syrian oppressors and to the lebanese people
this is one of the alternative energies and it has a direct effect on the working people of this country
slashing medicaid will have a devastating impact on the most vulnerable in our society
this growing debt will be passed on to our children and grandchildren leaving them to shoulder the burden of our fiscal irresponsibility
this budget cuts critical programs that working families depend on like medicaid education community development and veterans health care
i urge my colleagues to vote no we need a plan that is fiscally responsible and will fund the programs working families depend on
this assistance includes information on application and bidding procedures farm managements and other essential information to participate in agricultural programs
i urge my colleagues to vote yes on the butterfieldscottbaca amendment
this funding is given out on a competitive basis to hispanic serving institutions for agricultural research
i urge my colleagues to vote yes on the bacahinojosa amendment
i certainly think that of all the discussions we have had on this floor everyone on both sides of the aisle has nothing but the best intentions and i respect that
i think that we can do this on a voluntary basis give our producers the right to put the label that they wish as far as the origin of their product on their product and put it on the grocery store shelf and see what happens
we have no indication that just labeling the country of origin makes a significant difference in the marketing of these products and i think it is an unnecessary extra layer of regulation that we are about to put on an industry that many times has a very difficult time staying in business anyway
i rise in opposition to this amendment and recognize that everyone on both sides of the issue has nothing but the best of intentions and certainly wishes the industry well and especially our grassroots producers
but i still would encourage a no vote on this amendment and look forward to seeing this issue at some date maybe long after i am gone from this place resolved because it has been around a long time
we have seen the results of this corrupt system and the willingness of our own government to allow the pharmaceutical industry to continue to rob our own people and it goes on and on and on
we just had a big debate on whether or not to label meat and where it comes from
but when you are on the payroll of these companies folks just kind of seem to have a little trouble saying this is a terrible drug and we do not want to put it on the market
mr chairman if this body is going to do anything to serve the public health and welfare of our people on this day we should pass this amendment and i thank the gentleman from new york for courageously bringing it to the floor of this house
mr chairman i rise in support of the cbc budget a commonsense framework that embraces our values that focuses on fiscal discipline and that invests in our nation s future
and we keep our commitments to our nation s farmers who are depending on us to keep the promises that we made in the 2002 farm bill
i particularly appreciate the work done by the democrats on the committee to deal with the environmental priorities of america
but unfortunately this budget would turn its back on that responsibility
by continuing to focus on tax cuts for those who need them the least
this is unnecessary and frankly dangerous as we continue to create an abyss between the haves and havenots in society and are putting our financial markets on edge by borrowing trillions from foreign investors
madam chairman i appreciate the gentleman s courtesy in permitting me to speak on behalf of this bill
the congressional consideration of the interior appropriations bill should be one of the highlights of this congressional session as it touches on things that are near and dear to people s hearts clean water vast open spaces environmental protection even opportunities to invest in the arts
in the year 2000 as the gentleman from washington mr dicks xz4001090 my friend mentioned he was integral to fashioning an important compromise that gave flexibility to the committee on appropriations
this bill shortchanges education programs and imposes a burden on our college students
while over 600 000 oregonians are without health insurance this bill essentially eliminates many of the safety net clinics and community health centers on which uninsured people depend
mr chairman i want to thank the gentleman from iowa mr nussle xz4002980 for his hard work on this budget and for yielding me this time to talk about his budget and this alternative
after holding the line on that category of spending at almost no growth in the last budget year we hope to do even better this year and actually have a reduction of 1 percent below last year s spending
that does put us on a path to cutting the deficit in half within 5 years
i urge we move this budget forward today we do the tough things in discretionary spending and mandatory spending it asks us to do that we defeat the substitute and get on with our work
i would also like to thank the staff for working on this
i want to take a moment to mention some very important names who have worked on this bill sometimes day and night and on weekends as well martha foley of the minority staff and maureen holohan leslie barrack and jamie swafford of the majority staff
in addition i want to thank our detailee tom obrien and walt smith from my personal staff and of course my distinguished clerk martin delgado who does a fabulous job on this bill
i also want to take a brief moment to recognize joanne perdue who worked on the committee for several years and retired from the committee just this past month
mr chairman i would also like to point out just in very broad terms that this bill takes care of a lot of issues that are critical not just to agriculture producers but to consumers in terms of food safety research projects that are going on in every state in this nation
a lot of people go to the grocery store mr chairman and they see that big truck pulling up in the back of the store and unloading goods that are put on shelves and in the freezers at the local grocery store and their products that are sold at a high quality for a good price
quite frankly most americans do not know all of the policy and all of the research and all of the hard work that goes into putting that product on the shelf so that americans can go into the store use those coupons and enjoy themselves and the quality of life that it brings to americans all across the country
madam chairman the gentleman has worked very hard on this project and at this time as chairman i would like to commit to trying to resolve this problem to his satisfaction between now and the conference
so let us keep this funding moving forward and i ask for members support on this amendment
madam chairman the gentleman has worked very hard on this important issue which is very important to students around the country and we would be happy to accept the amendment and move forward and move it to a vote if the gentleman would like
and the list goes on
mr chairman i am offering this amendment as part of the agreement that i referred to earlier with the chairman of the committee on agriculture
that is what the amendment does and it is paid for by increasing the limitations on the conservation security program the wildlife habitat incentives program and the farm and ranchlands protection program
mr chairman this is a good amendment that the gentleman from arizona mr pastor xz4003100 has worked very hard on for some time and the gentlewoman from connecticut ms delauro xz4001030 is offering on his behalf and we are happy to accept the amendment
mr chairman i reserve a point of order on the gentleman s amendment
let me point out that the gentleman from kansas is not only working hard on this particular issue but he is a key player on agricultural issues that we deal with on a daily basis here in washington
i am not only on this issue but whatever issue the gentleman brings forward we are ready and willing to discuss work with and solve problems with him
mr chairman reserving the right to object i ask unanimous consent from this point on debate on this amendment be limited to 30 minutes with 15 minutes allotted to the gentleman from montana mr rehberg xz4003350 and 15 minutes allotted to myself who will rise to oppose this amendment
this is an issue that many of us have been working on for many years
this is also an issue for anybody who believes that grocery stores and retailers are part of americana in this country and they would rise in strong opposition to this amendment because there is a liability in the countryoforigin labeling that would in essence make your friendly corner grocery store liable for trial lawyers to come in and say you did not put the fact that this calf may have been born in one country processed in another country and now on the meat counter in your local grocery store
i realize there is an intent by this countryoforigin labeling provision to mandate that these labels be put on products
nothing could be more anti free enterprise than to mandate labeling on a product
if consumers want this they will ask their retailer to put it on the product so they can favor that product over another
there are dozens of cosponsors on the bill
many of us have been working on that for a long time and we hope that this provision that i have put in this bill remains by voting no on the rehberg amendment
mr chairman i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from virginia mr goodlatte xz4001540 the distinguished chairman of the committee on agriculture
mr chairman i ask unanimous consent that debate on this amendment and any amendments thereto be limited to 30 minutes to be equally divided and controlled by the proponent and myself the opponent
mr chairman i ask unanimous consent that debate on this amendment and any amendment thereto be limited to 30 minutes to be equally divided and controlled by the proponent and myself the opponent
the gentleman from new york mr sweeney xz4003930 for whom i have a great deal of respect has worked on this issue for some time
accordingly the committee rose and the speaker pro tempore mr king xz4002201 of iowa having assumed the chair mr ryan xz4003522 of wisconsin chairman of the committee of the whole house on the state of the union reported that that committee having had under consideration the bill hr 2744 making appropriations for agriculture rural development food and drug administration and related agencies for the fiscal year ending september 30 2006 and for other purposes had come to no resolution thereon
let me if i might focus on another area of concern that the prior speaker just talked about and that is commitment to our nation s veterans
let me touch on mr chairman what we have done under the gentleman s leadership this year in the veterans line items of the budget
as you can see from this chart this is the overall spending on veterans programs over that period of time from 1995 to 2005
so as a result of the hard work of the veterans and the committee on the budget we have increased from the president s baseline by 877 million which in these difficult fiscal times is a 28 percent increase
if you recall the president assumed copayments on drugs and an enrollment fee
but the chairman s mark because it is so much lower going from 424 million to 155 million i believe working together in the committee on veterans affairs with the committee on the budget that we can in fact look for waste fraud and abuse and eliminate those types of things without having to have an enrollment fee without having to have drug copayments
mr chairman i thank the gentleman from south carolina mr spratt xz4003860 for his leadership on this budget matter
our men and women that serve this country are putting their lives on the line and what are we doing
i say that president bush s budget and the house republican bush budget should be dead on arrival
i said that bush s budget and the house republican budget as it relates to veterans should be dead on arrival
on top of all of this this budget tells the veteran s affairs committee which i am on to find 800 million in cuts over the next 5 years for savings
and unlike the republican s it does nt balance the budget on the backs of the veterans the homeless seniors and the poor
i would like to thank mr watt and mr scott for their hard work on putting the cbc alternative budget together
if we do not take care of our veterans now we will not have the boots on the ground in the future to respond to any attack against us or our allies
the american legion appreciates your leadership and the hard work of your colleagues on behalf of america s veterans and their families
res 95 includes instructions to cut spending on mandatory veterans programs such as disability compensation by 798 million
mr chairman i want to congratulate you on this budget
that is what you hear on this house floor is demagoguery and that is completely unfortunate
in establishing priorities of care for veterans health care this congress also believes that the same military values that guided servicemembers on active duty should define how services and assistance are provided to them as veterans
this budget takes into consideration the present budgetary constraints the aging veteran population as well as the influx of veterans into the system as the nation continues to fight the war on terror throughout the world
as chairman of the committee on veterans affairs i seek an increase in 126 million for the medical and prosthetic research projects above the president s budget request
we increase about 300 million discretionary funding for veterans health care despite the demagoguery you will hear from some members on this floor
but while our greatest attention should be focused on those who have served us and can no longer fend for themselves there is another group of veterans that needs our help our soldiers sailors airmen and marines who need assistance in returning to the workforce or entering the workforce for the first time after serving their country
the gentleman from iowa mr nussle xz4002980 as chairman of the committee on the budget has done an outstanding job
some may forget the meaning of the attacks upon our country on september 11
the spending on veterans continues to increase maintaining our commitment to veterans in america
on this chart it shows what happened under the democrat control of congress
to my colleagues on this side of the aisle do you see this
you did not hear demagoguery on the house floor
what you had at the time were individuals on both sides of the aisle working together in a bipartisan fashion with regard to how we deal with veterans
he has challenged those of us who serve on the committee on veterans affairs
i would also like to begin by thanking the people who have worked so hard on this bill especially the gentleman from north carolina mr taylor xz4003981 who has been very thoughtful about the payments in lieu of taxes issue and has worked well with us in the past
mr chairman i wish to speak very briefly about an aspect of fiscal responsibility the rule called payasyougo because there is a connection between our lack of fiscal responsibility and these draconian cuts we are seeing in vital services like the 20 billion that people who are poor and dependent on medicaid will be forced to endure
in fact they just denied the house the ability to vote on such a proposal offered by the gentleman from tennessee mr cooper xz4000810 and the blue dogs
this amendment is an attack on the moratorium and an attack on the rights of coastal states and local governments to raise legitimate objections to offshore development that affects their coastlines
we already know for instance that 81 percent of the nation s undiscovered economically recoverable natural gas on the ocs is located in the central and western gulf of mexico where drilling is currently allowed and underway
the clean water act requires the environmental protection agency to issue permits for all sewage treatment plants that will protect water quality in the chesapeake bay and its tributaries yet the epa routinely fails to include restrictions on nitrogen pollution in these permits
the epa has not updated the standards on nitrogen pollution in almost 20 years
i believe that it will not only benefit my district but also the agricultural education and production of our country on a whole
mr chairman i thank the gentleman for yielding time and i thank the gentleman from texas for his leadership on this very important issue which i think is one of the most important issues that our nation faces in the long term
every single year we spend federal money on emergencies but we never budget for them
it makes all of us more accountable because it has mechanisms on how we can enforce the budget which i think is the least we can do is pass a budget and stick by it and do what we say we are going to do to the american people
it starts the process of moving from the measurement of success on how much we spend to how well we spend
this budget gets us on the path of being able to meet those challenges in a very responsible way
secondly it keeps our nation s promises to our veterans and provides the equipment and materials needed to support our men and women on active duty
we restore fiscal responsibility by closing tax loopholes and eliminating the repeal of the limitation on itemized deductions the phaseout of personal exemptions scheduled to take place between 2006 and 2010
mr chairman our colleagues on the other side are fond of talking about supporting and respecting our troops but they do not put their money where their mouths are
the president also proposes to increase fees and drug payments on veterans
the president on the other hand has increased funding for pell grants by taking needed funds from programs such as the school lunch program for lowincome children
on the other hand the cbc budget increases funding for programs that benefit rural communities by more than 3 billion
mr chairman in this budget we maintain tax cuts for wage earners making less than 200 000 a year and we roll back cuts on the top 2 percent of americans and by doing so we have saved almost 47 billion that we have used to invest in the human assets of this country the american people
mr chairman i would like the record to reflect my views on the horrendous and deliberate deficits our nation faces these articles appeared today in roll call and last week in the new york times
rescission time in congress president bush regularly calls on congress to restrain spending
all he has to do is persuade republicans on capitol hill to go along
this law gives mr bush more power than he has sought for his battles on trade promotion or new federal judges
with it he can pick his targets put fasttrack pressure on congress to respond and win by gaining a simple majority approval in other words rescission is filibusterproof
why has mr bush kept this knife in a dusty drawer especially given the staggering deficit his public stance on the need to curb spending and his close ties with the republican congressional leadership
the missinginaction president today congress will vote on a 5year budget for the nation
the house republican budget is based largely on the president s adding a tiny bit of compassion and 50 billion for the war
bush may be a strong leader in the war on terrorism but on budget deficits he is missinginaction
democrats are accustomed to republicans routinely violating their termlimits pledges and forgetting their contractwithamerica idealism including the balanced budget amendment but republicans are doing serious damage to the nation with their irresponsibility on budget issues
jim cooper a democrat from tennessee serves on the house budget committee and as cochair of the blue dog coalition a group of democratic fiscal and defense hawks
we are simply reducing the 23 million increase that they would receive under this bill and instead directing a portion of those funds back to local counties where every dollar will make a real difference on the ground where people live and where they work
so i would like to thank the gentleman from utah mr cannon xz4000590 the gentleman from west virginia mr rahall xz4003310 and the gentleman from colorado mr udall xz4004131 for cosponsoring this amendment as well as the national association of counties the gentleman from arizona mr flake xz4001340 and other members of the western caucus for the leadership that they have shown on this issue
a usda approval stamp only appears on meat products which have been transformed into a graded cut
as a housewife and a mother i would gladly pay a few extra cents on every pound of hamburger or on every pound of beef that i buy if i knew that that beef was produced in the united states because i would have a sense of safety that my family was eating meat that was inspected because all american beef is inspected
essentially a shipment such as ground beef could be imported into america from a foreign country and wind up on a family s dinner table having never been inspected by american authorities
as a member of the joint economic committee i rise today to speak on the economic policies of the budget resolution
to pay for its misguided policies the house budget resolution cuts nondefense discretionary spending by 12 billion below the amount needed in fiscal 2006 just to maintain current spending levels and it cuts spending on mandatory domestic programs by 8 billion
while little good can be said about the bush administration s budget it at least provides detailed information on the programs it seeks to cut
in contrast the spratt alternative budget as well as the congressional black caucus alternative budget that we will consider tomorrow focus national spending on priorities that benefit all americans and get us on the road to economic recovery
it will get our country on the road to recovery while funding meaningful national priorities for our children for our seniors for our veterans and for our communities
the congressional black caucus budget will also restore funding for veterans health care rather than imposing new copayments on them for essential services and prescription drugs
in the end one can only conclude that the republican budget balances itself on the backs of americans who can least afford it
i will work with the gentleman on that as well
i do not know if you have ever come to long beach you better bring kerosene with you if you go on our beaches
a lot of our friends on the other side of the aisle will talk about benevolence and their belief in families and families having strong values and yet they will vote tomorrow night to cut child care assistance
a lot of our friends on the other side of the aisle will talk about cutting taxes and yet they will vote tomorrow night to raise taxes on people receiving the earned income tax credit
a lot of our friends on the other side of the aisle will talk about their commitment to housing and then they will vote to eliminate one of the most effective housing programs in this country
and finally a lot of our friends on the other side of the aisle will talk about their commitment to children and helping families raise their children with the right values and then they will vote to freeze or leave virtually frozen child care services and day care services
we ask them to give up so much in this budget and there is an irony because we have heard it said by the chairman and various other members on the other side of the aisle we have heard it said that people want these tax cuts and they will trade these programs off for the prevalence and the prevailing of these tax cuts
the truth of the matter is nobody here on the floor of the house knows what the risk is if you drill
this degradation will have a tragic impact on military and civilian aviation which contributes significantly to our national defense and our economy
and turning our backs on that now as this budget does is not only bad policy it is immoral
let me also compliment the chairman on doing the very best with limited resources in this bill
when i chose to sit on this subcommittee 9 years ago i did so because i believed that the issues overseen by this subcommittee are core responsibilities of the federal government
another area that i have spent time on is determining how we can best secure our food supply something in which every american has a stake
in addition urban areas like new haven rely on feeding programs for women infants and children for schools for seniors and for some of the disabled living on the edge of poverty
we should remember that the farm programs and the international trade promotion and advocacy that help our farmers across the country and sell our products have profound implications on our nation s overall economy and our quality of life that research programs at usda are critical to our efforts to protect our agricultural plant and animal products our environment and our public health
fda oversees some of the most critical products that our citizens rely on every single day
on that same topic i thank the chairman for working with me to include funding to double the annual funding for review and directtoconsumer ads by fda as well as another 5 million for drug safety at the fda
in 2001 the drug industry spent 27 billion on directtoconsumer advertising but the fda office charged with ensuring that those ads are accurate was funded at less than 1 million 884 000 to be precise
i find it unfortunate the bill includes a 1year limitation on implementation of the country of origin labeling for meat and meat products
i believe it is a mistake to not move forward on implementing country of origin labeling
on international food aid the subcommittee bill restores 222 million of funds under public law 480 that the administration sought to move to usaid and i thank the chairman for preventing that move
really what should be happening is fda should be coming to the congress for authority in order to be able to change the labeling that in fact ultimately protects the public interest and that we ought to have the opportunity and they ought to come and demand from us authority in order to do postmarketing surveys about the risks of some of the products that are on the market
madam chairman i would like to inquire about how much time is remaining on both sides
madam chairman as we conclude the general debate i wanted to reiterate that it has been a pleasure to work with the gentleman from texas chairman bonilla on the bill
also of concern to me is the 1year limitation on implementation of country of origin labeling for meat and meat products
overall i think that the committee can feel good about the work that it has done on this legislation thus far
i would hope that with regard to the food and drug administration that in fact we will be able to provide them with the authorities that i think the nation would believe that they desperately need and that is to be able to do postmarketing studies on drug products on the market and also to change labels that would need changing in order to protect the citizenry of this country
we are looking at potentially massive deforestation and we are working hard at the new haven experiment station to cooperate on research on the plant disease before our forests of connecticut are heavily impacted
mr chairman i urge a yes vote on this amendment
some say that if we halt the implementation of the countryoforigin labeling for meat it will allow more time to consider the impact on the food industry
mr chairman i wish to speak on the point of order
in my opening comments i said that i believed that this bill is about what the house of representatives and members who are part of this effort have been asked to do and we have been asked to protect the public interest on a whole variety of measures and in this case we are talking about life and death
i wish that the committee on rules would have made this amendment in order because it is so critical to public safety
i rise to speak on the hinchey amendment to require that the fda stop waiving conflict of interest revelations by their advisors and to start to make an affirmative search for scientists who can give unconflicted advice to this critically important agency
mr speaker to my colleague on the other side of the aisle i just might add that this is the people s bill
i also might say that there has been bipartisan support in the past because together we could come together and increase the opportunity whether it was idea whether it was for lowincome assistance whether it was for education and it was a rallying point on a bipartisan basis to do something for the american people
we are at war with an enemy who threatens us here at home and on the other side of the world
what one wonders do they think that the 671 billion in additional spending that they propose at the committee on the budget markup would do
and i would remind them that the balanced budgets of the late 1990s were passed by republican congresses without much help from our friends on the other side of the aisle
but again so is the idea that raising 3924 billion in new taxes as committee on the budget democrats proposed just last week would somehow help the economy to create jobs
well mr chairman the facts are indisputable democracy is on the march around the world the war on terror is being won the economy is growing jobs are being created deficit projections are shrinking and the looming demographic crises facing social security and medicare are being addressed all thanks to the courage the policies and the leadership of president bush and this republican congress
now this may sound like just a matter of fact but it makes all of the difference in the world in our national parks on whether they can operate properly
the 30 million the gentleman from north carolina chairman taylor has added to the 22 million increase contained in the budget will mean a second consecutive year of very healthy increases in the park service operations budget and i want to pledge to continue to help my chairman to make sure that the park service partnership program stays on track towards better management
i know that many of you are hearing from your state and local officials about the effect this cut will have on plans to construct and improve water treatment facilities
it is gratifying to note that we seem to have come to a consensus on funding on the nea and the neh in that this bill provides level funding compared to this year
i believe we should not spend money at the expense of other indian programs on a historical accounting exercise that can not produce the desired results
again i want to thank the gentleman from north carolina chairman taylor and his great staff led by debbie weatherly for their hard work on the 2006 interior and environment appropriations bill
i also want to commend mike stephens on mr obey s staff and pete modaff of my staff for their part in helping to put together this bill
madam chairman i yield 2 12 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from west virginia mr rahall xz4003310 the ranking member of the committee on resources
i have sensed over the last few years that the battle over this amendment has cooled and we can move on knowing that a healthy majority in the house agrees that these two important programs deserve our strong financial support
this debate presents a good opportunity to make sure our new colleagues understand the importance of this modest federal support and how it has such a tremendous impact on every one of our congressional districts
again i urge a no vote on the amendment
mr chairman i would like to have some time on this side if we could have 5 minutes of the 10 minutes if we could work that out
i believe that on a subject of this importance if we are going to take back this protection that we have had on the books almost for the last 25 years we have to have hearings
so i believe just on process this amendment should be defeated and i would tell the gentleman from pennsylvania that we should take a look at this
our priorities should focus on helping those who need help before we begin to help those who do nt
however although we may not all agree with these concerns one priority which we can all agree on is that we must reduce the deficit
they continue to splurge on our national credit card racking up astronomical bills which our children and grandchildren will be obliged to pay
not surprisingly however many of my collegues have insisted on exempting the billions of dollars in tax givebacks from the paygo rule
yet this budget increases the financial burden on the states
the assault on the environment also continues including a massive unjustified cut to the superfund program
these are just two examples of critical programs this budget neglects and two examples of why i will oppose this legislation and i urge my colleagues to vote no on the republican budget
and while it may be reassuring to some to hear the words of the chairman of the committee on the budget tell us that they like local control of community development block grants they seem to like it 15 billion less than they did last year
the reason we are faced with this kind of challenge as with the other challenges in this budget it does not have anything to do with osama bin laden it has to do with the decisions that were made down the street on pennsylvania avenue and that were implemented by this republican congress
but on the other hand it says to millions of america s veterans that we are going to direct a 14 billion cut in veterans programs over the next 5 years
to a millionaire making every dime on dividend income you can keep your 220 000 tax cut but to a veteran who may be coming back from iraq in fact a soldier today who may be tomorrow s veteran or next year s veteran we are going to make you wait longer for health care in our va hospitals you are not going to get the care you deserve and you earned by risking your life for your country
this budget does not reflect the family values of the american family because the american family respects the service and sacrifice of our veterans not just with speeches on veterans day
let us not just say yes to veterans on veterans day and turn our backs on them on budget day
mr chairman i urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to reject the values of this budget reject the slap in the face of millions of american veterans while coddling the wealthiest in our society who are going to enjoy that 220 000 tax break they are making by their riskless dividend income of 1 million this year
they may appreciate our speeches on veterans day but today they need our vote
vote no on this unfair slap in the face to america s veterans
res 95 includes instructions to cut spending on mandatory veterans programs such as disability compensation by 798 million
the american legion appreciates your leadership and the hard work of your colleagues on behalf of america s veterans and their families
to the working woman i met yesterday who works hard to help troubled youth in my hometown in texas this budget says your housing program will be cut making it more difficult for her to find decent housing on a limited income
yet to the fortunate person who makes one million dollars this year on dividend income this budget says you can keep every dime of the 220 000 tax break you have received recently
if this is a faithbased initiative i would like to know on which faith it is based
they have preached to us for five years the all gain no pain budget built on the free lunch philosophy
vote no on this budget
every day high gasoline prices are hurting good decent hardworking families who are having to cut back on their purchases of food medicine and clothes
and to my friend the gentleman from california mr cunningham xz4000910 i have walked on texas beaches since i was 2 years old and have yet to end up with blackbottom feet because of oil on our beaches
i want to relate a similar problem that we have in my area in michigan not directly in my district but it impinges on my district
but in fact it is going to have serious impact on areas in my district and on surrounding communities
there will be no tax on the land and this results in a good deal of problems that the local communities and state will not have the funds to take care of
i believe it is very important to put a limitation on offreservation gambling and on cases where a tribe moves into an area which is nowhere near its home and claims that to be an area where they can have land placed in trust and they then build casinos and other facilities
in that sense i support the effort to put some regulation on this
i have been involved in discussions with the previous speakers and they have much the same problems we do but i have also discussed it with the gentleman from california mr pombo xz4003220 who chairs the committee on resources and he has assured me and the rest of us that he has a bill that will deal with this problem and that will provide free and open debate on the house floor
in the last 3 years the republican congress has enacted three tax cuts resulting in the three largest deficits in history all the while on top of the record 400plus billion deficits and 24 trillion of additional debt
so if you are going to stay up late at night watching cspan just put it on tivo
after the american people have spoken clearly this congress last year when we voted for this overwhelmingly just as recently as 2 weeks ago 221 bipartisan members of congress sent a letter to the speaker asking for an upordown vote on this legislation
here we have an attempt to make sure that the congress and the voice of the american people is clear on the issue of funding for reimportation and in the dark of night mark my words they will strip this out as they did last year as they did the year before and ground hog day will come to the united states congress
instead of using the money and the limited resources we have to help develop a system to allow for drug reimportation the fda has insisted on using their time and the precious resources of the american people to crack down on elderly americans who purchase affordable prescription drugs from canada england ireland and the rest of europe because they can not afford those medications here
as senator frist would say all we are asking is for an upordown vote and that is what we would like on reimportation
let us listen to the american people to the will of the bipartisan members of congress and allow a vote on this comprehensive prescription drug importation legislation this year
i would like to thank my colleague from connecticut for her leadership on this
it is a real privilege to rise tonight to take on the role of discussing the statutorily required humphreyhawkins side of this debate that is to consider how this budget fits into the overall economic policy of the united states
we have heard so far a very engaging debate and may i say the chairman of the committee on the budget has done an extraordinary job of defending the details of this budget
and even as we have been undergoing a very difficult episode a combination of a slowdown which began during the last administration coupled with the substantial damage to our economy that occurred in the wake of 911 at the same time we have had to take on a war on terrorism that was not of our choosing
we recognize that an uncontrolled deficit can put pressure on interest rates increasing the cost of borrowing and putting the brakes on economic growth and investment
its adoption will signal to the financial markets that a fiscally conservative congress once more is prepared to sally forth to make difficult decisions necessary to control the federal deficit and maintain our economy on a growth path
this budget vehicle provides fiscal discipline that will strengthen investor confidence in the renascent economy and act as a powerful tonic to continue on the path of economic growth
that is the burden on the national economy that the capital markets understand
mr chairman a couple of points i think need to be made in response to the interesting presentations that were made on the other side
first of all on the issue of jobs
we have heard the criticism that our friends on the other side of the aisle try to blame president bush for an economic slowdown that he inherited from the clinton administration that was exacerbated by 911
despite all of the problems that this president inherited the tax relief policies of the past 4 years that our friends on the other side of the aisle are striving to sabotage have helped to restore economic growth and job creation
during 2004 real gdp grew 44 percent the strongest annual performance in 5 years one of the strongest growth performances of the past 20 years belying the glooming forecast we have heard on the other side
the fact is by following on a path of high growth and low taxes we are moving the economy in the right direction and ultimately if we are prepared to put in place fiscal policies that restrain the deficit that will allow us to grow the economy in the right direction
i have heard a couple of extraordinary claims on the floor of the house that we are facing a record debt
our trade deficit is much too high but those who are making these claims tonight perhaps should be questioning whether they supported the clintonera trade policies that this administration inherited and put us firmly on the path to large trade deficits
anyone who has studied this issue carefully has to concede that for the longterm health of the social security system we have a choice of either going forward with a laissezfaire approach that has long been advocated on the other side and ultimately have to see truly draconian cuts as a result or if we act now we can put in place reforms that will allow us to preserve existing benefits also provide a solid retirement for the next generation and do so by improving the rate of return within the social security system
the fact is our economic policies and our economic challenges today are at least partially the result of the gridlock that existed before the last election in which the senate was at least not able to move forward on key issues like a stimulus bill like an energy bill like tort reform that directly speak to our economic health because of the gridlock implicit in the rules that gave the minority a veto over many of these provisions
we continue to grow the economy without raising taxes which clearly is the agenda on the other side raising taxes that would slam the brakes on economic growth
i can think of a lot of things that i would love to spend money on in the federal budget but the fact remains we need to set tough priorities if we are going to get back to a balanced budget
states and local governments rely on federal assistance to help provide a safetynet to these individuals
any cuts to the medicaid program will shift the burden entirely onto state and local governments that are already straining to meet increasing demands on the program and severe budget pressures of their own
many states rely on igts to fund their medicaid budgets
the lowincome and uninsured rely on these hospitals to receive access to needed health care services
and as winter approaches with expected record prices to heat their homes hr 3010 fails to increase funding for liheap home heating assistance which helps keep the heat on for lowincome seniors and children
if passed these amendments will trample on a longstanding bipartisan moratorium on offshore oil and gas development that was initiated by former president bush continued under president clinton and endorsed in president bush s fy 2006 budget
mr peterson s amendment strikes liquefied natural gas lng from the moratorium while mr istook s amendment calls for the entire moratorium in the eastern gulf of mexico on both oil and gas to vanish poof when the united states meets an arbitrary percentage of crude oil imports 667 percent
it is along with recreation the fastest growing sector of the ocean economy according to the president s own us commission on ocean policy s final report
the money spent by tourists pay the bills and put food on the table for the people living in these communities
as for mr istook s amendment we had an opportunity one month ago with hr 6 to set a strong and visionary national energy policy to reduce our dependence on imported oil and yet we did not take advantage of that opportunity
madam chairman i can not accept these amendments because they are shortsighted and fail to uphold decades of bipartisan agreement on protecting our coastlines from oil and gas drilling
in conclusion madam chairman the peterson and istook amendments should be defeated and i urge a no vote on both of them
i want to thank the chairman and the gentlewoman from connecticut ms delauro xz4001030 ranking member for their work on this fiscal year 2006 agriculture appropriations bill
the border program on the other hand has been flatfunded at 50 million for several years
nawqa carries out very important work collecting and analyzing data and information in more than 50 major river basins and aquifers across the nation in order to develop longterm information on streams ground water and aquatic ecosystems in support of sound management and policy decisions
all projects supported by the beif must have a health andor ecological benefit in communities on the us side of the border
mr chairman i want to thank the gentleman from texas for helping put together this package and for all the work that he has done on behalf of the republican study committee and for all of my colleagues there that have worked so hard on this alternative budget
this alternative budget makes some progress toward that end but i again want to stress this is kid stuff compared to what we are going to have to do in the coming years to get a handle on this culture of spending
i had planned to offer an amendment on this subject but i will settle for a colloquy with the chairman of the subcommittee
let me just point on this map again people point to the red stateblue state issue
families have many ways that we can be spending our money on trips on schools on property on houses and fancy cars
but at the end of the day a responsible family knows it has to spend no more than it takes in at the end of the year and must live within its means because if it does not what will the family be doing but simply passing that financial burden on to their children and their grandchildren
i serve on the budget committee and if you ever come to those meetings you will see from the other side of the aisle especially their ways to live within our means is to increase the means by increasing the revenue by raising taxes and they just did it last week again
just like families who have lots of things that we can spend money on congress has lots of things that we can spend money on and if you come to the budget meetings you will see
as a matter of fact if you sat on a budget hearing last year you saw the gentleman from minnesota mr gutknecht xz4001640 who where we put charts up on all the time of these various things spending requests and what have you the gentleman from minnesota asked a question
and we all looked at the chart and there was nothing on the chart because no one ever asks for less money in washington because we know we always spend more
one of the things it does is it limits our spending on nonsecurity discretionary by reducing the spending by 2 percent
mr chairman i make a point of order against section 749 that begins on page 77 line 1 and ends on page 77 line 16 in that it violates house rule xxi clause 2 by changing existing law and inserting legislative language in an appropriation bill
the senate held no hearings insisted on this provision and it was put into law
secondly it imposes unbelievably stringent liability on the retailers and every one of them is writing their own separate set of regulations so that if this law is allowed to take effect and i commend the gentleman from texas mr bonilla xz4000370 for postponing that because we need to have a voluntary system if it goes into effect we are going to have a separate set of regulations for each retailer that farmers and ranchers will have to comply with in order to get their products sold
finally last year i offered in the committee on agriculture legislation to do this the right way to make it voluntary
but i would suggest to the gentleman that he is way way way off on his numbers because there are not 65 000 times 100 or 6 12 million horses dying each year in this country
it will simply stop the proper inspection of these horses which as the gentleman from texas correctly notes will deprive us of a lot of useful information that will be gathered by those veterinarians about diseases and so on that will confront these horses if indeed they do not get properly inspected and they have serious diseases
i did not like seeing ferdinand go to slaughter but ferdinand was sold to a japanese owner and exported not for slaughter purposes but for breeding purposes and later on in japan he was slaughtered
mr speaker i rise in support of the labor health human services and education bill and say i am very proud to serve on this committee
the previous speaker said shame on us
i am proud that we have doubled the funding for the national institutes of health while i have been on this committee
mr chairman i thank my colleague from south carolina our ranking member on the committee on the budget for yielding me time
mr chairman i wish i had enough time to respond to the majority leader s problems with this budget but in all honesty the war on terror we just passed the supplemental that was not part of this budget and most of us in fact i voted for that supplemental because it was the war on terror
medicaid is a success story in this country not a program that belongs on the federal chopping block
as a member of the committee on energy and commerce i can not support this budget resolution instruction to my committee to cut 20 billion outs of medicaid
as this bill moves forward i hope to work with the subcommittee to provide epa funding for a muchneeded study on air toxics in east harris county which lies in the district i represent
in particular the series noted that the texas commission on environmental quality found that folks residing in some of houston s east end neighborhoods experience higher levels of potentially carcinogenic compounds than other areas
for many years residents have had concerns and questions about the quality of the air in houston s east end the potential relationship to local industry and the potential health effects on families
the city of houston partnering with the university of texas school of public health is already working to characterize the science and weigh the evidence on health effects
i look forward to working with the epa on this effort and hope that the appropriations committee will see it fit to include this critical funding during conference negotiations on this legislation
i have been on oil and gas rigs and they have such few discharges into the ocean a medium sized fishing boat will leak more in a year
my constituents feel the same way as i do on this issue
it reined in spending on nonsecurity activities for the first time in a generation
this budget cuts the cops program by 96 percent a program which has put over 7 000 police officers on florida streets
what a great message to send to our troops thanks for serving your country but now you re on your own
mr chairman i was going to stand here and tell you that the republicans are balancing the budget on the backs of the poor but they are not balancing this budget on anyone s backs because this budget does nt reach that far
i urge my colleagues to oppose this damaging and devastating attack on the social welfare of this country masquerading as a budget
mr chairman i would just encourage an aye vote on this amendment
international affairs is up 93 percent agriculture up 165 percent transportation 78 percent education 95 percent and the list goes on and on and on
first i want to congratulate the gentleman from iowa chairman nussle of the committee on the budget for bringing forth to this body a truly historic budget the most fiscally responsible budget we have seen since the reagan era a budget that is serious about protecting the family budget from the federal budget
but a combination of hope and fear has propelled me on behalf of the republican study committee to offer an alternative budget
the hope is as historic as the gentleman s budget is maybe given the seriousness of the challenge we have maybe we can do just a little bit better on spending discipline
and finally it includes a number of enforcement mechanisms to ensure that we can live with this budget that the budget is something more than a suggestion the budget is something more than a goal or an aspiration that it is actually a limit on spending that we draw a line in the sand and say we are going to take this much money away from american families and say this is it we are going to live within our budgets
i believe when the american people focus on social security what they will realize is that government has been part of the problem
finally we believe a budget ought to be a limit on spending
mr chairman growing government and putting us on a path to doubling taxes on the american people meets nobody s definition of fiscal responsibility
mr chairman i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from indiana mr chocola xz4000720 a real leader on budget enforcement in this congress
this is not a debate about how much we are going to spend on health care and education and housing
but those on the other side of the aisle seem to act like spending has nothing to do with the equation in the deficit
we are on an unsustainable growth path on the growth of federal government
now previous speakers i believe have used the term auto pilot that this budget puts the nation on auto pilot
well let me tell you about the auto pilot that their budget puts this nation on
so what that means is we are on auto pilot to double federal taxes on the american family
now frankly on our side we have done our part
we have cut marginal tax rates on the american family on small businesses
now that is five people that could have been on welfare five people that could have been on unemployment
the challenge has been on the spending side
and the list goes on and on and on
and if we do not do this mr chairman we are looking at this future this auto pilot future that i believe is fiscally immoral that will double taxes on our children and grandchildren
in understanding that it is important for us to look back at previous budgets that they have constructed and the effect that those budgets have had on the economy of our country
so they are in complete control of the budget operation how we take in money and how we spend it allegedly on behalf of the american people
so the debate today on this budget resolution is critically important
i would suggest that if the study does proceed it should be focused on new developments and should address the national academy of sciences recommendations
madam chairman first of all let me express my appreciation to the leader on our side on this subcommittee the gentlewoman from connecticut ms delauro xz4001030
this is her first year as the minority rank on this subcommittee and she is doing an outstandingly good job and we all very much appreciate the work that she is doing
the effect of these antidepressants on young folks youngsters teenagers people in their early 20s particularly has been to engender in them a deep sense of depression which in many cases has led to suicide and it has taken us a long time to get attention focused on that problem
now that comes about as a result of the failure of this congress to give the fda the kind of authority it needs to deal with the drug companies and i later in the debate on this legislation will offer two amendments to deal with this problem
for example in the case of vioxx once that drug got on the market and it became clear that people were being injured as a result of exposure to it and the offlabel marketing of that drug particularly once that became clear the food and drug administration was not in a position to tell the drug company that they had to engage in an educational program which would ensure that people to whom the drug would be dangerous would not be using it
they could not order the pharmaceutical company to do anything with regard to the labeling on that drug
so these are some of the major issues that we are facing one of the major deficiencies in this legislation that needs to be addressed and i will be offering two amendments later on in the debate and i hope that the members of this congress will embrace those amendments
mr chairman last night i went before the committee on rules to seek the ability to offer an amendment to the bill today that would have given the food and drug administration the fda two critically important new authorities to improve the agency s drug safety operations
but the committee on rules would not allow the amendment
when the agency finally did have enough data back in 2003 it first sought to hide it but eventually told antidepressant makers that there needed to be a warning on suicide
however it took more than 9 months before that warning was placed on any drug label because the fda had to negotiate with the drug companies over the label s wording
they are also endorsed on a bipartisan basis including by senators charles grassley and thad cochran who have cosponsored a bill that would do almost exactly what i am proposing today
the amendment should have been made in order by the committee on rules and i am asking the house now today to make this amendment in order
we need a food and drug administration that can deal with the drug companies and with the medical manufacturing establishments that it allegedly regulates deal with them in an effective way so that we can have true regulation on behalf of the safety and security of the american people which we do not have today and which this congress has refused to bring about
these antidepressants came on the market without proper careful review and in addition to that they began to be marketed for offlabel uses
they do not have the authority to tell the drug manufacturers that when a problem becomes evident after the drug is on the market that the drug company should at the very least change the label put information on the label that tells people this kind of experience has been shown to happen by this group of people so that people can be warned about it and therefore not be likely to take it and so that doctors can understand that and not be likely to prescribe it
failing to do it almost inevitably is going to cost the lives of tens of thousands of americans because it will not be much longer before we see another antidepressant situation or cox2 inhibitor situation vioxx situation come on the market if we do not change the rules if we do not give the fda the power to deal effectively with these drug manufacturers
after a certain period of time when that drug was on the market it became obvious that people who were taking it were suffering strokes andor heart attacks
are we just going to stand by idly while these circumstances continue to happen while more and more drugs come on the market week after week month after month while more and more people take them without understanding the implications and more and more people suffer even die as a result of that
this amendment needs to come to the floor and this amendment needs to get the kind of attention that it properly deserves on behalf of the safety and security and the lives of the american people and to be adopted
the fda is charged with protecting the public health and to assist with this mission the fda relies heavily on advisory committees composed of outside scientists to guide the agency policy on the safety and effectiveness of drugs and medical devices when questions arise regarding those products
over the past few years the fda has routinely waived conflict of interest prohibitions and appointed scientists with direct conflicts of interest to serve on these critical public panels
just this past april for example the fda convened an advisory committee to examine whether or not to allow silicon breast implants back on the market
ten of the 32 scientists on that panel had direct financial links to the manufacturers of those drugs
last year when there was a huge controversy around the link between antidepressants and suicide especially among young people the fda convened an advisory panel to make recommendations on how the agency should handle those drugs
three of the 11 scientists on that committee had been paid consultants to the manufacturers of those antidepressants
advisory panels on oxycontin oncology drugs even overthecounter athletes foot creams all had scientists with conflicts of interest
almost every advisory committee meeting begins with an fda statement waiving the conflicts of interest of some of the scientists on that panel
if you think that scientists who rely on drug companies for their financial wherewithal are going to recommend that the fda take action that will harm the company that is paying them then you are living in a fantasy world
this statement is laughable on its surface and an insult to the thousands of independent doctors across this country
mr chairman is there anyone on the other side who wishes to speak on the amendment
for anyone to stand on the floor of this house and say that you can not construct a panel an advisory panel to advise the food and drug administration with regard to the safety and security of a particular drug without putting on that panel onethird of the members who are conflicted in their interests who are being paid by the economic entities that are about to be regulated or should be regulated or who have done commercial advertisements for some of those entities that you can not construct a panel without having a third of the members with that kind of conflict of interest is the most absurd statement i think i have ever heard uttered on the floor of this house
no one who is being monetarily compensated by the entity that is being regulated in the case of the drug companies no one who is getting money from the drug companies no one who is on the payroll of drug companies
madam chairman i am offering this amendment on behalf of myself and my colleague the gentleman from california mr baca xz4000090
dozens of studies have demonstrated the significant positive effect of arts education on students academic performance self esteem and behavior and the challenge america grants are an excellent mechanism to bring the arts to students who can greatly benefit from that exposure
overall the conference report cuts education health care and human services by 15 billion from what was spent on these efforts last year
meanwhile republicans will spend 11 billion this week on a capital gains and dividend income tax cut that will provide 53 percent of its benefit to people making more than 1 million per year
their plan spends more on tax cuts this week alone 70 billion than on both the department of education and the department of labor 68 billion for an entire year
for some reason republicans have refused to increase funding for the lowincome home energy assistance program liheap which helps keep the heat on for people who can not otherwise heat their homes in winter
in calculating the deficit house republicans use surpluses in the social security trust funds to offset spending on other programs
democrats on the other hand will be offering an alternative proposal today that reflects the priorities of the american people
i agree with the statements made by my colleague from montana and i thank him for the leadership he has shown on this issue
i encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to stand up for their constituents and vote for the rehberghooley amendment
mr chairman this republican budget conclusively demonstrates one thing that when it comes to audacity our friends on the other side of the aisle have an unlimited supply
yesterday republican leaders including the gentleman from texas mr delay xz4001040 majority leader and the gentleman from california mr dreier xz4001150 chairman of the committee on rules claimed on this floor that the policies adopted by the republican party last year reduced last year s budget deficit by 109 billion
on the republican party s watch the federal government recorded the worst budget deficit in american history 412 billion in fiscal year 2004
i would like to see who is going to vote for the bankruptcy bill when it comes on the floor that want responsible borrowers
our colleagues on the other side of the aisle including my republican friends on the labor health committee claim that there is little they can do to improve the funding levels in this key domestic program
when we started on this budget disaster jim nussle republican leader of the budget committee said this we do not touch social security
the socalled new and improved laborhhs bill is virtually identical to the conference report that the house rejected on november 17 in a bipartisan way
now our colleagues on the other side of the aisle can claim there is little they can do to improve the funding levels in this bill because the fiscal policies they have pursued have put them in a position where we have insufficient funds to fund the priorities of this nation
they want to vote for draconian cuts in april and proclaim that they are getting tough on spending and then 8 months later they want to disclaim responsibility when those cuts are enacted
there are no fiscal conservatives on that side of the aisle i tell my friends of policies that this republican majority and the administration have enacted to deliberately deprive our government of the resources that it needs and that our people know our country needs
and by the way let me also say mr obey xz4003000 had an amendment which was going to give to seniors an additional 6 months to make a determination to figure out this incredibly complex prescription drug bill that we have put on their doorstep and that was rejected unanimously by republicans while it was unanimously supported by democrats
i very much appreciate his service on the bill that he has produced and i support this bill and i appreciate his efforts and the efforts of the gentleman from washington mr dicks xz4001090 the ranking member and the staff on the committee
it has provisions that continue a ban on drilling in most of the outercontinental shelf offshore drilling that could be occurring in the united states of america
yet for more than 30 years this congress each year has perpetuated a ban on drilling in most of those areas
we will have several amendments to address this that are offered on this bill
since i started serving on this subcommittee almost 7 years ago i have fought to end disparities disparities in employment disparities in education disparities in health
fortunately institutions like the institute of medicine of the national academy of sciences have laid out a framework on how to end these disparities
mr speaker this assault on minority serving programs is unjustified and overtly irresponsible
shame on us
the chairman and the subcommittee did the best they could but this is a terrible mark and i urge a no on this bill
i thank the chairman for yielding the additional time and i do rise as well to thank the ranking member for a very creative a very important statement on the alternative budget offered by the democrats and i look forward to supporting that vision that really helps to balance the budget and bring us back on line and also keep us in line with social security which i will discuss does more for education and of course we do not forget the veterans
just as an anecdotal story we were in the committee on the judiciary earlier today looking at the bankruptcy bill and there were several amendments that had to do with veterans catastrophic health conditions and unfortunately in the bankruptcy bill markup we did not succeed in supporting veterans those of us who supported that particularly democrats
i want to spend some time on the congressional black caucus budget and really focus on why this is so very important what it means for us to rise on the floor of the house and to argue a certain focus and i thank the gentleman from north carolina mr watt xz4004240 for leading us in this direction and of course the gentleman from virginia mr scott xz4003632 who will offer this amendment tomorrow
this president and the majority party in this body have spent so much time talking about their record on education and as hard as i try i can not see what they have to be proud of
i hear so much in this body from the majority party about the greatness of our armed forces and their right but again its just empty rhetoric on their part
those brave men and women fighting on the front lines in our war against terror will come back home and find that the republican party looks at them differently once they become veterans
in fact the congressional budget office itself said tax legislation will probably have a net negative effect on saving investment and capital accumulation over the next 10 years while the republican leadership continues its offensive for irresponsible tax policies they allow our national deficit to grow increasingly larger
mr chairman it is very interesting listening to my colleagues make a presentation on their budget
the budget that is on the floor right now does nothing to close the disparities between african americans hispanics and others less fortunate than others in the united states of america
the budget that is on the floor today now supports a trillion dollars plus in tax cuts and does nothing for catastrophic possibilities that may happen such as a terrorist attack
i can not imagine that my good friend on the floor of the house would not welcome the opportunity of putting that interest into the needs of the american people
section 8 vouchers which allows affordable housing for families of four and five and six hardworking americans there are 25 000 people on the list in houston texas alone
millions of people are still on the list because they do not have affordable housing
finally i congratulate the gentleman from virginia mr scott xz4003641 and the gentleman from north carolina mr watt xz4004240 on this budget because it also invests in homeland security
this administration and the majority in this congress promised to leave no child behind but clearly they have reneged on their promise
in the city of houston alone we have 25 000 people waiting on a list to obtain affordable housing
this alternative budget provides 465 billion for veterans funding so that when our brave men and women return home from fighting the war on terror they will know that their nation is ready and willing to take care of them
as the ranking member of the subcommittee on immigration border security and claims i worked with the cbc to get funding for 150 million for immigration and customs enforcement ice agents and border patrol agents truly we are undermanned in this vital sector
i appreciate and applaud their steady stream of ideas and positions on issues we all care about
i appreciate and applaud their steady stream of ideas and positions on issues we all care about
so in connecticut the nea in conjunction with the connecticut commission on the arts has really helped us develop the itineraries that we needed to attract tourism to the small towns with arts institutions or performing groups where the agricultural economy is failing
either inadvertently or otherwise even though we have had bipartisan support for the support of these two navigator positions for the hudson river and the susquehanna the susquehanna was inadvertently not included in report language on page 51 of the report where only the hudson river is indicated
to give my colleagues an example we are now in the throes of more than 100 million in projects as a result of the effort of the navigator position remodeling an old hotel in downtown wilkesbarre on the waterfront that exceeds 24 million in costs riverfront revitalization that is between 25 million and 30 million a program of 10 million of the gis project to include the entire susquehanna watershed so that we can work on water quality problems in that area of the susquehanna river and a project an ongoing project presently of over 30 million to service the combined sewage overflows into the susquehanna river
madam chairman i appreciate the chairman s interest and i will rely on the chairman s good faith to accomplish to that end
mr chairman i thank my colleague the ranking member of the subcommittee on agriculture rural development food and drug administration and related agencies of the committee on appropriations for yielding me this time in support of hr 2744 and i want to commend and thank the gentleman from texas chairman bonilla and his fine staff for their work on this important bill
it has been a privilege for me to have served as ranking member for several years on this subcommittee and i have full confidence that the gentlewoman from connecticut ms i want to take a brief moment today to raise two issues which are part of this appropriations bill and thank the committee for its support
it took us to this new century and millenium to envision a new energy future based on american agriculture
just yesterday producers from around our country displayed a broad array of biobased products here up on capitol hill ranging from everything from trash cans to lubricants to carpeting to new materials to ethanol to soy diesel all from american agriculture as we unlock the mystery of organic chemistry and renewable energy for our future
again i thank the gentleman from texas chairman bonilla for his great composure during committee meetings and his great leadership and also the gentlewoman from connecticut ms delauro xz4001030 and congratulate her for the great job she has done on this bill
i had intended to offer an amendment emphasizing the need for emergency funding and thank chairman bonilla for his work with us on this issue and with respect and appreciation knowing we still have much to work on will not extend floor debate today
mr speaker i thank the ranking member mr obey and i thank him and applaud him for his steadfast voice on behalf of those who need a voice on the hill who always speaks up on behalf of those without a voice
you know mr chairman i think that when you got on to that republican bus and you were trying to find a seat up front for the people s bill a seat up front for education a seat up front for health care a seat up front for human services all the front row seats were already taken
we are going to have another war on our hands
they need to have schools that are not falling down on them
they need to be able to go on to higher education
the committee on energy and commerce has been instructed to cut 20 billion from the medicaid health care program for so many vulnerable citizens
sixtyfour percent of the costs are spent on the elderly and disabled
mr chairman i thank both our chairman as well as the gentleman from virginia mr scott xz4003641 for their leadership on this most important effort
on the war in iraq we have spent 300 billion and the deficit is blooming
support the congressional black caucus fiscal year 2006 budget substitute the congressional black caucus cbc fiscal year 2006 budget substitute focuses on the cbc s agenda closing disparities in america s communities and restoring fiscal responsibility to the federal budget process
in addition our budget focuses on strengthening our efforts at the department of homeland security meeting some of the critical needs of our troops and improving services to our veterans
and while making these important investments in our country s future our budget places a high priority on reducing the record federal budget deficit
all of these funds are spent on other defense items to support our troops homeland security needs and veterans programs and benefits
the cbc budget focuses on closing disparities that exist in our society and investing in america s future
the cbc realizes that these farmers continue to depend on the department of agriculture s loan and grant programs and has allocated funding to modify cuts in agriculture programs that affect minorities
moreover america depends on its first responders federal air marshals and boarder patrol agents the cbc alternative budget ensures that they and our collective homeland security effort receive the resources that are urgently needed to protect the citizens of the united states
mr speaker i rise in opposition to the conference report on hr 3010 labor health and human services and education appropriations bill for fiscal year 2006
on november 17 the conference report was rejected because the bill showed that the republicanled congress was out of touch with the priorities and needs of the american people
the second conference report still underfunds key programs because of the republicanled congress and the administration s fiscally irresponsible budget priorities continued insistence on large additional tax cuts for the super rich and the wars in iraq and afghanistan
although appropriators must make tough choices because of these extraordinarily tight budget constraints programs that help millions of americans should not be on the chopping block
consumers are expected to pay 52 percent more for natural gas 11 percent more for electricity and 24 percent more for home heating oil this winter yet this conference report failed to increase funding for liheap home heating assistance which helps keep the heat on for lowincome seniors and families with children
the country s priorities should be based on the shared sacrifice of all americans not just sacrifices for the poor working class students and seniors
we on the other hand will be presenting a democratic alternative one that does i believe reflect the values and the priorities that we share as americans in this nation
this chart demonstrates the current raid on the social security trust fund under the bush administration
i do not believe and democrats do not believe it is in our best longterm economic interest to be so dependent on foreign interests to be financing these deficits
the president has been out campaigning on a new social security plan lately
i have a great deal of respect for the chairman of the committee on the budget
they also get rid of trio and gear up targeting lowincome students who want to go on to postsecondary education opportunities
as a member of the committee on education and the workforce i am heading to china in a couple of days in order to visit their colleges and universities
while the budget cuts to veterans programs medicaid grants and other important programs represent a very small amount of the overall budget they will make a large difference to the families who depend on them
i would call on the leadership in the house to pull their budget resolution so that we can have an honest debate with honest figures factoring in a realistic cost of the iraq operation
we all know that everything that we purchase in this country has got an energy cost component in it and so when we address the energy issues we know that when we can provide more supply of energy whether it comes from someplace else on the globe whether it comes from the northern hemisphere whether it comes from the united states whether it is renewable energy or whether it is a consumable energy that is at least in theory not renewed all of those things add to the overall size of the energy pie
that has driven up the cost of natural gas in my district and all across this country and put an additional price on virtually everything that we sell and purchase
mr chairman i rise today to urge my colleagues to vote in favor of the peterson amendment to end the 20 year moratoria on natural gas production from the outer continental shelf and gulf of mexico
the agricultural industry depends on natural gas for crop drying irrigation heating farm buildings food processing and nitrogen fertilizer production
this problem is not going away on its own a recent report by iowa state university estimates that farmers can expect to pay 20 percent more for fertilizer this year than they did last year
on one hand electric utilities and other industries have been influenced to move away from using our plentiful supplies of coal and towards the use of natural gas
i introduced that amendment in the committee on agriculture last year
mr chairman i thank the chairman for yielding me time and i appreciate the opportunity to say a few words on this issue
i had some zebra in africa last year and actually it was the best meat i had on the continent
i may be wrong on this i do not think any of the democrats voted for it
but when you look at the context of some of the other programs and you realize this is run by the ncaa the national collegiate athletic association and they are the same people who put on the rose bowl the rose bowl alone generates 30 million in revenue
it is my hope on these 29 programs that are terminated that the local the state level will step in the private sector will step in and a lot of what they are doing are duplicated in other programs
these are programs which i have worked very hard on over the years to try to get into this budget
despite its tightness in some areas mr regula xz4003340 has worked with the committee to put on what i think is a solidly balanced bill and face the economic realities of today with today s budget
in an age including the war on terror this promise to defend america is very expensive
social security recipients used to live when roosevelt created the program an average of only 11 months but now people are on social security on average 22 years
that should not be done on borrowed money on borrowed time
the votes members cast today on this conference agreement and the budget reconciliation later today will show their priorities
do we place more value on tax cuts for the wealthy or the education of our students
i urge my colleagues to join me in prioritizing students wellbeing and vote no on this conference report and on the budget reconciliation package
it is no surprise that the republican budget for fiscal year 2006 is more of the same continued tax cuts for the wealthy paid for by slashing programs that rhode islanders depend on
the loss of federal funding places an enormous burden on states like rhode island by pressuring them to cut eligibility for medicaid
by continuing failed tax policies while cutting effective programs that rhode islanders depend on their proposal is a misguided and unjust starting point
as democrats show it is possible to create a realistic blueprint that is fiscally responsible and builds on the needs of the american people
major cutbacks in the areas of education and health care will have a tremendous economic impact on our nation
while the administration has made it clear that community health centers are a priority to them this bill nearly eliminates the very programs that health centers rely on to recruit nurses to work in areas that are facing acute professional shortages and train medical students to work with underserved populations
this legislation makes it clear that tax cuts for the wealthy will continue to be paid for by slashing programs that rhode islanders depend on
before we voted on this bill in november my constituents told me what was important to them
i believe the public sentiment on these issues accounted for the failure of this bill last month
major cutbacks in the areas of education and health care will have a tremendous economic impact on our nation
res 95 the budget conference report they made it clear that tax cuts for the wealthy will continue to be paid for by slashing programs that rhode islanders depend on
this bill fails to recognize the continued hivaids crisis by freezing funding on virtually all components of the ryan white aids care program except aids drug assistance
madam chairman first of all i want to thank the gentleman from texas chairman bonilla for doing such a great job on this bill and for his hard work leading the subcommittee through a very difficult tight allocation and really coming out with an excellent bill and also the gentlewoman from connecticut ms delauro xz4001030 such a great ranking member and true professional
i also want to express my appreciation to the extremely professional staff that we have on the subcommittee
we all have concerns about how it has been administered and we wanted to make sure that the agency reports to us on a quarterly basis so that we can in fact make sure that that vital program stays in place
let me explain what this extreme restriction on the food and drug administration would do
in some cases waivers are granted only for participation in the advisory group discussion and the individual is not permitted to vote on the advisory committee recommendation
i would also like to draw the attention of my colleagues to the term advisory advisory committees make recommendations to fda but do not vote on product approvals
please vote no on this amendment
they went on to say existing law strikes the correct balance between protecting the government from inappropriate conflicts of interest and recognizing the need for temporary experts who may have unavoidable conflicts in relevant fields of inquiry
i think those concerns are relevant to the hinchey amendment before us and support a no vote on this amendment
from port security to health care the republican budget falls short on every count
on the other hand the congressional black caucus budget shows how national security priorities must include the economic security of all americans
this is the budget we should be voting on
on the other hand the congressional black caucus budget acknowledges that in order to have a strong america we must have all americans who are not vulnerable
that is turning our backs on the disabled
first i want to applaud the gentlewoman from new york ms slaughter xz4003780 and the gentleman from connecticut mr shays xz4003700 who are the cochairs of our arts caucus and their staffs for their leadership on this issue
once more we are forced to vote on an interior appropriations bill that is nothing less than an environmental disaster
the emerald ash borer arrived in north america years earlier so we have a huge job on our hands to contain this insect and stop its spread
i really come today to express my very sincere and deep appreciation to both the gentleman from iowa mr nussle xz4002980 and the gentleman from south carolina mr spratt xz4003860 for the fabulous job they do of working together on behalf of all of us to try to make sense out of our budget process
to say the least the world on both sides of the aisle and across the country would love to suggest that we provide for them every program at a maximum level that they might have on their wish list
as the gentleman from iowa mr nussle xz4002980 suggested i have now the responsibility of chairing the committee on appropriations where as they help us struggle with the budget we spend money that has a propensity to violate that which is their guidelines for sensible budgeting
but in turn over the years as i have observed this process there has been far too little communication that is meaningful communication between those on the staff level but also the professional level within the committee itself between the appropriations process and the budgeteers
i have committed myself to trying to have the committee on appropriations once again be a committee designed to preserve dollars not just spend dollars and indeed if we are successful in that effort we will be in partnership with our budgeteers attempting to make sense out of the budget and eventually balance that budget
and i must say that the committee on the budget has provided guidelines in the past we have not always followed those guidelines
however i wanted to express my sincere appreciation to the gentleman from ohio mr regula xz4003340 the ranking member the gentleman from wisconsin mr obey xz4003000 and their staffs for their hard work on this legislation
while these and other programs are on the chopping block today the bill provides a 10 million increase for abstinenceuntilmarriage programs despite mounting evidence of the scientific and medical inaccuracy of their curricula and ineffective results
as a member of the joint economic committee i am pleased to speak on the economic goals and policies reflected in the budget
we should never build our economic system on a foundation of foreign loans
this would attack all types of invasive species including the sudden oak death the glassywinged sharpshooter but i would like to focus on this terrible asian longhorn beetle which has had a devastating economic and environmental impact in new york state
funding for education health care and lowincome home energy assistance so that seniors on fixed incomes and poor families can heat their homes this winter are not their priorities
i urge a no vote on this bill
funding for education health care and lowincome home energy assistance so that seniors on fixed incomes and poor families can heat their homes this winter are not their priorities
i urge a no vote on this bill
the federal government makes pilt payments to counties that have federal lands to make up for the revenue local governments lose because they can not collect property taxes on the federal lands within their borders
republicans have squandered the surplus forcing america to go country to country in search of money to prop up what can not stand on its own fiscal integrity
as ranking democrat on the human resources subcommittee i asked my staff to examine where past republican practices might be in this politically engineered budget crisis
187 billion is coming out of the committee on ways and means
what in the world is going on
i urge a no on this resolution
studies show tourists spend 7 percent more than their local counterparts on arts events
overall disparity nearly 13 billion people around the world live in poverty and do not have safe drinking water more than onethird of the world s children are malnourished within the last ten years approximately two million children have been killed in armed conflicts many after being forced to be child soldiers many poor countries spend 30 40 of their annual budgets on repaying their foreignheld debt often more than they spend on health and education combined and horrific conditions can lead individuals to become more disaffected and susceptible to recruitment by terrorist organizations
under the republican leadership the entire budget process has become a complete fraud on the american people
firefighters on the front lines of the war on terror in new jersey stand to lose 4 million under this resolution which means they will have less protective clothing fewer portable radios than they need to protect our citizens
what type of values would slash funding to the cop program by 95 percent a program that has put over 4 800 police officers on the street in new jersey
it is not every day that we face such black and white options often the issues we debate on this floor have many shades of gray
when the republican leadership of this congress is content to spend more on tax cuts than on the entire department of education or labor when we can spend 70 billion in tax cuts but can not provide children the access to technology or advanced science and math instruction they need to compete in today s world when we can give millionaires a break but can not provide students even a meager increase in pell grants to help them pay for the rising cost of college when we can shell out billions in tax breaks to oil companies but can not help those in need prepare for what is expected to be one of the costliest winters yet it is clear that republicans have the wrong priorities in mind
vote no on this conference report that shortchanges and unfairly punishes everyday americans
mr speaker i thank the gentleman from wisconsin mr obey xz4003000 for all of his work on the legislation and i thank the chairman of the subcommittee for all of his work
we hear a lot of conversation today here on the floor about national security and not depending upon foreign sources of oil and gas
most of the focus we hear obviously is on the potential environmental impacts and impacts on tourism and all of the environmental things we enjoy along our coasts in florida and in california
we are deeply concerned over the construction of any oil or gas structures that could impact on our critical test programs performed by the air armament center at eglin air force base this is an issue of national security
budget enforcement rules that apply to only certain parts of the budget will not have a significant impact on our rising deficits as federal reserve chairman alan greenspan mentioned in his recent testimony before the house budget committee
additionally the blue dog budget process reform plan would create a rainy day fund for emergency spending which fortyfive states currently have require a roll call vote on any bill calling for more than 50 million in new spending repeal the house rule that allows the house to avoid a direct upordown vote on debt limit increases and require cost estimates by the congressional budget office cbo for every bill that congress votes on
the fiscal situation in our country is now out of control and only tough budget discipline will get us back on track
on february 17 2004 the national debt of the united states exceeded 7 trillion for the first time in our country s history
our current fiscal irresponsibility will eventually land squarely on the shoulders of our children and grandchildren who will be forced to pay back the debt we are accumulating today with interest
this debt tax that we are imposing on our children and grandchildren can not be repealed and can only be reduced if we take responsible steps now to improve our situation
this fiscal year alone interest on the national debt is expected to rise to 178 billion and the administration projects that that figure will increase to 211 billion during the next fiscal year
to put that figure in perspective projected interest on our national debt next year will be 75 billion more than projected spending on education public health health research and veterans benefits combined 138 billion
in addition to assuming an everlarger share of our annual budgets the interest on our debt and the debt itself is increasing our reliance on foreign borrowers which will weaken our position in the world and increase the risk that another nation will be able to assert greater leverage over america
but as much as i enjoyed it i know it left an even stronger impression on the student and the families and friends who joined them
when the nea budget has been cut we have seen its dramatic effect on the national arts community and specifically on arts education programs developing at community centers and in our schools
what has become of us as a country selling these horses off for horse meat to be eaten on the other side of our oceans
there are so many alternatives to slaughtering these beautiful creatures that are on public lands
we are down to 35 000 wild horses on public lands
i first would like to thank the gentleman from texas mr bonilla xz4000370 the chairman of the subcommittee on agriculture rural development food and drug administration and related agencies as well as the gentlewoman from connecticut ms delauro xz4001030 for their leadership in what i know is a very difficult task of allocating funds within the budgetary restraints that we find ourselves
mr chairman based upon previous conversations with the gentleman from texas and the staff of the agriculture subcommittee i am willing to withdraw my amendment under the understanding that we have reached in regard to cooperation on this issue in the future
mr chairman i would ask the members on the republican side of the aisle this evening to find one republican mayor in america one who favors what they are about to do to the community development block grant program
86 on the motion that the committee rise
had i been present i would have voted no on rollcall vote no
mr chairman i yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from indiana mr buyer xz4000560 a veteran and the chairman of the committee on veterans affairs
mr chairman i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from california mr lewis xz4002391 the gentleman of the house who has probably some of the heaviest lifting to do with regard to controlling spending the chairman of the committee on appropriations
mr chairman i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from florida mr mario diazbalart xz4001080 a member of the committee on the budget
we have worked together on a number of issues
but let me give a slightly different tack from what he was suggesting with regard to our record on education because i think it is important for us to see what has come before
first with regard to education totals as you can see we have grown on an average of 9 percent a year for the last 5 years
do the members know what is going on mr chairman
for all of the chest beating about education and the priority see that little red line of the total amount spent on education in our country
we are talking on any given day like about 6 percent
we have got to focus on results in education and this budget accomplishes that
it goes actually back to what the gentleman was saying on education
so the committee on appropriations is the one that is going to make these determinations
and we appreciate that her advocacy and mine is going to have to be brought to bear as we work on that
there are so many on our side including myself and so many others who agree that this is local control local decisionmaking getting this back to communities
but we plussedup the function for cdbg by 11 billion and we increased it for that purpose and we also did not make any assumption with regard to the president s new proposal of the strengthening america s communities block grant or transferring the program from hud housing and urban development to the committee on energy and commerce
the bottom line is there are many things that we will disagree with on budgets and like i said i doubt i am going to get the gentleman s vote but i do think we have a bipartisan commitment to this
it is one area that i know we will continue to work on
and there may be other disagreements but this is an area that we have worked on together
and if you heard the gentleman who just spoke if you wondered whether or not he maybe had been reading the newspaper and may be forgetting all of the things that have been happening to our country over the last going on 4 years you might wonder if anyone has been paying attention because he is correct
on september 10 2001 we were running a surplus
mr chairman first let me say to the gentleman from south carolina mr spratt xz4003860 there is absolutely no one on the democratic side that i admire more than the gentleman and the partnership we have in working on these budgets
we come out here and talk about other people s money very easily on the floor of the house what the taxpayers send us in order to solve problems but we really do need to be mindful of the fact that the most important budget that we ought to be focused on is the budget decided and discussed and sweated over and argued about around kitchen tables across the country
mr chairman 6 cents on every dollar in this country in food stamps is wasted
my favorite saying that i heard on the floor and i do not remember who said it a long time ago if you always do what you always did you will always get what you always got
last year we decided to put the brakes on spending
we said yes we have had the excuse of september 11 of the war on terror of needing to deal with homeland security and needing to deal with our economy but it is time to be done with all of that
and so what we did was we said let us put the brakes on spending just a little bit
that is good news but we need to build on that
what our budget does is it says let us continue to build on that success every year with more and more deficit reduction
we say not only should we hold the line on discretionary spending that is the spending we will argue about every day out here during the appropriations process
the reason is because what we do is we say the committees of jurisdiction in this instance the committee on energy and commerce should be given responsibility to look through the programs and see if they can not only find savings but reform the program to do a better job of delivering the product to the people who need it
we have one budget on the democratic side
we actually i think will have two or three budgets on the democratic side that do nothing with regard to medicaid
let us continue to always do what we have always done and that is continue what has been what some people say is fraudulent transfers that are going on at the state level where governors and state legislators are put in a position where they actually have to figure out how to game the system how to manipulate the system so that they can get more money from the federal government
we should measure it on results
we have heard all the complaints on the floor today
we know the other body left to their own devices may not do it on their own
in addition we have a president who is for really i think the first time since i have been in congress willing to step up during a very challenging time in our nation s history when we are at war and say even though it would be easy to use the war as an excuse and not worry about what is happening on the domestic side the president of the united states has said we are going to control spending work on the entitlement programs and try to reform the programs and to meet the needs out there
i want to speak to that briefly because as congressional watchers may have seen or misinterpreted the intramural discussion that went on and fighting that may have seemed to be happening between friends and colleagues i interpret what the rsc was doing the republican study committee was doing with regard to enforcement to be the exact right attitude to have
i give them much credit not only on the work product of coming forward with a budget but also their desire to enforce it
i commend them on their work product and i reluctantly will vote against their budget
accordingly the committee rose and the speaker pro tempore mrs drake xz4006580 having assumed the chair mr latourette chairman of the committee of the whole house on the state of the union reported that that committee having had under consideration the concurrent resolution h con
mr chairman could i inquire how much time is remaining on both sides
mr chairman we are coming to the end of the debate on the final amendment in the way of a substitute
now maybe my memory is just fading but i am trying to remember back to before the world changed on september 10 of 2001 and we were running a surplus
on september 11 of 2001 we discovered that we were running some deficits that we did not know about because the balance sheet did not give us much perspective on it
because of all of that we have the opportunity in this budget to reduce the deficit and build on the progress we had from last year
and so we are starting on a glidepath reducing that deficit every year
we are talking about a deficit plan that gets us below the rate of growth that we need to get to in order to have a responsible budget and we need to pass this plan and get on with business
if i might take just a brief moment in introducing my first speaker i would like to just say on behalf of our side in particular but i think on behalf of the entire congress we always respect members who go on to bigger and better things and today the president made a wise announcement in nominating the gentleman from ohio mr portman xz4003250 to become our us trade representative
he has been the vice chairman of the committee on the budget and he has been a great wing man and personal friend to so many
mr chairman i am very pleased to yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from ohio mr portman xz4003250 vice chairman of the committee on the budget
and all that is offered on the other side is more money more spending higher taxes more government more bureaucracy more regulation more laws more politicians making decisions that individuals and families and communities should be making for themselves my friends government is growing out of control
our debate should be based on results
we led when we got to a balanced budget in the late 1990s and we will lead again today by passing what i believe is the strongest budget the best blueprint to get out of deficits to make sure that we get results from the programs and the dollars that we are spending and make sure we get back on a path to freedom in this country
madam chairman i rise to speak on the appropriations bill for the department of the interior environment and related agencies
res 95 the concurrent resolution on the budget provides appropriations for most of the department of the interior the environmental protection agency the forest service the indian health service the smithsonian institution and the national foundation for the arts and humanities among others
for the first time the house appropriations subcommittee on interior environment and related agencies marked up a bill with their new jurisdiction reflecting additional responsibility for all discretionary programs under the environmental protection agency and losing some energy department programs previously under their jurisdiction
this measure like government spending on the whole has been drawn up under a tighterthannormal budget constraint
if this provision were stricken because it constitutes legislating on an appropriations bill the measure as reported would exceed its allocation under section 302 b of the congressional budget act
as we enter the appropriations season i wish chairman lewis and our colleagues on the appropriations committee the best in maintaining their admirable pace of bringing bills to the floor
madam chairman i rise to speak on the measure before us providing budget authority for programming by the us department of agriculture and others
res 95 the house concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2006

that is why this house should never have voted to eliminate all taxes on estates of over 7 million
it means more pressure on our national parks
it means more pressure on the part of real estate developers
it means more pressure on our sewer and water programs
i would like to see for instance this bill enable us to buy precious land at pope s creek on the property where george washington was born before a real estate developer can grab it and turn it into condos but we are not going to be able to do that because this bill for the first time in the 36 years i have been a member of this house zerofunds land acquisition programs at both the state and the federal level
madam chairman i do not want to rain on anybody s parade but in a sense i do
what we have just witnessed here is our annual kabuki dance on the question of the arts
i would hope that if the house wants to demonstrate the slightest bit of sincerity on this issue that having adopted this amendment it will stick to it in conference so that something other than a phony kabuki dance has taken place on the floor this year
i know that is quite a bit to expect given the hypocrisy that often accompanies conferences and given the penchant for so many members of either body to try to pose for political holy pictures on some of these issues but nonetheless i would like to express the vain hope that on occasion some sincerity will be displayed on this issue and that if the house adopts an amendment it really means it
mr chairman as i indicated earlier i intend to vote for this bill because i think the gentleman from texas has done a reasonable job given the limitations placed on him by the budget resolution
but those are the main ones that i would focus on at this moment
i will vote for the bill because i think the major fault for the inadequacies of the bill lies with the committee on the budget not with the gentleman who produced the bill
mr chairman i would like to be heard on the point of order
the committee on rules as i understand when they passed out the rule from the committee on rules they did not protect this amendment under the rule
the house can only avoid dealing with this issue if a member chooses to block the house from acting on it
mr chairman i would urge the gentleman from texas to withdraw his point of order so that we can vote on this most crucial issue
this is the day when the price of republican tax cuts for the wealthy becomes quite clear on this bill and on the bill that will follow the reconciliation bill
yet this bill is 15 billion on a programforprogram basis once you cut out the funny accounting this is a bill which is 15 billion below last year
that is 13 billion below the authorization and on a cumulative basis it is some 40 billion short of what we promised we would have provided these past years since we passed no child left behind
education technology cut by 45 percent and that comes on top of a 28 percent cut that was made last year
and i could go on and on
on higher education the college board tells us that the 4year cost of attending a public university has increased by 3 100 over the past 5 years
and we do all of this in order to free up necessary room so the republican party can deliver on its 100 000plus tax cuts for people who make 1 million bucks
what we are going to see today in the reconciliation bill and in this bill is a double whammy on the most vulnerable people in this society
we hear a lot of talk on this floor about preserving life
i urge a no vote on the conference report
what i say is not in any way designed to be an attack upon him or his leadership of the subcommittee but the fact is that this subcommittee has been given an inadequate allocation and as a result this congress is about to make a large mistake if it passes this bill because it will be shortchanging this country in terms of the longterm investments that we should be making in america s working families and programs that are focused on the needs of america s working families
let me make clear this bill is virtually identical to the bill that the house rejected just a few days ago by a 209224 vote on a bipartisan basis
over a 5year period because this sets us on a course over a 5year period if we pass this bill we will wind up spending 15 billion less for programs in this bill than we would otherwise spend if we simply stuck to last year s baseline
they are saying to people on disabilities sorry but you are not going to get your full entitlement in your first check after you are declared eligible for disability right now the law says that if you apply for disability and if you are adjudged to be eligible when you get your first check you will be paid retroactive to the date of application
the bill that passed 2 weeks ago on this floor the reconciliation bill said sorry folks if you are declared eligible you will get only the first 2 months entitlement in that check the rest will be strung out over a period of months the only reason the government saves money under that plan is because people will die before they get what they are entitled to get
so the congress is doing nothing to ease the squeeze on families trying to send their kids to college
and in the reconciliation bill which they passed just 2 weeks ago they are making that problem over the next 5 years 12 billion worse or i am sorry 8 billion worse for those same families by raising fees raising interest rates on student loans
and with the 1 percent across the board that is contemplated that will be on top of this freeze you will wind up actually reducing money for lowincome heating assistance
community health centers everybody on both sides of the aisle talks about how important they are
mr speaker one of the previous speakers on the majority side of the aisle said that we have limited resources we have to make priority choices
i would point out that that 12 trillion is more than five times as much as the federal government will spend by anybody s estimate on repairing katrina
the fact is that this bill fails on virtually all tests
that motion failed on a partyline vote unfortunately on a 77 vote
having said that mr speaker i want to thank the staff on both sides of the aisle for the work that they have done on this bill
mr speaker i assume this is the last time i will speak on the floor before christmas so i want to wish everyone merry christmas and a happy new year and enough blessings so that you will reconsider some of the mistakes in this bill
these cuts are in addition to 11 billion in cuts to medicaid that are included in the majority party s reconciliation bill that may be voted on later today
i happen to be on that side of the issue
we have continually increased our emphasis and our dependence on natural gas and yet our supply has remained stagnant
those living on fixed incomes are being eaten up by these costs
this is the margin that most farmers rely on
pilt was funded at 200 million back in 2001 and is clearly a step backward in a commitment to compensate counties for financial burdens imposed on them through an overwhelming federal presence
there s no getting around the need for some of the basic services that property taxes provide on the local level but there s no excuse for having to pay extra for the honor of having so much nontaxable federal land in our counties
why are we buying more land when we ca nt make good on the commitments for the land we already have
in listening to the debate today on both sides of the aisle there has been a lot of expression of concern about the deficit and of course i am very concerned about the deficit as well
but being pretty realistic i know that is not likely to happen or be offered or even be able to present that on the house floor
not so much embarrassing to me because i am accustomed to voting in a small group of people on many occasions but it could be embarrassing to others because for the most part most members would not even conceive of the idea of having a strict interpretation of the constitution and severely limiting the budget
so we would not want to put everybody on record for that
and it is the philosophy of government and our philosophy on money that encourages these problems
i wish we would all join in acknowledging the great leadership of the gentleman from south carolina our ranking member on the committee on the budget
the list goes on and on and on
and on top of all of that the republican budget undermines the solvency of social security
how on earth are they going to pay the social security trust fund back if they have gone broke on the other side by running up these deficits in the general fund
instead of being a statement of our values the republican budget is an assault on our values
vote no on this budget
this bill turns back the clock on clean water slashing the clean water state revolving fund for the second year in a row
madam chairman i also wish to state my support for the stupak amendment on sewage blending
mr speaker how much longer will it take for the republican leadership to pass this terrible attack on america s children
in just a few short years the gentleman from texas mr hensarling xz4001750 has emerged as a national leader on fiscal restraint in washington dc and it is an honor for me to be associated with his handiwork in support of the hensarling amendment
and the gentleman from iowa mr nussle xz4002980 who history may be calling him to other duties sometime soon will leave a lasting and indelible mark on the budget at the federal level and we are grateful for his principled leadership and support as well
the rsc budget known as the hensarling amendment would provide for needed restraint by reducing nondefenserelated discretionary spending by 2 percent and calling for 57 billion more in savings than the committee on the budget s budget but better yet the rsc s budget would dramatically enhance the possibility that members will adhere to the spending levels set out in the budget resolution by providing bold initiatives in process reform point of order protection forcing congress to define emergency spending and account for it in the budget creating budget protection accounts that would allow spending cuts to be directed toward deficit reduction or tax relief just to name a few proposals
the rsc budget is an opportunity for members of congress to vote for the president s number on defense and homeland security and a little bit less than the committee on the budget s number on everything else
and a day later ralph regula received a handwritten set of instructions about how to build a fence that is on the wall of his office today
they have worked on a bipartisan basis to provide the best bill possible in a bad situation
madam chairman once again i commend appropriations committee members on both sides for their work on this important bill and i urge my colleagues to vote for its passage
mr chairman my amendment will remove the words natural gas from the moratorium that has been in every interior bill i am told for 20 some years unbeknownst to many members of this congress that prohibits the department of interior from leasing or subleasing lands on the outer continental shelf our greatest reserve for natural gas
the production of natural gas on the outer continental shelf is not looked at as an environmental threat by canada they sell us gas that they produce the uk norway australia new zealand all countries with environmental records
if we had an adequate supply it could be the friendly bridge the environmentally friendly bridge to lead us to hydrogen give us time for stronger conservation measures growing use of renewables and less dependence on oil today
as evidence of the virus persistence on june 3 of this year last week the pennsylvania secretary of agriculture announced the discovery of plum pox virus in adams county once again
complete eradication of the plum pox virus on the other hand will allow us stone fruits and nursery industries to continue operating without further impairment by this virus menace
i want to commend the members of the committee on the budget for the great debate that we had over the last month or so i want to commend the members on the floor who have had a great debate here and i want to commend finally the chairman of the committee on the budget
the gentleman from iowa has conducted himself in the committee on the budget and here on the floor through an open honest process where people have had the opportunity to say their peace
i urge a yes vote on the resolution
it raises taxes on the poor
the republican budget on the other hand continues to run up record deficits for as far as the eye can see
mr chairman the budget process provides each party with a chance to put its money where its mouth is to act on the rhetoric we all hear around here year round
we the people is an agencywide program focused on examining and understanding significant events and themes in our nation s history
an additional 5 million will enable we the people to support teacher seminars and institutes with new content focusing on american history and civics media projects focusing on key people and events in american history and preservation projects that preserve and provide access to important historical documents and artifacts that are central to america s historical and cultural heritage
members have had the opportunity to vote on four different blueprints for this nation across the ideological and political spectrum
it does not raise taxes on those same small business men and women who are taxed at the individual rate because they are an s corporation because they are a small business because they are the neighborhood barber or diner or farmer
we lay out a policy that also calls for fiscal restraint and we balance the approach to fiscal restraint on both the discretionary side of the ledger and the mandatory side of the ledger
it is on automatic pilot
yet the new testament is invoked on a regular basis from the other side s talking points to claim that there will be blood in the streets that there will be mass pandemonium and starvation because onetenth of 1 percent of mandatory spending s rate of growth has been shaven off
on the discretionary side we bring eighttenths of a percent cut to programs that have experienced doubledigit increases over the last decade
madam chairman we all recognize that the committee on appropriations must work within the constraints of a budget that is completely inadequate to meet the nation s needs
the effect is that the department of the interior and our other departments and agencies are being put on a crazy fad diet that is harmful to the health of the nation
those monies are indispensable to states across the nation that rely on those matching monies for their parks and recreation budgets
the unspent balance in the fund is approaching 2 billion yet this money from a fee assessed on the coal industry is not being adequately deployed to combat these threats to coalfield citizens and their communities
this is a case of a starving agency trying to survive on the crumbs of a fiscal mess
mr chairman i rise in support of the pending amendment and i commend the gentlewoman from wyoming for her leadership on this issue as well as the gentleman from colorado mr udall xz4004121 and the gentleman from utah mr cannon xz4000590
it is always a pleasure for me to team up with these distinguished colleagues and especially my friend from wyoming mrs cubin xz4000880 on natural resource issues of importance to both of our states
today i find myself the token easterner on the bipartisan cubinrahallcannonudall amendment to restore a portion of authorized funding for the pilt program
i want to remind my colleagues that this particular amendment which is a funding limitation however is still very similar to an amendment that the house voted on shortly before we broke before the memorial day district work period
when americans think of the horse i do not believe they think of it in terms of foreign cuisine on the tables of countries around the european area
there is a lot of talk about moral values that we hear about politically but i do not care what your religious background is there are always these stories about the sick and the poor in need and on the other side the option is for the rich and the greedy and the insensitive
it seems to me that in the final analysis what we have done is borrow money and ask that we make these tremendous tax cuts permanent and whatever our kids get and our grandchildren get will be the debt that this body can possibly place on them
but i do not think that anyone takes this budget seriously not if you leave out of it the alternative minimum tax which no one would want to be able to tell their constituents that this 600 billion tax increase that we are going to place on them that we did not mean to do it and no matter how many cities the president goes to no one would believe that he was sincere about reforming the social security system when he knows republicans know democrats know that it is going to take money to do this and that is not in the budget
but one day just one day historians or maybe our kids and grandkids are going to ask each and every one of us when this country was going into this deficit hellhole and when the poor were becoming poorer and the sick we were cutting their benefits what were you doing and how were you voting and i am glad that we will have an opportunity just not to be able to vote against what the majority has given us but that we have an alternative that the gentleman from south carolina and the minorities on the budget committee and so many others have worked together to say that we are proud to be americans we are proud to be members of congress and we are proud that we voted the right way
mr speaker pursuant to house resolution 559 i call up the conference report on the bill hr 3010 making appropriations for the departments of labor health and human services and education and related agencies for the fiscal year ending september 30 2006 and for other purposes
if you read the literature you find more and more emphasis on the importance of education if a nation is to remain strong if a nation is to provide a standard of living that the people expect that we are used to enjoying in this country
you only need to read tom friedman s book the world is flat in which it is pointed out how much is happening or talk to people that have traveled as is the case of my state superintendent to countries in the far east and realize how much emphasis is being put on education
our authorizing committee i think took a giant step forward on head start in authorizing it to become more than just a welfare program as was originally envisioned but actually providing that people that man the head start program have some experience in education that they do more than teach
it starts early early on and head start is another example of the compassion of america
meals on wheels another example of compassion
i urge all the members before you rush to judgment on this bill realize that we are in this bill doing a lot of good things for american citizens
so again i say think on what the importance is of what you are doing
mr speaker i am pleased to present before the house today the conference report on the fiscal year 2006 appropriations for the departments of labor health and human services education and related agencies
peter drucker who passed away on friday was considered by many to be the most influential management thinker of the past century
many of my colleagues speak with me about the financial demands of special education on their local school districts
mr speaker i yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from georgia mr kingston xz4002210 a member of the committee on appropriations
we could go on and on
i could go on and on about the compassion of this bill in terms of helping people
mr speaker pursuant to house resolution 596 i call up the further conference report on the bill hr 3010 making appropriations for the departments of labor health and human services and education and related agencies for the fiscal year ending september 30 2006 and for other purposes
mr speaker i yield myself such time as i may consume and i would just like to say to my colleagues and friends on the other side of the aisle to take a second look at this bill
that would be a disastrous result that i do not think any of us on either side of the aisle would want to happen
mr speaker i want to say to all my colleagues that this is not something we want to make as a christmas gift to the american people a cr on this bill
but i want to tell you what happened to the earmarked money because we had 1 billion in the bill that originally passed the house back early on
i want to point out to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle that i do not think you want to go home and tell people in the education field that you voted against an increase let me emphasize an increase of 100 million over last year in title i i do not think you want to tell the parents and families of children with special needs that you voted against an increase in special education of 100 million over last year
i hope my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will take a second look at what we have tried to do in this bill
mr speaker i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from new york mr walsh xz4004200 a fellow chairman on the appropriations committee and a member of our subcommittee
when this bill was addressed on the floor in june i spoke of the need for additional rural health care funds and chairman regula assured me that he would consider increasing those funds in the conference report
i appreciate his leadership on this issue
i want to say to my colleagues on our side of the aisle we are not getting any help from our friends on the minority side so i would hope that we will have strong strong support on our side to demonstrate that we can govern that we can pass a very responsible bill with less money than the past because we have managed what we had in a more effective way
i would suggest to my colleagues on this side that we need to demonstrate with a very strong vote that even though our friends on the other side think it is not enough that it is going to have problems involving reconciliation but this is not a ways and means bill this is not a budget bill this is the people s bill with people s programs
that is another topic and people will have their opportunity to vote on that
i want to point out to my friends on the other side that when the republicans became the majority party this bill was 69 billion
today we have billions of dollars spent on these programs
one of the things that causes that i think is inadequate reading programs early on
that is a dramatic commitment on the part of the federal government
and we have tried to make sure that every american every american could be in that frontrow seat on the education bus on the health research bus on the labor department programs for job retraining bus
my colleagues on my side since we can not get any help from our friends on the minority side for whatever reason i have not quite figured that out but i think our members need to strongly support this bill and continue the pride we can take in our accomplishments since we became a majority since 1994 as i have outlined and particularly in the last 10 years
i hope my colleagues on the majority side will come in and vote in a positive way to increase education to increase medical research to increase a whole host of things that will serve our people throughout this land effectively
i find myself in a precarious position because i do support the agriculture appropriations bill and i think the gentleman from texas mr bonilla xz4000370 deserves a pat on the back for the fine work he has accomplished over the last several months in putting this piece of legislation together
the thing we can not kid ourselves about is that the actions that were taken within the committee on appropriations will effectively delay countryoforigin labeling s implementation but unfortunately it probably kills it because there is that attempt that is occurring
labels on the clear wrappers give traditional information about the seafood type and nutritional facts
while the burden of labeling falls on grocers it has not been difficult for the meat department staff to adjust to the change
it is just a matter of putting the sticker on the package he said monday
several customers have already commented on the change allen said
it was interesting to see that japan shut our markets down on christmas eve of 2003 and still have not opened them
i might also point out on may 25 of this year the usda closed its border to cattle from durango mexico
agriculture secretary mike johanns on tuesday announced that usda animal and plant health inspection service has closed the us border to cattle from mexico s state of durango due to inadequate health inspection programs there
the unintended consequence is the gentleman from texas s mr ortiz xz4003020 very own state loves the countryoforigin labeling that was mandated by that same farm bill on fish
on december 23 when the cow was found in the state of washington that had mad cow disease it took exactly 24 hours for 60 of our trading partners to shut off our exports 60 of them
the problem that exists right now and it was very quietly done but on may 21 as i mentioned before the state of durango in mexico can no longer send live cattle to the united states along the texas border because they were mixing cattle between two regions within their state one that has the ability to be exported and the other that does not
adequate funding for this program would provide the farmers with technical farm management and marketing assistance all of which are important to keeping our farmers productive on their land
i strongly urge my colleagues to join me in supporting our nation s minority farmers by ensuring the passage of this important amendment and i appreciate the efforts of mr butterfield and others on this important issue
mr speaker i rise in opposition to the conference report on hr 3010
mr speaker the constraints placed on this bill by the budget priorities and decisions of the republican leadership are not worthy of this house and the values of the american people
and as a final point it shortchanges our children with disabilities by funding idea at 4 billion below the republican promise to put special education on a fast track to full funding
as a result this laborhhseducation bill will not reflect kindly on us
members on both sides of the aisle voted against the injustices of this bill and refused to allow this 109th congress to be defined by a laborhhseducation bill that turned its back on the american people
nevertheless these modest changes will have little impact on rectifying the enormous gaps created by the funding cuts in this bill
mr speaker this country was built on a promise of hope and equal opportunity for all of its people
res 95 the first concurrent resolution on the budget
the congressional black caucus budget alternative focuses on closing the disparities that exist in america s communities and invests in the future of this nation by fully funding the no child left behind act at fiscal year 2006 authorization levels expanding the head start programs doubling the funding for historically black colleges and universities and hispanic serving institutions and increasing the size of the pell grant allotment for college students
i wonder if the american public fully appreciates that this congress and this president continue to borrow on their credit cards the way we do
the chinese own about 217 billion of that the japanese cover about 668 billion the oilrich opec countries own about 48 billion and the list goes on and on
it is poor fiscal judgment and this congress led by this side is guilty of putting that on a credit card that all americans will end up paying
as health care costs continue to rise the number of uninsured americans exceeds 45 million and employers continue to cut back on coverage medicaid has provided a guarantee of support for pregnant women and children persons with disabilities persons living with aids or mental illnesses and senior citizens needing medical care or long term care services
based on the republicans proposal maintaining and making permanent tax cuts for millionaires has been and continues to be a higher priority than meeting the needs of the majority of americans
representatives from the cities of riverdale and powder springs told me this week that their plans for building community centers depend on funding of cdbg
at the same time our budget recognizes that we can not place the burden on our children and grandchildren
on income we changed the revenue by rolling back the tax cuts to the level they were at in 2001 for income over 200 000
all of the numbers on defense are exactly the same numbers as the republican budget with one exception
now on defense i hope the gentleman from florida is working with the virginia delegation in maintaining a 12aircraft carrier fleet
on behalf of the congressional black caucus this amendment in the nature of a substitute seeks to offer to congress and the american people an alternative budget that is fiscally responsible and aimed at reducing disparities in our communities
the cbc alternative budget raises revenue by reducing the tax cuts from 2001 and 2003 for an individual s adjusted gross income that exceeds 200 000 and not adopting the new republican tax cuts eliminating corporate tax incentives for offshoring jobs closing tax loopholes abusive shelters and methods of tax avoidance and eliminating the repeal of the limitation on itemized deductions pease and the phaseout of personal exemptions pep scheduled to take place between 2006 and 2010

i do so in light of the fact that the republican budget resolution mirrors the president s request for defense and the spratt alternative matches this funding dollarfordollar but the spratt budget is better because section 401 of his resolution calls on the congress to address serious shortcomings in both the president s budget and the house republican budget resolution
madam chairman i rise to offer an amendment that will redress a grievous act that was perpetrated without our knowledge on a majority of this great body
minds were not enlightened souls were not fed and the small businesses that depend on the nonprofit arts community did not profit
while other industries have suffered the nonprofit arts world continues to build in strength while it encourages the growth of innumerable small businesses on its periphery thereby creating more jobs
but what is before us today is actually very important because even in a time of tight budgets the committee on appropriations has seen fit to raise the president s request on national parks by 70 million over last year s funding and 20 million above the president s approval
at a time when we are fighting on so many different fronts to figure out how to balance our budget and move towards a balanced budget where every tradeoff between immunizations and medicaid and whether we support our troops and veterans benefits and all this it is important to remember the legacy of america s national parks america s gifts to the world and i appreciate it very much in this overall important bill that they have increased the funding for the national parks
mr chairman i yield 2 12 minutes to the gentleman from missouri mr skelton xz4003770 the ranking member of the committee on armed services
our budget let me make this clear matches dollar for dollar their budget on national defense and international affairs there is not a dime s worth of difference over a 5year period of time
our budget resolution contains no reconciliation instructions to the committee on veterans affairs
their resolution calls upon the committee on veterans affairs to report savings out of mandatory programs that will save 798 million
mr chairman i yield 2 12 minutes to the gentleman from illinois mr evans xz4001260 a veteran of the united states marine corps the ranking member of the committee on veterans affairs
mr chairman i yield myself such time as i may consume to amplify on what the gentleman from oregon has stated
we have a decidedly different approach to education a much greater emphasis on education
in addition it provides when anyone wants to cut taxes when we have a deficit must offset the tax cut so it will not contribute to the deficit it will not further enlarge the problem on the bottom line
three times chairman alan greenspan of the federal reserve has testified before the committee on the budget that he would reinstate the paygo rule and he would apply it to expiring tax cuts that are renewed
on the spending side of the ledger we have brought spending back to current services in many cases restoring deep cuts made by the republicans
not even maynard keynes would look approvingly on that
we had a meeting on the democratic side of the committee on the budget with mr greenspan about what is the best approach we should take to this surplus that we find ourselves enjoying
well instead of being here on this pinnacle with a 236 billion deficit surplus we are down here with a 427 billion deficit this year according to cbo
mr chairman i am both pleased and proud today on the alternative budget that we the congressional black caucus have crafted
i know that from experience because i once served as the mayor pro tempore on the city council for carson california
all of those acts contained three elements the paygo rule which we are proposing to reinstate caps on discretionary spending backed up by sequestration and a multiyear 5year budget not just a 1year budget but a 5year budget with goals to attain each year
mr chairman i yield 4 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from new york mr rangel xz4003330 the ranking member of the committee on ways and means
the bush administration bet the budget on a blue sky estimate and went for huge tax cuts that left no margin for error
when the surpluses of 56 trillion failed to materialize the budget sank into deficit 375 billion in 2003 412 billion in 2004 and an expected 427 billion this year and on and on and on
in other words if we left it on autopilot at current services it would be 16 trillion more in implementing the president s budget
sitting here for the last 2 days i have heard their budget praised warmly by members on the other side and there are features of it frankly that i would praise too
and while it calls for renewal of the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts with the revenue impact of 16 trillion not a dime of that revenue loss is included because it falls after 2010 but sitting here for the last 2 days i have also heard the claim that this budget takes on entitlements
it does not take on social security
it does not take on medicare
reconciliation will mainly fall on medicaid and on other programs like medicaid medicaid being the health care program of last resort for the least among us
the president has proposed cutting medicaid over 10 years by 60 billion but when the congressional budget office scored his savings and said we can not find 20 billion of savings here maybe 13 maybe 14 but not 20 billion in these proposals nevertheless the committee has said to the committee on energy and commerce to cut 20 billion anyway
when we net these out there is no spending reduction to put on the bottom line
mr chairman i yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from maryland mr hoyer xz4001890 the distinguished whip on the house democratic side
mr chairman before yielding to the gentleman from texas i would simply like to say that i have here a copy of the cbo s report on the budget january 2005 which shows that in the year 2000 we had revenues of 1 004 trillion under the individual income tax
and now on that point i recognize and yield 1 minute to the gentleman from texas mr edwards
mr chairman before voting on this budget resolution everyone should ask what does it do to education what does it do to the development of our communities what does it do for veterans health care and what does it do to the bottom line
but if you want to put the budget back on a path to balance as it was in the year 2000 if you want to avoid the accumulation of that mountain of debt then vote for the spratt or democratic alternative
but we warned here in 2001 and in every year thereafter when this resolution came before this house that the other side of the aisle was betting the budget on a blue sky forecast and leaving no margin for error
i am the democratic ranking member on this committee
indeed they tell us in this report same page page 2 that the president s budget basically your budget the president s budget makes the situation 2 trillion worse than if we just left things on automatic pilot for current services
in the last congress after we put on an effort to win support for it we collected 225 cosponsors
but this bill has been thoroughly exposed thoroughly supported thoroughly argued for and against and today we are entitled to this vote on the house floor
as our weak economy is forcing more people to rely on medicaid s health safety net republicans are cutting the program by 20 billion
this budget is a punch line to a sick joke being played on the american people
like their previous bill the republicans continue their assault on health care programs
based on the republican efforts to cut employment services you d never know this administration has overseen the lowest rate of job growth since herbert hoover
i urge my colleagues to join me in voting no on this harmful and dishonorable bill
current law prohibits conflicts of interest between the members on the advisory committee and the companies whose drug is being examined by the advisory committee
though the fda has the authority to waive this prohibition under certain limited circumstances this exception has now become the rule and too often the fda places scientists with financial connections to the drugs they are examining on the advisory committees
the financial interests are too great not only for those who sit on the advisory committee but also the drug companies who produce these drugs and do whatever they can to get them approved
let me just say that it has long been my position that we should not debate past decisions no the hudson river but look to the future in the region and focus on protecting those communities most directly affected by the cleanup project
what has been consistently overlooked is the fact that dredging will have a heavy impact on people s everyday lives
for that reason i want to thank you for a separate report language provision which was inserted at my request to address the burden the hudson river cleanup project is placing on the people of fort edwards and reiterate my concern that the epa do all it can to provide assistance to the town
mr chairman several weeks ago we passed on the floor here an amendment banning the slaughter of wild horses that had been sneaked into the omnibus bill by a substantial bipartisan vote
this amendment i offer today is a supplement to that amendment and one that we have sought a vote on an upordown vote for several years in this body
the amendment essentially would end the use of taxpayer dollars to enable and subsidize foreign enterprises largely operating in opposition to the vast opinion and support of united states citizens and in fact the majority of states have outlawed the slaughter of horses for human consumption and yet this process continues on
first of all on the cost end of it cbo said already this is a costneutral proposition
madam chairman today we present for consideration by the house the interior environment and related agencies fiscal year 2006 appropriations bill as approved by the house committee on appropriations
madam chairman i ask unanimous consent that debate on this amendment and any amendments thereto be limited to 20 minutes to be equally divided and controlled by the proponent and myself the opponent
members can count on us to continue to support the arts to watch the oversight of our committees and this bill strikes a fair balance between the needs of the arts and our responsibility to land management and indian programs
we will certainly stand by our statements to decrease the spending on land if we can manage that and we will count on the house to support us in that area
i thank the gentleman from new york for his good work on the hudson river program and for bringing the need for clarification of the intent of the study to my attention
mr chairman i ask unanimous consent that further debate on this amendment and any amendments thereto be limited to 10 minutes to be equally divided and controlled by the proponent and myself the opponent
mr chairman i ask unanimous consent that the debate on this amendment and any amendments thereto be limited to 10 minutes to be equally divided and controlled by the proponent and myself the opponent
i thank the gentleman from new york mr sweeney xz4003930 for his good work on the hudson river cleanup and for bringing the need for clarification of the intent of the study to my attention
mr chairman i would like to engage in a brief colloquy if you will on the subject of the proposed usgs laboratory in santa cruz california
i would be pleased to assist in a meeting with the gentleman and agency officials on this matter
i thank the gentlelady for her efforts and look forward to continuing to work with her on this matter in the future
mr chairman i ask unanimous consent that all debate on this amendment and all amendments thereto be limited to 20 minutes 10 minutes to the proponent and 10 minutes to an opponent myself
mr chairman i reserve a point of order on the gentleman s amendment
accordingly the committee rose and the speaker pro tempore mr terry xz4004000 having assumed the chair mr shimkus acting chairman of the committee of the whole house on the state of the union reported that that committee having had under consideration the bill hr 2361 making appropriations for the department of the interior environment and related agencies for the fiscal year ending september 30 2006 and for other purposes had come to no resolution thereon
mr chairman i support the committee on the budget in adding 1140 billion to the administration s request for programs under the community and regional development function in the budget which includes the community development block grant
it goes on to state that the resolution makes no assumption regarding implementation of the president s proposed strengthening america s communities block grant or transferring the community development block grant program from the department of hud to the department of commerce
this house in taking the action of supporting the committee on the budget s resolution does not accept the president s level of funding and looks to restore functions for cdbg that go to important issues in our community such as taking abandoned houses and refurbishing them demolishing abandoned buildings where they can not be rehabilitated taking abandoned lots that might have been strewn with broken grass or be places where criminals congregate and turning them into community parking lots that can help support areas of local community business districts
i also serve as chairman of the federalism and the census subcommittee of the committee on government reform and we recently held a subcommittee hearing on the administration s proposal to consolidate existing direct grant economic and community development programs within the department of commerce
in colorado and across the county there is a need for wise reinvestments of the funds coming into the treasury from oil and gas development on the outer continental shelf and elsewhere
this bill turns its back on that principle
pilt payments go to every state except rhode island as well as to the district of columbia guam puerto rico and the virgin islands as we see on the map here
but it is particularly important for western states because we have the largest amounts of public lands again as we can see on the map
so it should be something local governments can count on without becoming hostage to debates over the management of federal lands
so i am glad the committee on appropriations rejected this idea and i applaud them for including 230 million in the bill for pilt
i have also introduced a bill with the gentleman from colorado mr salazar xz4006201 that would provide permanent automatic funding and i hope the committee on resources will take this up in the near future
in congressional terms these amounts are a blip on the budget screen
in addition to economic benefits of the arts recent studies have shown the significant impact that arts education can have on atrisk youth
overall this conference report cuts education health care and human services by 15 billion below what was spent on these efforts last year
meanwhile republicans plan to spend 11 billion this week on a capital gains and dividend income tax cut that will provide 53 percent of its benefit to people making more than 1 million
overall republicans will spend more on tax cuts this week alone 70 billion than on both the department of education and the department of labor 68 billion for an entire year
consumers are expected to pay 46 percent more for natural gas and 28 percent more for home heating oil this winter yet republicans refused to increase funding for liheap home heating assistance which helps keep the heat on for lowincome seniors and children
today we are being asked to pass judgment again on a virtually identical piece of legislation as if shuffling 180 million between accounts in a 602 billion conference report can begin to compensate for the deficiencies in the underlying bill
mr speaker the list goes on and on
there are 4 400 tribal members who are suffering on the reservation
they have land in the scenic columbia river gorge that is in trust and was in trust prior to the passage of igra and it is on a hillside where they have plans where they could build and they could do that today
mr chairman this is port property zoned for industrial use leveled out with dredge tailings from the construction of the second lock at bonneville dam all right as opposed to an area up on a side hill that is timbered and beautiful where they already have land
my colleague has on more than one occasion mentioned an acid rain study
i think the chairman of our committee on resources has a much more prudent approach to look at this issue on a broader scale to see what is the best policy for this nation to follow when it comes to dealing with these issues of tribal casinos on or off reservation
but to move an amendment like this with very little notice if any on an appropriations bill i would dare say is not appropriate
we are spending 142 billion on the needs of our american citizens
this is more money than they spend on their entire budget including their military
well we have tried to reduce the tax burden on americans who are paying for these benefits
but there is also the argument that we will hear on the other side of the aisle about our deficits that our deficits are too high our deficits are growing our deficits our deficits our deficits but every time we bring a bill to the floor there is not enough money in it
they can not rail against deficits and then tell us that we need to spend more money on every program in the federal budget
there is no question these are difficult choices but i think if i were going to entrust my decisions on these things to anyone it would be to congressman regula who has been doing this for so many years
mr speaker i would like to thank chairman regula for his leadership on this bill
so i just hope that we can set partisanship and some of that acrimony that we all have to deal with on a daily basis down here let us set it aside on this really good solid effort and let us all support this bill
i ask for a no vote on the republican budget and an aye vote on the democratic budget
the cbc budget rejects the failed budget policies of the bush administration and would return us to a policy of investing in education job training housing veterans and community development programs that millions of people depend on
unfortunately we have been allotted only 20 minutes on our side to discuss the details of that proposed budget and i am delighted that the committee on the budget has seen fit to provide us a little bit more time this evening to discuss some of the benefits we believe will enure if the congressional black caucus budget is adopted
there are two choices in particular we will be asking them to consider would you rather provide a tax cut to people who make more than 200 000 per year or would you rather spend approximately 30 billion dollars that you would save if you did not provide that tax cut on a series of things that would benefit our community and have a substantial potential of closing some of the disparities and gaps that have existed for years and years between african american citizens and white citizens in this country
the second question we will be asking will be would you rather spend 79 billion on a ballistic missile defense program which has been tested time after time after time and has failed all of those tests or would you rather spend that 78 billion on providing more security to our troops body armor personnel support equipment and other protective gear for our troops and providing more benefits to our veterans in this country
it will roll back the tax cuts on people with adjusted gross incomes that exceed 200 000 per year
on the military side we would roll back 78 billion in ballistic missile defense spending leaving using 1 billion for research to continue regarding the ballistic missile defense system
all of these funds are spent on other defense items to support our troops homeland security needs and veterans program and benefits
and over on the defense side we are going to be adding money for body armor personal support equipment and other protective gear for our troops ammunition for the marine corps small arms for the army
simply roll back the tax cut on people who make above 200 000 a year
i want every member of this congress to understand that that is a choice that we have made and that is a choice that we are calling on this congress to make
that is what you will be voting on today
mr chairman i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from virginia mr scott xz4003641 who prepared this budget has his imprint on it and knows more about it than anybody
madam chairman pictured on this chart is an asian longhorned beetle
if you have the emerald ash borer in indiana ohio or michigan or in the pacific coast or suffer from sudden oak death in california or oregon or are dealing with the glassywinged sharpshooter in california or of course boll weevils throughout the south all of these are pests which are having a dramatic impact on our economy or is having a budget cut in this round to an unacceptable level
we found when this house weighed into this debate in the past and increased funding through an amendment on the floor we wound up having a substantial positive impact
a combination of research and remediation has proven that the dollars spent on these things turn out to be extraordinarily helpful
he is expected on the floor shortly but he represents as so many other members do a bipartisan effort to make sure that insects like this are vanquished once and for all
now the gentleman s amendment does not speak to plum pox because that would be legislating so i would encourage the gentleman to support my amendment which we just voted on here because it would permit plum pox
that was one of the many pests on the list that would be increased in that case
plum pox asian long horn beetle this is another reason why i hope all of my colleagues will support the amendment that we just voted down and will be having a recorded vote on later
mr speaker i thank the chairman for yielding and i want to commend the gentleman for his outstanding work on this piece of legislation
the chairman is i believe well noted on both sides of the aisle for being a very compassionate and caring person but as well a responsible adult
we have had tremendous outlays and expenditures with hurricane katrina the war in iraq and that we really need to hold the line on spending
additionally there are some small increases for special education and title 1 i want to particularly commend the chairman for holding the line on the weldon language
but in recent years very aggressive abortion rights advocates have been putting pressure using regulatory agencies and state governments and courts on hospitals and other institutions to begin performing abortions when the officials and the workers in those institutions did not want to do that
we have seen unprecedented challenges that we have had to face this year hurricane katrina recovery from that hurricane wilma which significantly affected my district and the state i live in and then of course we are fighting a war a war on terror in this country
we spend more than 17 percent on health care
i could go on and on and on
but most important we have an inconsistent policy in the us government today on this issue
the coastal communities in my district rely on tourism and the fishing industry that could be severely hurt if offshore oil drilling and gas drilling were permitted off our coasts
they realize that we need an energy policy that focuses on investments in energy efficiency and renewable energy sources not oil rigs not an endless depletion of our natural resources
the coastal communities in my district rely on tourism and fishing industries that could be severely hurt if offshore drilling was permitted off of our coast
they realize that we need an energy policy that focuses on investments in energy efficiency and renewable energy source not oilrigs and the endless depletion of our natural resources
hr 3010 reflects very poorly on this congress
the governor of oregon signed a compact with this tribe on april 6 and it was presented to the department of the interior on april 8 i have been consistent in my position and i have privately informed the confederate tribes of the warm springs reservation and governor kulongoski and his predecessor governor kitzaber throughout my congressional career that i specifically do not support a casino in the columbia river gorge national scenic area and that generally i oppose offreservation gaming casinos
i have persisted in suggesting to the warm springs tribe that they consider a new location on reservation land along a highly traveled route namely highway 26 between portland oregon and bend oregon
this particular proposal came to the federal government on april 8 and it is necessary that i weigh in now
oregon must not become further dependent on gambling
mr chairman i rise today in support of the house of representatives budget plan and thank chairman nussle and his committee for their dedicated work on this legislation
third this budget will set us on course to reduce the growth in mandatory spending which is growing far faster than our economy and comprises nearly twothirds of all federal spending
let s be clear despite what we are hearing from some on the other side this budget does not cut any programs that help those in need
what this budget does is set on the track to slow the rate of growth on the mandatory side which is currently unsustainable
what we are doing here with respect to agriculture is allowing the agriculture committee to look at all mandatory spending at usda and have full discretion on how we reach our savings total
they are counting on us to set the right priorities and follow through on past commitments
i believe our house budget sets us on the right path toward reducing spending keeping our economy growing and protecting our nation
the amendment offered on behalf of the arts caucus will increase funding for the national endowment for the arts and the national endowment for the humanities by 10 million and 5 million respectively
another agency that receives funding under this bill is the us forest service which has the vital responsibility to fight fires on our public lands
this amendment was soundly defeated on the house floor
had the house of representatives held a recorded vote on this amendment i would have voted to support it
as it is the propriety of this amendment was so clear to my colleagues and me that no member of the house of representatives sought a recorded vote on this issue and it passed by voice vote
leadership in this body is breaking faith with rural america on a host of important issues
it is a win for consumers who get the security of knowing where their meat comes from and it is a win for our producers who can build a stronger marketplace for their meat based on the quality of the product
let us allow the agriculture secretary to fulfill the promise of the 2002 farm bill by giving producers the marketing tools that they need and consumers the information that they are seeking on the origin of the food they buy
one of the hazards of being one of the lowest in seniority on this side of the aisle is that we run out of time so quickly
participants receive instruction in literature composition mathematics and science on college campuses after school on saturdays and during the summer
madam chairman i bring this amendment to the floor today on behalf of myself the gentleman from california mr baca xz4000090 the gentleman from texas mr reyes xz4003370 and the gentleman from georgia mr scott xz4003632 in order to provide much needed financial assistance to our nation s minority farmers and to the 1890 land grant colleges and universities
during fiscal year 1983 president reagan initiated the small farmer outreach training and technical assistance program in response to the usda task force on black farm ownership
mr chairman it is a pleasure to be here on the floor speaking on this subject since some may know i left this place for 16 years and coming back to the floor of the house and having an opportunity to serve on the budget committee has given me a perspective that i did not have before
and i just must say that during the several years that i was embarking on my endeavor to return to this house i was constantly reminded by the people that i came into contact with in my district as to the spending spree they believe the congress has gone on and been involved in over the last number of years
i was in my office watching some of this debate and i heard what appeared to me to be crocodile tears expressed by some on the other side about how much we are cutting
most american citizens most of the people in my district believe that if you spent too much maybe you ought to look on the side of spending restraint
and all i can say is having been gone from this place for 16 years the image that i obtained from people on the outside looking in is frankly not that we have been very restraining in terms of our spending
the average person would i think stand with their mouth agape at some of the conversation that has been on this floor
could a restraint on increased spending be considered a cut
i want to thank the gentleman the chairman of this committee for leading our committee and bringing forward a product which will put us on the path towards restraint the type of restraint that not only is necessary but is expected by the folks back home
i have always said that there are only two things that can bring this country down our dependence on other countries to produce our food and our dependence on foreign oil
desperate times call for desperate measures but turning our backs on our country s service personnel and veterans is nt desperate it s crazy
it is for that reason i voted no on both budget proposals
mr chairman i found the rhetoric on the budget particularly interesting over the course of a wide variety of issues
being both a former enlisted solider and an officer who served here and abroad i am concerned that we keep our commitment to our veterans those who have laid their lives on the line and in many cases borne a great price to pay for the freedoms that we have here to have this dialogue
these increases in this budget carry on a commitment to our nation s veterans that over the past 11 years has been reflected in veterans spending since 1995 when republicans took control of congress
mr chairman reclaiming my time i thank the chairman and am delighted that he has decided to accept the amendment and we will move on
furthermore i would like to thank the gentleman from iowa mr nussle xz4002980 the chairman of the committee on the budget for putting forward a very strong fiscally conservative reasonable budget for the american people that is not just good for our priorities here in washington dc like funding national defense like funding homeland security but it is also a good way to rein in government spending and eliminate government programs that have gotten out of control and maybe are not responsive to individual taxpayers
this budget would further reduce spending would further rein in government growth and would take on the mandatory spending programs that are going to bankrupt our country
i encourage those on the other side of the aisle who ask for more fiscal discipline to come on over and vote for this budget because it is a reasonable thing to do the right thing to do
working on the committee on the budget this year i realize how difficult it is to get agreement on the type of budget we need
even to get a small group of people to agree on a budget is very difficult so i commend the chairman of the congressional black caucus for putting this together and i certainly respect what the gentleman has done
but on so many issues we have disagreement on the content of the budget
i think our budget that we produced out of the committee on the budget is well balanced
i think it is appropriate for the time we are living the time of war the time of very strong homeland security needs and we need to properly fund those items which i believe our house budget that we produced out of the committee on the budget does
i would like to talk more about the qualities of our house budget that we have on the floor today
this budget although restraining nondefense nonhomeland security discretionary spending and taking on mandatory government programs and finding savings although slight we are finding savings in those programs that will enable us to keep continuing to cut taxes and enable us to avoid raising taxes at the same time
mr chairman reclaiming my time this is an interesting chart on the rapid increase in veterans spending per veteran
mr chairman i think i may have a chart on that
we are taking on this and we are going to further cut taxes in order to keep spurring the economy
i do commend him for his hard work and efforts on behalf of his constituents which are my neighbors in north carolina
with that we do have a disagreement on policy
i strongly believe that the federal government must recognize its obligations work within budgetary limits to meet them and to make smart investments focused on the nation s current and future fiscal wellbeing
i fought for a seat on the committee on the budget because my constituents want me to be an advocate for strong fiscal discipline and wise federal spending
during committee on the budget consideration of this budget resolution i was proud to join my democratic colleagues in putting forward amendments aimed at refocusing our spending and investments on the priorities that matter to the everyday lives of all americans creating and keeping jobs supporting community development and providing for a safe and secure homeland
their claim is based on a conveyance that allegedly occurred in 1737 before our nation s independence
i am concerned about this kind of reservation shopping and i look forward to working with my colleagues from california and oregon and michigan and elsewhere in order to limit these tribes ability to build new casinos on properties not contiguous to existing reservations or on those lands where ownership is based solely on a conveyance that predates the existence of our nation
we need to balance the budget but i think we need to protect our families and we need to make sure that we ensure that we are not trying to fix the deficit on the backs of the country s working class
as a member of the committee on the budget i think we should ensure that the federal government investment is available to fulfill our commitment to helping low income students get into and graduate from college
the situation that terri is in has been discussed here on this floor tonight already and you only have to turn on the news or pick up a newspaper to learn about it
terri is not on artificial life support
i ask my colleagues to support this legislation and may we as a nation continue to protect the most innocent and most vulnerable among us so that the united states of america will continue to be that light on the hill that beacon of hope for all mankind
not only has a tube delivering food and water been removed but her parents have been barred from even putting ice chips on her tongue
approved last week i am pleased that we now have an opportunity to vote on this measure
mr speaker on this sunday i have looked into my heart and listened to my god in prayer and spoken to my pastor and other parishioners in church
this is a tragic situation but this young woman is not on life support she is not on a respirator she is not terminally ill and she has been deprived of the physical therapy that might allow her to swallow and eat without a feeding tube
some of us have spoken on both sides of the aisle of holding our loved one in our hands as they died having made the decision not to have heroic measures
but for anybody to try to imply that people on one side or the other do not care about this woman is not right or fair on either side
and people on both sides are pro life in the richness and complexity and difficulty of it
terri schiavo is not on artificial life support
judge greer of the pinellaspasco circuit court stated i see no cogent reason why the committee should be able to intervene into a case involving the decision of whether or not to remain on life support he added i do nt think that legislative agencies or bodies have business in court proceedings i respectfully disagree
the driving force behind many people s efforts on behalf of ms schiavo was plainly to save her life
i however focus on how congress can protect ms schiavo s life because that is of paramount importance
mr speaker there has been much said tonight much eloquence on both sides about this issue
he communicated with his eyes and he communicated with a hand on my forehead in the most profound way imaginable
i think if we are going to make mistakes and god knows certainly that we make mistakes we are human but if we are going to make mistakes let us err on the side of life not denying life but granting life and giving every opportunity to that
the hard work of the gentleman from wisconsin mr sensenbrenner xz4003650 over the last few days of the gentleman from texas mr delay xz4001040 majority leader the work of the gentleman from maryland mr hoyer xz4001890 who may not be on the same side as i am when we take the vote tonight but who has certainly worked hard to see what we could do to make this work in the best possible way for the members who were called back
i know others have said there is no real difference in just giving someone food and water and putting someone on incredible life support systems
mr speaker on december 3 1963 theresa marie schindler was born in pennsylvania
at the time i was pregnant with my first child and my beautiful daughter danene was born 5 days later on december 8 she is my best friend and today she too is a mom
the issues that we are discussing tonight are not because those who may speak on one side or the other are right or wrong or prolife or prochoice
these are people who make lifeanddeath decisions and realize that the 5yearold video we see on tv of the eye blinking and apparent movements are an involuntary reflexive action known as part of the autonomic nervous system
mr speaker when i came here tonight i had no intention to speak on this issue for frankly the most personal of reasons a year ago my brother and i were involved in making precisely this same kind of decision where my mother was concerned
we had been empowered by her to make that decision we were in agreement on the decision and the medical professionals and her minister agreed with us about that decision
we know that she is not on artificial life support only receiving hydration and nutrition
where there is doubt we should err if err we do on the side of protecting the rights of any individual especially when it is the right to life
it will be hard to envision a case or circumstance that congress will not be willing to involve itself from now on if this precedent is approved this evening
we will be abandoning our role as a serious legislative branch and we will be taking on the role as we have done during this debate of judge of doctor of priest of parent or spouse
my friends on the other side of the aisle will declare that this legislation is about principle and morals and values
this congress is on the verge of telling states and judges and juries that their laws their decisions do not matter
for the good of floridians for the good of the country after the house had passed the bill and the governor continued to pursue it very courageous members of the florida senate and the florida house on both sides democrats and republicans refused to make the same mistake a second time
one of the top republicans in the florida house said the legislature should stay out of family court issues the state legislation that failed in the state senate died when some of the leading republican senators said we can not and should not sacrifice our oaths as political officers on the altar of political convenience these were state legislators recognizing the limits of their power
without due process of law in this case i believe it is entirely appropriate that we err on the side of caution all we re doing is seeking a federal review of what has happened in the state courts to ensure that all constitutional rights all of the basic protections that we afford a criminal have been afforded to terri schiavo as well
this entire case hinges on what terri schiavo herself would have wanted
mr speaker i ask unanimous consent that upon entry of this order the speaker may decline to entertain a motion to adjourn until after disposition of the motion to suspend the rules described in this order that it be in order at any time on sunday march 20 2005 for the speaker to entertain a motion that the house suspend the rules with respect to s 686 and that such motion be debatable for 3 hours equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the committee on the judiciary or their designees
i want to thank everybody that has worked on this bill particularly those in the senate the democrats in the senate the republicans in the senate
i want to thank the democrats in this house that worked on this bill the republicans that worked on this bill
mr speaker it was with heavy hearts and steady resolve that we came to the house chamber on palm sunday to pass s 686 a carefully crafted bill with a singular purpose to ensure that terri schiavo enjoys the same due process under the constitution as any other citizen and to guarantee that her right to life is fully protected
if we make an error we should err on the side of life
mr speaker i yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman from florida ms wasserman schultz who both as a member of this body and previously as a member of the florida legislature has a rare commodity on the floor today genuine knowledge on the subject of which we are speaking
what we have are members choosing a side based on their ideologies
we legislate on broad policy
frist looking at it on television and making his diagnosis
we have not spent very much time on that
you are asking to make a decision based on most of us knowing very little if anything at all
what happened has been that this has been very well litigated in florida litigated on a number of occasions with lawyers on all sides
mr speaker i yield 8 minutes to the gentleman from florida mr davis xz4000941 again someone who has worked on this for quite some time
we just play them on cspan the point is this the gentleman is making specific medical arguments
the rule remains that states decide these kinds of decisions but because there was an overwhelming showing of a pattern of discrimination based on race outlawed specifically by an amendment to the constitution we made an exception
i have to ask people on the side who are pushing this if this is such a good idea why is it limited to this case and why do you say it is not to be a precedent
none of the other cases he mentioned are in federal courts because a particular bill was passed in a particular situation to send them there based on a review of those facts
this bill does that for one individual which as the gentleman from georgia s comments make clear it is based on the facts of the one case
mr speaker i yield 5 12 minutes to the gentleman from michigan mr conyers xz4000800 ranking member of the committee on the judiciary
secondly he acknowledged our objections to this individual private bill on one case by blaming the senate
mr speaker i yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from maryland mr hoyer xz4001890 our whip the ranking member on our side who is here tonight to close on our side
mr speaker on that i demand the yeas and nays
mr speaker she reminds me so much of another woman whose name i will not mention who was in much the same circumstance as terri and a young nurse insisted every morning on singing to this patient
mr speaker in response to the remarks a few minutes ago from the gentleman from massachusetts i want to say that i am not sure whether or not i am on cspan but i am absolutely sure that i am not playing doctor for indeed i am one
mr speaker i want to thank my colleagues for returning to washington on palm sunday to take up this very important issue
i particularly want to thank the gentleman from illinois speaker hastert the gentleman from texas mr delay xz4001040 the gentleman from wisconsin chairman sensenbrenner and the gentleman from florida mr weldon xz4004271 for their leadership on this issue
mr speaker listen to the words spoken just one year ago by pope john paul ii to the international congress of catholic physicians on lifesustaining treatments and the vegetative state a man even if seriously ill or disabled in the exercise of his highest functions is and always will be a man and he will never become a vegetable or a man animal
unfortunately his wishes have set his wife on a course of dehydration starvation and death
terri responds to verbal auditory and visual stimuli normally breathes on her own and can move her limbs on command
possibly because she arrived in a wheelchair doctors assumed she d prefer to leave on a gurney
described alternately as in a persistent vegetative state and a lockedin condition schiavo who has lived with brain damage since 1990 either does or does not understand what is going on around her
on friday a senate committee trying to forestall the withdrawal of feeding subpoenaed her though unsuccessfully
on friday judge greer reinstated an earlier order and schiavo s feeding tube was removed
one former caregiver heidi law has said under oath that on three or four occasions i personally fed terri small mouthfuls of jello which she was able to swallow and enjoyed immensely it is one thing to withdraw a feeding tube another entirely to withhold that day s meal tray
at least three affidavits are on file from former nursing home attendants who insist terri showed some hope of making progress but that her husband insisted she be given no rehabilitation
one nurse carla sauer iyer said terri spoke on a regular basis saying such things as mommy and help me iyer said that when she put a washcloth in terri s hands to keep her fingers from curling together michael saw it and made me take it out saying that was therapy michael schiavo s reticence could well have been an unwillingness to open himself to the cruelties of false hope
the underlying argument for protecting terri schiavo is predicated on the idea that life at its core is sacrosanct something with which we interfere at peril to our own places in the universal order
oddly enough on this very day last year the pope addressed a group of participants in an international congress on lifesustaining treatments
with such complex ethical questions that fall between interpreting the law and saving an innocent human life we must always err on the side of life
mr speaker reserving the right to object and if the majority leader will answer a question it is my understanding that we have an agreement that there will be pursuant to this unanimous consent request debate on the pending piece of business the house bill or the senate bill containing the house language between 9 pm
and 12 midnight for the vote to occur on the pending legislation is that accurate
they have had 17 hours notice of reconvening and with the vote to occur at 12 obviously 9 oclock will have been 14 hours and the reason we did not want to go sooner is because there are members on either side of this question who would want to make their positions known
on the one hand we consider the life of one young woman a young woman struck by tragedy shared by her family and by her friends and by her country
one of the striking facts of american life and american culture is the great importance that america puts on the individual one life one swallow that god cares for and plans for
on the one hand my reaction was that i am concerned that we appear to be a congress that is flexible on the jurisdiction of courts
but when we disagree with the courts we have had legislation on this floor in recent months to take from them jurisdiction
so i believe tonight mr speaker that every member will vote on behalf of terri schiavo tonight but they will see their responsibility in that act differently
throughout this painful and difficult trial mr wolfson went on the family acknowledged that teresa was in a diagnosed persistent vegetative state
the schiavo and schindler families need our prayers to do for terry what not a single one of us wishes to imagine to make a decision on the life of a beloved as they traverse the jagged edge of being
this decision on terri does not belong in this congress
mr speaker since i was a child and to this very day on the floor of the house i have been guided by a fundamental principle that we as men and women indeed we as a society will be judged according to how we treat the most vulnerable amongst us
so today we must act on behalf of terri schiavo
congress must act on behalf of all of those who can not speak for themselves and defend themselves
i especially thank the chairman for his leadership on bringing this legislation to the floor in the condition that it is in and i would like to compliment all the leadership in the house and on the senate on both sides of the aisle that have worked so hard and so diligently throughout this weekend and given up their palm sunday weekend to serve a very important citizen of this country and someone whom we have an obligation to protect the constitutional rights of terri schiavo
when you do the math on this and shake this down it breaks down to this approximately 2 million out of that 225 million against her interests into the pockets of attorneys and into the pockets of michael schiavo and into the pockets of the bank for administrative fees
she is not on life support mr speaker
i wanted the opportunity to address the issue of the funding that has gone in on behalf of terri schiavo and the report that i have put together i could easily add several hundred thousand dollars to that that have gone towards attorneys and towards the interests of michael schiavo as opposed to the interests of terri schiavo
i would have a documented report that i would file with the lt em gt lt em gt congressional record except that the trust fund for terri schiavo has been sealed at the request of the attorney on behalf of michael schiavo
we do not know what is going on behind the scenes
and by the way i happen to have another piece of information that flowed to me today a gao audit looked in on that and that organization paid 148 million back in medicaid fees that were inappropriately collected
another issue that should be addressed and we will hear this continually as this 3hour debate goes on is the allegation that 19 judges have reviewed this and 19 judges have concurred
i have put together the full list of the judges that have heard the case of terri schiavo in the history of this and throughout all of that i can identify judge greer and i can identify a threejudge panel that heard her case en banc and i can identify the supreme court of the state of florida which we saw perform a number of times in the year 2000 and also the united states supreme court which simply refused or denied cert on the subpoenas last week
she is not on a respirator she is not on dialysis she is not on a pacemaker or any other 24hour medical equipment
mr speaker 15 years ago or so i worked with colleagues in the senate on the difficult issues relating to the wishes of people who were going to receive medical care if they were incapacitated
section 1 of the bill says the us district court for the middle district of florida shall have jurisdiction to hear determine and render judgment on a suit or claim by or on behalf of mrs schiavo for the alleged violation of any of her rights under the constitution or federal laws that court has already addressed that issue it did so just a few days ago and here is what it decided the court finds there is not a substantial likelihood the petitioners will prevail on their federal constitutional claim that is the same court to whom you are sending this case
the evidence for that begins in the way this was brought to this body being brought in on st
on the one hand you say this is not precedent
on his first stroke we talked to him
he said well i do nt want any of those paddles that they use on er
if you press on an old man s chest to try and start his heart from the external massage you break the ribs
then came the day when he had his third stroke and he could no longer swallow and he was on ivs
it is no different than being on a ventilator forcing air into someone s lungs than it is forcing food into them
you are throwing all that up in the air and leaving families and doctors with nowhere to go because this is not setting precedent this is something to hide something else some diversion of what is going on in this house
mr speaker 2 000 years ago jesus christ entered jerusalem on palm sunday marking the beginning of a week that throughout history and the world over has signified the sanctity of human life
tonight we are here on palm sunday to afford the greatest presumption of life possible under our united states constitution to a woman who has never truly been afforded representation and whose wishes are truly unknown
the constitution confers upon this congress the power to effect the authority on the federal courts to conduct this kind of review and that is what i hope we do here tonight
she had chosen not to be dependent on a respirator in a hospital but to die at home with her family
i have never met certainly not examined ms schiavo but nor have any of the socalled medical experts in this body that have testified on the basis of edited videotapes ever examined her either
mr speaker the night that this was brought up last week we also voted on a budget resolution and we decided to cut tens of billions of dollars out of the program that enables the poorest and the sickest and the most dependent among us throughout this country to be able to live in a dignified safe and sanitary nursing home
where there is disagreement on the medical facts or on the wishes of the patient these cases can be heartrending and sometimes bitter beyond the comprehension of those who have been fortunate not to have to make these decisions
this is not establishing a federal appeal from the florida courts on the grounds that the florida courts have violated some constitutional rights we are familiar with those kinds of procedures
mr speaker it is an uncontradicted fact uncontradicted except for the speculations of some orators in this chamber that terri schiavo told her husband told her sisterinlaw told her brotherinlaw told various of her friends when attending funerals of close family members who had been on life support that she would not want to live like that the florida court found that to be the case to be the fact
the doctors testified doctors who examined her not doctors standing up on the floor here who say well from the video tape we can infer
george will a noted conservative comentator and philosopher conservative enough so that he famously helped coach ronald reagan for his debates in the presidential debates in 1980 said on television this morning and i quote unless we are prepared to overturn centuries of common law and more than two centuries of constitutional law that says that husband and wife are one therefore clearly this is a decision to be made by the husband now this is not just a decision made by the husband
she is not terminally ill she is not dying she is not on artificial life support
if prisoners on death row are guaranteed federal review of their cases terri schiavo deserves at least as much consideration
i urge every one of my colleagues to have compassion on this disabled woman and allow a federal court to review the facts and her constitutional rights
none of my colleagues on the other side are kin to terri
yet terri did not express this to her parents or siblings or reduce her wishes on paper and michael did not remember the supposed request until years after terri s initial injuries when a cash settlement was awarded to her a settlement he would stand to inherit
if we as a congress allow this to happen without guaranteeing her 14th amendment rights to due process terri s blood is on our hands
the committee on education and the workforce considering a case on appeal between the department of labor and a bank retroactively changed the law to fix the result on behalf of the bank
mr speaker i ask unanimous consent that all members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on s 686
on march 16 the house passed legislation to avert the tragedy now unfolding in florida
as a result the legislation is clearly consistent with both the separation of powers envisioned by our founders and the weight of judicial precedent on point
we must work diligently not to not only help terri schiavo continue her own fight for life but to join the fight of all those who have lost capacity to fight on their own
mr speaker i include for the record a supplemental legislative history on this bill and a letter addressed to me dated today from professor robert a destro who is the attorney for robert and mary schindler who is next friend of their daughter theresa marie schindler schiavo and is a professor of law at the columbus school of law in the catholic university of america
chairman you have asked me to comment on the proposed bill for the relief of the parents of theresa marie schiavo to be brought up in the house today which is the same bill the senate passed earlier today in my capacity as cocounsel in the federal litigation filed by robert and mary schindler on behalf of their daughter theresa marie schiavo
on behalf of the legal team and the family we thank you and your colleagues in both the house and the senate for your efforts and those of your respective staffs on behalf of terri schiavo
we did try an emergency motion for a stay but the court denied it on thursday march 17 2005
unfortunately for terri the habeas corpus statutes are focused almost exclusively on prisoners
on friday march 18 2005 the united states district court for the middle district of florida dismissed mr and mrs schindler s attempt to get a fair trial for terri because judge moody believed a that terri is not a person in custody entitled to habeas relief b that mr and mrs schindler do not have standing to argue that terri did not get a fair trial and c that the federal courts are duty bound to respect the findings of the florida courts concerning her wishes
because we believe that federal law is to the contrary we asked for and received a certificate of appealability from the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit which is currently considering our request that the district court give terri and her parents a hearing on their federal claims
section 2 resolves any questions concerning the right of terri s parents to argue in court on terri s behalf
we thank you once again on behalf of the family and on behalf of our client terri schiavo
mr speaker i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from iowa mr king xz4002201 a member of the committee on the judiciary
terri schiavo is not on life support
she is not on a ventilator
she is not on any kind of artificial heart pump
mr speaker this bill does not make a decision on whether or not the feeding tube should be reinserted
it does not make a final decision on the issues that are being decided in florida
what it does do is that it says that a federal court a judge will review the federal constitutional and legal rights that belong to terri schiavo and that federal judge will make a decision on federal issues and that is all the bill does
there have been statements made on the actions of thengovernor george w bush of texas
i would like to correct the record on this
mr speaker i have listened to this debate intently and the complaints that i have heard from people who are opposed to this bill feelings that are sincerely held and emotions that are sincerely held is why are we picking on this one case the case of terri schiavo
we had a debate on the floor and it passed unanimously
i also think this is an issue of priorities priorities of what we put a higher priority on in terms of how we provide food and nourishment to living human beings
on friday she was denied that relief by the florida federal district court
consequently terri schiavo s only hope is the current bill which will guarantee a fresh review of her case in the lower federal court immediately without any deference to state court determination and with the lower federal court issuing a stay of the state court order until it can determine the federal claims the court is required to hear under this bill on its merits
on both sides of the aisle we ask let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in thy sight o lord my strength and my redeemer sanctity of life sanctity of marriage sanctity of an individual to decide for themselves what should happen to their own life i find myself wondering why is there so much focus on this life when we ignore the countless lives throughout the world who die minute by minute hour by hour day by day from hunger and disease that this congress could address and this congress could prevent
he goes on to point out that she could benefit and i will include this full statement in the record from medical interventions that are available right now as we meet she could be getting therapies medical and otherwise that would make her situation all that much better
there are other therapies that could benefit terri schiavo such as hyperbaric oxygen therapy and nutritional therapy that all have high success rates and these should be tried on terri
i reviewed supplied medical records personally observed and evaluated ms schiavo on two separate days at the request of attorney pat anderson who was involved in the case at that time
based on my observation that ms schiavo can swallow i believe that she deserves the opportunity to see if she could sustain her life by swallowing food and water
i recommend that she receive further swallowing testing and the right to sustain her life by eating and drinking on her own
i base this opinion on my 30 years of practice in radiation therapy and as medical director for a hospice program where i have dealt with many patients who are in a pvs state
she did not get it because most of it was spent on attorneys by her guardian who wanted to kill her
as i listened to my colleagues debating this issue on the house floor last night i heard many emotional statements from members on both sides of the aisle in support of and opposed to what this bill stands for
the bill also directs the federal courts to rule on whether removing ms schiavo s feeding tubes is a violation of her civil rights granted to her both by the constitution and federal laws
my view is that when in doubt society should err on the side of life
now i am concerned about the separation of powers and the tenth amendment and i have a record for a decade of standing on almost a libertarian platform on some of these issues
mr speaker i just came in on the plane from north carolina and i found myself thinking a lot about what we are doing here this evening
wondering first of all what this vote is going to cost the american people making a mental calculation that probably 4 5 million we are spending on this one vote this evening and wondering how many children are going to go to bed hungry tonight and how many we could feed with that amount of money how many feeding tubes we have withdrawn by our own indifference in this body by the decisions that we have made in this body that pit one group against another
for many people listening and watching you may get the impression this is a dispute between the democrats and the republicans but there were 30 approximately 30 democrats on the bill and i know that many democrats do support this
number one by my medical definition she was not in a vegetative state based on my review of the videos my talking to the family and my discussing the case with one of the neurologists who examined her
so i would respectfully suggest for those of us that take exception to the proposed action by the chairman of the committee on the judiciary and by this congress that we stand in the shoes of terri schiavo
if it were we would not be here at this late hour on this day
however we have a family that disagrees on the fate of terri s life
and let us be clear terri is not on life support she is not braindead and no heroic measures are needed to keep her alive she simply needs the assistance of a feeding tube for food and water
however because these questions remain disputed the responsible course of action is to err on the side of life
a report to governor jeb bush and the 6th judicial circuit in the matter of theresa marie schiavo theresa marie schiavo was born in the philadelphia pennsylvania area on 3 december 1963 to robert and mary schindler
on the tragic early morning of 25 february 1990 theresa collapsed in the hallway of her apartment waking michael who called theresa s family and 911
on 12 may 1990 following extensive testing therapy and observation she was discharged to the college park skilled care and rehabilitation facility
in september of 1990 she was brought home but following only three weeks she was returned to the college park facility because the family was overwhelmed by terry s care needs on 18 june 1990 michael was formally appointed by the court to serve as theresa s legal guardian because she was adjudicated to be incompetent by law
on 19 july 1991 theresa was transferred to the sable palms skilled care facility
michael schiavo on theresa s and his own behalf initiated a medical malpractice lawsuit against the obstetrician who had been overseeing theresa s fertility therapy
there is no evidence in the record of the trust administration documents of any mismanagement of theresa s estate and the records on this matter are excellently maintained
michael s decision not to treat was based upon discussions and consultation with theresa s doctor and was predicated on his reasoned belief that there was no longer any hope for theresa s recovery
it took michael a long time to consider the prospect of getting on with his life something he was actively encouraged to do by the schindlers long before enmity tore them apart
mr pearse s report submitted to the court on 20 december 1998 contains what appear to be objective and challenging findings
he concludes that michael schiavo s testimony regarding the basis for his decision to withdraw life support a conversation he had with his wife theresa was not clear and convincing and that potential conflicts of interest regarding the disposition of residual funds in theresa s trust account following her death affected michael and the schindlers but he placed greater emphasis on the impact it might have had on michael s decision to discontinue artificial life support
actions by the schindlers to remove michael as guardian and to block the petition to remove artificial life support took on a frenetic quality at this juncture
more external parties on both sides made appearances as potential interveners
on 11 february 2000 consequent to hearings and the presentation of competent evidence judge greer ordered the removal of theresa s artificial life support
the testimony of these parties referenced specific conversations in which theresa commented about her desire never to be placed on artificial life support
the testimony reflected conversations at or proximate to funerals of close family members who had been on artificial life support
the schindlers new evidence ostensibly reflected adversely on michael schiavo s role as guardian
the requested appeal to the florida supreme court was denied on 23 april 2001 one day before the scheduled removal of theresa s feeding tube
on 24 april 2001 theresa schiavo s artificial feeding tube was clamped and she ceased receiving nutrition and hydration
the case was remanded to the trial court with the charge that each side would select two expert physicians a neurologist or a neurosurgeon according to the court and agree between them regarding a fifth and if they could not agree on the fifth the court would select it
the schindlers acting on behalf of theresa filed a motion in federal district court seeking a preliminary injunction to stay the removal of the artificial life support from theresa scheduled to occur on 15 october 2003
on 6 october 2003 florida governor jeb bush filed an amicus brief in support of the motion for a preliminary injunction
the governor predicates his memorandum on the pivotal question as to whether theresa could ingest food and water on her own
on 15 october 2003 theresa maria schiavo s artificial feeding tube was disconnected for the second time
the florida legislature in special session passed hb 35 e on 21 october 2003 authorizing the governor to stay the disconnection of the artificial feeding tube and required among other things the appointment of a guardian ad litem to produce this report
on that same day 21 october 2003 the artificial feeding tube was reinserted per the stay ordered by governor bush
no matter where you may fall on this issue the details of terri s case are heartwrenching
we do not have the expertise or the facts in enough detail to get into these kinds of decisions and make decisions on these kind of cases
the accusation that because we have 3 hours of debate on an unprecedented piece of legislation that seeks to insert the federal government in between a family while overruling state courts and circumventing the constitution that is an outrageous accusation and not worthy of a representative elected to craft and debate legislation
i think it is important to note that president bush when he was governor of texas in 1999 signed a texas law that is on the books today that was just used a few days ago to allow a hospital to withdraw over the parents objections the life support of a 6monthold boy over the parents objections
there is an obvious conflict here between the president s feelings on this matter now as compared to when he was governor of texas so i thought that was an important conflict that should be raised here this evening in our discussion
in fact it documents it to such a degree that it cites the specific conversations referenced by her family members when she attended funerals of loved ones who were in similar situations when they had life support removed and she had stated that if god forbid she was ever in this situation that she would not have wished to remain on life support
the independent guardian ad litem appointed to represent terri schiavo has said in his report that despite the facts cited by my colleagues on the other side of the aisle who have said that terri felt pain and laughs and cries that that is factually inaccurate that her cerebral cortex has been liquefied and that is the area of the brain that responds to emotion and reason
the five courtappointed physicians that have examined terri two appointed on michael schiavo s side two on the schindlers side and one courtappointed physician who have all examined her the board certified neurologists who had scientificallybased academicallyresearched testimony their testimony was deemed to be clear and convincing by the court that she was and is in a persistent vegetative state
depends on the case
mr speaker i shall not try to influence the opinion of anyone on this issue
i have done much maxillofacial trauma all of those years and dealt with situations like this on numerous occasions
she is not on life support as we routinely define it
she is not intubated and she is not on a respirator
how many others in this country are now in longterm care facilities with feeding tubes but able to breathe on their own their hearts beating strongly
but before we could leave she fell asleep on our stairway
mr speaker i wish to thank our leadership for their exhaustive efforts on terri s behalf for their willingness to stand for a compassionate society that protects its most weak and vulnerable members
mr speaker it is a sad day in america when a society as great as ours and filled with as many opportunities as ours turns its back on one of its most vulnerable disabled citizens
terri schiavo is not brain dead she is not on artificial life support
my mother told us every week of her life that she did not want to be kept on life support
she had a stroke and she was on life support
mr speaker tonight we are taking on one of the great moral issues of our day our basic sanctity of life our right to life and what you hear tonight is a lot of emotion
this body has heard much about the importance of conflicts of interest whether in the sarbanesoxley bill that talks about the relationship of auditors and their clients or campaign finance laws where it talks about the impact that money has on these conflicts of interest
i do not believe the issue of terri s husband s conflict of interest and its impact on her condition have been given a proper review
mr speaker the chairman of the committee on the judiciary is correct when he says 8 years
i dare say we could spend another 8 years but given the quality of this bill given the reality that it imposes no responsibility whatsoever on the credit card industry naturally we will be opposed
we need amendments like the one that the gentleman from north carolina and myself filed which would have limited the interest on credit cards to 75 percent
the house will convene on tuesday at 2 pm
any votes called on these measures will be rolled until 6 30 pm
on wednesday and thursday the house will convene at 10 am
i am not advised as to when we could go to conference on the budget possibly next week
we have had three committees scheduled to mark up components of the energy bill this week the committee on energy and commerce the committee on ways and means and the committee on resources but due to the shortened week only one of those was able to begin their markup
i hope and we are going to work very hard and i expect that all three of those committees will complete their markups next week and we will be able to have a comprehensive energy bill on the floor hopefully by the following week
on average passage of this legislation will save a family of four 400 a year and 400 a year is a very important amount of money for an awful lot of people in this country and that is the price that they are paying because of the abuse that we have seen of our bankruptcy law that has been going on for years and years and years
mr speaker any member who votes no on this rule is voting against bankruptcy reform
because it is true 35 amendments were submitted to us in the committee on rules
the gentleman from wisconsin chairman sensenbrenner came before the committee on rules and made it very clear to us
mr speaker reclaiming my time the chairman of the committee on the judiciary is absolutely right
the exact same opportunity existed on this bill which has gone through congress after congress with an excess of 300 votes in the past
we said a substitute would have been made in order if it had been submitted to us in the committee on rules
if you look at the cost that exists today because of abuse of bankruptcy law the abusive filings of bankruptcy there is on average for a family of four of 400 per year
if i could reclaim my time what i am suggesting is that because of abuse of bankruptcy filings that take place today that is a cost that is imposed on american consumers to the average family of four of in excess of 400
mr speaker by direction of the committee on rules i call up house resolution 211 and ask for its immediate consideration
the rule provides for 1 hour debate in the house equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the committee on the judiciary
mr speaker i ask unanimous consent that all members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks on h res 211
the house judiciary markup on march 16 included rollcall votes on 11 amendments
i want to thank the gentleman from wisconsin distinguished chairman of the committee on the judiciary for bringing forth those statistics and that stack of documents that he just went over and i want to add one more statistic to that and this is that since the 105th congress the house and the senate have passed bankruptcy reform legislation a dozen times with a vote tally of 2 455 for and 871 against
to my distinguished colleague from florida in regard to the amendment process in the committee on rules my colleague knows that the other side was offered an amendment in the nature of a substitute
every one of those 35 amendments could have been included in an amendment in the nature of a substitute but apparently they just could not get their act together did not have an amendment and passed on that opportunity
the gentleman from virginia mr scott xz4003641 was not one of those voting in the affirmative on any of those occasions but i want to point out to the gentleman in regard to his concern over medical and healthrelated expenses for a debtor spouse and dependents on line 23 page 8 continuing through line 10 page 9 this covers the treatment of medical expenses for the debtor spouse of the debtor and dependents of the debtor
s 256 means test has a special exception just for debtors who are disabled veterans if the indebtedness occurred primarily during a period when the debtor was on active duty or performing a homeland security activity
the bill excuses a debtor if he or she is on active military duty in a military combat zone from the mandatory credit counseling and financial management training requirements
i could go on and on mr speaker but we are addressing as we always have on this side of the aisle the special needs of our great veterans of this country
families who are dependent on obtaining their share of marital property for survival may now find under present bankruptcy law that such debts are discharged
once again the majority has squelched debate on a controversial piece of legislation for no legitimate reason
the house came into session on tuesday and members will leave town later this afternoon after just 2 days of work
a 1hour debate on legislation containing such sweeping reforms is not the way to conduct the people s business
it requires credit card companies to preserve a customer s interest rate prior to incurring medical expenses if the customer is unable to pay off the full medical expenses on time
it is in my opinion hypocritical to prevent debate on an amendment that could ameliorate some of the issues facing this bankruptcy reform legislation
and the ranking member of the rules committee the gentlewoman from new york ms slaughter xz4003780 offered an amendment that imposes restrictions on issuing credit cards to college students
but none of those amendments or the 31 others will be debated today because the rule on this bill is closed
amendments submitted to the rules committee for s 256 and denied consideration by the rule h res 211 1 emanueldelahuntdingell prevents debtors from shielding their funds from bankruptcy liquidation through socalled asset protection trusts 2 filner exempts disabled veterans from the bill s means test 3 filner exempts from the bill s means test consumers who are victimized by identity theft 4 inslee exempts from the bill s means test consumers whose debts are the result of serious medical problems 5 delahunt requires debtor corporations to file for bankruptcy where their principal place of business is located 6 sanders establishes a usury rate for credit card companies above which credit card companies can not charge consumers 7 sanders caps fees credit card companies can impose on consumers at 15 8 sanders prohibits credit card companies from changing interest rates based on changes in consumers credit information 9 sanders prohibits credit card companies from raising interest rates based on consumer credit reports 10 ruppersberger requires credit card solicitations to be accompanied by a brochure explaining the consequences of the irresponsible use of credit 11 schiff exempts from the bill s means test consumers who are victimized by identity theft if at least 51 of the creditor claims against them are due to identity theft 12 lofgren exempts from the bill s means test 1 families facing bankruptcy due to a serious medical hardship that drains at least 50 of their yearly income and 2 families who lose at least one month of needed pay or alimony due to illness 13 lofgren exempt from the bill s means test a single parent who failed to receive child or spousal support totaling more than 50 of her or his household income 14 scott va exempts from the bill s means test provisions 1 debtors who have business losses incurred by a spouse who has died or deserted the debtor 2 debtors who have had serious illness in their family and 3 debtors who have been laid off 15 scott va exempts from the bill s means test provisions debtors who have business losses incurred by a spouse who has died or deserted the debtor 16 scott va exempts from the bill s means test provisions debtors who have had serious illness in their family 17 scott va exempts from the bill s means test provisions debtors who have been laid off from their jobs through no fault of their own 18 nadler sunsets the bill after 2 years 19 watt prohibits annual credit card rates higher than 75 20 watt includes the costs of college in the calculation of debtor s monthly expense 21 ruppersberger exempts from the bill s means test debtors who have declared bankruptcy due to high medical expenses 22 hastings fl prevents credit card companies from increasing rates on consumers who use their credit cards to pay for extraordinary medical expenses also prevents hospitals from generating negative credit information on consumers who are paying their bills in good faith 23 meehan exempts from the means test disabled veterans whose indebtedness occurred primarily as a result of an injury or disability resulting from active duty or homeland defense activities closes a loophole in s 256 which exempts only disabled veterans whose indebtedness occurs primarily while on active duty while failing to exempt disabled veterans whose indebtedness occurs after they have left active duty 24 jackson lee makes debts arising out of state sex offenses nondischargeable in bankruptcy proceedings 25 jackson lee clarifies congress intent that nuclear liabilities be covered by the priceanderson act and not by bankruptcy laws 26 jackson lee makes debts arising out of penalties imposed on businesses for false tobacco claims nondischargeable 27 jackson lee strikes the bill s means test provision 28 woolsey requires credit counseling agencies to provide free services to recent veterans of the military who served in combat zones 29 slaughter requires credit card companies to determine before they approve a credit card whether a student applicant has the financial means to pay off a credit card balance it restricts the credit limit to minimum balances if the student has no independent income and it requires parental approval for credit limit increases in the event that a parent cosigns the account 30 slaughter applies the highest median income of any county or metropolitan statistical area in the state to all residents of the state petitioning for bankruptcy protection 31 millendermcdonald provides the bankruptcy courts a higher percentage of the fees collected when a debtor files for bankruptcy 32 maloney ensures that debtors emerging from bankruptcy make child credit payments first before payments on credit card debt
the current version of the bill does not ensure that child support payments will have priority over the other types of unsecured debts such as credit card debt 33 meehan and berman provides a modest homestead exemption for people who have suffered a major illness or injury 34 jackson lee provides additional protections to debtors who are the victims of identity theft 35 jackson lee increases the means test limit on parochial school tuition expenses from 1 500 to 3 000 so that families chapter 13 bankruptcy can keep their children in schools that conform to their deeply held religious beliefs
it seems that if the republican leadership deems legislation important and that is their prerogative it is willing to push through the other body s version without the opportunity for debate here in the people s house on any amendments
the founding fathers envisioned a forum for lively debate on the issues of the day not the controlled steering of selected legislation with no opportunity for meaningful change
considering disaster assistance as a source of revenue adds insult to injury and contradicts the government s efforts to help people get back on their feet
why are we not debating legislation that would address those practices instead of eviscerating a crucial safety net that americans rely on when all else fails
i will not and can not support such an attack on american consumers
i urge my colleagues to vote no on this closed rule and no on s 256
my respect for the chairman of the committee on the judiciary is immense and he has thrust all of these hearings and all that were in committee where 40 members of the committee on the judiciary had an opportunity to participate
that would be what i would put on the table from the minority side
mr speaker i am delighted to yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from california ms matsui xz4006631 our newcomer who is making her first statement as a committee on rules member
reclaiming my time in any event both bills will be on the calendar next week
can the gentleman tell me when that bill might be on the floor
mr speaker i rise today to answer my good friend the chairman of the committee on rules to simply say the reason why a substitute was not offered is because the bankruptcy code as it now stands addresses the needs of the american people
i ask for a no vote on the rule
we should focus on the true abusers and not the working families that have played by the rules
alan greenspan has said these provisions reduce uncertainty for market participants and reduce risk by making it less likely that the default of one financial institution would have a domino effect on others
i offered an amendment to address this but the committee on rules did not make it in order
dear congressman conyers the national women s law center is writing to urge you to oppose hr 685 a bankruptcy bill that is harsh on economically vulnerable women and their families but that fails to address serious abuses of the bankruptcy system by perpetrators of violence against patients and health care professionals at women s health care clinics
this bill would inflict additional hardship on over one million economically vulnerable women and families who are affected by the bankruptcy system each year those forced into bankruptcy because of job loss medical emergency or family breakup factors which account for nine out of ten filings and women who are owed child or spousal support by men who file for bankruptcy
legal momentum believes that if s 256 is enacted the economic effects on more than 12 million women each year will be devastating and we strongly urge you to oppose the legislation
sincerely lisalyn r jacobs on civil rights washington dc march 14 2005
oppose unfair bankruptcy reform dear representative on behalf of the leadership conference on civil rights lccr the nation s oldest largest and most diverse civil rights coalition we write to express our strong opposition to the bankruptcy abuse prevention and consumer protection act of 2005 hr 685
we strongly urge you to reject hr 685 because it would radically alter the bankruptcy system in a way that imposes hardships particularly on the most vulnerable among us
lt em gt lt center gt nancy zirkin lt center gt lt center gt lt em gt deputy director lt em gt written statement of marshall wolf may 13 1998 on behalf of the governing council of the family law section of the american bar association earlier version of this legislation concluded that child support and credit card obligations could be pitted against one another
while federal bankruptcy court enforces a strict set of priority and payment rules generally seeking to provide equal treatment of creditors with similar legal rights state law collection is far more akin to survival of the fittest whichever creditor engages in the most aggressive tactic be it through repeated collection demands and letters cutting off access to future credit garnishment of wages or foreclose on assets is most likely to be repaid
as marshall wolf has written on behalf of the governing counsel of the family law section of the american bar association if credit card debt is added to the current list of items that are now not dischargeable after a bankruptcy of a support payer the alimony and child it is for these reasons that groups concerned with the payment of alimony and child support have expressed their strong opposition to the bill and its predecessors
professor karen gross of new york law school stated succinctly that the proposed legislation does not live up to its billing it fails to protect women and children adequately joan entmacher on behalf of the national women s law center testified that the child support provisions of the bill fail to ensure that the increased rights the bill would give to commercial creditors do not come at the expense of families owed support assertions by the legislation s supporters that any disadvantages to women and children under s 256 are offset by supposedly prochild support provisions are not persuasive
we hope the house of representatives will not act on it
by focusing on the opportunistic use of the bankruptcy system by relatively few deadbeats rather than fashioning a tailored remedy this bill would cripple an already overburdened system
because it is based on income and expense standards devised by the internal revenue service to deal with tax cheats the principal effect of the meanstest would be to replace a judicially supervised flexible process for ferreting out abusive filings with a cumbersome inflexible standard that can be used by creditors to impose costs on overburdened families and deprive them of access to a bankruptcy discharge
for example sections 306 and 309 of the bill working together would eliminate the ability of chapter 13 debtors to strip down liens on personal property in particular their car to the value of the collateral
this will have a whipsaw effect on many debtors who forced into chapter 13 by the meanstest will not have the income necessary to confirm a plan under that chapter
the average interest rate charged on consumer credit cards has declined considerably over the last dozen years
finally we ought to consider the impact on society of increasing the number of people who conclude that they have nothing to lose
it is ironic that the last time we debated bankruptcy reform on the floor of the house a farmer had driven his tractor into the pond near the washington monument tying up traffic for a long time
if medical expenses wipe you out and you can not pay them under this bill you can not get into chapter 7 if you can pay 166 a month on your bills however much they are
as we now consider this rule and the legislation later today i believe it is particularly important to keep in mind bankruptcy reform s extensive deliberative history before the committee on rules the committee on the judiciary and both bodies of congress which i would like to briefly summarize
the house for example has passed prior iterations of this legislation on eight separate occasions
over the past four congresses the committee on the judiciary has held 18 hearings on the need for bankruptcy reform 11 of which focused on s 256 s predecessors
the senate judiciary committee likewise has held 11 hearings on bankruptcy reform including a hearing held earlier this year
in the 105th congress 4 days were devoted to the committee on the judiciary s markup of bankruptcy reform legislation
in the 106th congress alone the committee on the judiciary entertained 59 amendments over the course of a 5day markup on bankruptcy reform legislation which included 29 recorded votes
on the floor 11 more amendments were considered
in the 107th congress the committee on the judiciary considered 18 amendments during the course of its markup of bankruptcy reform legislation and the house thereafter considered five amendments
in the last congress the committee on the judiciary entertained nine amendments to the bill and five amendments were considered on the house floor
also in the last congress the committee on rules made two amendments in order in connection with a similar bill addressing bankruptcy reform which was considered on the floor
last month the committee on the judiciary entertained 23 more amendments each of which has been soundly defeated
here s the committee report on this bill over 500 pages long
we have a committee report earlier in the 106th congress one from the 105th congress and then we have a committee report from the 105th congress on the house side
there has been plenty of process on this legislation
the house for example has passed prior iterations of this legislation on eight separate occasions
over the past four congresses the judiciary committee held 18 hearings on the need for bankruptcy reform 11 of which focused on s 256 s predecessors
the senate judiciary committee likewise has held 11 hearings on bankruptcy reform including a hearing held earlier this year
on the floor 11 more amendments were considered
in the last congress the judiciary committee entertained nine amendments to the bankruptcy legislation and 5 amendments were considered on the house floor
also in the last congress the rules committee made two amendments in order in connection with a similar bill addressing bankruptcy reform which was considered on the floor
in the 107th congress conferees formally met on three occasions and ultimately agreed after an 11month period of negotiations to a bipartisan conference report
mr speaker i would like to lay to rest the fact that we have not had a full and complete debate on this
this year on march 16 the committee on the judiciary had a full markup on this bill
this transcript goes on for 160 pages in the committee report which shows that everybody had an opportunity to speak their peace
mr speaker i recall yesterday when the death tax repeal was on the floor
they offered a substitute which was voted on and debated in the house of representatives
so the rule under which we considered the death tax repeal yesterday is the same type of rule that we are considering today except that the minority on this bill decided not to offer a constructive alternative substitute
the rule we are debating that we have made today is a closed rule which means that the members of congress who brought 35 amendments to the committee on rules will not have a chance to bring them up
i personally think that amendments protecting our men and women returning from military service in iraq and afghanistan would be a good idea and i feel very strongly that the amendment protecting the victims of identity theft from bankruptcy is an important measure that should be debated on the house floor
this chart shows the number of amendments that the committee on rules made in order on this bill in every congress since the 105th and i insert in the record at this point a list of the rules
number of amendments made in order on bankruptcy bills 105th109th congress 105th congress h res 452 12 amendments made in order
there is less and less democracy in this house and every congress fewer voices are being heard on the floor
the democrats on the committee on rules last month issued a report studying the disturbing trend toward less democracy and deliberation in this house
these unforeseen expenses caused her to fall behind on other financial obligations and before she knew it she was simply unable to make ends meet
bankruptcy has always been about giving a fresh start to those who have fallen on hard times
now is not the time to turn the tables on america s working families
vote no on s 256
for the republican leadership and the republican members of the committee on rules to propose that we consider a bill that is tilted toward the credit card companies and as complex as this bill is without giving members any opportunity to amend it on the floor with only 30 minutes per side for general debate is a travesty and a gross abuse of power
when this bill was in the committee on the judiciary we had a pseudomarkup that lasted all day and was a complete embarrassment and a waste of time for all of the members for the republicans would not even consider one amendment no matter how meritorious or beneficial to the american people even if the amendment addressed issues not previously considered because of the republican leadership s insistence on reporting out a clean bill in order to avoid a conference committee
as a result important thoughtful amendments on such subjects as protection on domestic violence victims from eviction disabled veterans alimony and child support exemptions for medical emergencies and job loss underage credit card lending and a homestead exemption for seniors predatory lending and payday loans all were rejected by the committee on the judiciary
shame on you republicans
and i would oppose that and i would support my colleague who again would ask that we have a vote on the ruling by the chair
based on my statement he is now again appealing the ruling of the chair based on that it was untimely
yes mr speaker i withdraw and i thank the gentleman on the opposite side of the aisle
during the committee on the judiciary markup numerous amendments were offered to correct these provisions yet amendment after amendment was voted down not on the merits of the amendments but because there was a backroom deal to move this legislation through the house without any changes
again in the committee on rules a number of amendments were offered to allow a debate on these issues but not a single one was made in order today
those on the other side of the aisle say they sympathize with the issue and would like to address this matter at some point in the future but i ask why do we not do this now
hawaii and florida can join in because we are growing sugarcane sugarcane can become ethanol ethanol can help reduce the dependency on oil and gas
and we can work with the oil and gas companies to see to it that we have blends that will allow us to reduce our dependency on foreign oil on foreign sources
that is what this is about and that is why i ask for the support of my colleagues on this
chairman dreier ranking member slaughter and the members of the committee on rules
i offer this amendment to hr 6 with the hope of reducing our nation s reliance on oil and advancing our efforts in hawaii to become more energy selfsufficient
this pilot program would parallel the existing corn program to show that the process can be applicable to cane sugar and can be replicated on a larger scale
this pilot project will provide invaluable insight on problems that may arise with a national program
the state of hawaii has passed a law that goes into effect on april 1 2006 mandating a 10 percent ethanol blend for gasoline consumption in the state
i urge my colleagues to allow floor debate on this demonstration project and rule this amendment in order
well there is a court in manhattan yesterday new york federal district court refused to dismiss 80 lawsuits brought on the ground that the majority is trying to eliminate and the judge said innocent water providers and ultimately innocent water users should not be denied relief from the contamination of their water supply if defendants breached a duty to avoid an unreasonable risk of harm from their products
for all those who believe in home rule vote yes on the castle amendment
under the nuclear waste policy act nwpa the doe s authority to store commercial spent fuel on an interim basis at existing doe facilities expired january 1 1990
mr speaker of all the things to come on the floor of the house of representatives and claim with a straight face that we should have a debate about claiming that what is in the bill with regards to the mtbe is an unfunded mandate is one of the biggest whoppers i can imagine with all due respect
i want to read some of the language of the bill and i have to put my reading classes on to do it
the bill also has a provision in it that over the course of the next i think 10 years depending on some scientific studies and various things there could be a point in time that we have a federal ban on mtbe
eighty amendments were offered at the committee on rules yesterday
i believe that the committee on rules has made in order about 30 of those
it may be a little bit fewer than that but a large number of amendments have been made in order including a substitute by the gentleman from michigan mr dingell xz4001100 the ranking member of the committee on energy and commerce
we accepted amendments on the floor on some of the more controversial areas in the bill
the gentleman from delaware mr castle xz4000700 will have an amendment on the floor sometime tomorrow to strike that provision
we have worked very hard on that lng siting provision to make sure that states are very involved but ultimately on the final decision as it should be because this is interstate commerce the ferc is the one that makes the final decision
we want to go to conference with the senate later this spring bring back the conference report and put a bill on the president s desk to help our energy future
i would urge a yes vote on the rule
the energy policy act of 2005 among other things improves our nation s electric transmission capacity promotes a cleaner environment with new innovations on alternative power sources the clean cities authorization and the hydrogen fuel cell car program it promotes clean coal technologies provides incentives for renewable energies such as biomass wind solar and hydroelectricity
i could go on and on mr chairman but simply let me say at the beginning of the debate that it is time for an energy policy for america
it is time for the house of representatives to say we want a strong economy based on the world s best and most open free market for energy supplies and also to put some incentives in for conservation
mr chairman i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from texas mr gene green one of nine democrats on the committee on energy and commerce who voted for this bill in committee
i do want the record to show that i supported at the committee on rules that it be made in order so we could have a full debate
basically i would say that the dingell substitute is well intentioned but in some cases it goes too far and in some cases it is silent on the underlying bill
i will say on the record hundreds of millions if not billions of dollars have been reclaimed indictments have been brought cases have gone to court and convictions obtained and people sent to jail for some of the transgressions the gentlewoman alluded to
while it is obvious that she feels more needs to be done i think it does need to be stated on the record that quite a bit already has been done
and depending on one s point of view that is a lot or a little
i want to thank our colleagues in the other body for already agreeing in the reconciliation instructions and i urge a no vote on the markey amendment
there are cars and trucks on the market today that meet the standards that would have to be met if this amendment were to become law
it probably got 35 miles to the gallon on the highway
she has been very gracious to come up to me on the floor and then her staff and committee staff have been working and we really thought that earlier in the week or late last week we had an amendment that everybody could agree to
we just had the debate on the boehlertmarkey amendment
i voted in the negative on that and i think when that rollcall is called the majority of the house is going to be in the negative
mr chairman parliamentary inquiry since the rogers amendment which is next in line amends or perfects the johnson amendment does the gentleman from michigan mr rogers xz4003421 have to seek recognition to offer his amendment before the close of debate on the gentlewoman from connecticut s mrs johnson xz4002051 amendment or does he wait until her debate concludes and then offers his amendment
before we go to the gentleman from michigan when it comes time to vote are we going to vote on the rogers amendment to the johnson amendment and then if it is amended we will vote on the johnson amendment is that correct
there will be two votes rogers to amend johnson and then johnson either amended or unamended depending on how the rogers amendment fairs
mr chairman i yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from michigan mr upton xz4004140 the distinguished chairman of the subcommittee on telecommunications and the internet of the committee on energy and commerce
on the johnson amendment immediately prior i was in mild opposition
on this amendment i want to be recorded in strong opposition
there has been no hearing on this no markup on this
then there is the dingell electricity substitute which we have already had a debate on earlier today and then at the end there are another 30 pages of tax credits
it is certainly lengthily drafted but i can not conceive at this stage of the game after all of the hearings and the markup and the amendments we have already had in this congress and the debate that went on in the prior congress in the conference report that this house voted on two times that the house would accept this amendment
with all due respect to the authors i would urge a strong no vote on this on a bipartisan basis because i do not think this amendment is right for inclusion or substitution for the underlying bill
mr chairman i yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from louisiana mr mccrery xz4002610 a member of the committee on ways and means that has jurisdiction on tax issues
he goes through and sets some specific standards on specific appliances dishwashers and things like this
but on page 21 there is something beginning on line 16 that i just do not understand and i just want to see
it says section 345 of the energy policy and conservation act 42 us code 6316 is amended by adding at the end the following it just goes down and says if a state wants to set up a specific standard that is fine and that state standard will not be preempted until the federal standards established under this bill take effect on january 1 2010
he is saying the states can set a standard but once the standards in the bill kick in on january 1 2010 the federal standard preempts
the next section i do not understand subparagraph 3 line 16 if the california energy commission adopts not later than march 31 2005 a regulation concerning the energy efficiency or energy effective after the standards established under section 342 a 9 take effect on january 1 2010 what does that mean
then right underneath that we are talking about administration penalties enforcement and preemption on efficiency standard for appliances
am i correct or incorrect on that
i am just trying to point out that even on a cursory examination there are things that were just kind of hastily put together
i do want to say one thing about the gentleman from michigan s amendment on great lakes drilling
we had a fair debate on it
but the base bill allows a state the right to ban drilling on their portion of jurisdiction of the great lakes if they so wish
but as he just pointed out on the underlying bill we do encourage states i think the language is encourages the states to have such a ban but we do not have the federal preemptive ban that the gentleman from michigan wanted
and since she is a member of the committee on rules and every now and then i will need a vote from the minority on the committee on rules there was another reason
then we found out that the gentleman from alaska mr young xz4004401 the chairman of committee on transportation and infrastructure had some concerns about it and the general services administration had some concerns about it
and i would simply say that the gentleman from minnesota mr oberstar xz4002990 the ranking member on the committee on transportation and infrastructure has offered an amendment that would authorize 20 million for the administrator of general services administration to proceed with the sun wall design project and the majority is prepared to accept it and work with the gentleman from michigan mr dingell xz4001100 and the gentleman from minnesota mr oberstar xz4002990 to maintain it in conference with the senate
we had a debate in the committee on energy and commerce on this amendment and i glanced at it and it appears to be the identical amendment
is it the identical amendment from the committee on energy and commerce
we had a good debate on it there and it was rejected and i honestly hope that the house does the same
so i am not sure how we would work on that
but the gentleman from california goes on to say in subsection b if the president determines that the departments and agencies lack the authority or funding to implement the actions proposed in the section i just read then the president should come to the congress and request the necessary authority now here we have an economy that in the last year in the united states demand for energy has gone up not down
i strongly support the gentleman s right to offer it but i just as strongly support my right to oppose it and i hope at the appropriate time the house will vote no on the waxman amendment
there is a big natural gas plague going on in texas right now
there is some oil production drilling going on
i was at the white house earlier this week and was briefing the president on the energy bill that came out of the various committees and when i mentioned this particular element which i consider to be an important element of the bill something that we did not have in last year s bill his initial offthecuff reaction was a it was very good and b could we add abandoned military bases
obviously it is not in order to change the amendment on the floor but when we go to conference if the president decides that the official position of the white house is to support the amendment plus add abandoned military bases we will have a debate in the conference and hopefully add that
but the bottom line on this is we need more refinery capacity
i would urge a no vote on the solis amendment
the only concern well not concern but i need to let the distinguished gentleman from tennessee know that this authorizes the program it does not appropriate the funds and it would be subject to appropriations but certainly authorizing the program so that we can go to the committee on appropriations and request funding
mr chairman there are so many ways to oppose this particular amendment that i am at a little bit of a loss as to which way to start in opposition but i think i will start first on the procedural opposition
this is basically the same vote and the same amendment that the gentlewoman from california mrs capps xz4000620 had a vote on yesterday on a point of order before consideration of the rule
the lawsuits that have been filed and could be filed are going to be filed on a wide range of issues
i have got several court cases that have already been considered on the defective product situation with mtbe and i would like to read those right now
therefore the court found because congress required that gasoline include an oxygenate and specifically designated that mtbe would be one of the most common and effective oxygenates this court concludes that gasoline containing mtbe can not be deemed a defective product a california court the state the gentlewoman hails from federal law permits the use of mtbe and the supremacy clause precludes state tort liability from attaching based on the mere use of this allowed option the court reasoned that permitting plaintiffs to pursue their common law claims conflicts with the reformulated gasoline and oxygenated fuels provisions of the clean air act and the regulatory actions taken under it we have other court cases that we can put into the record
so we think the allegation that it is unfunded is spurious on the measure
and lastly on the item of whether mtbe is defective as a product just because it is mtbe it has clearly been ruled in several cases and common sense would dictate that something that is made properly and used properly and actually cleans up the air there is no way that can be a defective product
we were not even told it could until we walked on the floor and saw the gentlewoman from california mrs capps xz4000620
i am fine on that
the second point i want to make is i am not going to disparage what the gentleman from california mr waxman xz4004250 just said but when we were debating these amendments back in the early 1990s we had numerous instances where he went on record saying that mbte was something that should be included as an oxygenate
mr chairman i ask unanimous consent to speak out of order and engage in a colloquy with the chairman of the committee on agriculture
i give the gentleman my assurances i will work with him on language that reflects the commodity futures trading corporation s jurisdiction in its vital role in market transparency
the subject of the amendment executive order 12898 is already in effect and requires each federal agency to make achieving environmental justice part of its mission by identifying and addressing disproportionately high and adverse human health or environmental affects of its programs policies and activities on minority populations and lowincome populations
mr chairman i will yield 1 of my 2 minutes to the gentleman if he wants to close on the amendment
mr chairman i commend the gentleman from massachusetts mr markey xz4002530 on his visual
so i would respectfully ask for a no vote on the castlemarkey amendment and then what we need to work on in the conference we will work on
i appreciate all his efforts and the faith he has placed in me on this issue which is so critical to new hampshire a state that has been affected significantly and obviously other affected states
as one who served on the committee on the budget and was here in 1995 i would suggest that this would be classified if one is an accountant as a contingent unfunded liability or a hypothetical unfunded liability
i have established it with the chairman a task force that is going to work between now and conference time on a plan that will structure a remediation program that will clean up the water not 10 years from now or 20 years from now not unfairly in this community and not in that community and not in this state or that state but across the whole country
madam speaker i thank the gentlewoman and commend her for organizing this hour that we can talk about this energy bill but we all hope we not only hope can pass on this floor but can actually in this congress become law because we have waited too long
when i got elected to congress in 2002 anwr was very much on my mind because one of the first issues we talked about was an energy bill
we have heard much about ethanol already tonight on the floor of the house
we ought to remember that there are precious few people who actually live in that very difficult very hostile environment in the world anwr which is literally on the coast of the arctic ocean
prudhoe bay which we often talk about is located here again literally on the edge of the arctic ocean
we actually flew over in a very small plane landed on a gravel runway and visited these people in kaktovik about 270 of them actually manage to survive in that very very difficult environment
they fish for arctic char and they survive on them
this was after he told us how they depend on the caribou for their very survival
we should be focusing on reducing our dependence on foreign oil by diversifying our energy sources not by encouraging more oil and gas production
in the committee on rules my colleague the gentleman from nevada mr porter xz4003240 and i offered a simple amendment that would have included yucca mountain in the nuclear site threat assessment study already a part of the energy bill
unfortunately the committee on rules did not put that amendment in order
recently the department of energy revealed that federal employees working on the yucca mountain project deliberately falsified scientific documentation regarding water infiltration and climate studies
before creating an assistant secretary for nuclear issues and increasing our reliance on nuclear power we must find a safe and scientifically sound solution to the problem of disposing of tens of thousands of tons of radioactive toxic nuclear waste
this bill shortchanges water projects and energy technology research and development research into technologies to harness the sun and wind and reduce our dependence on foreign oil
i want to update my colleagues on the recent developments regarding yucca mountain and i sincerely hope that they listen
last month the department of energy revealed that scientists from the us geological survey who were working on the water infiltration and climate studies at yucca mountain actually falsified documentation
in the end i keep track of two sets of files the ones that will keep the qa happy and the ones that were actually used another email says like you said all along the yucca mountain project has now reached a point where they need to have certain items work no matter what and the infiltration maps are on that list
if they need proof i will be happy to make up more stuff no one better dare say to me on this floor that yucca mountain is based on sound science
doe is building yucca on a weak foundation based on lies fraud intimidation deception and nonexistent science
mr chairman i claim the time on the majority side for the committee on science
mr chairman it gives me great pleasure to yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from new york mr boehlert xz4000350 the illustrious chairman of the committee on science
mr chairman i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from south carolina mr inglis xz4006490 a member of the committee on science
in closing i express my appreciation for the leadership of the committee on science and my colleagues on the committee for their contributions to the development of the provisions in the r amp d title of hr 6
they are bipartisan forward thinking balanced and speak to the importance that we as a congress place on the role of technology in our energy future
i would also express my appreciation for the extremely professional staff of all the relevant committees as well as the key leadership staff who worked diligently on this bill for months and in some cases years
i want to thank the able staff of committee on science and its energy subcommittee
like the other assistant secretaries at doe the director position is on an executive schedule
like the other assistant secretaries at the doe the director position is a level iv on the executive schedule
i yield to the gentleman from new york the chairman of the committee on science
i want to be sure that your intent is for the secretary to focus his attention on existing doe sites and not go looking for private sites that might be used for interim storage
the bishopmarkeymcdermott amendment calls on the president to immediately suspend deliveries to the strategy petroleum reserve until oil prices fall below 40 per barrel
mr chairman let us give americans in the northeast and on the west coast something to cheer about
one of the things that the chairman mentioned a few moments ago is bipartisan support that we have had on some of our initiatives and certainly we feel like we will see this on the energy bill
we saw it in committee and i would commend the gentleman from texas chairman barton for the wonderful work he did on the bill in committee
over the past few weeks we had 122 democrats that voted with us on the continuity of government bill 50 democrats voted with us on class action 73 democrats voted with us on bankruptcy reform and 42 supported us on repeal of the death tax and our real id
i want to congratulate the gentleman from texas mr barton xz4000180 and our colleagues on the committee on energy and commerce
i would like to remind my colleagues that over the last few weeks we have seen quite a bit of bipartisan support on some of our legislation
we had 122 democrats vote with us on the continuity of government bill 50 democrats voted with us on the class action bill 73 democrats voted with the republicans on bankruptcy reform and 42 supported our repeal of the death tax and the real id
so we look forward tomorrow to having our democrat colleagues from across the aisle join us as we move forward on our nation s energy policy
i also want to thank the gentleman for the wonderful leadership that he has shown on this bill
madam speaker i thank the gentleman so much for his thoughts and i thank him for his leadership on the committee on energy and commerce and the gentleman from texas is exactly right
it is an issue that affects our children and as he said it is an issue about the economy about security and how we need to look at our sources of oil our security and many times we feel we are too reliant on foreign oil which we are
madam speaker i thank the gentleman for his leadership on this issue and for his diligent work on behalf of his constituents and on behalf of all americans as we are working on this bill and bringing it forward to the house getting it ready to move forward and looking forward to the time that the president signs this into law so that we do have an energy policy
we have to think about the impact of this on the economy
i thank the gentleman from nebraska and at this point i yield to the gentleman from colorado mr beauprez xz4000200 who has been a leader on the energy issue has done a wonderful job for his constituents in the state of colorado and is going to talk with us for a few minutes about anwr and the implications of anwr
it is like putting a quarter on the dining room table that is the relationship of that space
so i thank the gentleman from colorado for his work on the issue
the gentleman from idaho who is a member and a leader on the committee on energy and commerce has certainly worked on some of the issues dealing with refineries and permitting
during the 107th congress that the gentleman from idaho mr otter xz4003050 spoke about that was 20012002 the republicanled committee on energy and commerce held 28 hearings related to a comprehensive energy bill
one of the things that we have all learned so well in our public service is if you want less of something pile on the taxes pile on the regulation because you are going to get less of it
i thank the gentleman from idaho mr otter xz4003050 for his good work on this effort
a gentleman who has been a leader on the issue of small business and taxation and regulation and how that affects our economy is the gentleman from iowa mr king xz4002201
i appreciate the leadership that the gentleman shows in the committee on the budget and in the republican study committee as we work to lower taxes and spending and address appropriate regulation
this bill does that and does put the focus on biodiesel biomass ethanol wind hydropower hybrid cars hydrogen fuel cells solar power and all of those alternative and renewable energy sources so that we will have a goal of reducing that dependence on foreign oil
i yield to the gentlewoman from north carolina ms foxx xz4006430 for her comments on the bill
as we continue with our debate as we were saying earlier we will be looking at electricity and we are going to have some provisions in this bill that the federal government is going to lead on energy conservation issues
this bill is virtually identical to dick cheney s energy task force and where the house has been these last 4 years with concerns notwithstanding the enron scandal skyrocketing gasoline prices and demands on scarce oil supplies in unstable parts of the world
it is true that lots of people have been working very hard on this bill but i would suggest that never have so many worked so hard and so long to do so little to change the direction of this country s energy future
for the sake of the country one hopes that there will come a time when the needs and wishes of the public is heard and it will be reflected in an energy policy for this century costeffective and rational preserving the quality of life rather than operating on the cheap
there is much discussion on the floor about things that are mandatory
the conserve by bike amendment recognizes that it is time to better understand the positive effects that bicycling can have on the conservation of our energy resources
mr chairman i appreciate the gentleman s courtesy in yielding me this time and permitting me to speak on this and for his bringing this forward
intelligent transportation has tremendous potential for energy savings to put money back in the pockets of taxpayers and consumers around the country and it is an example that we do not have to make this equation quite as hard as we tend to on the floor of the house
i appreciate the gentleman s leadership in focusing on the notion of the 800 billion that is spent dealing with energy in this country
i appreciate my colleague s leadership in focusing on what impact research and technology can have in this critical area
by focusing on intelligent transportation it will be one important area of research application that will make a difference for millions of americans it will save hundreds of millions of gallons of fuel and it will improve the quality of life for our communities in the offing
the second point is that we have not voted on this
the ever growing concerns about energy reliability the enron scandal skyrocketing gas prices increasing demands on ever scarce supplies in unstable areas of the world all have not produced a change in the mindset of congress
wind and solar energy are abundant and nonpolluting with a fraction of the resources lavished on traditional energy sources alternative energy could increase the production and reduce cost
in oregon pacificorp is in the process of relicensing a number of dams on the klamath river
i am disappointed that congress defeated a number of democratic amendments that would have boosted fuel efficiency removed language allowing drilling the arctic national wildlife refuge kept in place important consumer protections and reduced our dependence on foreign oil
and for the leadership of this chairman the leadership of the chairman of the committee on ways and means and the leadership of the chairman of the committee on resources i am grateful
i am also grateful to our friends on the other side led by the gentleman from michigan mr dingell xz4001100
while they may not have agreed with all of the final product certainly many parts of this product benefited from the work they did on this committee
we are now going on sixteen years with no energy plan for america and it is not for lack of trying
keeping the lights on should not be a partisan issue
louis ever runs short on their boutique fuel gas stations there ca nt sell what consumers could buy back in springfield
the energy bill we will vote on tomorrow caps the number of these special fuel blends and allows communities faced with a shortage due to unforeseen circumstances such as a refinery fire a waiver to use conventional gasoline
this plan relies on simple economics if we create a larger market for a greater amount of gasoline we ll help drive prices down
this bill will not lessen our dependence on foreign oil and it will do nothing to reduce energy prices
our growing dependence on foreign oil puts us at the mercy of unstable and unfriendly foreign regimes
we would start every day 500 millionplus in the hole on our balance of trade because of the imported oil
so what do we do to reduce our dependence on foreign oil
the federal energy information administration found that last year s energy bill would have almost no impact on energy demand and energy prices and that bill if anything made more of an effort to tame consumption
at a time of fiscal crises and record oil prices the bill provides new mandatory spending that will go directly to the oil industry and it provides mandatory breaks for the oil industry on royalties
here is what the president said last week on that issue with 55 oil we do nt need incentives to oil and gas companies to explore the president s budget devoted 72 percent of its proposed energy tax incentives to alternatives
while the house has been writing a bill based on ideological purity rather than careful analysis others have come forward with bipartisan sensible balanced approaches to energy policy
groups like the national commission on energy policy and the alliance to save energy and the energy future coalition have all offered carefully considered proposals that could have formed the basis of an effective bill with republican credentials
first we can not become less dependent on foreign oil unless we increase the fuel economy of our vehicles
we are on a collision course with disaster
second we have been losing ground on fuel economy
so i hope that when the senate comes back with this same provision as i expect they will we will be able to work it out based on the facts
i am especially pleased at its focus on renewable energy and i thank chairman barton for including my renewable energy production incentive repi legislation in the bill
teaming together with private enterprise we can become less dependent on using fossil fuels for our homes and our cars
to address that need and its impact on our economy this legislation also helps expand domestic exploration
it is critical for our nation to have a national strategy on energy so we can clear many of these hurdles looming in our future
again i wish to thank chairman barton for his diligence and effort on this legislation
mr chairman i want to thank the gentleman from michigan for yielding this time to me and commend him on his outstanding leadership with regard to the energy bill now before us
of particular interest to me is the title on coal which would provide for the implementation of the clean coal power initiative to develop projects that would utilize clean coal technologies
coal is our nation s most abundant natural resource for energy production and it is appropriate that we take steps to accomplish the goal of incenting coal use and thereby relieving to some extent the pressure that we are experiencing at the present time on natural gas prices
i am concerned however that the bill before us includes a provision that would cap spending on the implementation of the reliability standards
i want to conclude these remarks by complimenting again the gentleman from michigan mr dingell xz4001100 on his outstanding leadership and also complimenting the gentleman from texas mr barton xz4000180 of the committee on energy and commerce
he was willing to work in a bipartisan fashion in order to establish consensus on a number of these measures
it would create reporting requirements based on the recordkeeping requirements under the federal securities laws for all wholesale energy transactions
it would increase civil and criminal penalties under the federal power act modeled on the penalties established in the sarbanesoxley law
it would direct the ferc to review approved marketbased rates on an annual basis to remain sure that they are fair and reasonable as circumstances change
the people in anwr are counting on this congress to do the right thing and allow them the rightful owners of these mineral rights to begin developing the sources that were granted to them upon statehood in 1959
the increasing use of hybrid vehicles shows that a marketbased approach to increasing fuel efficiency is a better way to reduce american oil consumption than by placing arbitrary standards on automobiles that harm our domestic manufacturers
we are at a point in our nation s history where we can not afford to turn our back on any reasonable power source to meet our nation s energy needs
during our committee hearing on february 16 2005 we had a lively and substantial debate on the mtbe limited defective product liability waiver contained in the energy bill
and during our markup last week the committee considered a number of amendments on the mtbe provisions including several offered by mrs capps
during our hearing on the 16th we heard testimony from many different people including mr erik olson on behalf of the national resources defense council
the gentleman has done a magnificent job leading the committee on this new bill
mr chairman i want to thank the gentleman for engaging in this colloquy with me addressing the department of defense dod s concern in any decision ferc would make authorizing the siting of liquefied natural gas facilities lng on or contiguous to our defense installations
should a proposal to site an lng terminal be on or adjacent to a military installation or range i believe there would be concerns that should be addressed as to whether there may be an impact upon military operations training and readiness
i have spoken with the officials at the department of defense and assessing nonmilitary impacts to installation operations and training is something they are capable of and in fact do on a regular basis
it is my belief the department of defense should have a role in assessing the impact of such proposed sitings to be considered on or contiguous to a military installation or range
this legislation is the result of hundreds of hours of work developing a plan that will reduce our dependence on foreign oil improve our economy and create jobs
it provides for safer stable and more reliable energy sources within our own country making us less reliant on oil from the middle east
they pass on huge costly problems to other parties
in this case hr 6 would shift the costs of cleaning up mtbe groundwater contamination on to the towns the cities and the water districts around this country
even the chairman of the committee on energy and commerce has acknowledged that
it still went on adding it to gasoline
recent court cases regarding responsibility for mtbe groundwater contamination have come down on the side of local water companies and cities
after it sued cambria was able to get chevron to pay a 9 million settlement to help the town to build a desalinization plant but under this bill the taxpayers of cambria and of hundreds of towns large and small across this country would be forced to pay for the mtbe cleanup on their own
we should support the point of order and take this terrible provision out which is going to force our constituents to shoulder the burden of cleanup on to the constituents
the republican leadership knows it could well lose a vote on such amendment
i wanted to offer an amendment to strike this provision because in its wisdom the house leadership would not want to vote on this
perhaps it is because too many members on both sides of the aisle represent districts with bad mtbe problems in places where lawsuits are pending
this is cbo s analysis of the bill and i quote section 1502 would shield manufacturers of motor fuels and other persons from liability for claims based on defective product
mr chairman i yield 1 minute to the gentleman from michigan mr dingell xz4001100 the ranking member of the committee on energy and commerce
first i appreciate the leader s acknowledgment on process because the process is very important
i think the debate that we are having on the floor should have been had prior to the rule being brought under a very partisan environment for passage on the first day of session
i served on the ethics committee for over 6 years during some very difficult times including the bank issues including a charge against the speaker of the house
in my entire time on the ethics committee we never had a partisan division
it is interesting to point out that the investigation and the charges that were held against speaker gingrich brought about a lot of controversy on this floor
there were some votes that took place on the floor of the house that were recommended against by the task force that changed some of the recommendations and we had a motion to recommit to try to clarify that
the gentleman is correct on the final vote but the package itself was very much developed in a bipartisan manner through the task force in a way that it should have been done contrary to the process that was used on this rules package
mr chairman let me make four quick points on this amendment
but the bottom line is that the process that is in this legislation which supplants the existing process in my judgment tramples on the rights of the states and the individual communities as they have indicated in their letters to us to be able to influence these decisions that are made
if you read this carefully you will see that hr 6 requires ferc to consult with the state but it clearly removes the directive that ferc base its decision on community support or opposition which it does now
on the other hand for the states and the local areas to give up their jurisdiction and their ability to influence this decision i think would be absolutely wrong
for instance it says on page 13 the term federal authorization means any authorization required under federal law in order to construct expand or operate a liquefaction or gasification natural gas terminal including such permits special use authorizations certifications opinions or other approvals as may be required whether issued by a federal or state agency you are basically taking what has been partially codified and developed by procedure and you are trying to codify it here in what is a much tighter measure giving to the energy commission the ability to make the decision and overrule what happens at the state and local levels
twentythree of the state s 82 generating facilities run on coal and employ over 2 883 employees
the technology exists today to make all vehicles to go farther on a gallon of gas while improving safety and consumer choice
this amendment would save american consumers money at the gas pump protects the environment and cuts america s dangerous dependence on oil
finally i supported a motion to strike a provision in hr 6 that has been identified by the congressional budget office as an unfunded mandate on state and local governments and the private sector
this provision shifts the cleanup of methyl tertiary butyl ether mtbe burden on communities and the federal government
fact this bill makes our country more dependent on fossil fuels from places like the mideast as scientists of all ideologies have stated that the limited amount of oil will not result in a lessening of oil dependency for the us fiction opening anwr will weaken opec and strengthen the us fact the bush administration s own department of energy contradicts this point when it determined last year that if world oil markets continue as they currently do opec could countermand any potential price impact of arctic refuge production by reducing its exports by an equal amount
fact drilling in anwr will not lower gas prices at the pump will not protect our national sovereignty and will not reduce our dependence on foreign oil
specifically the solis amendment would strip out language that cynically allows refineries to move into economically distressed communities override federal environmental laws trample on local zoning laws and ignore community opposition to set up shop
while i represent new york city and do not see any oil refineries planning to set up shop there any time soon this amendment is an attack on all communities facing tough times and will lead to greater victimization of people suffering
that is a lot of miles on the highway to do business and a lot of money at the gas pump
this spike in gas prices has real consequences for people in wyoming whose drives to work are measured not by the length of the country and western song on the radio but by the entire country and western album
when our country was threatened by terror attacks on 911 congress acted
this bill will cut our reliance on foreign energy and put our focus where it belongs on domestic production
it will strengthen america s standing as the nation with the most strict environmental laws on earth
it will streamline the process to safely explore for new energy sources and put us on the road to energy selfsufficiency
america s energy policy at this critical time should pioneer the use of renewable fuels and move our nation away from dependence on fossil fuels
at a minimum national energy legislation should reduce our dependence on foreign oil however the us energy information administration has concluded that the legislation before us today will not support the development and wide usage of renewable fuels or even reduce our reliance on foreign oil
similarly hr 6 would provide 2 billion to support research on recovering oil and gas resources from the deep waters in the gulf of mexico despite the fact that oil companies are generating record profits
while the groups who met with vice president cheney were clearly focused on maintaining the status quo in america s energy policy there are in fact many things that can be done to decrease our dependence on fossil fuels and particularly to decrease our dependence on foreign oil
further we can increase spending on the development of bioenergy and other renewable fuels
however the president s shortsighted fiscal 2006 budget proposes to limit expenditures on these initiatives to just 60 million
such reductions in spending on bioenergy especially given the provisions of the hr 6 are misguided
i urge a no vote on this legislation
i have not had a chance to speak on the floor but i thought this fit right in line with environmental justice
the gentleman from california mr pombo xz4003220 did that in 1996 and my colleagues on the other side fought that tooth hook and nail
the bill could be made much better including by an amendment that i have offered that the committee on rules refused to be made in order
what this bill does is undermine that process that has worked very well for decades and the rule deprives the house of representatives of an open and honest debate about the fact that this bill is tantamount to repeal of the coastal zone management act and i do not think any member of congress wants to stand on this floor and admit or agree that we should repeal the coastal zone management act
we are once again remarkably trampling on the rights of our states
the beaches on the coast of state of the florida should be judged and policed by the governor of the state of florida not by somebody in an agency in washington
mr chairman i support this bill so that we can and the public can rely on the energyconscious information that they are getting and that they know that is correct and accurate and they can move forward with that
our constituents must be able to rely on these facts to be the energyconscious consumers they want to be
second our country will always have to rely on foreignproduced oil
the president s own energy administration have said this bill will have only negligible impact on production consumption and imports of oil
what this bill does is to authorize more money for existing energy producers to increase oil drilling in sensitive areas for sources of supply that will not greatly reduce future reliance on foreign oil
a major report by the national commission on energy policy advocated enhancing oil security by reforming and significantly strengthening vehicle efficiency standards
drilling there would not address the nearterm supply of oil and therefore gas prices and is not projected to have a major impact on reducing dependence on foreign oil
there are a host of other issues that affect my constituents on the coast of california
these relate to the ability to appeal decisions under the coastal zone management act and incentives for drilling for oil on the outer continental shelf
in addition the bill increases the power of the federal energy regulatory commission the body which has failed to order appropriate refunds for california utility consumers based on the 20002001 manipulation of the power market
while i applaud a number of measures like continuing the energy star program for appliances and providing grants of 50 million in 2006 to develop or promote photo voltaic technologies these measures are modest compared to the overall need for investing in alternative energy sources and passing measures to decrease our dependence on petroleum
a recently released gao report requested by the committee on government reform confirms that doe contract management should remain on the gao highrisk list
our committee on government reform which has jurisdiction over the federal civil service and therefore the creation of new layers of bureaucracy unanimously agreed to strike this section from the energy bill when the committee marked up our provisions last week
based on conversations with my colleague that support the creation of these new positions this is an issue that i pledge to work with them on as the bill moves through the conference
mr chairman i ask unanimous consent for 1 additional minute on each side
madam chairman over the past couple of years i have corresponded with the department of energy on an issue of particular concern to me
regarding question numbered 2 of the 2003 letter we have been informed that while the district judge accepted the defendants standard of proof for injuries that decision was soundly reversed by the ninth circuit on the merits
i recently learned that federal judge nielsen on march 30 2004 rejected the motion of dupont and general electric that they be dismissed from the case because they contracted with the government to run hanford
rather we should be reducing our dependence on foreign oil by improving our energy efficiency and maximizing our domestic energy production in an environmentallysound way by investing in cleaner more secure energy sources such as solar wind biomass and fuel cell technology
my state of connecticut is a leader in fuel cell technology with several businesses doing research that is on the cusp of revolutionizing the way our nation powers its homes cars and businesses
mr speaker the house will convene on tuesday at 2 pm
any votes called on these measures will be rolled until 6 30 pm
on wednesday and thursday the house will convene at 10 am
the gentleman has touched on many points
i am advised and i stand to be corrected but having served on the committee on appropriations the rules allow that once we pass the april 15 deadline for having a budget the committee on appropriations is allowed to start their work without a budget
i am advised also by the gentleman from california chairman lewis of the committee on appropriations who is walking in front of me right now and hopefully will correct me if i am wrong that the gentleman from california chairman lewis has begun the appropriations process in earnest and he has a very ambitious schedule
in fact i am told that we will have the opportunity to schedule appropriations bills for the floor by the middle of may and i anticipate not anticipate we have set as a schedule another way of putting it we have turned over the schedule to the committee on appropriations to get their work done
so i would assume that we could have a conference report on a budget hopefully by the first of may
obviously i can not anticipate what the committee on rules may do on this bill
i do recall that in the last congress when we approached the energy bill there was i think at least 20 if not more amendments allowed on the bill
the speaker of the house looked at the last few years and decided that the rules allowed the use of the committee on standards of official conduct for partisan purposes and its ability to act in a bipartisan way was seriously hindered
the committee on its own decided to change the way they operated from the past
this committee and the last committee had decided on their own that without consulting with the affected member to send a public letter and release the underlying documents to support their position without the opportunity for a member to face the committee and discuss those letters of warning the speaker felt very strongly that that undermines the rights of every member both democrat and republican to due process
that suggestion by the speaker as the gentleman knows was brought to this house and debated extensively on this house floor and those amendments to the rules were passed by the entire house with some nay votes i understand
i am advised through the speaker that the chairman of the committee on standards of official conduct is working with his ranking member and i would hope that they would come to some sort of agreement in how we get past this impasse
on the process side the gentleman is correct
and i do not want to secondguess the speaker and the gentleman may well have a good argument on process
now what happens in practice is if that member that has been charged receives from the committee that they are moving towards an investigative subcommittee that is a huge hit on that member whether he is guilty or not
mr speaker i appreciate the comments by the gentleman who worked so hard on that bipartisan ethics reform taskforce that made recommendations to the house
and i appreciate that the gentleman is trying to protect those rules that he worked on
but i remind the gentleman that when those rules were voted on both gentlemen from maryland voted against the rules they are trying to protect today
i do not know what the result of that has been but i know that the speaker has been informed by the chairman that he is more than willing to work on those issues and i know the speaker told me that he is open to fixing that time problem that the gentleman brings up and is concerned about
this was voted on september 18 1997 and it was on the recommendations for reforming the committee on standards of official conduct and the gentleman that worked on the recommendation and the gentleman speaking voted against the recommendations not on the house rules package
a commission would just open up the whole recommendations that the gentleman from maryland worked on and the gentleman from louisiana worked on
and i have got to tell you the members on your side of the aisle as well as my side of the aisle better think about this very seriously because we do want to protect the integrity of the institution
the bill also forecloses a vote on the billions of dollars bestowed in this bill to producers of mtbe
are we being allowed to debate and vote on this amendment which would inconvenience powerful oil and gas producers
i urge my colleagues to see to it that we teach the rules committee that their function is to facilitate debate not to deny members the opportunity to discuss matters of importance on this floor
it jeopardizes not only fish but the overall health of our river systems and the recreational activities that they sustain and it confers unfairly rights on people while not taking the same care of the concern of the citizenry generally
madam chairman it is regrettable indeed that we function under such a constrained rule but the amendment which i have been permitted to offer here contains real benefits for electricity consumers and includes many of the reforms that i and other of my colleagues have proposed in committee markups on the house floor and in conference during consideration of various energy bills
the liability waiver amounts to a massive unfunded mandate on local governments and citizens
mr chairman the language of this bill which appropriates 310 million from the nuclear waste fund to carry out the purposes of the nuclear waste policy act of 1982 does not on its face present policy concerns
as the us supreme court ruled in its 1993 opinion lincoln v vigil it is a fundamental principle of appropriations law that where congress merely appropriates lumpsum amounts without statutory restriction a clear inference may be drawn that it does not intend to impose legally funding restrictions and indicia in committee reports and other legislative history as to how the funds should or are expected to be spent do not establish any legal requirements on the agency nonetheless report language that conflicts with an agency s statutory responsibilities warrants a response
interim storage is likely to divert doe s funds and attention just when the department needs to focus on submitting a license to the nrc and on getting yucca mountain up and running
when the same collection of fossil fuel dinosaurs and tax loophole lobbyists come here and order congress to fill er up with special favors they seldom go away on empty national security demands a balanced energy policy that encourages more new energy technology and renewable alternatives
our families health depends on clean air and water but this collection of tax breaks loopholes handouts and waivers ensures only continued healthy profits for some of the worst polluters in the world
take for example the synthetic fuel provision that i tried unsuccessfully to strike in the committee on ways and means it is really about tax dodging through synthetic accounting
unscrupulous companies get what some estimate to be up to 4 billion a year by spraying starch on coal or pine tar on coal
that is why enron was about to embark on this gimmick that so many companies have abused and which this committee on ways and means refuses to end
this energy bill is not just about overreliance on fossil fuels
with our security at stake when so much of the world s oil is located in areas as inflammable above ground as the fuel they hold underground with our families health dependent on not letting the quality of our air and our water deteriorate even further than it has under this administration this energy bill is the latest example of spending today while the future will be billed in dollars safety and health
mr chairman today we are about to further our independence on foreign sources of energy
the solution is not more litigation and lawsuits but recognition that the federal government pushed mtbe on our communities and now our communities need our help
i would particularly like to commend the chairman and the staff in working with both sides here on this bill
additional funds are provided for priority work on advanced scientific computing high energy physics and operation of user facilities
we must keep america s scientific knowledge strong and on the cutting edge
in my home state of pennsylvania which is not normally thought of as a state closely tied to the automotive industry a total of 220 800 jobs are dependent on the industry 39 700 of these people are directly employed by it and when you add in other spinoff employment we are talking about over 220 000 jobs in pennsylvania alone
mr speaker the committee on rules may meet next week to grant a rule which could limit the amendment process for floor consideration of the energy policy act of 2005 which is expected to be introduced monday april 18 as hr 6
any member wishing to offer an amendment should submit 55 copies of the amendment one written copy of a brief explanation of the amendment and one electronic copy of the same to the committee on rules up in h312 of the capitol by 12 noon on tuesday april 19 2005
members are advised that the combined text from the committees of jurisdiction should be available for their review on the committees web sites as well as on the committee on rules web site by tomorrow friday april 15
i wish we could have made a lot more amendments in order but we made 30 amendments in order on this measure
i believe that we are going to allow for the debate to take place on a wide range of issues
i want to congratulate all of my colleagues and committee chairmen who have worked on this
we have been this close this close to making it happen in the past mr speaker and unfortunately the fact that we have not been able to make it happen in the past has played a role in increasing the cost of gasoline has played a role in ensuring that we have not been able to pursue alternative sources of energy has played a role in making us more dependent on foreign sources of oil
so mr speaker i will say that i believe that we now are on the verge of what will be another great bipartisan victory in this congress
i am very proud that democrats and republicans have come together in large numbers on both sides to pass bankruptcy reform legislation class action reform legislation our continuity of congress bill permanent repeal of the death tax and passage of the real id
this amendment contains a number of provisions designed to reduce dependence on nonrenewable energy sources
i can not support hr 6 as it is written today despite my great affection for our chairman who was more than fair when we had the markup in the committee on energy and commerce but this bishopmarkey amendment would provide critical improvements to it
i do not believe there is a commitment on the majority side to look at renewable fuels
i am very disappointed and i urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this amendment
the intense polarization of the energy debate has been compounded by the leadership s insistence on repeatedly forcing congress to consider essentially the same bill
congress had a great opportunity to produce a balanced energy policy that is diversified reduces our dependence on oil and invests in alternative energy but our leadership chose to essentially recycle an old bill that favors special interests over consumers
american energy policy is at the crossroads and our national security is being compromised daily by our dependence on foreign energy supplies
although i appreciate chairman barton s willingness to extend hearings on energy this year prior to the 109th congress s consideration of the energy policy act i was very disappointed that a letter that 14 of my colleagues and i sent to chairman barton at the beginning of february requesting that our committee invite the national commission on energy policy to testify went unanswered
new york which banned mtbe on january 1 2004 will long be dealing with the repercussions of mtbe contamination
in and around jamaica queens where more than a million nyc residents and businesses rely on groundwater instead of surface water from the upstate reservoirs mtbe has contaminated much of the groundwater supply in the aquifer
the first which i introduced during the house energy and commerce committee consideration of hr 6 expresses the sense of congress that energy cooperation between the united states of america and israel is mutually beneficial acknowledges the cooperative agreement between the us and israel and states the department of energy should report on past and future cooperative energy projects between the us and israel
as the cochair of the congressional oil and national security caucus i know we need to ensure that our energy policy is diversified reduce our dependence on oil and create skilled jobs while reducing energy costs
its passage will set us on the right path by encouraging the creation of new technologies by promoting renewable energy sources by modernizing and expanding our energy infrastructure including our power energy infrastructure and encouraging conservation
i believe we need to move forward on this bill
the bill paves the way for building energy facilities on the outer continental shelf including areas subject to gas and oil drilling
in listening to state leaders about this bill i could not find anyone from the governor on down who has said that this is a wonderful bill and it should be supported and passed
under this rule i do not think we even have the opportunity to debate and vote on the most important amendments dealing with them
dear governor schwarzenegger on april 13th our committees the house committee on energy and commerce and the house committee on resources completed work on elements of a comprehensive energy bill that will come before the full house of representatives as soon as april 20th
as we and other members of the delegation determine how to best represent the interests of our state we believe it s important to understand your views on some of the key provisions before us as well as your overall position on the legislation
they were part of the conference report on hr 6 which was considered by the house and senate in 2003
under this bill states will not be allowed to present new evidence to the secretary and the secretary will not be allowed to seek out evidence on his or her own
the secretary will only be allowed to rely on the record compiled by ferc
energy related facilities on the outer continental shelf ocs provisions from hr 6 the bill will give the department of interior permitting authority for alternative energy projects such as wind projects situated on the outer continental shelf ocs
it also grants the department of interior authority to permit other types of energy facilities including facilities to support the exploration development production transportation or storage of oil natural gas or other minerals these facilities could be permitted within coastal areas currently subject to congressional moratoria on oil and gas leasing
in a time of skyrocketing gas prices this new mandate amounts to hidden tax on california motorists which will subsidize a single industry located largely in the midwest
under current law federal resource agencies can impose conditions on a hydroelectric license for the protection of natural resources and wildlife
under the bill a dam operator and only a dam operator will be entitled to a trialtype hearing before a resource agency to dispute the evidence that the agency uses to justify placing conditions on a license
we believe there are many other aspects of the legislation which will have a negative impact on our state but these provisions clearly run contrary to the interests of california and we believe they will undermine the policies and positions the state is pursuing under your administration
before the delegation votes on this legislation members should have the benefit of your views on these provisions and the bill as a whole
this legislation is too important a matter for the nation s largest state to be silent on
therefore we ask for your input before the house votes on this legislation this week
sincerely lt center gt anna g eshoo lt center gt lt center gt lt em gt committee on energy and commerce lt em gt lt center gt henry a waxman lt center gt lt center gt lt em gt committee on energy and commerce lt em gt lt center gt lois capps lt center gt lt center gt lt em gt committee on energy and commerce lt em gt lt center gt grace f napolitano lt center gt lt center gt lt em gt committee on resources lt em gt lt center gt george miller lt center gt lt center gt lt em gt committee on resources lt em gt lt center gt hilda l solis lt center gt lt center gt lt em gt committee on energy and commerce lt em gt protection council sacramento ca april 4 2005
dear representatives waxman eshoo capps and solis thank you for your march 15 2005 letter to the california ocean protection council regarding the pending national energy bill and your concerns about potential impact of this legislation on ocean and coastal protection
the california ocean protection act is intended to help california coordinate and act on ocean and coastal issues of statewide and national significance
at our first meeting on march 21 the council discussed the need to maintain strong ocean and coastal protection measures
as a council we did not suggest a position on the energy bill but reached consensus on the need to reaffirm california s position on the following ocean and coastal protection issues congressional oil and gas moratorium
the council opposes any effort to lift the congressional moratorium on offshore oil and gas leasing activities that has been protecting our shores since 1982
we appreciate the opportunity to provide input on these critical issues facing california and other coastal states
finally any proposal that would give way to the lifting of the moratorium on offshore oil drilling along our coast is abhorrent to the vast majority of california s voters and its public officials
on march 21 the other members of the ocean council joined me in expressing opposition to this socalled energy bill as the council s first official act
dear representatives barton and dingell on behalf of the california coastal commission the commission i write to express our strong objection to provisions in the energy bill that would compromise the outer continental shelf ocs moratorium on oil drilling seriously weaken the coastal zone management act czma protection of states rights and eviscerate california s role in siting new liquefied natural gas lng terminals
such an inventory would seriously undermining the longstanding bipartisan legislative moratorium on new mineral leasing activity on submerged lands of the ocs that has been included the commission also objects to proposed amendments to the czma
dear representative eshoo the california public utilities commission cpuc strongly opposes the liquefied natural gas lng provisions in section 320 of title iii of the energy policy act of 2005 epact and urges you to vote in favor of any proposed amendment to strike section 320 from title iii during markup which we understand will take place on tuesday april 12 2005
it is not a question for us should there be lng terminals on the west coast including california
it was the ferc who rejected the cpuc s request for a hearing in that proceeding even though the proposed lng facilities at the port of long beach would be in a densely populated area and built on landfill with 27 active for these reasons we urge you to oppose section 320 and vote in favor of striking the lng provisions from the proposed epact
so when a member rises on the floor and talks about retroactive and it is not fair to have something retroactive we have to have the arm of the law reach back so consumers are refunded the dollars that they were ripped off
four on march 3 2003 a coalition of california governmental entities and public utilities presented the ferc with more than 1 000 pages of evidence documenting a pervasive pattern of market manipulation that resulted in disastrous effects on prices and reliability and in march 2003 the ferc confirmed that significant power manipulation had taken place in the west
mr chairman in a cautionary letter to the president last month a group of defense experts including conservatives robert mcfarlane frank gaffney and boyden gray said the following with only 2 percent of the world s oil reserves but 25 percent of current world consumption the united states can not eliminate its need for imports through increased domestic production alone our dependence on foreign oil is putting our country in a perilous situation
no constituent is going to stand up and say put the tax burden on us and allow the industry to get away with it
let us not stand on the wrong leg and try and defend something that is indefensible
so i ask my colleagues on a bipartisan basis let us do the right thing
instead the burden of mtbe clean up will fall entirely on states and localities
it s an unfunded mandate and a tax on the american people
in response to the public health threat 42 states have established action levels cleanup levels or drinking water standards for mtbe 19 states have imposed full or partial bans on mtbe in gasoline
with oil prices hitting record levels and repeated predictions that the cost of a barrel of oil could hit over 100 in the coming years we should be focusing our efforts on alleviating our nation s dependence on fossil fuels
hr 6 should have been an honest bipartisan effort to halt america s growing dependence on fossil fuels for energy
it could have been focused on developing new technologies improving energy efficiency promoting renewable energy and conducting the research and development that could produce the breakthroughs that would power the world of tomorrow
instead of creating a truly comprehensive plan for addressing our energy needs this legislation sets us on the wrong path making us more reliant on oil than we already are
it will not help consumers save on energy costs and it will not help the us become energy independent
this legislation sends us in the wrong direction by relying on the fuels of today to provide energy in the future
in order to create a policy that looks to future needs and us security we can not rely on increased drilling and oil refineries
finding new efficient clean renewable sources of energy is not just better than continuing down the path hr 6 sends us on it is necessary for the security of the us
we are missing an opportunity here as a future energy policy this legislation is bumbling along because of following the policies in this bill would be like driving into the future by looking through the rearview mirror with its heavily weighted dependence on fossil fuels
based on the proindustry recommendations of the cheney energy task force report this bill is antitaxpayer antienvironment anticonsumer and is loaded down with specialinterest giveaways
by contrast only about six percent of the tax breaks would go to energy efficiency and renewable energy incentives that could actually save consumers money and reduce our dependence on dirty energy sources
according to the bush administration s own energy department estimates this republican bill will actually increase gas prices by 3 cents and will have virtually no effect on production consumption or barrel prices
these include changes in lng terminal siting weakening the coastal zone management act and expanding alternative energy projects situated on the outer continental shelf ocs
under hr 6 states will not be allowed to present new evidence to the secretary and the secretary will not be allowed to seek out evidence on his or her own
the secretary will only be allowed to rely on the record compiled by ferc
hr 6 will give the department of interior permitting authority for alternative energy projects such as wind projects situated on the outer continental shelf ocs
i urge my colleagues to oppose this legislation so we can develop a comprehensive energy policy that looks to the future and does nt rely on repackaged outdated technologies from the past
we appreciate the chairman and the committee s hard work on this bill
in the 1940s rose bay was a productive estuary and shellfish harvesting area on the halifax river in volusia county
i would ask the chairman s help along with the committee s to do everything we can to get this project back on the appropriate steps forward
on a more personal note i also want to thank the chairman for supporting the green brook flood control project which is in my district in new jersey
for more than 5 years the gentleman from new jersey mr frelinghuysen xz4001420 as a member of the committee on appropriations has been a champion for the green brook flood control project
the gentleman from ohio chairman hobson and every member of the committee on appropriations has a considerable task and responsibility of prioritizing local projects
we could have boosted our nation s commitment to renewable and efficient energy thereby curbing our reliance on foreign oil creating 21st century jobs protecting the environment and providing affordable and reliable energy for america s families
we could have taken on the oil companies that are gouging all our constituents at the gas pumps
yet the republicans on the rules committee shot down this common sense amendment preventing us from even taking a vote on it
with the highest child asthma rate in california imperial county certainly needs the help but the republicans on the rules committee once again turned their backs on us
namely the amendment would create a 3 billion program over the next 10 years to provide incentives for car manufacturers to dramatically increase their production of hybrid and advanced diesel vehicles and for consumers as well mr chairman to purchase those vehicles at a discount and get them on the road as quickly as possible
hr 6 makes every effort to address our dependence on foreign oil
this small amount that would go towards the development of hybrid vehicles would allow us to do two or three things right away mr chairman first to increase our fuel standards without addressing some of the more controversial ways that came up on the floor yesterday involving cafe standards and increases there
a hybrid honda insight is rated at 61 miles per gallon in the city and 70 miles per gallon on the highway
a comparable traditional honda civic gets just 32 miles per gallon in the city and 37 miles per gallon on the highway
it is one that has no partisan stripes only an effort to help clean up the environment find ways to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and create good old american jobs here in this country
so i guess i should congratulate you on the bipartisanship of your contempt for democracy
our bill includes essential funding for energy programs that seek to make our country more efficient and less dependent on traditional fossil fuels and foreign oil
this bill also prioritizes the army corps work on a number of essential navigation and flood control projects to ensure that such construction projects authorized by congress are actually completed
the economic return on keeping open our nation s third largest port to larger container ships is huge
for too many years madam chairman our domestic energy policy has languished driving investment overseas and increasing our reliance on foreign energy resources
yet we continue the cycle of tolerating irresponsible energy policies continuing to discourage investment in domestic energy production and subsequently becoming more dependent on foreign sources of energy
relying on foreign and sometimes hostile nations for energy and minerals jeopardizes our national security madam chairman
hr 6 also contains provisions to spur production of renewable energies such as geothermal so we can reduce our reliance on traditional sources
through this important legislation we will have increased ability to utilize the vast renewable energy resources on our public lands in an environmentally responsible manner
i urge all of my colleagues to support the passage of this legislation that will allow us to capitalize on our nation s energy exploration and development technology commitment to environmental quality and conservation and work ethic to develop our domestic energy resources
this is the area we are going to be drilling on for oil and gas
i thank the gentleman for yielding me this time and for his great work on this bill
mr chairman this country needs to create a new energy landscape that begins shrinking our disproportionate reliance on foreign energy sources and begins building one that places american ingenuity producers and consumers at the forefront
mr chairman i rise to congratulate my good friend the gentleman from texas mr barton xz4000180 the chairman of the committee on energy and commerce for his leadership in forging a comprehensive cohesive energy policy for our nation
mr chairman i seek the assurance of the gentleman from texas mr barton xz4000180 that he will work with me and concerned others on language that clarifies the commodity futures trading commission s exclusive jurisdiction with respect to accounts agreements and transactions involving commodity futures and options
first i would like to thank the gentleman from new york mr boehlert xz4000350 chairman of the committee on science and the gentlewoman from illinois mrs biggert xz4000270 chair of the subcommittee on energy for their hard work and cooperation in developing the foundation of title ix the r amp d title of this bill
while the bill on the floor today has provisions that are not acceptable to many democrats and republicans there are good points worth mentioning in title ix
i would also like to highlight the work of several of our members on key components of doe research and development in title ix the interest of the gentleman from california mr honda xz4001850 in the progress of the next generation lighting initiative the stanford linear accelerator and the joint genomics institute and his work with the gentleman from connecticut mr larson xz4002330 on transit bus demonstrations of fuel cells the continued dedication of the gentlewoman from california ms woolsey xz4004360 and the gentleman from colorado mr udall xz4004131 to clean renewable and efficient energy technologies the work of the gentleman from illinois mr costello xz4000820 to ensure that utilization of our vast coal resources only gets cleaner and more efficient the vision of the gentlewoman from california ms zoe lofgren xz4002450 in support of domestic fusion energy research and international fusion projects the work of the gentleman from tennessee mr davis xz4000971 to ensure good science continues at oak ridge national laboratory particularly in the area of highend computing the efforts of the gentleman from north carolina mr miller xz4002781 to establish a nationwide network of advanced energy technology transfer centers to get technologies off the laboratory shelf and into the marketplace finally the tireless commitment of the gentlewoman from texas ms jacksonlee xz4001990 to research and development at historically black colleges and universities and other minorityserving institutions
the committee on science contributed virtually all of title ix the research and development title of this bill
i am proud to say that i have long been a proponent of banning oil and gas drilling on the great lakes and have voted to do so at every possible opportunity
congress has a history in support of banning drilling on the great lakes
however the time has come to end the uncertainty surrounding drilling on the great lakes
while i am disappointed the rules committee has prevented the house from including a ban on drilling on the great lakes i plan to work night and day with my colleagues to get a permanent ban approved either in conference or as a standalone piece of legislation
in particular i plan to push for the inclusion of a ban on oil and gas drilling in the great lakes
very quickly i want to thank the chairman for inclusion of a number of provisions in the bill such as the provision encouraging the siting on liquefied natural gas lng which is important to energy security to cut into the rising natural gas prices that threaten our economy
the bill contains a study on liheap reform
madam chairman i thank the chairman of the committee on resources for yielding me this time
the doom and gloom scenarios by opponents of anwr oil are inaccurate and not based on reality
mr chairman i reluctantly rise in opposition because the gentlewoman from california ms solis xz4003840 is a good member of our committee and we work on lots of issues together
mr chairman i guess this is a postponed vote on mtbe
it is an issue we have been dealing with at least in the committee on energy and commerce for a number of years
mtbe is on the way out and being cleaned up around the country regardless of the amount of litigation
states can still deny lng facilities on their coasts
i want to thank the gentleman from ohio mr hobson xz4001800 the gentleman from indiana mr visclosky xz4004170 and also the gentleman from texas mr edwards xz4001180 for their assistance on these projects particularly two flood projects hunting and greens bayous in my district
thousands of my constituents homes and businesses are at risk from catastrophic flooding in these areas and the funding in this bill 500 000 and 150 000 each keeps these projects on track
this funding means we are on track to complete the deepening and widening this year and begin the barge lanes and environmental restoration
financial stability is essential and large investments are made on the basis of congressional appropriations
it seems unjust that the solution to restore the letter and spirit of the law falls on the backs of the most recent victims of reprogramming such as our houston ship channel who had reprogrammed dollars not returned
i regret that members of my staff were not able to meet with you on september 12 2001 to discuss this project in more detail
based on conversations with your office and mr william dawson of my staff the following information will address your primary concern
the us army corps of engineers remains fully committed to completion of this project based on the optimal construction schedule
i continue to appreciate your patience and willingness to work with us on this matter
this project funded by the corps at 28785 million realistically requires 468 million to keep it on an optimal construction schedule
given the discrepancy between the fy 02 corps budget and the amount of funding required to keep this project on schedule i am requesting that the corps return the full amount of reprogrammed money to this project in its fy 02 budget
if you have any questions on this matter please contact bob turney in my washington office at 202 2251688
the corps of engineers southwestern division is fully committed to completion of the project based on the most optimal construction schedule
based on this analysis i have determined that these funds are truly excess to this year s project needs
if i can be of assistance on any other matter please feel free to contact me
maintaining this optimal construction schedule is a priority for us because it will add an additional 281 million to the project s return on investment and save taxpayers 635 million in increased escalation and investment costs
mr chairman i yield 1 minute to the gentleman from west virginia mr rahall xz4003310 the ranking member of the committee on resources
i urge a yes vote on this amendment
we can not let our country to get into a situation where we are absolutely dependent on foreign sources of oil without this rule we are dependent
we are already certainly currently today dependent on foreign sources for 62 percent of our nation s supply
hr 6 will decrease our country s dependence on foreign oil by increasing domestic gas and oil exploration and development on nonpark federal lands
of equal importance to me in this bill is my provision on ultradeepwater and unconventional onshore natural gas
this is a good bill and a good rule a bill that has been worked on and debated for five years
its purpose is to promote conservation reduce our dependence on foreign oil improve our economy and create new jobs and probably keep our young men and women from having to fight a war for energy when we have enough energy at home if we pass this bill
i m proud to support it and i urge my colleagues to do the same by voting yes on this rule
we have also included the on road and offroad diesel rules in the fuel harmonization study
we also tried to avoid a 64 million score on our employee benefits amendment we adopted in committee
some of our other changes include clarifying that the 3year time period in which the federal government must establish energy efficiency standards on certain products be prospective only
finally madam chairman i want to thank the gentleman from california mr pombo xz4003220 chairman of the committee on resources the gentleman from california mr thomas xz4004010 chairman of the committee on ways and means the gentleman from new york mr boehlert xz4000350 chairman of the committee on science the gentleman from virginia mr tom davis chairman of the committee on government reform the gentleman from alaska mr young xz4004401 chairman of the committee on transportation and infrastructure and their staffs for helping us put together this manager s amendment and i ask for its adoption
accordingly the committee rose and the speaker pro tempore mr lahood xz4002280 having assumed the chair mr simpson acting chairman of the committee of the whole house on the state of the union reported that that committee having had under consideration the bill hr 6 to ensure jobs for our future with secure affordable and reliable energy had come to no resolution thereon
we are going to go to work on the senate to try to get those two votes that we have not been able to get in 4 years over there 4 years
as we listened on our philco radios we heard him make these speeches
we supplied them their entire energy thrust and they depended on us for it
it was a war to keep a bad guy named saddam hussein who is now in a cage from getting his foot on half the known energy sources in the entire world
we can drill on anwr
as the gentleman from texas chairman barton pointed out section 631 of the bill reported by the house committee on energy and commerce i do not know how many votes were against it but the committee authorizes a modest research and development program it is 10 million a year over a 3year period
mr chairman on the blumenauer amendment i rise to say that we will accept the amendment
i might go on further and say that this amendment essentially provides for the expansion of national policy for the benefit of one type of fuel the pseries fuel and the one technology that can produce it
the production quantities of the fuel are so minimal that it is unlikely to have any part of an impact on a national scale
for this reason it does not please me to oppose a member of congress who is supporting his own and goes that extra mile for his constituents that he represents but i have to point out that actually this will not have an impact on a national scale and is not a matter of national policy
the study shall include an analysis of the impact of such consolidation on the retail price of gasoline small business ownership other corollary effects on the market economy of fuel distribution local communities and other market impacts of such consolidation then at the very end it says the comptroller general shall submit such study to the congress not later than 1 year after the date of the enactment of this act it could delay it as much as a year
i urge a no vote on this amendment
madam chairman i thank the chairman and my colleagues on the committee for moving forward such an excellent package as part of the energy bill
i urge my colleagues to support this bill and i especially commend my colleagues on the committee on ways and means for the tax provisions
the legislation we have on the floor today will go a long way towards giving our nation the sound comprehensive energy policy that our citizens need and deserve
our nation is too dependent on a fickle foreign oil market that is being stretched to the limit by global demands
it reduces our dependence on foreign oil by expanding domestic supplies and allowing oil and gas exploration right here in the united states
it launches a stateoftheart program to have emissionfree hydrogen fuel cell vehicles on the road by the year 2020
more importantly it eases america s dependence on an unpredictable foreign market
and in stark contrast to the protestations of my friends on the left we are willing to embrace these technologies
the committee on appropriations approved this bill unanimously on may 18 and i believe it is a good bill that merits the support of the entire house
i want to explain a couple of things about the corps as we go through this and take a little time on this because some of this is a change
we took steps last year to put the corps on the road to fiscal recovery by eliminating the number of new starts and concentrating resources on the completion of ongoing construction projects
while this ratio may not be a perfect measure of merit of all the projects the budget request represents good faith from the omb to concentrate the corps limited resources on finishing the most worthwhile projects that are already under construction
we think this is not good management and we have done a lot in our bill to try to focus the corps on these continuing contracts
we also propose a spent fuel recycling initiative to stimulate some fresh thinking on how this country deals with its spent nuclear fuel
the department of energy estimates that each year of delay on yucca mountain costs the government an additional billion dollars half from the legal liability for doe s failure to begin accepting commercial spent fuel beginning in 1988 as required by the law and the other half from the costs
it is time to rethink our approach on spent fuel
i would note that we are already storing foreign reactor fuel on doe sites
secondly we propose a modest slowdown of life extension work on the old warheads in preparation for a shift to the newer replacement warheads
frankly in the long run i am hopeful the secretary s task force on the nuclear weapons complex will propose some sensible steps to modernize the doe weapons complex and bring it into line with these coming changes in the size and composition of the stockpile
we provided an additional 65 million to keep the plutonium producing reactor shutdown program with the russians on track to have all three reactors closed by 2011
i want to thank all the members of the subcommittee on energy and water development and related agencies for helping to bring this bill to the floor today
i also want to thank the chairman of the committee on appropriations the gentleman from california mr lewis xz4002392 and the ranking minority member the gentleman from wisconsin mr obey xz4003000 for their support and for allowing us to move this bill forward in such an expeditious manner
lastly i want to thank the staff of the committee kevin cook our clerk john blazey scott burnison terry tyborowski and tracy laturner for their work on this bill
the appropriations committee approved this bill unanimously on may 18 and i believe this is a good bill that merits the support of the entire house
we took steps last year to put the corps on the road to fiscal recovery by limiting the number of new starts and concentrating resources on the completion of ongoing construction projects
while this ratio may not be the perfect measure of merit for all projects the budget request represents a goodfaith effort from the office of management and budget to concentrate the corps limited resources on finishing the most worthwhile projects that are already under construction
this is not sound financial management and suggests that the corps is more focused on moving money around frequently to meet the corps determination of project needs irrespective of the allocations provided in annual appropriations
much of this problem is driven by the corps misplaced emphasis on expending 99 percent continuing contracts are a related problem
also the corps uses accelerated earnings on continuing contracts to pay its contractors more than is appropriated for a project in the current fiscal year
in part these accelerated earnings on continuing contracts are one of the drivers for the corps extensive reprogrammings and also one of the mechanisms the corps uses in its pursuit of the 99 percent expenditure goal
we also propose a spent fuel recycling initiative to stimulate some fresh thinking on how this country deals with its spent nuclear fuel
the department of energy estimates that each year of delay on yucca mountain costs the government an additional 1 billion half from the legal liability for doe s failure to begin accepting commercial spent fuel beginning in 1998 as is required by law and the other half from the costs
second we propose a modest slowdown of life extension work on the old warheads in preparation for a shift to the newer replacement warheads
we provided an additional 65 million to keep the plutonium producing reactor shutdown program with the russians on track to have all three reactors closed by 2011
lastly i would like to thank the staff of the subcommittee kevin cook john blazey scott burnison terry tyborowki and tracey laturner for their hard work on this bill
he reads these things and understands them and i very much appreciate his remarks on the bill on behalf of both myself and the ranking member
i do not see any reason for the secretary to consider making a private site or a site on tribal land into a doe site for interim storage
let me close and say i want to thank my ranking member because we have worked together on this bill
accordingly the committee rose and the speaker pro tempore mr simpson xz4003760 having assumed the chair mr goodlatte chairman of the committee of the whole house on the state of the union reported that that committee having had under consideration the bill hr 2419 making appropriations for energy and water development for the fiscal year ending september 30 2006 and for other purposes had come to no resolution thereon
it is a highbtu lowsulfur fuel and is considered the cleanestburning solid fuel on the commercial market today
one of our priorities should be to reduce our dependence on foreign oil
a company in gilberton pennsylvania in my district is ready to do convert this waste coal to diesel fuel and electricity on a large scale
mr chairman it is my understanding that i also have 1 minute remaining on the underlying amendment
mr chairman on the second order amendment how much time does the gentlewoman from connecticut have remaining
the tests themselves need to be changed not an afterthefact fudge factor so that when you go into the showroom to purchase a car and you see the number in the window for city mileage and highway mileage you will have a reasonable expectation that that car when used on actual american streets and actual american highways will give mileage comparable to what is posted there
what if you had a monitor maybe on your cell phone maybe at the bus stop that would tell you what the schedule is where the bus is now and when the bus will be at your stop
mr chairman i rise in opposition to the energy legislation that we are debating on the house floor today
unfortunately rather than providing a productive and clear vision that leads this nation towards energy independence this bill subsidizes oil and gas companies and eases environmental regulations and fails to put the us on the right path
it does authorize increases in research on efficiency and renewable energy in future years
our dependence on foreign oil affects not only our economy but also our national security
on behalf of the residents of the 12th district i pledge to continue to work toward the development of a balanced comprehensive energy plan one that finds environmentally friendly sustainable ways to decrease our dependence on foreign oil and slow the degradation of our planet
however i do support title ix and i am proud to be the ranking member of the committee on science s energy subcommittee which authored this portion of the bill
also included are research programs into distributed energy and electric energy systems which will make us less reliant on fragile transmission grid and the next generation lighting initiative which will reduce future demand for electricity through efficiency
we have also increased support for the basic sciences at the department of energy generally and focused on several programs in particular such as nanotechnology research and development advanced scientific computing research and fusion energy sciences
it is a credit to the collegial bipartisan nature of the committee on science members and staff that all of these important provisions are included in a product that both sides of the aisle can support
what we need is to put a strategy in place that will help this country over time become less dependent this bill does not do enough to make this nation less dependent on energy be it from imported or domestic sources
we need a bill that focuses on our longterm future needs not one that is stuck in the past
mr leader tomorrow is a day on which the conference report on the budget is supposed to be adopted as you well know
in light of the fact that the speaker has not yet decided who he wants to appoint as conferees does the gentleman have any thought as to when we might contemplate having the conference committee meet and then of course the conference report on the floor
i ask that from two perspectives one as the representative of the party who would like to know what is going on as i am sure the gentleman would as well and secondly as an appropriator
i would be pleased to yield to my friend the gentleman from california the distinguished chairman of the committee on appropriations
my presumption is then mr chairman before he leaves the floor my presumption would be for the members of the house and also for the members of the committee on appropriations that the committee on appropriations will proceed as if the house numbers were the numbers
am i correct on that
given the schedule the gentleman has just announced would the gentleman expect the bill to be on the floor both wednesday and thursday
given the time that is allocated to this bill i presume as the leader has apparently indicated that it is the expectation of the committee on rules to have a full amendatory process
am i correct on that
i know that on our side we had a discussion on that bill this morning
although they live relatively close by it is a 45minute commute in traffic and a lot of gas and they spend a lot of money on gasoline
efforts to move the ethics process forward have failed so far both in committee and on the floor when virtually all of the members on the gentleman s side of the aisle now twice have voted to table motions that would have provided for the appointment of a bipartisan task force to make recommendations to restore public confidence in the ethics process
we oppose that change as the gentleman knows as does the former chairman of the committee on standards of official conduct the gentleman from colorado mr hefley xz4001740
he and the gentleman from west virginia mr mollohan xz4002810 have a bill and that bipartisan resolution has now 207 cosponsors and that would simply return the ethics rules to where they were adopted bipartisanly proposed bipartisanly by the livingstoncardin committee and it would return to a place where we believe the committee on standards of official conduct would not be at impasse
i would respectfully inquire given that background which the gentleman knows of course if and when we might see house joint resolution 131 on the floor
we have a difference of view on the change that was made from the livingstoncardin and houseadopted ethics rules which provided for an investigation of any member to go forward unless a majority of the committee disposed of it
that meant as the gentleman knows that it would have to be bipartisan because the committee is equally divided so we would have to have at least one other member assuming one party was united on either side one other member of the other party to join in the disposition of a case
unfortunately it is our perception i say to the gentleman that what the speaker because the gentleman said the speaker wanted to protect the members what the speaker has done from our perspective and we think from the perspective of many is created a process where on the inaction of the committee based upon a tie vote so that a partisan group can stop an investigation that the investigation will thereby be dismissed
there were only a few votes i think we were almost unanimous on our side which is not unusual which is why the ethics rules has historically been separate and apart perhaps in the rules package but agreed to in a bipartisan fashion
mr hefley the former chairman i do not agree with mr hefley xz4001740 on a lot of things but i do agree with his perception of how we protect the integrity of the house
there may be people on my side of the aisle who agree with your perception and not mine
but there was agreement on the rules package as it related to the committee on standards of official conduct and the reason for that is because both sides felt it to be very important
reclaiming my time i think we both agree on that
the gentleman from maryland mr cardin xz4000640 wanted to say something but i wanted to say you were right on the process
i was incorrect on the process
it was a separate vote on a separate package and you are right that i and the gentleman from maryland mr cardin xz4000640 and others voted against it
it was not on these provisions as you know because a change was made not in a partisan sense according to the gentleman from maryland mr cardin xz4000640
mr speaker the united states of america needs an energy strategy that not only reduces our nation s dependence on foreign sources of oil but also strengthens our national security
the united states dependence on imported petroleum poses a risk to our homeland security and to our economic wellbeing yet mr speaker this republican energy bill does virtually nothing to reduce our dependence on petroleum products
it depends on the hope that somehow dead dinosaurs will appear underneath the continent of the united states where they just do not exist
that is not what happened to this bill where 94 percent of the subsidy goes to an industry the most profitable in american history one company had 8 billion profit in the third quarter last year on your 55 a barrel oil
that is what is going on in this bill
we need to get back on the fuel efficiency wagon as we were in the 1980s on a bipartisan basis and not put a mustache on the mona lisa
it is still a mustache on the mona lisa for our most pristine areas
reduce it from about 2 300 on average to about 1 100 per megawatt
now we want to maximize it on our public lands
we have several projects in washington state in fact on public land in washington state we have at least 600 acres very eligible for economically efficient production of wind energy
it directs the comptroller general to study the effects of consolidation on prices on market economics and small business ownership
and lower prices on the street corner have also become a thing of the past
in 2002 the senate committee on government reform permanent subcommittee on investigations studied consolidation of fuel refineries
the subcommittee did not focus on wholesale and retail consolidation
there have been a number of studies but each study has been conducted almost in a vacuum without considering the entirety the entire scope of this problem a problem that is putting small independent retailers out of business and driving up prices on every street corner in america
we are not taking a position necessarily on the issue
not a single hearing on the pros and cons of the consequences of shifting zoning authority away from the states and to the federal government was held
first of all i am grateful that the committee on science had an opportunity to provide insight into this legislation
i have an amendment that i will be discussing later on in the day that speaks to the purpose of my standing today in general debate and that is to make i think the declaration that we clearly need to have an energy policy
in fact i had an initiative that would report on the deposits in texas and louisiana offshore so that we could be more independent of foreign oil and do more domestic drilling in a safe and environmentally manageable way
in the united states additional changes in gasoline specifications and tight refinery capacity can be expected to increase operating costs slightly and limit supply flexibility adding further pressure on pump prices
thus as the bill moves along the legislative process i will be working with members and industry to establish a sense of the congress that the secretary of energy acting through the administrator of the energy information administration should commence an immediate investigation on the causes of high gasoline prices in the united states and in collaboration with the petroleum industry and the congress develop a solution to such prices
i believe that the effects of rising energy prices have had and will continue to have a chilling effect on our nation s economy
we must bring to this debate a vigor and vitality that will enliven our efforts to not have a future of energy have and have nots due to out of control energy demand with few creative minds working on the solution to this pressing problem
mr chairman i thank the ranking member and the chairman of the subcommittee for their work on this bill
i appreciate very much the 47 billion in funding provided to the army corps of engineers but let me express my disappointment that we have not been able to stretch the dollars to provide work on new projects
more importantly having worked on legislation dealing with inland flooding i can tell you that flooding is a very serious issue in my district
might i also acknowledge my concern on the funding for nonproliferation in nuclear weapons
i am very pleased that the appropriations committee rejected the administration s proposal to prioritize army corps of engineers water projects based on the projected revenue they would bring to the government
obviously the needs of this nation change on a daily basis
mr chairman let me first say thanks to you and the ranking member for your work on this bill
i appreciate very much the 47 billion in funding provided to the army corps of engineers but let me express my disappointment that we have not been able to stretch the dollars to provide work on new projects
more importantly having worked on legislation dealing with inland flooding i can tell you that flooding is a very serious issue in my district and i would look forward to working with this appropriations subcommittee through conference to be able to provide some greater assistance
mr chairman might i also acknowledge my concern on the funding for nonproliferation in nuclear weapons
i would like to commend the chairman and ranking member of the energy and water subcommittee of the appropriations committee for their excellent work on crafting this bill
i am very pleased that the appropriations committee rejected the administration s proposal to prioritize army corps of engineers water projects based on the projected revenue they would bring to the government
obviously the needs of this nation change on a daily basis
i commend the committee for its leadership on this issue
we are being accused on every front of employing double standards as we march on in war and talk about peace in the middle east as we spurn our own neighbors in cuba but ask people in the occupied territories or in korea or in south asia to forgive and forget as we talk about liberating people but allow tens of millions to die from hivaids in africa
we do not need through my work on the science committee i have come to understand the amazing new technologies on the horizon that will decrease our reliance on foreign sources of fossil fuels and help preserve our environment for generations to come
i understand the needs again i thank the chairman and the ranking member for their work on this bill
my amendments presented to the committee on rules would have corrected this or would have also given some time for the companies to record their progress but of course they were not made in order
roads pipelines drilling platforms and communities to support personnel all involve disturbing this critical natural habitat by moving a great deal of extremely heavy equipment across fragile lands by locating multiton rigs and whole communities of people to support the drilling operation on this fragile land base
on the other hand the national petroleum reserve and other areas are capable of providing far more oil
we do not need to drill on the anwr plain
so this vote is not about oil it is about our values and how we balance the value we place on a critical environmental resource and its ecosystems and the value we place on exploration in a lowyield area
mr chairman i reserve the balance of my time on the rogers amendment so that we can move on to the gentleman from new jersey s mr holt xz4001840 comments on our amendment
mr chairman i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from new jersey mr holt xz4001840 on the rogers amendment
the overreliance of the united states on imported petroleum creates a major strategic vulnerability for our nation with nearly half the energy supply of our country now imported and that reliance grows every day
my amendment has a goal of taking a small step toward energy independence in the following way we have something called a strategic petroleum reserve managed by the department of the interior which has in that reserve about 700 million barrels of oil allowing us to maintain a temporary shield from increased costs on oil
there is absolutely no reason that biodiesel can not ultimately become part of that reserve and help us to transition off our increasing reliance on petroleum
it asks that those responsible for the current strategic reserve think more creatively take the time to look at these alternative fuels and help put america on a more energyindependent course
and in fact when you come to my part of the country and you look across the fields you can see part of america s future in the fields of the future and fuels of the future that will be produced on them and are being produced on them more and more every day
in fact the reserve could actually be stored in the form of the raw material which is processed very easily and can be done immediately because the processing technology is on line
dear congresswoman kaptur on behalf of the over 260 000 members of the national farmers union we write in strong support of your amendment to hr 6 which will establish renewable fuel reserves as an important foundation to lessening our dependence on foreign oil
we applaud your efforts and we want to work closely with you on making this amendment part of hr 6
we look forward to working with you on this issue and commend you for your dedication to renewable fuels
i want to say thank you to the gentleman who has been such a leader on this issue the gentleman from ohio mr kucinich xz4002270 for cleveland and for our country
it is important to think about new ways of doing things to close the book on the 20th century the petroleum age and move toward a new energy age for america and the world
mr chairman i would just say along with what the gentleman has stated for the record there are over 140 million cars and 85 million trucks on our highways
and today 3 300 000 of those cars and trucks all already are on our highways running on 85 percent ethanol
these renewable energy sources and technologies offer a sensible alternative to help reduce our reliance on foreign sources of oil without endangering our environment
mr chairman on behalf of the citizens of pascoag rhode island who have lived with contaminated water from mbte i rise in support of the capps amendment
i have seen firsthand the devastation that the gasoline additive mtbe can have on our local communities
no child should have to turn on the water faucet to have their tap water smell like turpentine
mr chairman i ask unanimous consent that we extend debate by 2 minutes on both sides
and as we go on the millions of dollars that the industry has put into new development new cars that are energy efficient we will see as time goes on
what we do not want to do is put additional funds additional costs additional measures on the auto industry that is already very fragile
consumers deserve to know that the sticker in their window actually reflects the mileage they will get on the road
nancy johnson s amendment requires the epa to change the testing procedures that auto companies use to determine the fuel economy numbers that go on the dealer label
the rogerskilpatrick perfecting amendment to the johnson amendment achieves precisely the same goal that the johnson amendment strives to achieve accurate fuel economy labels on new cars
if the intent of this change is to create a new test for fuel economy labeling then the burden on automakers to test vehicles for both cafe and fuel economy labeling would increase substantially
this amendment provides the vision for us to start pivoting off from our dependence on fossil fuels generally but the importation of oil more specifically by providing incentives for alternative and renewable energy sources incentives for increased energy efficiency and conservation practices and hopefully the incentive to move to a new energy source for a new century and that is fuel cell development
section 2005 waives federal royalty collections from offshore oil and gas production on the outer continental shelf
mr chairman there are unfortunately many more very bad provisions for american taxpayers in hr 6 and title 20 in particular much of which is premised on a drill at taxpayers expense approach to the management of energy resources on public lands
and there are other provisions that standing alone make this a bad bill such as the royalties in kind provision granting broad authority to the secretary of the department of the interior for permitting alternative energyrelated uses on the outer continental shelf and reimbursing oil and gas companies for doing the environmental impact studies that are required under law
i know there are a number of my colleagues who are anxious to speak on some of these provisions so i welcome their comments and lend my support to their wise concerns
this provision waives federal royalty collections on huge amounts of publicly owned lands
the amendment offered by my friend from arizona mr grijalva would strike section 2005 and restore the collection of royalty payments to the treasury for offshore oil and gas production on the outer continental shelf a measure i helped lead last year and one that i strongly urge my colleagues support
i urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this energy bill that does little to lessen our dependence on fossil fuels or the fossil fuels industry dependence on taxpayer dollars
i echo the sentiments that the gentleman from wisconsin mr obey xz4003000 just gave on the floor and appreciate the hard work that has gone into it
i do appreciate the work that is being done on the yucca mountain funding however
this was a program that was created in the mid1980s to strike balance on the multiple uses of the mississippi region in the upper states
finally mr chairman i would commend to my colleagues and include for the record an article that just appeared in the washington post sunday edition under the travel section called lolling on the river it describes the quality of life and unique beauty that the upper mississippi river basin has for all of us in that region
in it the author of the article bill obrian writes the mississippi the river of mark twain who once wrote it is not a commonplace river but on the contrary is in all ways remarkable the river of lasalle marquette and joliet of bb
lolling on the river following the upper mississippi by land if you think the prairie of wisconsin and minnesota is nothing but nondescript flatlands and farms buena vista park in alma wis is the place for you
from that bluff on a clear day you can see one of the most aweinspiring panoramas in all of north america
the vista from the bluff in alma on a clear day can compete with any of those places
the mississippi the river of mark twain who once wrote it is not a commonplace river but on the contrary is in all ways remarkable the river of la salle marquette and joliet
more it is the river that draws us together as a nation so from the point just outside east dubuque ill where the illinoiswisconsin border meets the mississippi about 175 miles west of chicago sue and i had set out northward on the great river road to see what and whom we might find
on the first day at a boat landing near the town of cassville wis we stopped to chat with dwayne durant a fortysomething iowan
dressed in camouflage hunting gear he was standing on the riverbank in the upper mississippi river national wildlife and fish refuge with his dog sidney
176 we introduced ourselves to a softspoken gentleman in a flannel shirt sitting on a stool at the end of the bar
over coffee neefe rhapsodized about the pleasures of living in a houseboat docked on the mississippi six months a year and he made two recommendations
they ve been doing it this way basically from the beginning the lock at genoa is one of 29 on the upper mississippi
as a barge passes through a lock you can get close enough to chat with the stevedores on board
one deckhand told us that sometimes he stays out on the river for 60 to 80 days at a time
and that he d rather toil on the upper mississippi than on the lower especially in the dead of summer because down near new orleans and memphis it s too hot and the skeeters are bigger than i am an hour north of genoa on state route 35 not far past la crosse wis we came to perrot state park a verdant 1 400acre refuge
there an information marker on a small bluff overlooking braided channels of the river reminded us just how remarkable the mississippi is
some of it s true some of it s not we met schleicher a 65yearold retired car salesman at the municipal marina in red wing minn the final town on our river drive directly across the bridge from hager city wis
he explained that part of the appeal is that you can be whoever you want to be on the river he told tales of riverrunning bootleggers past and present
we had seen a handful of bald eagles soaring over or perched along the river and schleicher beamed as he spoke of the resurgence of that ornithological american icon on the bluffs near red wing
then he suggested that after spending a couple days driving along the river sue and i might want to spend some time on the river
for 10 apiece he offered to take us on a leisurely twohour cruise in his old military flatboatturnedriverboat
once we cleared the dock schleicher allowed each of us in the small group on board to take a turn piloting the boat for a few minutes
as i stood at the helm guiding the boat around the river s trademark sweeping bends minding the red and green buoys that mark the shipping channel passing huge tow barges i suddenly understood what schleicher meant when he said you can be who you want to be on the river
at that moment i was every riverman who s ever skippered a slow boat on ol man mississipp
this rise in prices has contributed to the growing reliance on imported fertilizer
but we sit in this country on a significant supply of domestic crude oil
nothing is going to move during that period of time except the caribou and when those young calves get old enough to walk back they go back over to canada out of the area so nothing would be going on in that region when the caribou were there
by the way the alaska pipeline if the north slope oil runs out and it looks like it is heading in that direction that pipeline has to stay full almost all the time or it starts to erode inside the pipe it turns to rust and it may not be able to be put back up on line
we have started construction now on biodiesel plants we have two plants up and running now we are breaking ground on a third plant that happens to be about 9 miles from where i live as the crow flies on biodiesel
that has made already this district that i represent an energy export center with the ethanol production being up to almost all we can provide and the biodiesel we have started on it very well
it has helped a lot with our energy independence and to become less dependent on foreign energy supplies of all kinds
one of these esteemed gentlemen has made the statement on this floor and i am going to repeat it and i believe it and that is that we have enough known natural gas reserves underneath nonnational park public lands in the united states of america to heat every home in america for the next 150 years
we could be in that same situation with venezuela and russia if we let them take on any more of the fertilizer production
but if we do not we will not be able to keep those plants which means we lose that fertilizer production and makes us dependent on those countries that i named
we mentioned the solar energy as a component and that is going on in some of the parts of the country
we have got hydrogen around the corner and hydrogen may be the answer to much of this but if we put all these pieces together wind and ethanol and biodiesel and natural gas and crude oil hydroelectric the whole list we have got the picture of the pieces that make us less dependent on foreign oil
one of the reasons why we pay so much attention to the persian gulf is that the economy of the west is totally dependent on oil from this region
madam chairman i have the greatest respect for the gentleman from alaska mr young xz4004401 and i simply have a difference of opinion with him on this despite that great respect
some of the nation s largest unions i might point out like the seiu united auto workers united steelworkers and united farm workers are on record opposing drilling in the arctic refuge
one dollar spent on petroleum production creates only 151 in economic value
mr chairman i want to concur with the gentleman from michigan mr stupak xz4003910 who spoke in favor of a federal ban on drilling for oil or gas in the great lakes
water is the oil of the 21st century and we are here acting as though it is not the basis of life on our planet
i want to express my appreciation to the chair for accepting the modification and my appreciation to the gentlewoman from ohio ms kaptur xz4002110 who i have worked with on this amendment that would double the number of department of energy clean city programs that could apply for a pilot program to invest in alternative fuel vehicles
now we are offering this amendment because we believe that farmers and our urban centers can work together to eliminate our dependency on oil
mr chairman i yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman from toledo ohio ms kaptur xz4002110 with whom i have had the privilege of working on this amendment
they will benefit with new and more stable markets our fuel supply is home grown thus reducing our dependence on foreign oil fuel prices are reduced and the air we breathe is cleaner
mr chairman this is a noncontroversial amendment which authorizes a national academy of science study on the feasibility of mustard seed as a feedstock for biodiesel
and we know that farmers are key to eliminating our dependency on foreign oil and that we can grow our way out of this energy crisis
it is imperative that we find those feedstocks that will eliminate our dependency on foreign oil as soon as possible
however where we differ is on how best to achieve those goals
instead i see a policy that promises more of the same and that does not end our nations dependence on foreign oil
it astonishes me that the nation that mobilized to put an american on the moon is not leading the world in developing new clean and renewable energy sources
a recent study by the department of energy noted a deliberate attack on a lng tanker could result in a deadly fire reaching as far as a mile away
i am deeply disappointed in this measure and urge my colleagues to vote against it so that we can refocus our efforts on an energy policy for america s future
mr chairman i just want to first of all express what an honor and privilege it is to work on a subcommittee that works in such a bipartisan way with the great leadership of the chairman and the ranking member
also the tremendous staff that we have on this subcommittee
i think the gentleman from tennessee mr wamp xz4004210 mentioned the great professionalism that they have on both sides of the aisle
i am very appreciative of the fact that we have focused on renewable energy the kind of important work that we do on the river on the mississippi and other projects that are involved also
the proponents of this bill would have you believe that the only way to cure an addict is to feed the addiction at whatever cost regardless of the effect on the environment on our wildlife and on our public health
by allowing drilling in the arctic refuge we are spoiling a pristine natural environment we are furthering our dependence on oil and we are contributing to high levels of asthma such as in my own district in west oakland and throughout the country
reducing dependencies on alcohol and on drugs leads to individuals leading clean and sober lives
our country needs to reduce its dependency on oil for a clean and sober and independent future is what our children deserve
according to the bush administration s own energy information administration the policies contained in this legislation will have a negligible effect on energy production consumption imports and prices
there s 33 billion in oil and gas production tax incentives plus a number of royalty holiday provisions for energy extraction on public lands
we need a balance between energy production on the one hand and greater use of renewable sources of energy and conservation on the other
we need to pass an energy policy that actually brings down record high gas prices protects our environment and truly reduces our dependence on foreign oil by encouraging energy efficiency and the use of renewable sources of energy
and yet according to the bush administration s own energy department the republican bill will actually increase gas prices by 3 cents and will have almost no effect on production consumption or prices as if raising gas prices were not bad enough hr 6 also harms our environment
at this time in history it is crucial that we work to reduce our dependence on foreign oil by prioritizing energy efficiency and renewable energy
on top of these tax breaks provisions in this bill would provide as much as 2 billion over ten years to companies who drill in the deep waters off the gulf of mexico
every day we have pictures on the screen of consumers pulling up to the gas pump paying an arm and a leg for gasoline
this bill tramples on the right of state and local governments to protect their citizens from potentially dangerous energy facilities such as large liquefied natural gas terminals that would be sited right in the middle of densely populated cities in our country even though we know they would be the number one terrorist target constructed in that city
we never had a hearing on it
this bill tramples on the right of state and local governments to protect their citizens from potentially dangerous energy facilities such as large liquefied natural gas lng terminals sited right in the middle of densely populated urban areas
this bill gives utilities who dam the public s waterways special rights to appeal and change conditions federal resource agencies placed on their hydropower license in order to protect fish the environmental irrigation navigation or other public uses of our nation s rivers
so i would say to my republican colleagues you may have the votes to prevail here on the house floor this week but this extreme bill will not become law
let me just begin by saying that inside of the bill there was a provision that i authored in the committee on energy and commerce that was accepted by the chair by the majority
now when you think of all the pollution that comes out of smokestacks that is created by the generation of electricity from coalfired plants or from gasfired plants to create electricity well that electricity is being created in order for the most part to keep our lights on our airconditioning on to make sure that we can live in a modern society
the majority in its wisdom has decided they are going to impose no burdens on anyone who makes any appliances in america so they have to improve their efficiency which is very typical of the entire bush administration s approach to these technologies
it just wants to put a big new gas station on top of the arctic wilderness or on top of any other pristine area in our country rather than looking at the technological genius of our country to find some way of improving our efficiency
it also provides real transparency on pricing and trading of electricity in this marketplace
vote aye on the dingell amendment
besides the wildlife refuges drilling in the arctic refuge is widely seen as the first step in lifting the moratoria on drilling on the outer continental shelf of the atlantic and pacific coasts specifically in florida and california
instead of making those vehicles more efficient what they have decided to do is to construct a gasoline station on top of the arctic wildlife refuge in order to fuel those inefficient vehicles
but congress because of the energy crisis passed a law mandating a doubling of the standards in 10 years and the auto industry responded and by 1986 the average was 27 miles per gallon and we had opec on its back
well we put a man on the moon in 9 years
i thank the gentleman from new york for his leadership on this issue and i am proud to follow his leadership on this amendment
but the president then went on to call upon congress to pass the republican energy bill a bill replete with a rich assortment of tax and deregulatory incentives for the oil and gas companies to explore even though they are essentially already drowning in windfall profits
if members do not want to support increasing fuel economy standards for suvs and automobiles so we can take on opec what we have is another series of alternatives that can be engaged in which are much less draconian but will at least give us some improvement in the way this country interrelates with gas oil and other energy sources
i thank the gentleman from new york mr bishop xz4000311 for his help on this amendment
but the president then went on to call upon congress to pass the republican energy bill a bill replete with a rich assortment of tax and deregulatory incentives for the oil and gas companies to explore a bill that the president s own energy department has acknowledged would result in only negligible changes to overall demand production and imports a bill that the energy department acknowledges will actually increase gasoline prices at the pump by between 35 and 8 cents a gallon
we are giving them royalty relief so they do nt have to pay the public a fair price for drilling on public lands
on the issue of gas prices our amendment says when oil prices are at record highs let s stop filling the strategic petroleum reserve
it expresses the sense of congress that the president should put pressure on opec and nonopec oil producers to increase oil production to help bring down prices
our amendment also would extend the renewable energy production tax credit for 5 years so that companies know that there will be incentives out there to make the investment in building new solar wind geothermal and biomass technologies so we can become less dependent on coal and natural gas to generate electricity
our amendment strikes the cap on energy savings performance contracts an important tool used by the federal government to reduce the amount of energy consumed in federal buildings across the country
finally our amendment includes the dingell democratic alternative amendment on electricity which would preserve the bill s mandatory reliability provisions but delete its proposed repeal of the public utility holding company act
mr chairman this issue is one of whether or not you want the federal government to decide if you are on a coastline in the united states that an lng facility is coming to your district
if you want your governor your mayors to have a role some role in deciding where an lng facility is located which would have catastrophic consequences if there was an accident or terrorist attack you vote aye on the castle amendment
if you just want the federal government to decide in the middle of your district where this most attractive of all terrorist targets will be located then you vote no but understand the consequences on the floor today
we have not had time and the chairman of the committee on energy and commerce spoke about the number of pages in this amendment we have not had time frankly to analyze it from a budgetary aspect to see if it violates the house budget we have already passed
the reason is if we insisted on industry of whatever kind accounting for first in first out it would lead to distortions in the market and it would lead to business decisions based on tax considerations instead of market considerations
despite soaring prices despite dangers to our economy and security for our dependence on oil the administration puts forward the deal of the century for big oil gas and coal
nothing in this bill will alter our dependence on oil
the oil and gas industry is sitting atop a mountain of cash looking down on americans who are held hostage by runaway gas prices that grow the mountain of oil prices even higher
we laughed at him when he put on a sweater and said maybe we should turn the thermostat down 1 degree
profits may be up 400 percent but this bill allows big oil to earn even more money to add to their current 55 billion cash on hand
the democrats propose and i proposed in the committee on ways and means something radically different in our alternative energy bill actually paying for it
imagine that a bill we paid for on the floor of this house
at 3 a gallon for gasoline you are hitting pretty hard on the food budget
republicans want americans firmly rooted in the past relying on fuel sources that make us vulnerable to too many foreign countries
mr speaker pursuant to section 426 on the congressional budget act of 1974 i make a point of order against consideration of the rule h res 219
page 1 line 7 through page 2 line 1 of h res 219 states all points of order against consideration of the bill are waived the rule makes in order hr 6 the energy policy act of 2005 which contains a large unfunded mandate on state and local governments in violation of section 425 of the budget act
section 426 of the budget act specifically states that the committee on rules may not waive section 425 and therefore this rule violates section 426
mr speaker back in 1995 my republican colleagues the socalled champions of states rights led the fight to pass the unfunded mandates reform act a bill they claimed would stop the federal government from imposing the costs of federally mandated programs on states and localities
my republican colleagues are bringing a bill to the floor that imposes a multibillion dollar unfunded mandate on communities around the country whose water supplies have been tainted by the fuel additive mtbe
specifically section 1502 of the energy bill we are talking about today creates a safe harbor for mtbe manufacturers against lawsuits that attempt to hold them accountable for the damage their product has wrought on the water supplies of communities all over the country
the budget act specifically says that the committee on rules can not waive points of order against unfunded mandates yet the republican leadership blatantly ignores this
at the end of this debate therefore i will call for a vote on a motion to continue consideration or fix this problem
my colleague the gentleman from texas mr sessions xz4003670 made the following statement on cbo just a few months ago
he said the congressional budget office is a professional organization that assists the united states congress in knowing in a nonpartisan way those impacts on the laws that we pass
chairman based on a preliminary review of hr 6 the energy policy act of 2005 as introduced in the house of representatives on april 18 2005 cbo estimates that enacting this legislation would reduce direct spending by 11 billion over the 20062010 period and by 04 billion over the 20062015 period
cbo and the joint committee on taxation estimate that the legislation would reduce revenues by 40 billion over the 20062010 period and by 79 billion over the 20062015 period
based on our review of the bill cbo expects that the mandates new requirements limits on existing rights and preemptions contained in the bill s titles on motor fuels title xv nuclear energy title vi electricity title xii and energy efficiency title i would have the greatest impact on state and local governments and privatesector entities
section 1502 would shield manufacturers of motor fuels and other persons from liability for claims based on defective product relating to motor vehicle fuel containing methyl tertiary butyl ether or renewable fuel
the provision would not affect other causes of action such as nuisance or negligence under current law plaintiffs in existing and future cases may stand to receive significant amounts in damage awards based at least in part on claims of defective product
because section 1502 would apply to all such claims filed on or after september 5 2003 it would affect more than 100 existing claims filed by local communities states and some private companies against oil companies
based on the size of damages already awarded and on information from industry experts cbo anticipates that precluding existing and future claims based on defective product would reduce the size of judgments in favor of state and local governments over the next five cbo can not determine whether the aggregate cost of the privatesector mandates in the bill would exceed the threshold established in umra primarily for two reasons
first some of the requirements established by the bill would hinge on future regulatory action for which information is not available
if you wish further details on this estimate we will be pleased to provide them
and today we are considering the rule for another important bill the energy bill and the committee on rules made in order 31 amendments this time
and once again a majority of amendments were shut out from receiving a vote on the floor
important amendments on important issues like global warming a topic not even mentioned once in this bill and mtbe liability protection were denied a vote by the heavy hand of the committee on rules and the republican leadership
mr speaker once again i will vote against this bill because it is nothing more than a giveaway to the oil gas and other energy industries at a time when they do not need these giveaways because it will not lower energy prices for consumers because it does not reduce our nation s dependency on foreign oil and because it harms the environment
so if this bill does not help control the price of gas at the pump decrease our dependence on foreign oil or invest in renewable sources of energy what does it do
to date neither the house nor the senate has held a single hearing on this issue in supporting this language
on november 21 2003 the department of homeland security warned of an increase risk of terrorist attacks noting of particular concern al qaeda s continued interest in targeting liquid natural gas chemical and other hazardous materials facilities
to their credit like many other state and local communities the residents of fall river led by mayor ed lambert have been on the frontlines fighting against this lng facility
this is a very real problem in many communities across the country and the republican leadership should have at least had the guts to allow an upordown vote on the capps amendment
we have a onceinalifetime opportunity to reduce and eliminate our dependency on foreign oil
mr speaker i yield 3 minutes to the distinguished gentlewoman from new york ms slaughter xz4003780 the ranking democrat of the house committee on rules
mr speaker i yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from california ms matsui xz4006631 our distinguished new member of the committee on rules
mr speaker i yield 2 12 minutes to the gentleman from michigan mr dingell xz4001100 the dean of the house and the ranking democrat on the energy and commerce committee
mr speaker how much time remains on both sides
out of 90 amendments that were offered last night in the committee on rules there were 22 democratic amendments made in order
the gentleman from maryland mr gilchrest xz4001490 the gentleman from massachusetts mr olver xz4003010 and the gentleman from maryland mr van hollen xz4004150 had an amendment on global warming to come up with a strategy to deal with it
if we are going to have a real democracy and a real debate on this issue these important issues should have a place for debate here on the house floor
let me just finally say instead of bringing up yet another bill that rewards corporate donors i wish the leadership on the other side would think about the future about the world our children and grandchildren will inherit and give us an energy bill that actually makes the world a better place
well it has taken more than 4 hours but they have finally reluctantly recognized that at least on this occasion a democrat the gentlewoman from california mrs capps xz4000620 has a right to offer an amendment a good amendment that strikes a provision in this bill that protects polluters and penalizes taxpayers
for people who are not familiar with the rules of the house here is what is going on
the purpose of the law was to prevent the federal government from passing bills that impose unfunded mandates on our state and local governments
they issued thousands of press releases patting themselves on the back for this legislative accomplishment
do not pass it on to communities that are already strapped for cash
thanks to the capps amendment you will have the opportunity to go on record as to whether you favor or oppose this unfunded mandate
let me say to my friends in the republican leadership you could have avoided the scene we saw on the house floor today
the gentlewoman from california mrs capps xz4000620 brought her amendment to the committee on rules tuesday night and asked for an opportunity to consider this amendment on the house floor
the california energy crisis and today s high fuel demands are evidence that the nation needs an energy strategy that is focused on clean energy technologies and energy independence
the united states needs to become less reliant on foreign energy sources
unfortunately this bill will only worsen our nation s dependence on fossil fuels imported from the middle east
our reliance on saudi oil is harmful to our environment and our values
that was unlikely to change for the near future no matter what bill we had a chance to vote on
unfortunately this bill does little to put this nation on a path to greater energy independence
despite the bill s claims to meet our nation s energy needs and provide for our nation s future hr 6 ignores a pivotal approach that will reduce our foreign dependence on oil and alleviate our high oil consumption increasing fuel economy standards
we know that fuel economy standards have helped to reduce our dependence on foreign oil
we have a choice do we want an energy future that is stagnant and dependent on traditional sources or do we want a future that will break new boundaries in innovation and technology reduce our dependency on foreign oil increase conservation and efficiency and ensure the security of our nation
to suggest now that we are going to provide a safe harbor that we are going to restrict the liability or prohibit the liability from those who knew of the dangers of this to our environment to our drinking water supplies to our citizens and on the other hand we are going to direct communities to clean this up when in fact the resources will not be available to do that they are not there at the local level and they are not forthcoming from the united states
if we were really seeking to strengthen america s hand with respect to energy and our economy we would do all that is possible to develop a national sustainable energy policy that would minimize our dependence on foreign oil
rather than placing too much of our emphasis on new oil supplies we would build a national energy policy that is based upon the strength of our country rather than its weaknesses
in fact it drives us deeper into the dependence on the most unstable countries in the world into the hands of those countries that simply can not provide stable environments for the production of those energy resources
that means mr and mrs taxpayer in america did not get the royalties that these companies should have paid them to drill on the public lands that the taxpayers of this country own
if the shortfall in supply takes on crisis type dimensions the transition will be much more disruptive economically and socially
unless this bill places our nation on a path toward lower levels of oil consumption greater use of alternative fuels greater levels of fuel efficiency and conservation why should we advance the calendar on the day of reckoning
when it comes to cheap energy and low gasoline prices we have lived on borrowed time
the bill before us does little to wean our nation from its dependence on foreign and unstable sources of energy
had the current president s father adopted tougher cafe standards put us on a gradual path to 27 miles per gallon for light trucks and 34 gallons for cars we would have displaced all oil we import from opec today
mr chairman for the sake of the future of our country and our long term economic prosperity we need to wean ourselves from our dependency on oil
two years have passed since the last time we debated a comprehensive energy bill on the house floor but the majority appears to have learned nothing since that time
while demand from the us and other industrialized nations is growing on average 12 percent the situation in developing nations has radically altered
on its face that may not sound like a lot but it is not sustainable and is largely the cause behind the higher prices we re encountering today
the department of energy on its own web site even suggests that crude oil prices will continue to cost over 50 per barrel
though they are silent on any longterm forecast mr chairman we are an oilbased economy
while coal uranium and some renewable sources such as wind comprise a majority of the fuel used to generate electricity most of our economy is dependent or exclusively reliant on oil from fertilizers for agriculture plastics for manufacturing to gasoline and diesel for transportation
why are we rushing to exploit pristine wilderness areas like the arctic national wildlife refuge and bestowing more tax incentives on some of america s most profitable companies and individuals to tap our last domestic sources of domestic oil and gas when these sources wo nt even make a dent in our oil and gas needs
where are the incentives and subsidies to wean us from our dependency on foreign oil
this bill is shamefully silent on that issue
it rushes us closer to the day shortages occur and sets us backward on our ability to address it
we have doubled the price of fertilizer which increases the price for farmers which is passed on in higher food costs
we need a national energy policy there is no question about it and i congratulate the gentleman from texas mr barton xz4000180 on years of hard dedicated work to bring this to the floor
what can i anticipate on participatory funding down the road
i thank my colleague and i look forward to working with him on this as we move forward toward conference
and as the american people are paying upwards of 250 a gallon for fuel today and we sit in the white building on capitol hill i wonder what they are thinking out there
dear friend in a few short hours the republican energy bill will be brought up for debate and a vote on the floor of the house of representatives
each of these amendments was voted down by the republican majority on the committee ensuring that the most technologically advanced nation in the world will continue to ignore energy conservation and not diminish its demand for oil
the republicans on that committee voted against my amendment choosing to set up a gas station in this pristine national refuge
today i will offer these amendments again on the house floor
help me continue to fight for a sensible clean and independent energy future and shine a light on the republican party s backroom attempts to cater to the special interests by making an immediate contribution
while the government s overall energy strategy is now being discussed in a conference on hr 6 the bill before us today provides a vital additional component of the nation s energy policies
res 95 did allow for an advance appropriation in the elk hills account the committee on appropriations provided for it with a current year appropriation
in conclusion i would like to commend chairman lewis and the appropriations committee on their steady work in bringing bills to the floor that comply with h con
the amendment authorizes the administrator of the general services administration to install a photovoltaic solar energy system photovoltaics in accordance with the sun wall design project on the forrestal building the headquarters building of the department of energy located on independence avenue in washington dc
the sun wall is an engineering and architectural marvel 24 750 square feet of power generating panels installed on the building s south facing wall
with ever rising oil prices and our country s everincreasing dependence on oil the time has come for the federal government to get serious about alternative renewable fuels
the federal government is the nation s largest energy consumer a typical office building is estimated to spend onethird of its operating expenses on energy costs
the corps of engineers regulates activities that would have adverse effect on navigable waters of the united states
i think that the gentleman from ohio and the gentleman from indiana working together in an absolutely bipartisan fashion have produced a bill which is obviously based on some intellectual decisions about how to approach problems rather than being based simply on political judgments and that means that this place is performing as it should perform
as everyone knows high energy costs are the greatest drag that we currently have on our economy and actually on world economy and every year we delay passing this legislation we become more dependent on foreign oil
so it reduces our dependence on foreign oil
i can tell you there is no other place in the world that this argument is going on of whether or not we are going to energize our natural resources energize our native creative genius in order to provide the cheapest and the most abundant and most reliable energy source that we possibly can
in fact i myself have voted on this energy bill
although i have only been in this congress for 4 years and 4 months i have voted on the energy bill four times with the great hope that was going to be one thing as a member from idaho s first congressional district i could leave as a legacy
as the gentlewoman from tennessee mrs blackburn xz4000320 mentioned early on we have not built a refinery in this nation in nearly 30 years
thus we are counting more and more and more for yet another strategic part of our valueadded energy on some foreign country
so for twothirds of our consumption we are now relying on some other country that may be friend or foe and mr chavez has already suggested he is not going to be really friendly towards us
yet we are still relying for twothirds of the strategic element for our economy on some other nation
we are relying on their labor their tax base
we are relying on building up their economy in order to support our own rather than doing that ourselves
so they may have increased since 30 years ago when the last one was permitted they may have increased 6 or 7 percent but they do not want to go beyond that or it will be very expensive to go on
madam chairman i rise today in support of the energy bill that we are discussing on the floor
what is happening is that we are outsourcing jobs to those other nations because they are paying onetenth the price for natural gas that we are paying here and yet our friends on the other side of the aisle some days want to talk about outsourcing jobs and the horrific effect that it has on the economy and today we are doing something factual about it and yet they want to turn an eye and say that is okay send those jobs we probably did not need them to start with
we are drilling on some offshore platforms that cost billions of dollars to set in place
we are drilling on those with great risk that we will lose money and what we are simply saying is that deep well incentives should be in place
the consumers in this nation depend on it and they are depending on republicans because our friends on the other side of the aisle refuse to help
we face limitations on production based on the lack of availability of labor
i want to commend four of our ranking members the gentleman from michigan mr dingell xz4001100 of the committee on energy and commerce the gentleman from west virginia mr rahall xz4003310 of the committee on resources the gentleman from new york mr rangel xz4003330 of the committee on ways and means and the gentleman from tennessee mr gordon xz4001550 of the committee on science for their exceptional leadership in presenting an alternative view to the republican bill that is on the floor today
it is imperative that our country have an energy policy for the future and it is a matter of national security that we reduce our dependence on foreign oil so that we will be able to take care of our own security and not have to send our troops in harm s way for oil
the opportunity is here really for an energy bill that would put our country on the right path
madam chairman according to the bush administration s own department of energy this republican bill will actually increase gas prices by three cents a gallon and will have almost no effect on production consumption or prices
by arbitrary caps on private spending to improve the reliability of our nation s electricity grid the bill goes wrong
second the bill is antitaxpayer and i know that the gentleman from california mr stark xz4003870 and some of the members of the committee on ways and means addressed some of these concerns
the provision on the gasoline additive mtbe a few drops of which can poison entire drinking water systems the provisions in this bill for mtbe are a breathtaking example of pandering to special interests
you are poisoning the water supply you do not have to stop for 9 years you have no liability for contamination and on top of that we are going to give you 2 billion in subsidies 2 billion in subsidies to help mtbe manufacturers
the provision on mtbe included in this bill at the majority leader s insistence killed the bill in the last congress and the gentleman from texas mr delay xz4001040 the majority leader is insisting on including it again this year
i urge my colleagues to vote yes on the democratic amendments for an energy policy for the future and i urge my colleagues to just say no to the gentleman from texas mr delay xz4001040 disgraceful mtbe giveaway and his outdated boondoggle of an energy bill
mr chairman i thank the distinguished gentlewoman from california for yielding me this time and i thank her for her leadership on protecting the environment and the health of america s children
the gentleman from texas insisted on the mtbe provision in the last congress even at the cost of killing the energy bill
he insisted on it again this year
republicans are not even giving mtbe polluters a slap on the wrist
they are giving them a pat on the back
these organizations say that this provision agrees with the congressional budget office that it amounts to a massive unfunded mandate on local governments and citizens
yesterday congresswoman allyson schwartz of pennsylvania requested a waiver from the rules committee so that she could offer this amendment on the floor but she was denied that opportunity
a democratic energy plan would set us on a faster course toward energy independence by investing more of our valuable resources in clean renewable energy resources promoting new emerging technologies developing greater efficiency and improving energy conservation
unless a business can make a reasonable return on its research investment it can not afford to invest in r amp d
and unless the business is a monopoly this requires the r amp d to lead to a patent on a device or a process that can be marketed
we have built the world s largest economy on the inventiveness of our citizens and our willingness to make the investment needed to advance our society
i call on members to defeat the previous question so we might consider an alternative rule that would allow congresswoman schwartz to offer her amendment during the debate on funding energy priorities today
madam chairman i think i am on a different bill than i just heard described here
just to compare we are 40 percent higher on natural gas than europe
you know you go back 30 years ago and the united states was dependent on foreign energy about 30 percent
but we did not adopt the kind of policies that we had to to increase the amount of domestic production so that we were not so dependent on foreign oil
and that is a direct result of the failure on the part of congress to pass a national energy policy
last year we had an amendment to make it easier to site renewable energy on federal lands
and the same people that are down here today opposing this bill opposed that bill on renewable energy
there was so much support for this bill coming out of the resources committee it passed on a voice vote
madam chairman i yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from alaska mr young xz4004401 chairman of the committee on transportation and infrastructure
madam chairman i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from texas mr barton xz4000180 chairman of the committee on energy and commerce
mr chairman i ask unanimous consent to claim the time on our side
mr chairman i could stand here all day and discuss some of the problems that are currently plaguing the department of energy but as chairman of the subcommittee on the federal workforce and agency organization within the committee on government reform i am growing more and more convinced the department of energy is not only experiencing problems relating to how to remove nuclear waste but also other energyrelated projects
mr chairman when the committee on government reform and the subcommittee were considering the energy bill i introduced an amendment to strip this position
i urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this bipartisan amendment
the committee on resources opposes this amendment because of problems with a definition within the amendment that will prohibit many private landowners from participating in this program
the fact that federal resource agencies mandate restrictive conditions on the operations of hydropower projects without comprehensive analysis of their impacts or an independent review of these conditions is unacceptable
i rise in opposition to the pending legislation surprise because it will do absolutely nothing to lower the price of motor fuel and reduce america s dependence on foreign oil
but has that stopped the republican majority from bestowing such largesse on some of their biggest benefactors
because when one pulls the curtain aside on this bill what we find is a wacky old fellow pulling the manipulating levers reaching deep into the treasury and deep into the pockets of ordinary americans
it is in effect a direct assault upon all other coal including coal from my home state of west virginia and it is a direct assault on consumers jobs and the economy and the communities which rely on coal from states like west virginia who are not given special treatment under this provision
yet under the rule governing debate on this bill i was denied the ability to offer an amendment to strike this provision an effort that came very close to succeeding when the house last considered this bill
could it be that because i came so close to knocking it out of this bill on the house floor of the last congress i was denied that opportunity this year
could it be because the republican leadership fears debate on this provision and will only allow amendments that they can bet the house will fail to pass
all of this all of it is why every newspaper in my congressional district that has editorialized on this bill has editorialized against this bill
i urge a no vote on the bill
madam chairman i yield 4 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from california mr george miller xz4002780 the distinguished former chairman of the committee on resources
mr chairman and both sides of the aisle i stand with president bush on this issue
there will not be revenue enough for you to distribute if we do not collect the royalties on ocs production
i urge my colleagues and from the gulf states especially to support this amendment and also i urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle support president bush on this
believe me if they could get 40 miles to the gallon in an suv they would be on these front steps having a press conference selling these things
mr chairman parliamentary inquiry how do we get to the chairman s 2 12 minutes remaining on the primary amendment
the gentlewoman from connecticut mrs johnson xz4002051 has done a great job of focusing on a problem that is a problem
we all want accurate numbers on those stickers and times have changed
so let us err on the side of those families
let us stand up today and say yes we should have accurate numbers on these stickers the very true intent of what the gentlewoman from connecticut mrs johnson xz4002051 and the gentleman from new jersey mr holt xz4001840 are trying to do and trying to accomplish
i think my colleagues can be proud of this amendment as amended back in their districts and tell people that they fought valiantly to get the 2005 standards on stickers for cars they are going to buy today
it will foist new unnecessary costs on automakers
the current ozone nonattainment areas the blue areas on this map 217 counties
if there is a problem in supply overnight an immediate problem like we had in arizona last year wisconsin on a couple of times with a pipeline break or a refinery fire the epa has waiver authority on a 20day basis to fix that
in addressing both present and future concerns this plan provides real improvements to our energy policy with the goal of reducing our dependence on foreign oil
for example the increased use of ethanol will not only reduce our dependence on foreign oil but will also benefit our economy and environment
i am also aware however that the committee works closely with the corps in this process and that funding decisions are based largely on the priorities put forward by the corps
with this in mind i am very disappointed that the energy and water appropriations bill that we approved today did not contain funding for the cleanup of a logjam on jacobs creek in my district in coffey county kansas
i am disappointed because i have made it abundantly clear to the corps on numerous occasions that i hear more from constituents about this project than any other corps project in my district
i am disappointed that this crucial project has once again been ignored and i call on the corps to put their resources to work and remedy this situation
unfortunately the bill before us today represents a real missed opportunity to reduce our dependence on foreign oil promote energy efficiency and conservation and improve our air land and water quality
i urge my colleagues to vote yes on the markeyjohnson amendment
our amendment will help protect the environment reduce our dependence on foreign oil and save drivers money at the pump
the united states can not continue on a course of increased oil consumption with little to no regard for the implications it has on our environment economy and national security
there is no better time to focus on reducing our reliance on foreign oil than right now
i support the castlemarkey amendment and would say to my fellow republicans if this is the party that believes in local government and decisions being made on the local level and the state level as opposed to the federal level you would be supporting this amendment
it is essential states be able to evaluate their effect on sensitive coastal areas
mr chairman on april 21 i inadvertently missed a recorded vote
i take my voting responsibility very seriously and would like the congressional record to reflect that i would have voted yes on recorded vote number 130
mr chairman i thank the gentleman from texas mr barton xz4000180 for yielding me this time and for his great work on this bill
it sounds like it is not the bill that i voted on but i am very pleased to support it
we can no longer rely on one fuel source whether it is for electricity generation or to move our vehicles
it addresses a diversified energy portfolio on fuels
i am excited about an opportunity to pass this bill on the floor tomorrow move it to conference and get it to the president s desk
he is just wrong on this
we had almost 90 amendments submitted to the committee on rules and we were granted 30 of them
i think we can still do better than that but it sure is better than last week s closed rule on the bankruptcy bill
i urge my colleagues to closely follow the debate we are having on this bill today and tomorrow because in its current form i believe it has the wrong priorities
this brand of taxpayerfunded corporate welfare is so off the mark that even president bush a former energy executive himself recently stated that oil companies have all the incentives they need to keep on drilling in the form of 50 a barrel crude
so if the major oil companies the people who are the experts in the field the folks we depend on to do the drilling if they do not think there is oil there then why are we doing it
once allied the administration and the oil industry are now far apart on the issue
though the oil industry is on the sidelines the president still has plenty of allies
the project has long been on mr bush s agenda
others who advised mr bush on his energy plan said including the refuge was seen as a political maneuver to open the door to more geologically promising prospects off the coasts of california and florida
ken bird a geological survey official who worked on the study said the federal geologists did not have access to test data from the only exploratory well drilled on the refuge by chevron texaco and bp in the 1980 s
their concerns are heightened because of the former ties between the industry and mr bush and mr cheney and the administration s stance on issues like climate change
big oil senator john kerry said in last year s presidential campaign now calls the white house their home some industry executives say their views are more aligned with those of republicans on a broad range of issues including regulation the environment and energy supply and they were heartened by the initial pronouncements of the bush administration
but some say they feel let down by mr bush s inability to lift bans on oil exploration
my amendment i think is a good start at least on some conservation
it does not begin until the passenger steps on a pad entering into the escalator and stops when the passengers are off
but in addition to that what we would save simply on the wear and tear the pure mechanics of the escalator probably would be even higher than the energy savings
mr chairman on rollcall no
the refinery revitalization provisions are the biggest environmental and public health injustices that the congress and bush administration can perpetrate on the american people
this language is crafted on false premises
the provision as many of my colleagues know is an unfunded mandate on our communities and water providers
we are doing a foul job on behalf of the american public
this provision is an unfunded mandate on our communities and water providers who will be left holding the tab while the polluters cash in
an unfunded mandate on states which are paid for by taxpayers and largely broke
the entire texas financial assurance fund will sunset on september 1 2006
in 2003 shell exxon chevrontexaco and 15 other companies settled a contamination lawsuit brought by santa monica calif by agreeing to spend an estimated 200 million on a filtration system to remove mtbe from the city s water supplies
the success of those lawsuits in holding the oil companies responsible for mtbe contamination sparked the first attempt in 2003 by the industry and its political allies to make it impossible for communities to sue on defective product grounds
the liability waiver amounts to a massive unfunded mandate on local governments and citizens
but as we know our committee on standards of official conduct is unable to meet to consider such transgressions because of delay by my colleagues on the republican side of the aisle which delay committee on standards of official conduct action against one of their own
ending our dependence on foreign oil is not only important to the economy but also doubly important to national security
we need a comprehensive energy policy that recognizes that sophisticated new technology greatly reduces adverse impacts on the environment by exploration and production
by simply scaling back the excessive and cumbersome federal regulations on refiners we could significantly reduce these costs
we have passed this comprehensive legislation before and i know i speak for a lot of my colleagues probably on both sides of the aisle that we should finally move forward after the large increases in gasoline
ending our dependence on foreign oil is not only important to the economy but also doubly important to national security
hr 6 goes a long way to end our reliance on foreign oil
this suggests that a substantial portion of the vehicles on the road would have to be very small to reach this objective
for these reasons i urge a no vote on this amendment
i offered this language as an amendment before the committee on rules last night
however the committee on rules republican majority refused to allow my bipartisan amendment to be considered on the floor despite strong bipartisan support for it in the house and by the american people
last week when the committee on energy and commerce marked up this legislation i offered my amendment
we could have eight different policies on drilling in our lakes
and an oil spill on the shoreline can contaminate our groundwater
i ask that my colleagues approve this amendment to enact a permanent ban on oil and gas drilling in and on the great lakes
in fact in 2001 we did have a moratorium on oil and gas drilling in the great lakes and it passed 265157 with strong bipartisan support
that is why we are disappointed that the committee on rules did not make our amendment in order
if we open anwr if you put it in perspective if it was the size of the ou football field the area that we are talking about drilling in would be the size of a postage stamp on that football field
it is asinine that we rely so much on foreign oil especially in areas around the world that we have carpetbombed
the committee on energy and commerce along with other committees of jurisdiction have produced an energy bill that recognizes today s needs while preparing for the future
it doubles our efforts in energy conservation and efficiency it reduces america s dangerous dependence on foreign oil and improves our nation s electrical transmissions
it is the engine that powers other sectors of the us economy and i urge my colleagues to vote yes on the rule and the bill
madam speaker i do appreciate the gentlewoman from tennessee yielding some to me so we can talk about what i think is one of the most important bills that we will vote on in the 109th congress and that is a comprehensive energy package
in fact in my district of omaha nebraska about 65 percent of the households are heated and by the way it gets cold maybe not like in the gentlewoman s part of tennessee it gets pretty cold in omaha during the winter and we rely on natural gas
this is going to have a severe impact on our economy and for our farmers
because localities and states have played on this fear those localities in fact in maine a locality even though the states have issued permits are approved permits a locality stops an lng terminal
in this base bill we in the committee on energy and commerce worked on this together in committee
if we are going to help alleviate the pressures on price we have to give more authority for this international and national commerce to the federal energy regulatory commission
what we just do not want is for the states and localities based on nimby to have veto power
so i want to thank the gentlewoman for reserving this time so we can help educate our colleagues and america on something as important as liquid natural gas and its implications to their budgets at home
the majority focus is on the infrastructure of this country the electric power lines gas collecting lines and supporting a structure which will be the backbone of our energy needs clearly for the next quarter of a century before any of the innovative approaches begin to carry a significant share of our energy needs
and i will conclude my opening remarks by saying i was very pleased that on the ways to the means committee five democrats understood one the strategy that we are undertaking and two supported the content of that strategy by voting for the ways and means position
i anxiously look forward to the debate on the democrat substitute and would willingly yield time to the gentleman from washington mr mcdermott xz4002620 to make all the points he just made on the majority bill on the minority bill since they include in their entirety the tax section of the majority s bill
i also look forward to seeking to yield to my friend from texas mr doggett xz4001110 during the debate on the minority substitute bill because the provision he just viciously attacked on the floor as being totally unacceptable is in the democrats bill as well
madam chairman i would inquire of the chair the 1 minute that was on the minority side does that expire
first of all i want to thank the five democrats on the committee on ways and means who had the courage to vote for this excellent tax provision
on that i do nt think there is a need to try to add to what they said except to say that the amendment will protect one of the most special places in our country without much real cost in terms of our ability to maintain needed energy supplies
but i have my own opinion on the subject and i think speculation along those lines is not based on history
but if people want to consider some words from the past i would direct their attention to the original committee report on the alaska lands act dated april 7 1978
on page 149 the report points out that the committee has noted the eloquent statements of a number of prominent alaskans about the idea of building a pipeline across the coastal plain
told the council on environmental quality that some have appropriately compared that idea with slicing a razor lade across the face of the mona lisa i think that is a good summary of what could happen if we do not adopt this amendment
there is nothing i d rather vote for than a balanced energy bill that sets us on a forwardlooking course one that acknowledges that this country is overly dependent on a single energy source fossil fuels to the detriment of our environment our national security and our economy
it makes sense to focus our r amp d priorities on distributed power hybrid systems that can both help improve power reliability and affordability and bring more efficiency and cleaner energy resources into the mix
on that question congress is being asked to gamble on finding oil there
while the economically recoverable amount could increase along with higher oil prices we know for certain that drilling will change everything on the coastal plain forever
it would shift the cost of mtbe cleanup from mtbe manufacturers to taxpayers an unfunded mandate on our communities
the bill does not suspend deliveries to the strategic petroleum reserve and instead put the oil on the marketplace which could bring gasoline prices down
coloradans on average are already paying 225 for a gallon of regular gas
instead we need a strategy to wean our nation from its dependence on foreign oil
unfortunately the republican leadership did nt allow them to be debated and voted on
the last one started during the 1970s energy crisis and ended abruptly on black sunday in 1982
that was followed by an exodus of other companies that had been working on oil shale which led to an exodus of jobs and of coloradans who had nowhere else to turn
i only wish my colleagues in the house could understand that a vision of a clean energy future is not radical science fiction but is instead based on science and technology that exists today
given the magnitude of the crisis ahead we can surely put more public investment behind new energy sources that will free us from our dependence on oil
we must think anew and act anew then we will save our country and while we are not engaged in a civil war our excessive dependence on fossil energy is a pressing matter of national security
provision after provision reflects a stubborn insistence on old ideas more tax subsidies more royalty giveaways more restrictions on public participation more limits on environmental reviews and a hostility to the search for new approaches
america s dependence on imported oil poses a risk to our homeland security and economic wellbeing
subcommittee chairman hobson ranking member visclosky and their colleagues on the appropriations committee deserve our thanks for their work on this legislation
with the funding provided by this bill and barring unforeseen developments the department of energy and its contractor kaiserhill should be able to complete the cleanup in the coming months and while the department will have ongoing responsibilities at rocky flats completing the cleanup will enable it to focus even more intently on the cleanup work to be done at other sites
many have moved on to other jobs and others will do so
so i was very glad to note that the committee report accompanying this bill directs doe to report by september 30 2005 on the department s plan for a national stewardship contract for administration of the pension and benefit payments to former environmental management closure site contractor employees
these programs are also helping to reduce our reliance on oil imports thereby strengthening our national security and also creating hundreds of new domestic businesses supporting thousands of american jobs and opening new international markets for american goods and services
mr chairman i thank the gentleman from massachusetts for his leadership on this issue
one of the things that has not been mentioned here is two native tribes depend on the migration of these caribou and they have asked the congress and they have asked the state of alaska to stand up for them and to say we do not want to have the destruction of this migration because their livelihood depends on having caribou and their entire existence rotates around that
my amendment can prevent the potential damage this provision can inflict on the health of thousands of native americans
the potential longterm damage this section could inflict on the environment is also immeasurable
the history of uranium mining on the navajo nation is painful
this unnecessary act of corporate welfare could indirectly facilitate uranium mining in navajo communities that do nt want it and on a sovereign american indian nation that just this week enacted a statutory ban on uranium mining and processing
since the early 1950s many navajo communities including church rock have dealt with the devastating impacts of uranium mining on the health of workers and community members and the environment
this 50year legacy was one of the principal reasons cited by the navajo nation council when it voted 6319 on april 19 to adopt the din natural resources protection act of 2005 which created navajo nation law banning uranium mining and processing including isl mining
we are deeply concerned with this provision which gives a 30 million handout to the uranium industry and we will consider including your vote on the udall amendment on our annual scorecards
section 631 is yet another example of the government s wasteful support of nuclear power an industry that can not survive on its own
the amendment would expand the federal definition of environmental justice directs each federal agency to establish an office of environmental justice reestablishes the interagency federal working group on environmental justice and requires that executive order 12898 remain in force until changed by law
like this amendment that legislation was prompted by our continued concern about the way federal actions have had disproportionately adverse effects on the health environment and quality of life of americans in minority and lowerincome communities
this needs to give way to policies focused on providing clean healthy and quality environments within and around these communities
that order required all federal agencies to incorporate environmental justice considerations in their missions develop strategies to address disproportionate impacts to minority and lowincome people from their activities and coordinate the development of data and research on these topics
it would do this by statutorily requiring all federal agencies to make addressing environmental justice concerns part of their missions develop environmental justice strategies evaluate the effects of proposed actions on the health and environment of minority lowincome and native american communities avoid creating disproportionate adverse impacts on the health or environment of minority lowincome or native american communities and collect data and carry out research on the effects of facilities on health and environment of minority lowincome and native american communities
high gas prices are on the minds of many americans right now and this bill does nothing to change that
the energy information administration has said that this will actually increase gas prices by three cents and will have almost no effect on production consumption or prices
in addition there are native tribes who depend on this wildlife and they have asked congress and the state of alaska to stand up for them and oppose drilling
opening anwr would have no effect on our dependence on foreign oil
right now the us relies on foreign oil to meet roughly 60 percent of our oil needs
this inevitably leaves us dependent on unfriendly nations and harms our national security
i believe it is only fair to include these stakeholders in the appeals process and i was disappointed that this amendment was not allowed a vote on the floor
why does the majority insist on passing a bill full of tax incentives and subsidies for the oil and gas industry at a time of record profits for those companies
we need a real energy strategy that will help consumers decrease our dangerous dependence on foreign oil and keep us competitive internationally
mr chairman we have heard it repeated over and over during debate on this bill from members on both sides of the aisle we must reduce our dependence on foreign sources of oil and we must stabilize our energy costs
this amendment matches the rhetoric by truly reducing our dependence on foreign oil helping our economy and benefiting consumers
in this bill we finally impose reliability standards on the electric industry so that hopefully that will not happen again
we hope that the senate legislation will even go more in terms of incentives so that private consumers going to the showroom are going to be able to take advantage of those incentives to purchase those vehicles so that we can get those on the road
but the more important work is finding real alternatives to gasolinepowered cars and developing them for every dollar we force the auto companies to spend on the cafe standards is a dollar they will not spend on hybrids hydrogen fuel cell and other alternative fuel cell vehicles
currently there is one test conducted on vehicles to determine the fuel economy rating
you have all these different areas people with different driving habits and you can not expect that the epa is going to put a laundry list of these different tests on the window
we know about what it is going to be based on our history of purchasing cars
that is why i strongly urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle as we have with this bipartisan amendment to support the rogers amendment to the johnson amendment so we can make more sense for every consumer as they purchase a new american car
we have to protect people that carried through on those provisions
please vote no on the capps amendment
petroleum fuel alternatives this legislation actually increases our reliance on foreign oil according to the independent energy information agency eia
on the minority side although again as the chairman pointed out this was a bipartisan effort dixon butler
as an initial effort to get its arms around this program which reached an aggregate funding level in fiscal year 2003 of 365 million the committee mandated a comprehensive report on projects from the department of energy and initiated a gao investigation
in developing recommendations for last year s bill the committee based its guidance and statement of concerns on the results of those investigations and reports
this year the president s budget recognizing the concerns of the committee and the constraints on funding reduced the percentage allowed for labdirected research at weapons labs from 6 percent to 5 percent
i would add my appreciation to the staff led on the majority side by kevin cook
on the minority staff i would thank dixon butler
i would also thank kenny kraft on chairman hobson s staff and peder maarbjerg on my staff
this is my seventh year as ranking member on the energy and water development appropriations subcommittee
during my years on this committee it has been my privilege to serve with five subcommittee chairmen and now it has been my pleasure to serve with dave hobson for three years
during this time chairman hobson has led our subcommittee to take a longterm perspective on a number of important issues and this is resulting in some profound and positive changes
and to initiate longerterm research and development on next generation computer architectures ultimately despite being faced with budget constraints the doe office of science sustained this increase in the president s fy 2005 budget
as an initial effort to get its arms around this program which reached an aggregate funding level in fy 2003 of 365 million per year the committee mandated a comprehensive report on ldrd projects from doe and initiated a gao investigation of ldrd
in developing its recommendations for fy 2005 the committee based its guidance and statement of concerns on the results of the gao investigation and what had been learned from reviewing the extensive doe reports
the president s budget request for fy 2006 recognizing the concerns of the committee and the constraints on funding reduced the percentage allowed for ldrd at weapons labs from 6 to 5
taken together these policy initiatives signaled the house report accompanying the fy 2004 energy and water appropriations bill states the fiscal year 2004 budget request is the second budget request delivered to the committee that is loosely justified on the requirements of the nuclear posture review policy document but lacking a formal plan that specifies the changes to the stockpile reflecting the president s decision on the nuclear weapons stockpile plan the committee reduced funding for the rnep to 5 million from 15 million ultimately agreeing to 75 million in conference zeroed funds for proceeding with a modern pit facility and held the test readiness posture at 24 months
concentrating funding on highpriority water projects to get them done should significantly improve the overall benefits of investment through the corps and bureau of reclamation and so i support this painful approach as well
everyone is being asked to concentrate on two subsets of our work
the designation would also encourage large building developments to expand on planned renewable energy and energy efficient features to add scale and deploy emerging technologies
i want to thank the gentleman from texas mr hall xz4001650 and the gentleman from texas mr barton xz4000180 for the hard work they have done on this bill and for asking that the amendment be included
i have worked for a decade as an appropriator on those important investments yet i asked for amendments to improve this bill and every one of them was denied
i want the 72 percent on renewables and energy efficiency and alternatives and clean fuels extend the tax credit so people will drive these hybrid cars
mr chairman i rise to make remarks on the subrogation provision in the price anderson section of hr 6
if section 612 was enacted i fear that it will have a detrimental impact on not only the defense mission of doe but on most of the government s nuclear science activities
not to repeat anything that has been already said but just to highlight why i can believe this is such an excellent work product really three reasons one this chairman over the last 2 12 years has gone out into the country both on the water side and on the energy side gone into the depths of very complex places like our nuclear weapons complex gone into our scientific research institutions energy research gone and seen demonstrations and the advancement of technology and tried hard to understand what needs to be proposed
at no time in my 9 years on the committee on appropriations have i seen this kind of diligence that the gentleman from ohio chairman hobson has shown
third this is one of the greatest assimilations of professional staff on both sides of the aisle people with expertise and experience coming to the same subcommittee at the same time at a very important time
mr chairman if i may engage in a colloquy i would like to say a few words on the importance of fielding a leadershipclass computer for open science
they claim that their bill will reduce the cost of a gallon of gasoline which now averages 224 per gallon and that it will reduce our reliance on foreign oil
it provides 75 billion in tax breaks and billions more in royalty relief to companies like exxon mobil chevron texaco and conocophillips which are already earning record profits supposedly to encourage these companies to drill more on our public lands and produce more gasoline and oil
mr chairman the american people need us to enact legislation that will actually reduce the cost of gasoline and reduce our dependence on foreign oil
it does nothing about the most important energy issues facing our nation like addressing global warming and reducing the nation s dependence on foreign oil
instead this bill lavishes taxpayer subsidies on big energy companies while weakening our environmental laws
republicans in congress say they want limited government yet they enact legislation intruding on the endoflife decisions for the poor woman in florida
and in this socalled energy bill we shower billions on special interests while ignoring our nation s serious energy needs
we urgently need to reduce our dependence on foreign oil yet america s dependence on oil imports will grow by 75 percent over the next 20 years under this bill
it is a windfall for exxonmobil but an attack on communities all around this country facing contaminated drinking water
before i discuss the merits of this amendment that i seek to offer i want to extend my appreciation to the chairman of the committee on energy and commerce the gentleman from texas mr barton xz4000180 for his courtesy to me in allowing me to offer this amendment
it simply calls on the president to come up with a plan to lead in an effort to reduce the waste of oil
the other body voted on this very same amendment and they voted to accept it 99 to 1 now i know we are going to hear in a minute that this is a backdoor way to impose new standards or regulations
now all that we have to have the president do is to come up with ideas and to appeal to the american people on a patriotic basis that they simply should be more conscious of the waste and perhaps shut off their cars when they run into a starbucks
when we had our energy crisis a few years ago we had a real energy crunch and the people in california pitched in and almost overnight reduced energy waste by 4 to 10 percent depending on whose numbers you accept
for our national security s sake we ought to simply reduce some of the waste in oil that goes on every single year
at least it can put us on the side of trying to reduce waste
the president is simply called on to exert that leadership to come up with a plan
this only calls on the president to come up with some ideas talking to the people that are heading up his agencies
but at least it makes him focus on not wasting oil and there is a lot of waste that goes on
some of these small things can add up to savings and the savings we call for are the savings based on projections of future oil
we have a member on our side who wants to speak in favor of the proposal
mr chairman the republican leadership in the house has done everything it could possibly do to keep us from voting on this issue
we had a vote earlier as the gentleman from texas chairman barton indicated but it was on a procedural vote
now we have a vote on the merits
and that is why i am speaking for the republican side of the chamber because the republicans came in under the contract with america and said we want to do away with unfunded mandates and we will let them be challenged on the house floor
and i guess the republican leadership fears that they might because that is why they have gone to such enormous lengths to not allow anybody in this chamber to vote on this specific issue
every time we asked the committee on rules to allow a motion to strike be in order they denied it
there was a point of order raised and that way they were able to keep us from voting on it
but thanks to newt gingrich and the contract with america we have this way of bringing the issue on the merits
through a combined strategy of strong r amp d efficiency and incentives we can help ensure future generations of americans a vibrant and growing economy while not having to worry about the whims of foreign influence on our energy
i applaud the white house for taking such a proactive stance on new technologies
hr 6 further decreases america s dangerous dependence on foreign oil by expanding domestic production and authorizing expansion of the strategic petroleum reserve s capacity to 1 billion barrels of oil
if our nation is to meet these needs in the coming decades it will be in part due to continued advances in energy efficiency and conservation helping to reduce our demand on foreign supply and stimulating economic growth
one goal is to save consumers and businesses money spent on energy so they can invest spend and grow the economy and improve our standard of living
madam chairman i rise in strong support of hr 6 balanced legislation designed to reduce our dependence on imported energy a balanced approach that has earned bipartisan support in the house committee on ways and means emphasizes conservation alternative sources of energy as well as finding more domestic sources of energy
i take my brief amount of time to focus on what i consider to be the most consumeroriented provision of this legislation legislation that rewards conservation conservation at home
mr chairman the chairman of the committee on science knows what is right
america s continued reliance on middle east oil for the majority of our energy needs is the single largest factor that contributes to our lack of national security
instead we need real energy independence and that will only come when we start focusing our efforts as a nation on clean renewable sources of energy conservation and efficiency
we should not even be having this discussion because drilling in anwr will not make us energy independent and it will not end our nation s reliance on middle east oil
drilling in anwr will do little to reduce our current dependence on foreign oil because it will take more than 10 years yes more than 10 years to process what little oil may be there
well it is because the fuel economy numbers advertised by automobile manufacturers are based on 30yearold fuel economy tests tests that have not been adjusted for today s realities and that leads americans to be regularly misled by inaccurate labels
but the only real policies to be found in this immoral legislation are tax breaks for polluters swollen gasoline prices and continued reliance on fossil fuels of the past
most significant of all mr speaker this legislation fails to truly address america s reliance on middle east oil
drilling in anwr will do little to reduce our current dependence on foreign oil because it will take a full decade to process what little oil may be there in the first place
in truth this failure to reduce our dependence on middle east oil along with president bush s supremely misguided invasion of iraq have combined to make americans less secure not more secure
if president bush continues to support a misguided war that is draining our national resources and if the republicans will not work to reduce our dependence on foreign oil how can they possibly claim to be securing america against the threat of terrorism
i urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join me in this effort to truly secure america for the future
i believe the restrictions on reprogramming of funds and the constraints on the use of continuing contracts contained in this bill will lead to the inefficient use of appropriated funds and will disadvantage congressionallyadded projects
i must disagree also with the restriction placed on continuing contracts by this bill
as a result of the constraints on reprogramming a lot of money will be carried over each fiscal year and work will have to be broken up into many smaller units making projects more expensive
chairman hobson and ranking member visclosky are to be commended for their efforts to see that program management and budgeting at the corps of engineers are put back on track
madam chairman i want to thank the gentleman from california chairman pombo and the gentleman from texas chairman barton for their fine work on a good piece of legislation that starts our process in becoming independent providing energy policy which i have heard none from the other side
the caribou are using the pipeline to rub their backs on
it says dear friend in a few short hours the republican energy bill will be brought up for debate and a vote on the floor of the house of representatives
last week in the committee on energy and commerce i offered a series of amendments to increase the average fuel efficiency and it was turned down by the republicans
i then offered an amendment in the committee on resources to strip a provision from the bill that would open the arctic national wildlife refuge for oil drilling the republicans again voted against it
help me to continue to fight for sensible clean and independent energy future and shine a light on the republican party backroom attempts to cater to special interests by making an immediate contribution
to raise money on an issue that has nothing to do with energy energy that this country needs
we are no longer the only buyers on the block in this world with china and india in the field
and to have someone stand on this floor and offer an amendment that will take out the only provisional production is against america against this great nation and in fact would do the wrong thing for this nation
so i ask members to vote no on the markey amendment
the bipartisan legislation provided a funding cap that congress could impose on states and local governments
unless we impose a spending cap we are imposing too great of a financial burden on local government that is already hard pressed throughout our country
on top of this i believe that this does little to deal with the threats
dear representatives the national conference of state legislatures urges you to support a point of order against hr 6 for its inclusion of unfunded federal mandates that would be imposed on state and local governments with the adoption of this legislation
during the 108th congress unfunded federal mandates exceeding 51 billion were imposed on state and local governments
thank you for your consideration of our concerns and we are hopeful you will vote not to impose further unfunded mandates on state and local governments
i commend chairman hobson and ranking member visclosky for their work on this bill
this funding level represents a 4 million increase over the president s budget request and comes on the heels of a colorado delegation letter which i spearheaded back in march
since 2002 the bureau of reclamation has made much progress and work has been completed or initiated on many key project features
the lake is located in southern colorado on the purgatoire river and bordered by the historic santa fe trail
that means that our nation is more and more reliant on foreign sources of energy
when our nation depends on just a few countries for the majority of our energy this adversely impacts american security
by using less energy and opening up new areas for environmentallyresponsible exploration we will become less dependent on foreign sources of energy
mr speaker on rollcall no
what this provision simply does is make it economical for companies to take greater risk than they have ever had to take before to allow them to raise the capital and spend hundreds of millions of dollars maybe even a billion dollars on these rigs to produce the energy that our country so desperately needs that our farmers need that our petrochemical industry needs
but we have a choice do we produce our own energy needs or do we become increasingly dependent on foreign sources
knowing the economy of louisiana and particularly south louisiana my district is very reliant on the oil and gas industry
the gentleman from louisiana mr jindal xz4006340 gave some numbers that apply to what has happened with the leaseholds out on the outer continental shelf in recent times
we have 125 companies that have located at port fourchon and there are 25 companies presently on the list waiting for locations to open up at the port
mr chairman the johnson amendment requires the epa to change the testing procedures that auto companies use to determine the fuel economy numbers that go on the dealer label
this goes to the heart of what we are doing to the auto industry now unintentionally perhaps and that is beating up on them and we should not do that
sadly the energy bill does little to reduce our nation s dependence on foreign oil decrease rising oil and gas prices increase our national security protect our environment or encourage investment in renewable energy sources
clearly this measure is a short sighted political move aimed at winning friends and contributors instead of what it should be a long term plan to ease the energy burden on consumers and make the united states safer and energy independent and that s a shame
as a member of the committee on government reform s subcommittee on energy and natural resources i know all too well how energy needs shape our foreign policy and our national security agenda
we have resources at home like water wind and sun that with research and investment can produce cleaner energy sources and cheaper alternatives can reduce our dependence on foreign oil and can create jobs and spur spending here at home
i will vote against the energy bill on the floor because this legislation ignores my constituents needs and adds to their troubles through higher prices an increased tax burden more pollution and less national security
mr speaker on rollcall no
mr speaker i want to thank the gentlewoman very much for organizing this effort on behalf of hr 6 the energy policy act of 2005
i am encouraged we have the opportunity to tackle this issue head on and take the necessary steps to reduce the cost of energy
hardworking americans are depending on us to take action
this bill will also reduce our dependence on foreign oil and encourage investment into alternative energy sources
there are plenty of incentives this congress needs to establish an energy policy that sets america free from its dependence on imported oil
yet only seven percent of the tax incentives in this bill will go towards renewable energy and energy efficiency leaving us to be reliant on the same old energy sources
we must set the nation on a course to energy independence which means promoting cleaner less expensive energy that we control
i urge a no vote on hr 6
mr chairman i agree with the chairman of the committee on science
it runs on hydrogen
it seems like science fiction but the good news is that we on the committee on science are in the business of making science fiction into reality and it is not that far away
now is the time to be spending good money on that
if we do that we will do good work for the american people and we will lessen our dependence on middle eastern oil
if we can retool the automobile and make it so that we not just develop the technology but also produce it here we can tremendously expand the economy of the united states providing jobs and while doing that cleaning up the environment and reducing the oil pressure on the middle east
many of you have heard the story about the fellow that was sitting on his porch and water came trickling through his yard
a fellow drove by in his jeep and said jump on the dam is giving way this place is going to be flooded
and he climbs up on the rooftop as the water gets higher and higher
if we have cheaper natural gas the papermill that had to close down in lufkin because they could not get cheap enough gas they are planning on reopening if that can happen
we have got land men going to work getting leases on the land
and let me just say on a personal note with all of the things that a good energy bill will do for the nation and do for our district i feel good about what we are doing and i appreciate the gentlewoman s yielding to me because it does mean a lot
sarah s birthday is tomorrow and i do not remember not being there on the morning of one of my kids birthdays
the need to import a barrel of oil or the need to import an mcf of natural gas causes us to remain dependent on those foreign sources
mr chairman i yield 1 minute to the gentleman from texas mr barton xz4000180 the chairman of the committee on energy and commerce
i am particularly troubled about the amnesty this bill gives to mtbe polluters and the effect it has on my home state of california
we should be strengthening our natural security by reducing our dependence on foreign oil
if they were commenting on the bill of rights the fourth amendment is an amendment designed to quash evidence coming from an unlawful search and seizure that could allow the conviction of sexual predators
this is how the majority chooses to interpret in this particular case the substance and the intent of a series of amendments made to the bill we voted on last week
we depend we in the minority depend on a process that relies on honesty and good faith and the duties and those duties i truly believe were breached in the case of this report
the second purpose is accomplished by requiring that a parent or legal guardian is notified that an abortion is going to be performed on their daughter
mr speaker by direction of the committee on rules i call up house resolution 258 and ask for its immediate consideration
mr speaker on wednesday the committee on rules met and reported a rule for consideration of the conference report on hr 1268 the emergency supplemental act for defense the global war on terror and tsunami relief act 2005
additionally it authorizes the chairman of the house committee on the judiciary to file a supplemental report to accompany hr 748
it helps to ensure the full funding of the important accounts which have been depleted during our global war on terror and our effort to assist the iraqi and afghan people in their efforts to establish functioning democracies in their countries
mr speaker house resolution 258 allows us to fully debate the important issues surrounding the war on terror
just yesterday we saw on the front page of the washington post a graphic photograph that captured the terrible effects of the war on an innocent victim and the courage and compassion of the american soldiers who are engaged in the battle
we should keep this image in mind as we commence the debate on the conference report today
others may want to discuss issues that however important are superfluous to the war on terrorism
mr speaker i believe in this discussion we should focus our remarks on what truly counts
we owe them our full support in the battles they wage on behalf of the american people and the cause of liberty
for the purpose of clarification i want to quickly address the matter involving the supplemental report on hr 748 the child interstate abortion notification act
it is my understanding that the chairman of the committee on the judiciary has already prepared the supplemental report and shared its contents with the committee s ranking minority member
i further understand that the chairman of the committee on the judiciary is prepared to file a supplemental report immediately after the adoption of this resolution and also to place it in the lt em gt lt em gt congressional record
this supplemental report responds directly to the questions of privilege raised by the gentleman from michigan mr conyers xz4000800 and the gentleman from new york mr nadler xz4002890 both of which call for the chairman of the committee on the judiciary to report to the house a supplement to house report 10951 that corrects the record by describing the five amendments with nonargumentative objective captions the text of the proposed supplemental report also includes additional dissenting views from the committee s ranking minority describing his disagreements with the interpretation of the amendments by the majority
mr speaker i am pleased to yield such time as he may consume to the distinguished gentleman from california mr dreier xz4001150 the chairman of the committee on rules
second as to the point on the embassy i have been to iraq four times and have met with our folks there and frankly i think they deserve the very best protection they can get as quick as we can get it
there is line after line of great specificity my good friend the chairman of the committee on appropriations was very careful in crafting a bill that will meet the needs of our personnel
the immoral thing to do would be to commit 170 000 people to combat and not resupply them and not reequip them and not give them the things they need on a daily basis to not only be successful but to provide for their own safety and security
although i remind my good friend on the other side of the aisle this body and the other body vote on a bipartisan basis to make the commitment in iraq
i could read off name after name including the distinguished nominee from the other body of my friends on the other side of the aisle a candidate for president last time who voted in favor of this particular contest
having made that decision once we place people on the line under fire and in danger we owe it to them to provide them what they need
in closing i would like to say that i believe we have had a good debate on the rule today
the material previously referred to by ms slaughter xz4003780 is as follows previous question for h res 258 rule on conference report for hr 1268 emergency supplemental appropriations act for defense the global war on terror and tsunami relief act 2005 strike all after the resolved clause and insert that upon adoption of this resolution it shall be in order to consider the conference report to accompany the bill hr 1268 making emergency supplemental appropriations for defense the global war on terror and tsunami relief for the fiscal year ending september 30 2005 and for other purposes
2 the chairman of the committee on the judiciary is authorized on behalf of the committee to file a supplemental report to accompany hr 748
b the concurrent resolution referred to in subsection a is a concurrent resolution 1 which has no preamble 2 the title of which is as follows providing for corrections to the enrollment of the conference report on the bill hr 1268 and 3 the text of which is as follows at the end of the conference report bill add the following new title sec
1 there is hereby created a select committee on the model of the truman committee to investigate the awarding and carrying out of contracts to conduct activities in afghanistan and iraq and to fight the war on terrorism hereinafter referred to as the select committee
the select committee shall conduct an ongoing study and investigation of the awarding and carrying out of contracts by the government to conduct activities in afghanistan and iraq and to fight the war on terrorism and make such recommendations to the house as the select committee deems appropriate regarding the following matters 1 bidding contracting and auditing standards in the issuance of government contracts 2 oversight procedures 3 forms of payment and safeguards against money laundering 4 accountability of contractors and government officials involved in procurement 5 penalties for violations of law and abuses in the awarding and carrying out of government contracts 6 subcontracting under large comprehensive contracts 7 inclusion and utilization of small businesses through subcontracts or otherwise and 8 such other matters as the select committee deems appropriate
such payments shall be made on vouchers signed by the chairman of the select committee and approved in the manner directed by the committee on house administration
amounts made available under this subsection shall be expended in accordance with regulations prescribed by the committee on house administration
mr speaker i yield back the balance of my time and i move the previous question on the resolution
and i do this because the committee on the judiciary report on hr 748 mischaracterized amendments offered by members in a way that distorted both the effect of the amendments and the intentions of the members
the same is true of the amendment descriptions prepared by the majority staff on the committee on rules as well as the majority staff on the republican conference
i can not agree with the contention that the obligation should have been on the members to draft these amendments more narrowly
the duty should not be on us to exclude categories of persons who have nothing to do with the underlying amendment
mr speaker i yield 5 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from new york mr nadler xz4002890 a member of the committee on the judiciary
mr speaker can we inquire of the distinguished chairman of the committee on the judiciary who has not used any of his time yet how many speakers he has
i want my friend a member of the committee on the judiciary the gentleman from florida mr feeney xz4001310 to understand it is not about anything in the debate that took place to which we were objecting
mr speaker i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from california mr berman xz4000250 a member of the house committee on the judiciary
we debated it on the floor
mr speaker i yield 2 12 minutes to the gentlewoman from new york ms slaughter xz4003780 the ranking member of the committee on rules
mr speaker how much time remains on each side
we are not here to debate hr 748 we are here to talk about the power and the abuses of the majority party that sets the agenda that writes the reports and that entitles the amendments submitted to the members of the committee on the judiciary
so it is with great reluctance that i come before you to ask that we make sure this never happens again that this deliberate mischaracterization of amendments be stopped here and now that it does not happen and that the chairman of the committee on the judiciary issue a supplemental report and apologize to the house of representatives
mr speaker on that i demand the yeas and nays
mr speaker the house will convene on tuesday at 2 pm
any votes called on these measures will be rolled until 6 30 pm
on wednesday and thursday the house will convene at 10 am
i believe the committee on the budget chairman the gentleman from iowa mr nussle xz4002980 has had some informal discussions with his senate counterpart
as the gentleman may or may not know the senate is taking a work period the following week so they are trying as hard as they can to get this conference formed a meeting and work done so that we can have a conference report on the floor of the house and the senate by the end of next week
i do not know what their resolution is even if there is a resolution on the senate side
the house is very interested in holding the line on their mandatory savings and the senate is trying to work through this process
and i take my hat off to him as i know both democrats and republicans will for the phenomenal job that he is doing as the new chairman of the committee on appropriations
this bill is one which encompasses as we all know the very important aspect of ensuring that our men and women in uniform as we are in the midst of the war on terror including iraq have what they need
it also is focused on ensuring that we provide some relief to those who were hit so badly by the tsunami that took place at the end of last year
i had the privilege of serving with a number of our colleagues as a conferee on the intelligence reform package the implementation of the recommendations from the 911 commission
those of us who were house conferees on the republican side pushed very hard to make sure that we could deal with the driver s license issue the asylum issue and the effort to close the 3 12 mile gap in the border fence which has been discussed here many many times
we worked very hard to ensure that when it came to the issues of driver s licenses that we did not impose a mandate on the states
we simply said to the states as is included in this measure that if a state chooses to give driver s licenses to people who are here illegally then those driver s licenses can not be used for any federal purpose getting on board an aircraft going into a federal courthouse applying for any federal program
so states are still free to do whatever they would like but this provision is addressed i think very adequately focusing on our security
i am pleased we are planning next week to hold hearings on hr 98 our goal of putting into place a counterfeitproof social security card so that we can also play a role in diminishing that magnet which draws people illegally across the border and in so doing we can allow the border patrol to focus their attention on the potential terrorist threat coming across our borders and other criminals
i thank my friends for their hard work on this
i generally congratulate the gentleman from california mr lewis xz4002392 and all who have been involved on both sides of the aisle in implementation of this important measure
mr speaker i am really disappointed that we have descended to this level because i have some great friends that i admire on the other side
we serve on a committee which is not a fluff committee
one thing we know is that last week the united states house of representatives overwhelmingly on a bipartisan basis passed house resolution 748 the child interstate abortion notification act
and i did not speak on the amendments
i did not speak at all because if every one of the members of the committee on the judiciary spoke for 5 minutes on each amendment as we are entitled we would never get through our business protecting children who are impregnated by people that molest them
and so we knew what we were voting on and the job of the committee staff is to describe the effect of the amendment not the debate
it really is about this whole notion of abortion and i do not understand the intensity completely but i believe it has something to do with the conscience in all of us collectively that we are beginning to realize that somehow as americans we are bigger than abortion on demand that 40 million dead children is enough and that somehow we need to start asking the real question
i think somehow we collectively in our hearts understand that and therefore it creates all this acrimony on the finer points but the real abuse of power is that this body has the power to protect these little babies and instead we are debating the finer points in a committee report and i am ashamed of that
a committee report should do the former not the latter because what matters at the end of the day are the actual words on the page of a bill
mr leader i noticed that the budget conference report is not listed on the schedule next week
can the gentleman tell us when the gentleman believes the budget conference will be appointed and when we might have that on the floor
i understand a substantial number of members on your side have suggested that those cuts are not advisable
can the majority leader tell me at this point in time if there has been any resolution of this issue as to where we might stand on those medicaid cuts
again i do not know the accuracy of the letter in terms of the numbers of people but there seemed to be a fair number of people there were over 40 on the letter which appeared to agree with the senate s view obviously a large number on this side who share that view as well
perhaps we might have some discussions about reaching agreement on that issue at some point in time
in fact as the resolution reads although it is the long and established practice on house reports to describe recorded votes with objective nonargumentative captions the committee on the judiciary majority departed from the practice in house report 10951 by captioning those five amendments with inflammatory inaccurate captions implying that these three members of congress were engaging in criminal behavior
we should not be divided on upholding the laws of this land because of the lack of judiciousness of the writing of a report that could be solved today
mr speaker i rise in strong support of the resolution introduced by the gentleman from michigan the distinguished ranking member of the committee on the judiciary from where the underlying legislation was initially reported
my constituents and the constituents of my colleagues do read house reports and the nefarious language that the chairman avers as representative of his true intentions should be highlighted as contrary to the ideals on which this house this government and this nation were established
and then of course it is a backdoor way to correct the abuse that was rendered in the committee on the judiciary characterizing members amendments that dealt with protecting children and providing rights to clergy and grandparents as having to do with a criminal act
this is a no on the rule and this certainly is worthy of consideration of this appropriation that does not answer the concerns of americans
mr speaker i rise to oppose the rule in hr 1268 the emergency supplemental appropriations act for defense the global war on terror and tsunami relief for 2005 purports to do and i thank the chairman of the committee on the judiciary for what section 2 of the rule proposes to do
section 2 of h res 258 section 2 of the rule provides that the chairman of the committee on the judiciary is authorized on behalf of the committee to file a supplemental report to accompany hr 748 while i thank the gentleman from wisconsin for his effort unfortunately this language is neither hortatory nor fully protective of the privileges offered by house report 10951
previous question on rule h res 258 mr speaker we must include in the underlying conference report a concurrent resolution adding the tierneyleach accountability amendment
the tierneyleach accountability amendment would create a select congressional committee based on the truman committee that existed from 1941 to 1948 during world war ii to investigate and study the awarding and carrying out of government contracts to conduct military and reconstruction activities in iraq and afghanistan
senator truman rightly called upon congress to create a select committee to study and investigate contracting which congress did on march 1 1941
from its creation in 1941 until it expired in 1948 the truman committee held 432 public hearings and 300 executive sessions went on hundreds of factfinding missions and issued 51 reports
nearly 9 billion of money spent on iraqi reconstruction is unaccounted for because of inefficiencies and bad management according to the special inspector general for the iraqi reconstruction
in one case the inspector general raised the possibility that thousands of ghost employees were on an unnamed ministry s payroll
a new truman committee would allow us to get the facts on us contracting in both military and reconstruction activities and to fix whatever problems exist
it is interesting to note that those of us who may side on the position of choice and the right to privacy recognize the intensity and the questions being raised about children who are put in harm s way whether or not that means that a child without counsel because of some tragedy in her life has to seek an abortion
the debate in the committee on the judiciary by members on my side of the aisle really centered and focused on the structure of the legislation that seemingly would close the door shut on a child that would seek counsel beyond the parent in this very troubling time in their life
i started out by saying and i do intend to follow that charge that i have made that this is an effort to go forward to be able to highlight a mistake an indiscretion a pathway that hopefully we will not return to and allow us to heal on our own if you will but also to cite that this is not the way to run the people s house
and by the way mr speaker though i am not intending to challenge legislation that has already been passed on the floor of the house albeit i disagree with it vigorously in terms of the restraints it puts on the interaction between a child and confidante a trusted adult who can help steer them in the right direction let me just suggest this was a constructive amendment because it was to give the child an ability to consult with someone that may be out of the pipeline and be out of the child s distress area meaning we have never looked at the point that possibly the parent could be the predator or could be engaged in incest
the amendments were very clear on their face
the amendments stood alone the general accounting office shall conduct a study detailing the impact of the number of unsafe and illegal abortions performed on minors who would be affected by this law you see mr speaker i have lived through a time when women went to back alleys and a coat hanger was a medical device
this is not a nice word to say on the floor of the house because as we have seen the rash of attacks on our children two young babies killed just in the last 24 hours little precious danielle having been determined and identified decapitated a couple of years ago as cochair of the congressional children s caucus we were briefed by alonzo washington on that tragic case the cases in florida the cases in texas
no one wants to promote the extending of any criminal exemptions for the likes of those who prey on our children
there is vigorous debate on the question of choice parental consent
as we went to the committee on rules we would hope it would have been cleared up through that matter
so we had hoped that there would have been some solution to this in the committee on rules
the point that should be part of the rules of this house that i hope that we will as we go forward make really part of our institutional fabric is that house reports from now on or from last thursday on should describe recorded votes with objective nonargumentative captions
the committee on the judiciary majority can not do that in house report 10951 by captioning the five amendments that i mentioned with remarks that would suggest that we are harboring that we are kowtowing playing to sexual predators
the opportunity that was given mr speaker to address this question in the committee on rules was troubling because questions were posed as to why such language was utilized
that is why we pay tribute to americans on this floor
the reason why again i would cite this as an important request and one that i hope the correction of last week will not be simply the correction of that time but it will be embedded that we try and work not to do it again is because when we get on this floor mr speaker and there are words that are not befitting or becoming of the debate albeit the member did not intend any wrongdoing or missteps but because someone else found those words to be inappropriate we have a procedure called to take the words down
we stand in debate with our eyes on the flag of the united states and the words in god we trust this nation s underpinnings allow us to do so
it is hopefully an effort in a moment of evenhandedness to suggest that this kind of mischaracterization not take place anymore in the committees of the house the final reporting andor the committee on rules and that we strictly stick to the conciseness and integrity of the process which is a nonargumentative objective reporting of the work of an individual member
because as i was driving on the freeway yesterday in texas because of the amber alert that all of the members of this house were willing to support there unfortunately was a highlight of another kidnapped child from new mexico possibly on the run into texas not knowing whether there was an issue of sexual predator or child predator
allow me to quote from the ranking member of the committee on rules who said that it was not indicated how this was brought to our attention
the committee on rules discovered yesterday that the committee on the judiciary report on this very bill which was authored by the majority staff contained amendment summaries which had been rewritten by committee staff for the sole purpose of distorting the original intent of the authors
if it had not been for the staff of the committee on rules we would not have had the opportunity to clear the air
i do want to pay tribute to the committee on rules in this instance republicans and democrats who listened to our protest if you will
and frankly mr speaker i had hoped and thought that that matter could be resolved there in the committee on rules
the response of the majority of the committee on rules is to stand by it or they stood by those amendments as they were described
it appeared as stated by the ranking member that the representations being made in the committee on rules is that one the majority stood by it and two that the alterations to our amendments were deliberate
that is why a president of the united states can stand with the georgian people and talk about democracy and hold his head up high because we are allowed to stand on the floor and vigorously disagree in a manner where we will not be punished
so the resolution that was offered and debated on asked for a number of actions
one that we will be allowed to debate in this body whether it be in committee or on the floor and vigorously disagree and that in that disagreement there will be no punishment
in the instance of the committee on the judiciary in this occasion on these amendments the majority prevailed
so i would hope that that would be where we would divide on our beliefs our reasons for the legislation not on how we talked about a bill
it would almost be like those who are abhorring drug cartels and drug dealers that if they were to have an amendment dealing with a gao study determining the extent of drug cartels influence in the united states or the growth of drug cartels between 1990 and 2005 and all of a sudden it was characterized as an amendment for the gao to promote drug dealership and drug cartels you would not want to hear that on the floor but it certainly would be the complete opposite of your intent and it would have mischaracterized the debate where you were standing and trying to determine whether some legislation promoted drug cartels more so than broke them up
it was simply rendered to say that what occurred deserved the greater attention of this body and that it was on the brink of abuse and the sadness is that we had to rise to the floor more than once before it was ultimately corrected in the waning hours of last week s legislative session
and if any thought came to the mind of a colleague that that was the intent of that member i would assure you that the best approach of that particular colleague would be to query that member in that committee there are a lot of papers here mr speaker because i am looking at this debate that went on and so i will not add to some of the accusations that were made in the debate going back and forth
i am simply going to conclude by asking again that it not ever be done again and asking that we respect the individual rights of members to defend and represent their constituents and to offer vigorous debate both consent and dissent and as well the right to vigorously disagree on a legislative initiative
they are written as with a sunbeam on the whole volume of human nature by the hand of the divinity itself and can never be erased or obscured by mortal power of course this is high language to talk about the rights bestowed upon mankind humankind that they are not found in paper
but one thing is right as well mr speaker is that although all is not said and done on the written word it certainly is a parallel to our rights because we look to a written document for our rights
we have had our say on this and i hope that it has been a deliberate statement
to the judiciary committee members as we gather on a daily basis weekly basis i believe they will all agree that we have the right to disagree and to debate vigorously in the committee in the rules committee and on this floor
this point as did the point raised by my colleague on the judiciary committee from new york mr nadler relates to the malreporting by the republican leadership of the committee on the judiciary with respect to hr 748 the child interstate abortion notification act of 2005
again while the supplemental report to 10951 makes some corrections to the mistakes made in part 1 the report still contains an inaccurate representation of the amendments that i representative sheila jackson lee offered in committee on april 13 2005 in room 2141 of rayburn
2 designated as dl006 add at the end the following the general accounting office shall conduct a study detailing the impact of the number of unsafe and illegal abortions performed on minors who would be affected by this law and report to congress the results of that study within 1 year of the enactment of this act
this combination of the two distinct amendments give an inaccurate representation of the amendments that i offered during committee and therefore muddled the import of the very substantive amendment on which i joined my colleagues during our debate of the bill on the floor on april 27 2005
lt p gt i would like to cite the insightful and sagacious words of my colleague the distinguished ranking member of the committee on rules on april 27 2005 on this matter there is no question that we can debate and disagree over the impact the bill can have
we can argue over how well it has been written or what language it should include to be more effective but regardless of the way the debate turns out the caption on the top of that bill or amendment serves to instruct the american people as to what the original intent of the legislation was
it serves as an unbiased reading on what the amendment aims to accomplish
was it took a resolution of privilege introduced by the ranking member john conyers a point of personal privilege and a wealth of time and debate before the committee on rules to move the leadership of the committee on rules to even tender an action to redress the problem
on may 3 2005 the ranking member of the committee on the judiciary led debate on his resolution of privilege h res 253 that concerned the ways in which the act of the chairman of the judiciary committee negatively affected the rights of the house collectively its safety dignity and the integrity of its proceedings so too was this resolution properly and justifiably introduced because in that case the privileges of dignity and the integrity of the house s proceedings have been patently violated
the american people must be made aware that we the authors of the amendments on pages 4549 of house report 10951 do not associate ourselves with the misreported portions thereof
my constituents and the constituents of my colleagues do read house reports and the nefarious language that the chairman avers as representative of his true intentions should be highlighted as contrary to the ideals on which this house this government and this nation were established
louise m slaughter xz4003780 dny28 ranking member of the house committee on rules delivered the attached statement on the house floor this morning regarding the gross abuse of power by chairman james sensenbrenner and the majority on the judiciary committee this week
chairman sensenbrenner and his staff rewrote the captions of five democratic amendments to distort their meaning and intent in the judiciary committee report on hr 748
mr sensenbrenner xz4003650 and the republican leadership of this body owe an apology to the democratic members of congress whom they have maligned the following amendments were offered and voted down by recorded votes in the judiciary committee markup of hr 748 the child interstate abortion notification act ciana the following chart demonstrates how judiciary committee republicans blatantly mischaracterized these amendments in their official committee report on the bill
the rules committee discovered yesterday that the judiciary committee report on this very bill which was authored by the majority staff contained amendment summaries which had been rewritten by committee staff for the sole purpose of distorting the original intent of the authors
this is a clearly dishonest unethical attack on the credibility and character of another member
but regardless of how that debate turns out the caption on the top of that bill or amendment serves to instruct the american people as to what original intent of that legislation was
it serves as an unbiased reading on what that amendment aims to accomplish
in fact when we pressed last night in the rules committee to have the record amended to reflect the honest and accurate captions that belong on those amendments we were defeated on a party line vote
but perhaps they will be the last to realize that in order to regain some of that lost civility they need look no further than their own abusive unethical and arrogant administration of this house of representatives the following amendments were offered and voted down by recorded votes in the judiciary committee markup of hr 748 the child interstate abortion notification act ciana the judiciary committee republicans blatantly mischaracterized these amendments in their official committee report on the bill
i have had an opportunity on two separate occasions now mr speaker to travel to iraq to visit our troops in the field and nothing has made me feel prouder to be an american than seeing our troops in action
we need more accountability on how the money is being used or misused in iraq right now
during the second world war you could pretty much put pins on maps and see the progress of the front lines
mr speaker i thank the chairman for yielding me time on this important issue
therefore the amendments introduced by the democrats in the committee on the judiciary are unnecessary
as my distinguished committee on the judiciary colleagues have explained the health and safety of these young girls is not protected by providing a blank exemption for those who may have sexually abused them
if those amendments had all gone on the bill it would have been gutted in the bill and it would have gone down because i would have voted against it and so would the rest of us in the majority
how can we sign off on another 82 billion check when the bush administration has failed to provide the proper accounting of where the taxpayer money is going
how can we sign off on this check when our own government reported yesterday that another 100 million can not be accounted for
this is on top of the 9 billion from last year that is still missing
unfortunately that is not what happened last week when the committee on the judiciary reported hr 748 to the house floor with the committee report house report 10951
republicans that ruled the committee on the judiciary mischaracterized five democratic amendments in an extremely disparaging and distorting manner
the american people certainly deserve better and i urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this important resolution
we should be paying these costs like grownups not passing them on to our children and our grandchildren
mr speaker i am relieved that the conferees reinstated the president s ability to waive the restrictions on the economic aid for palestine
we should be paying these costs like grownups not passing them on to our children and grandchildren
but somehow this equipment never gets to the men and women whose lives are on the line
so i thank the conferees for their work on this matter and i just hope this time the equipment gets to where it s needed most
senator durbin s provision focused solely on federal employees which is the largest employer of national guard and reservists and cost only 170 million over 5 years
right the federal government praises those private sector employers that by their own choice do the fifth i am pleased that the conferees reinstated the president s ability to waive the restriction on the economic aid for palestine
instead the conferees have chosen to impose these highly restrictive punitive measures that will burden our states and i believe fail to have any meaningful effect on stemming illegal immigration but will do great harm to those immigrants fleeing persecution regardless of how they come to our shores seeking protection
we are engaged in a worldwide war on terror a battle against the forces of terror terrorists who hate our freedoms who hate democracy
afghanistan has gone from a haven for terrorists to an ally in the war on terror
we have a responsibility to keep the heat on the terrorists
for those who say that we are spending too much on this war i would ask what price do you put on freedom and on security
mr speaker is it his intent to let anybody on this side speak after he has spoken even if he closes
it was said on the floor of the house last week that the question is one of intent versus effect
so on that level the report is dishonest and the chairman or whoever else had anything to do with it owes this body an apology
but as i said last week if someone wanted to say on the floor of the house or in the committee as no one did in the committee that one has not anticipated the rare eventuality that a grandparent would be a sexual predator and maybe they should amend the amendment that would have been a fair comment
mr speaker it is amazing to me that the chairman of the committee continues to smear other members of the house on this floor
the words sexual predator or abusers do not appear in the bill number 1 number 2 by the chairman s logic any bill on the floor of the house that gives veterans benefits or gives educational benefits gives benefits to sexual predators as long as it does not specifically exclude them and any such bill could be fairly described as a bill to give benefits to sexual predators
whereas the committee on the judiciary conducted a markup of the bill hr 748 the child interstate abortion notification act on wednesday april 13 2005 and ordered the bill reported on that same day whereas the committee on the judiciary subsequently reported hr 748 to the house on thursday april 21 2005 with an accompanying report designated house report 10951 whereas during the markup of hr 748 representatives nadler scott and jacksonlee offered in good faith a total of five amendments to the bill all of which failed on partyline votes whereas because representatives nadler scott and jacksonlee called for recorded votes on their amendments under section 3 b of rule xiii the votes were published in house report 10951 whereas although it is the long and established practice in house reports to describe recorded votes with objective nonargumentative captions the committee on the judiciary majority departed from this practice in house report 10951 by captioning these five amendments with inflammatory inaccurate captions whereas when representative sensenbrenner the chairman of the committee on the judiciary was asked about this language and given the opportunity to correct it both in the committee rules and on the house floor he instead explained that it was his purpose and intention to include these derogatory and inaccurate captions in house report 10951 whereas committee reports are official congressional documents to which american citizens will refer when seeking to interpret the bills they accompany whereas although the committee markup and reporting process gives members ample opportunity to debate characterize and criticize each other s views committees have a ministerial institutional responsibility to accurately report the proceedings of committee activities whereas under the procedures of the committee on the judiciary the minority must submit its dissenting views to the majority without having the opportunity to review the report whereas the majority has the opportunity to review the minority s dissent before filing its report whereas earlier versions of hr 748 were reported by the committee on the judiciary on three separate occasions and in each case these amendments or similar amendments were described in these earlier committee reports with objective nonargumentative captions whereas this unprecedented manipulation of a traditionally nonpartisan portion of a committee report constitutes an abuse of power by the majority of the committee on the judiciary whereas a report of a committee offers the majority and minority the opportunity to provide their views and interpretations of the legislation amendments and issues whereas the section of a committee report required by clause 3 b of rule xiii was purposely misused as an opportunity to comment on or characterize the amendments and whereas the vote captions published in house report 10951 appear to be purposefully inaccurate and misleading and reflect negatively on the integrity of the members offering the amendments and therefore belittle the dignity of the house and undermine the integrity of the proceedings of the house now therefore be it resolved that the house of representatives 1 finds that the committee on the judiciary purposefully and deliberately mischaracterized the abovementioned votes in house report 10951 and 2 directs the chairman of such committee to report to the house a supplement to house report 10951 that corrects the record by describing the five amendments with nonargumentative objective captions
mr speaker i seek recognition on a question of personal privilege pursuant to rule ix of the rules of the house
i have placed at the desk the documentation on which this question is based
mr speaker the basis of my question of personal privilege concerns the manner in which amendments i offered during the committee on the judiciary s consideration of hr 748 on april 13 2005 were characterized in the committee s report on that legislation house report 10951
the language in question appears on pages 45 and 46 of the committee report and it mischaracterizes my amendments in a manner that does not reflect the actual content of the amendments nor the actual intent of those amendments
i have never previously in my 12 years as a member of this house nor in my quarter century representing the people of new york had the need to rise on a personal privilege
i would observe that the filing a few minutes ago of the supplemental report to the committee on the judiciary report is a tacit acknowledgment of the inaccuracy and untruthfulness of the original report and its reputation in the public domain and renders much of what was said in its defense in the committee on rules and on the floor as the saying goes inoperative i commend the chairman for correcting the record and hope that with this correction of the slanderous report language this unfortunate chapter can be brought to a close
this situation is especially sad because it involves the committee on the judiciary s official report on this bill which contained false and misleading indeed libelous descriptions of the amendments i and my colleagues offered in committee in good faith and with the intent of protecting children and families in terrible situations
both the majority and the minority have the opportunity in the report to make their cases and very much to the credit of the gentleman from wisconsin chairman sensenbrenner the committee on the judiciary reports also contain a transcript of the markup
what has never been done and i am not aware of the majority on any committee having so abused its power is to distort the content of the amendments in the section reserved for reporting votes
every member of this house sits on committees every member knows what a report looks like and every member of this house knows this was an aberration and that it was wrong
to place this report and the slanderous language it used in context the last time the committee on the judiciary reported a version of the same bill the report said an amendment was offered by mr nadler xz4002890 prohibiting hr 476 from applying with respect to conduct by a grandparent or adult sibling of the minor same amendment same committee different year
earlier versions of this bill have been reported by the committee on the judiciary on three prior occasions going to 1998
the committee on rules described the same amendment in the following manner when it reported it to the floor adds to the exceptions to the offense of transporting minors for the purpose of obtaining an illegal abortion grandparents of the minor and members of the clergy even the republican study committee the voice of some of the most conservative of our colleagues described the amendment this way the amendment allows a grandparent of the minor or a clergy person to bring pregnant minors across state lines for abortions these are factual descriptions of the amendment
as the transcript clearly shows the transcript contained in the committee s report appearing on page 58 to 120 will clearly show
not abusing the power the majority has over the contents and the filing of the report which the minority does not get to see until it is filed is really based on nothing more than the honor system
the voters have every right to expect us to fight for our beliefs to represent them vigorously and to speak out in clear terms on the important issues of the day
mr speaker not seeing the gentlewoman from texas ms jacksonlee xz4001990 i thank the chairman of the committee on the judiciary for filing the corrected report and i yield back the balance of my time
he spent a great deal of time trying to ensure that the lt em gt lt em gt congressional record accurately reflected what each and every member said and did on this house floor
there is enough skill on the part of the majority staff of the judiciary committee to describe any amendment offered by any member in a nonpejorative nonargumentative way
but what i want to do at this time is to alert the house to the contents of the motion that we would make on the rule if the previous question is not adopted
the article goes on to say the audit of us funds found that the contract files were unavailable incomplete inconsistent and unreliable other than that they were terrific
now we have been virtually begging on bended knee to get this congress to establish a committee with teeth to look into this problem
mr speaker i thank the distinguished ranking member the lead democrat on the committee on the judiciary for yielding me time and for his great leadership to protect and defend the constitution of the united states the oath of office that we all take
i know that all the members of the committee on the judiciary have a difficult task
i commend all of the members of the committee on the judiciary for the very important responsibility that they have in protecting the civil liberties of our country
mr speaker i am very sad that it is necessary to come to the floor to speak on a resolution offered by the gentleman from michigan mr conyers xz4000800 again the distinguished ranking member on the committee on the judiciary
i understand why our republican colleagues want to talk about the bill and not talk about this privileged resolution because this resolution strikes right directly to the heart of our democracy and our right of freedom of speech on this floor and how our words are interpreted
i view what the committee on the judiciary leadership did on this bill as just another extension of the abuse of power of the republican majority in the congress of the united states both in the house and in the senate
in both bodies and let us just speak to our own there is an attempt to limit the opportunity for members to speak on the floor to have substitutes alternative amendments that can come to the floor and on the occasions when they do allow an amendment they decide to misrepresent the amendment
just when we think we have seen it all on the part of curbing debate in this house the republicans not only curb the debate they decide what it is that we said and what it is that we wrote in our amendments that we were putting forth
we must be mindful of a standard we must uphold not only for ourselves but for the american people to conduct ourselves at all times in a manner which shall reflect credibly on the house of representatives
an official report that the majority of the committee on the judiciary prepared to the legislation at hand deliberately and purposely mischaracterized their amendments in a manner that was insulting and derogatory
again no wonder the republicans do not want to talk about what is on the floor right now which is a privileged resolution addressing the gross abuse of power of the republicans
if this were to pass without discussion think of the precedent that it would create that the majority on a regular and repeated basis could use their power and abuse their power to write any characterization of any amendment that anyone made
the behavior exhibited by the republican majority with the committee on the judiciary report flies in the face of the comity and civility and honesty that we should all strive for
i was deeply disappointed to learn that the chairman of the committee on the judiciary has refused to apologize on his own accord
as i said mr speaker you even see in this close on this important debate that there is an interest in stopping the conversation
i hope that the speaker and the republican leadership will reflect on their obligations to the house and indeed to all the members of both parties and that they will ask the chairman of the committee on the judiciary to apologize for the affront to this house and the blatant abuse of position as the chairman of the committee on the judiciary
as i said many of us while we may disagree on issues have held him in great esteem and respect
i want to commend all the members of the committee on the judiciary once again republicans and democrats alike
i know that the distinguished chairman for whom i have great respect would like to call it a drafting dispute or return to a discussion on the merits of the bill
what the leadership of the committee on the judiciary did is just another extension of the abuse of power of the republican majority in both chambers of the congress of the united states
there is an attempt to limit the voice of the minority reducing the opportunity for members to speak on the floor and offer substitutes and amendments
that is why the republican leadership has an obligation to come here right now on the floor and disavow this disgraceful behavior
i rise in strong support of the emergency war supplemental and i commend in particular the new chairman of the committee on appropriations the gentleman from california mr lewis xz4002392 and all the members of his committee for masterful and disciplined work on this important legislation
but just like our troops the american people deserve the very best protection and the gentleman from california chairman lewis and the members of his committee have succeeded in adding 635 million in budgetary resources for increased border security and enforcement and this also is a critical advance in the war on terror
we are standing with our soldiers abroad as they fight on the front lines of the war on terror
i applaud again the gentleman from california chairman lewis and the house committee on appropriations for their disciplined and principled manner of approaching this legislation
i am pleased to note that today the house committee on the judiciary held a markup of my bill hr 748 the child interstate abortion notification act ciana
the 911 commission was constituted in order to tell the american public what we could do to avoid or stave off another attack like the one that occurred on 911
i would therefore mr speaker hope that we would pass the resolution so that the house will not be on record as condoning such misrepresentations
mr speaker i include for the record an editorial published this morning in the daily newspaper in norfolk virginia the virginian pilot on this issue
democrats on the judiciary committee offered several amendments that would have limited the law s scope
no matter your answer to that question the congressman s wording is pretty clear unless you re a member of the judiciary committee s staff which managed scott s amendment into this mr scott xz4003641 offered an amendment that would have exempted sexual predators from prosecution if they re taxicab drivers bus drivers or others in the business of professional transport in other words the staff of a committee on which scott serves accused him of trying to protect sexual predators arguably a crime in itself
the resolution to change the descriptions of course failed on a partyline vote
still for 60 minutes the rudeness that now rules the hall of the capitol was on sharp display for all america to see
mr speaker i would refer the gentleman to the statement made by the gentleman from ohio mr chabot xz4000710 that is on the bottom of page 84 which talks about the potential of sexual predators
at the committee on the judiciary markup on this bill some members offered amendments that would have created blanket exclusions from the criminal prohibitions in the legislation without any exceptions for those who would commit statutory rape or incest
that purpose is reviewed extensively in the committee report in an entire section entitled ciana protects minor girls from sexual assault the amendments offered at the committee on the judiciary markup were directly contrary to a primary purpose of the legislation
as a recent presentation given at a us department of health and human services conference on the sexual exploitation of teens showed of minor girls first sexual experiences 13 percent constitute statutory rape
the ratio is greater among victims of incest than those of rape because incestuous conduct is usually longterm and progressive whereas rape is usually a onetime occurrence another amendment offered at the committee on the judiciary markup of hr 748 accurately described the amendment as creating an additional layer of federal court review that could be used by sexual predators to escape conviction under the bill that statement is true
the resolution states that the chairman of the committee on the judiciary explained that it was his purpose and intention to include derogatory and inaccurate captions in house report 10951 i have done nothing of the sort of course and that statement is entirely false as i have explained already
the text of the resolution also claims that the committee on the judiciary purposefully and deliberately mischaracterized the votes at the committee on the judiciary markup
instead of admitting the obvious and having the committee report amended to their liking and moving on they refused to do that because for some reason they felt they could benefit from extending the debate on this issue
and at the committee on the judiciary markup of hr 748 on april 13 2005 the gentleman from new york mr nadler xz4002890 stated the statement of the gentleman from new york mr nadler xz4002890 directly equates parents with slaveholders
mr speaker how much time is left on each side
mr speaker i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from ohio mr chabot xz4000710 the chairman on the subcommittee on the constitution
and when we vote on legislation we vote on what is on the plain text of the piece of paper not on what the author of an amendment intended to do
anyone knowingly and willfully falsifies conceals or covers up by any trick scheme or device a material fact 2 makes any materially false fictitious or fraudulent statement or representation or 3 makes or uses any false writing or document knowing the same to contain any materially false fictitious or fraudulent statement or entry shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 5 years or both the committee on rules discovered last week that the committee on the judiciary report on the child interstate abortion notification act authored by the majority staff in conflict obviously to the united states code contained amendment summaries that had been rewritten by the staff for the sole purpose of distorting the original intent of the authors
i was certain it must have been an oversight because i could not imagine that the committee on the judiciary of all things or the committee on the judiciary chairman whom i have known for 18 years would stand by a committee report that would so deeply mischaracterize and falsify the intent of several amendments offered by democrat members of the committee
we may disagree on how we overcome the challenges that lay before us just as our founding fathers hoped and expected we would
we must insist on accountability and honesty in this government and we too must always be accountable and honest
their good work saved many american lives by ensuring that our tax dollars were spent on where they needed to be spent on winning the war
and yet we in this congress do not have the courage to insist on the same level of accountability today that our forefathers saw fit to employ over 60 years ago
when this same supplemental was brought before the house earlier this year the gentleman from massachusetts mr tierney xz4004070 offered an amendment that would have established a select committee to follow up on a very disturbing report which had been released from the inspector general s office
the report indicated that 9 billion of money spent on iraqi reconstruction was unaccounted for
and without any oversight commission to investigate and prevent the issues of taxpayer dollars by the pentagon or some unscrupulous government contractors how can we be sure that the 82 billion check we are cutting today on behalf of the american taxpayers will actually reach its destination or be used to protect our troops in the line of fire
but now i want to touch on what should not be in the bill
it should be debated on the floor openly with opportunity for ample discussion and amendment
members should be aware that the rule contains a section that authorizes the committee on the judiciary to file a supplemental report on hr 748 the child interstate abortion notification act
members may recall that during the markup of hr 748 in committee on the judiciary last month five defeated democrat amendments were included in the committee report with descriptions that blatantly and grossly mischaracterized the amendments
while the rule will provide for a supplemental report to be filed it does not require or direct the chairman of the committee on the judiciary to apologize to the authors of the amendments nor are we sure that it will never happen again
also if he is referring to members on our side saying that we are not safer than we were on 911 i would report that was a government report saying that tsa has made us no safer than it was before
i will be asking members to vote no on the previous question
nearly 9 billion of money spent on the iraq reconstruction is unaccounted for because of inefficiencies and bad management according to the special inspector general for the iraqi reconstruction
i want to stress that a no vote on the previous question will not stop consideration of the emergency supplemental report
a yes vote on the previous question will prevent the house from establishing this important select committee
mr speaker i ask unanimous consent that the text of the amendment be printed in the record immediately before the vote on the previous question
mr speaker again i urge a no vote on the previous question and i reserve the balance of my time
they wanted us to negotiate with our states on whether they wanted to do this or not and what we have done is impose upon the states without any hearings or any discussion with them from top down an unfunded mandate requiring them to change their driver s license at our whim
mr speaker i object to the vote on the ground that a quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not present
this supplemental that we are talking about under the rule is 82 billion in additional spending bringing it to almost 300 billion for spending on combat operations occupation and support for our military personnel
the center for strategic and international studies made an analysis and said as little as 27 cents of every dollar spent on iraqi reconstruction has actually filtered down to projects benefiting iraqis
it said that the commander s emergency response program which is a program designed to allow us military officers to quickly fund small reconstruction projects maintain little documentation on how tax dollars were spent 42 cases worth 13 billion where there were no contracts on file 142 cases totaling 40 million where there was no proof that the work was even done
this criticism continues to go on about solesource contracts and other issues that ought to be explored
the truman committee was also unanimously respected for its focus on factfinding and its refusal to succumb to partisan considerations
while mr shays s subcommittee on national security has attempted to draw attention to this issue the full government reform committee has convened only four hearings on the iraq contracting process
similarly the house armed services committee touched on this issue during a june 2004 readiness subcommittee hearing however beyond that they have not pursued the issue
to that point highlighting the need for such a select committee the ranking democrat on the house armed services committee ike skelton has cosponsored the bill from which this amendment is based
critics may disqualify this amendment on a technicality suggesting it authorizes on an appropriations bill
mr speaker i am really saddened today and i am not sure whether i am more disappointed because of the mischaracterization of the amendments in the committee report or whether i am more saddened by the fact that the members of a committee on which i have served now for 13 years would be here on the floor defending the characterization that was put in the committee s report
i would just hope that we can get the committee to file an amended report that clears this up and we can put this behind us and go on
this is saddening and if we can not get that i think it would be a really really sad commentary on this institution and what our committee has sunk to in this congress
they had heard some of our friends on the other side of the aisle saying they were wasting their lives
i have heard people on television i have heard colleagues across the aisle some folks i have great respect for indicating that there is nothing in the real id bill that would have changed anything on 911
and i have respect for some of these people that i have heard say that and i wish that they would read the bill instead of just relying on talking points or something from the leadership
because if you look under evidence of lawful status which is required in order to have a driver s license that will be an acceptable form of identification to get on an airplane it says you can not use a driver s license if it does not come from a state that makes sure you are in lawful status
and if you are in a temporary status it must be a temporary driver s license that says on there the same date your permit to be in this country expires
if we had had that in place on 911 then every one of the hijackers would have tried to get onboard an airplane with an invalid outofdate driver s license and should have been stopped
it would have helped on 911 it will help prevent 911s in the future
mr speaker the house will convene on tuesday at 2 pm
any votes called on measures will be rolled until 6 30 on tuesday
on wednesday and the balance of the week the house will convene at 10 am
mr speaker i would like to defer on the rules to the committee on rules chairman
he will have some announcements regarding rules on those bills when he speaks
mr speaker at this moment we are scheduled to work on friday
mr speaker the committee on appropriations is moving their work along at an extraordinary pace particularly based on the fact that they also were able to get this supplemental done today in a way that has not slowed down the progress we are seeing this year
we are hopeful to get many if not all of these bills done by the early part of july and expect to have some of these bills on the floor the week of may 16
in many ways the rest of the calendar will respond to the work coming out of the committee on appropriations and ready for the floor
i want to thank the distinguished gentleman from virginia mr forbes xz4001370 for his hard work on this very critical issue
i also want to thank the chairman of the committee on the judiciary the gentleman from wisconsin mr sensenbrenner xz4003650 for his leadership in this area as well
sadly too many children are turning their backs on beneficial extracurricular activities and turning to the world of guns and drugs and violent activity in order to gain entry into or move up or just maintain status in a gang
in my district the first district of ohio which includes the city of cincinnati the 22 homicides that have occurred as of march put the city on pace to exceed the record number 75 homicides that occurred back in 2003
many of our city officials and law enforcement point toward gang activity centered on drug trafficking as the source of this increase
now the one thing that we should know before we go to a vote here is the organizations that have joined myself and the gentleman from virginia mr scott xz4003641 the ranking subcommittee member and the gentleman from illinois mr davis xz4000931 who has worked tirelessly on this issue across the years with the congressional black caucus
at a time when we have more than 21 million americans in prisons or jails more than any nation on the planet and 10 percent of these individuals are already serving life sentences it is difficult for reasonable legislators to see how more jail time for more youth can accomplish anything constructive
so i urge that the members of this house return this measure to the committee on the judiciary
mr chairman could i ask the distinguished author of this amendment if this idea occurred to him during the time that we considered the bill in the committee on the judiciary
and i have some reservations about piling it on
we have never talked about this position before in the subcommittee or full committee of the committee on the judiciary
i would hope that we would take it back deal with it appropriately and bring a bill that we can agree on that punishes those who deserve to be punished but to demonstrate that we understand sensitivity and not put children in jail as adults
the mandatory minimums proscribed in this legislation will only result in many young people serving long sentences at least ten years based on the circumstances of rather than the crime itself
mr speaker the committee on rules may meet the week of may 9 to grant a rule which could limit the amendment process for floor consideration of hr 1279 the gang deterrence and community protection act of 2005
any member wishing to offer an amendment should submit 55 copies and one copy of a brief explanation of the amendment to the committee on rules in room h312 of the capitol by noon on tuesday may 10 2005
members should draft their amendments to the bill as reported by the committee on the judiciary on april 20 2005
members are advised that the report of the committee on the judiciary is expected to be filed today thursday may 5 and members are also advised that the text of the reported bill should be available for their review on the web sites of the committee on the judiciary and the committee on rules by this evening
it is amazing as we listened to those numbers that the gentleman from virginia mr forbes xz4001370 used talking about the fact that this would be the sixth largest army on the face of the earth between threequarters of a million and 850 000 gang members 21 500 gangs out there the fact that it has become such an international entity
the gentleman from virginia mr scott xz4003641 who is sitting here on the floor along with the gentlewoman from california ms waters xz4004220 is going to have an amendment made in order under this rule
it will help us turn the corner on what is a very serious problem
mr speaker it is with a great deal of pride that i rise today to support both this rule and the underlying bill and to point out to my good friend on the other side that this is a bipartisan bill and it is a bill that is designed to reach a major problem in our country today which is the rise of violent gang crime
mr speaker i would suggest that if this bill fails we might as well put a sign on a billboard that says coming to a neighborhood near you soon because that is the growth we are seeing in violent gangs
and mr speaker we will have a lot more as the day goes on
dear chairman sensenbrenner on behalf of the major county sheriffs association i am writing to express our support for hr 1279 the gang deterrence and community protection act of 2005 this much needed legislation takes a necessary step toward addressing the growing epidemic of gang violence that is affecting our entire nation and has even stretched into some of our most rural communities
dear chairman sensenbrenner on behalf of the members of the association for los angeles deputy sheriffs alads which represents over 7 000 deputy sheriffs and district attorney investigators in los angeles county

recent studies on gangs have estimated that over 25 000 different gangs comprising over 750 000 members are active across the united states
it also creates a new gang prosecution statute focusing on street gangs and increases the penalties for violent gang crimes strengthening prosecutors ability to combat gang activities
dear representative forbes i am writing on behalf of the members of the fraternal order of police to advise you of our strong support for hr 1279 the gang deterrence and community protection act of 2005 this legislation will attack the growing problem of criminal gang activity by providing increased federal funding almost 390 million to support federal state and local law enforcement efforts to combat gang activity
law enforcement agencies in these designated areas will be able to call on federal resources to hire additional state and local prosecutors and purchase technology to increase their abliity to identify and prosecute violent offenders
i want to commend you for your leadership on this issue
if i can be of any further help on this or any other issue please do not hesitate to contact me or executive director jim pasco through my washington office
sincerely chuck canterbury april 18 2005 dear representative sensenbrenner as the house judiciary committee continues its work on gang violence in america on behalf of the national latino peace officers association nlpoa we support all of the provisions contained in hr 1279 and urge the committee to adopt all of the provisions to strengthen federal law enforcement s capabilities on combating the growing gang violence in america 18 usc
521 criminal street gang prosecutions increasing the penalty for such criminal acts on behalf of a criminal gang defining gang crime for federal prosecution increased penalties for racketeering crimes on behalf of the criminal gangs modification of the definition of a crime of violence and increasing resources and appropriations in the newly defined high intensity interstate gang activity areas
the other thing that i want to say that you will see today and we heard it earlier and i was absolutely shocked when i heard it but the opponents of this bill literally said on the floor earlier this morning that giving arts and crafts to criminal gang members who committed violent crimes would do more than the provisions of this bill which is to lock them up and to empower law enforcement to go after them
mr chairman i just wish today that we would hear the same passion for the victims of gang crimes as we have heard on the other side for those who commit violent gang crimes
they can either spend a long time in jail or they can help us bring down the networks that are praying on our communities
we have not heard a single discussion on it on the floor today
mr speaker it is time we stopped playing games with this bill and we pass it and go on to try to deal with these violent gangs
mr speaker by direction of the committee on rules i call up house resolution 268 and ask for its immediate consideration
the rule provides 1 hour of general debate equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the committee on the judiciary
it provides that the amendment in the nature of a substitute recommended by the committee on the judiciary and now printed in the bill shall be considered as an original bill for the purpose of amendment and it makes in order only those amendments printed in the committee on rules report accompanying this resolution
mr speaker it is time for congress to get tough on gang activity
if we can get tough on drugs and if we can get tough on identity theft terrorism child abduction we can get tough on gangs by creating the tools to put gang members behind bars and get them off the streets
the gang deterrence and community protection act would give the attorney general discretion on whether or not to try a juvenile in federal court as an adult if they are 16 or 17 years old
my own state of georgia has laws that give prosecutors discretion on whether to treat juveniles as adults involving violent and repeat offenses
mr speaker gang activity is as important to the war on crime today as the battles against organized crime in the 1960s and 1970s
like our war against terrorism our law enforcement on the state local and national levels need to communicate to share intelligence and to share resources
mr speaker i yield myself such time as i may consume to clarify and to remind my colleagues on the other side who are suggesting we should be adding more social programs to this legislation that this is not a social programs bill
if they would like to work with the chairman of the committee on the judiciary to craft a bill that would authorize arts and craft classes for gang members certainly they can do that
i would also like to mention that we currently have spent over the past 4 years 2001 to 2004 over 21 billion on juvenile social programs aimed at prevention
mr speaker i yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from virginia mr forbes xz4001370 the distinguished author of the bill and member of the committee on the judiciary
mr speaker i yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from california mr dreier xz4001150 the distinguished chairman of the committee on rules
as we bring debate on this rule to a close i must stress the importance of strengthening our communities efforts against gang crime
with mandatory sentencing law enforcement will gain leverage over the lowerlevel gang members leverage that will put pressure on a gang member to roll over on their leadership
the identity theft penalty enhancement act contained mandatory minimum sentences and it passed on suspension
getting tough on crime requires tough and uniform enforcement
mr speaker i yield back the balance of my time and i move the previous question on the resolution
i was pleased to work with the committee on the judiciary and especially the gentleman from virginia mr forbes xz4001370 my good friend to support the legislation on the floor today
madam chairman many headlines of late have reflected on growing gang problems in heavily populated areas
unfortunately gang violence is also on the rise in rural areas including my congressional district
i rise to offer an amendment to crack down on gangs comprised of illegal aliens such as ms13 which newsweek recently called the most dangerous gang in america in my congressional district alone we have recently witnessed a disturbing rise in the level of gang activity as well as the number of illegal aliens participating in this gang activity
according to the fbi ms13 is a highly sophisticated gang of illegal and previously deported aliens that is committed to national expansion in the united states and is built on a infrastructure which transports new members or previously deported members across our borders with the intention and plan to expand their activities into new communities and enrich themselves all at the expense of our communities and our lawabiding neighbors
it gives law enforcement the ability to tack on more severe punishments rather than simply returning ms13 members to el salvador or other countries where they will turn around and sneak right across our borders once again
and according to the los angeles times the los angeles department arrests about my amendment would help to stop the entry and reentry of gang members into the country by imposing strict penalties on illegal aliens who participate in gang activities and who have already shown they will commit violent crimes and drugtrafficking offenses
it will also add 15 years of prison time to any such sentence if the illegal alien had been previously deported on the grounds of a criminal offense and had reentered the country
in addition the amendment would require the department of homeland security to send all the names of individuals who are subject to deportation orders or who have signed voluntary deportation orders to the national crime information center the ncic so that information on illegal alien gang members can be more easily accessed
mr chairman it is my pleasure to yield 1 minute to the gentleman from wisconsin mr sensenbrenner xz4003650 the chairman of the committee on the judiciary
central american leaders say the groups pose a hemispheric threat augmented by us deportation of criminals you can not keep sending them back down there where they have no ability to handle them and they come right back up here and commit more crimes on our citizens
a week later a 17yearold youth was shot dead in herndon by an assailant on a bicycle
mr speaker i rise today to express my disappointment with the structured rule that has been set forth for debate on hr 1279 the gang deterrence and community protection act of 2005 this bill among other things could subject innocent people to the death penalty creates numerous discriminatory mandatory minimum sentences could result in wrongful convictions based on unreliable evidence and creates more serious juvenile offenders by incarcerating children in adult prisons
despite the structured rule i hope my colleagues on both sides will realize the importance of this bill and give it the time and attention it deserves
the material previously referred to by mr mcgovern xz4002630 is as follows previous question for h res 268 rule on hr 1279 the gang deterrence amp community protection act of 2005 at the end of the resolution add the following sec

just recently of course as the ranking member on the subcommittee on immigration we have had hearings on the ms13 gangs
from the early time of my career i recall that we have on the committee on the judiciary reached out those of us who were democrats to reach out on this question of intervention
in fact the first term that i was here we did a national tour if you will national meetings of the subcommittee on crime
my colleague who is now the ranking member joined me on that the gentleman from virginia mr scott xz4003641 where we traveled across the nation to talk about the importance of intervention on gang and juvenile crime activities
in fact out of that came a legislative initiative the aspect that i worked on was mental health intervention mental health treatment which we found to be very effective
it established a system whereby any individual inadvertently included on the gang terror watch list may have his or her name removed
sweeping up large numbers of people from the pakistani community and as i understand not one single person on that list was found to be a terrorist
and i have in fact written bills that have enhanced sentencing on particular notorious or vicious acts
instead of focusing on correctional and rehabilitative programs it attempts to throw more youth in crowded adult prisons where these programs are lacking
i would like to thank the gentlemen from massachusetts mr mcgovern for his austere words in support of the amendments that i offered at the committee on rules yesterday but were not made in order
first of all in the passage of the patriot act if we are fearful of these gangs smuggling individuals over who do terrorist acts the patriot act enhances sentencing on those engaging in terrorist acts
you have got to not give up on young people
i work closely with the law enforcement divisions in my area and they wanted a system that would allow them to easily access and share information on gang activity
this database will contain critical information on gangs gang members firearms criminal activities and histories vehicles and other fields of information necessary for investigators to solve gangrelated crimes
this ethnic enclave has created and fostered some of the worst gains we have ever seen in this country people that cut off hands and arms and heads people that have a network across this nation that from a prison in california can order an execution on the streets of virginia or from a prison in virginia order an execution in a prison in la
or on the streets of la
mr speaker continuing to yield to the gentleman i understand we have appropriation bills coming up and we understand we may have a number of appropriation bills on the floor prior to the memorial day district work period
mr chairman i would like to thank the gentleman from wisconsin for working with me on this section section 922 x which he just basically took out
i appreciate him working with us on that issue
mr speaker time magazine focused on the spike in gang activity in los angeles in the september 3 2001 edition
you have the three strikes law and jail and so on but you ca nt terrify a kid into being hopeful about his future the following quote is even more telling we do nt need new laws
let me remind my colleagues that president bush signed the justice for all act into law on october 30 2004
another flawed aspect of hr 1279 is its emphasis on mandatory minimum sentencing
however the judicial conference of the united states and the us sentencing commission has found mandatory minimums require sentencing courts to impose the same sentence on offenders when sound policy and common sense call for reasonable differences in punishment in other words judges are prevented from assessing what type of punishment fits the crime
for the most violent and dangerous individuals we already have laws on the books that address these actions
studies of head start demonstrate that 3 is saved for every 1 spent on the program by reducing the future cost of crime remedial education and welfare
about 75 percent of job corps participants move on to a fulltime job or study and are onethird less likely to be arrested than nonparticipants
local communities all across this country are laying off police officers at a time when we should be increasing the number of police who are on our streets
mr speaker finally let me just say that 16 democratic amendments were not made in order by the committee on rules last night
they brought them forward in the committee on rules last night
yet last night the committee on rules said to 16 democrats that you will be shut out of this debate
we can talk all we want about using all this harsh rhetoric but the bottom line is there are laws already on the books if you commit a violent crime in this country
we need more police on the streets
i always enjoy listening to the distinguished chairman of the committee on rules the gentleman from california mr dreier xz4001150
he mentions that a handful of democratic amendments were made in order and i guess we all should be grateful on this side of the aisle because usually we get shut out totally
i am willing to stay until 5 or even until 6 or even until 7 to give these other people an opportunity to have their concerns voiced on this floor
i think especially on an issue like this as many people who have these ideas should be able to bring them to the floor and to be able to debate them
but unfortunately 16 amendments have been totally blocked from consideration on this bill
and why did the committee on rules last night deny the gentleman from massachusetts mr capuano xz4000630 and the gentleman from new york mr weiner xz4004260 the right to offer an amendment that reauthorizes the community oriented policing services the cops program for fiscal year 2006 2008
we could have had a vote on the floor today on that amendment and a full debate and that was denied in the committee on rules
the gentleman from new york mr crowley xz4000870 had an amendment that would require that the purchase of firearms ammunition and explosives to be made in person and to require records to be kept on how the purchases were made
yet the committee on rules would not allow that amendment to be made in order on the floor today
we can disagree on whether or not juveniles should be tried as adults but nonetheless it is an important enough issue that we should have debated it on the floor here today and let members decide that
that was ruled out of order by the committee on rules
i mean i can go on and on and on
there are really good ideas here and yet for whatever reason the committee on rules last night said they are not going to have their day on the house floor
and i do not understand why and nobody who has spoken on the other side has explained to me why those amendments were not made in order not even mr speaker i reserve the balance of my time
i also include for the record a statement that has been signed by the american bar association the american civil liberties union chamber of commerce of the united states the children s defense fund the commission on social action of reform judaism leadership conference on civil rights the national urban league murder victims families for human rights the naacp the national federation of independent business and the united states conference on catholic bishops all in opposition to this legislation
and i include for the record so that it is there the 16 amendments that the majority of the committee on rules decided to not make in order today on this important legislation
dear member of congress on behalf of the national council of la raza nclr the largest national latino civil rights organization in the us i urge you to oppose provisions contained in the gang deterrence and community protection act of 2005 hr 1279 which is on the suspension calendar this week
hr 1279 will if enacted into law would have a disparate impact on latino youth and their families
when judges are restricted by mandatory sentences they can not assess an individua1s culpability during the crime or other factors that have bearing on recidivism thus resulting in inappropriate sentences
studies have shown that this discretion results in a disparity in sentencing outcomes based largely on race and quality of defense attorney
while we certainly recognize that these consequences were not the intent of this legislation this provision could have an unjust impact on business
we ask that you give serious consideration our concerns as you continue to work on this issue
26 crowley the amendment requires that the purchase of firearms ammunition and explosives to be made in person and requires records to be kept on how the purchases were made
it also establishes a system that would assist any individual who is wrongly included on such a list to have his or her name removed
these databases contain critical information on gangs gang members firearms criminal activities and histories vehicles and other fields of information necessary to investigators in solving gang related crimes
dear representative on behalf of the united states conference of catholic bishops and catholic charities usa we urge you to oppose provisions in hr 1279 gang deterrence and community protection act of 2005 the gang bill that would expand the use of the death penalty treat juveniles as adults and impose mandatory minimum sentences
catholic teaching on capital punishment is clear if bloodless means are sufficient to defend human lives against an aggressor and to protect public order and the safety of persons public authority should limit itself to such means because they better correspond to the concrete conditions of the common good and are more in conformity to the dignity of the human person catechism of the catholic church
as we stated in our 2000 pastoral statement on criminal justice we believe that placing juveniles in the adult court system is not a solution to reducing gang activity
responsibility rehabilitation and restoration a catholic perspective on crime and criminal justice november 15 2000
unlike state systems around the country the federal system does not have any specialized programs or facilities to accommodate young people or to a address the root problems such as abuse that these children are experiencing at home or on the streets
this emphasis on swift punishment rather than effective treatment and intervention demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding of the street gang culture and is tantamount to giving up on our children something that our faith tradition teaches we should never do
although the offenses are serious and individuals who are convicted ought to be properly held accountable rigid sentencing formulations could prevent judges from properly assessing an individual s culpability during the crime or other factors that have bearing on recidivism thus sometimes resulting in harsh and inappropriate sentences
the gang bill could subject innocent people to the death penalty creates numerous discriminatory mandatory minimum sentences could result in wrongfully convictions based on unreliable evidence and creates more serious juvenile offenders by incarcerating children in adult prisons
hr 1279 is scheduled for a vote on the house boor on wednesday may 11 2005 we strongly urge you to oppose this legislation
congress should not expand the federal death penalty until it ensures innocent people are not on death row
according to the death penalty information center 119 prisoners on death row have now been exonerated
states continue to address the systemic problems with the administration of the death penalty by implementing reform and moratorium efforts while the federal government in hr 1279 is moving to expand the death penalty in lieu of enacting or implementing reforms on the federal level
making it more difficult for an accused person to be released on bail prior to trial hinders a defendant s ability to assist their defense lawyer with investigating the facts of the case and preparing their defense
hr 1279 will not solve the problem of gang crime in this country thus members should oppose this bill when the house of representatives votes on wednesday may 11 2005
this approach will skew traditional federal law enforcement priorities undercut the superior efforts of the states to deal with violent crimes and juvenile offenders and may exceed constitutional limits on federal power
the heritage foundation provided recent testimony on what measures congress should support to address the gang problem including fostering stable neighborhoods providing afterschool activities and improving local economies and hr 1279 does none of these things
commission on social action of reform judaism
leadership conference on civil rights
i will be asking members to vote no on the previous question
if the previous question is defeated i will amend the rule to allow the house to consider the capuanoweiner amendment on the cops program
this amendment was offered in the committee on rules last night but was defeated on a straight partyline vote
the cops program created as a result of the violent crime control and law enforcement act of 1994 focuses on crime prevention at the local level
this program puts law enforcement professionals on the streets and assigns them a beat so they can build mutually beneficial relationships with the people that they serve
i urge my colleagues to vote no on the previous question
mr speaker i ask unanimous consent that the text of the amendment be printed in the record immediately prior to the vote on the previous question
mr speaker i object to the vote on the grounds that a quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not present
mr chairman the purpose of my amendment is to require the department of homeland security within 6 months to get information on a number of types of criminal illegal aliens into the national crime information center
under my amendment information on three types of aliens would be included in the national crime information center first those aliens with a final order of removal issued against them
mahmud abouhalima entered on a tourist visa in 1985 which expired in the spring of 1986
mohammed salameh entered on a 6month tourist visa issued in jordan in 1988
eyad ismoil entered on a student visa in 1989 left school after three semesters violating the terms of his visa and became an illegal alien
this was all written on november 8 1998 in the dallas morning news nearly 3 years before the attacks of 911 and approximately 6 12 years ago
i will take just a minute to thank the chairman of the committee on the judiciary for a great bill
this amendment would simply require a study conducted jointly by the department of homeland security and the department of justice on the link between illegal aliens and gang membership
surprisingly despite the overwhelming agreement from all parties that the two are linked there is no comprehensive report anywhere that we can find on this topic
congressional testimony on april 13 of this year produced some important anecdotal evidence of the need of this sort of data
before the committee on the judiciary subcommittee on immigration marsha garst offered some statistics in relation to some problems in the shenandoah valley of virginia
she also related that a number of the illegal alien gang members had been previously deported proving that we are not doing our job on the borders
ice officials put the number of illegals among ms13 members at simply a majority we need to do better than just know a majority if you are not convinced just listen to my friend and colleague the gentleman from indiana mr hostettler xz4001870 who is the subcommittee on immigration chairman
he indicated in his statement while there are an estimated 750 000 to 800 000 gang members in the nation there are no firm estimates on how many of these gang members are aliens and how many are citizens his point should not go unaddressed
people say that addicts have to first admit that they have a problem before they can move on and get help
i hope that we will not take too long to seek that help and i would be happy to assist with a solution because it is an issue that i have worked on and been very interested in for a long time
this is an effort to get the facts on what we already know
i ask all of our colleagues on both sides of the aisle to vote to help protect this country from illegal immigrants
mr chairman the gang deterrence and community protection act hr 1279 is the latest example of congress disregarding its constitutional limitations in the name of getting tough on crime gang crime is certainly a serious issue in many parts of the country
chief justice william h rehnquist and former us attorney general ed meese two men who no one has ever accused of being soft on crime have both warned that although creating more federal crimes may make politicians feel good it is neither constitutionally sound nor prudent
mandatory minimum sentences impose a onesizefitsall formula in place of the discretion of a judge or jury to weigh all the circumstances surrounding an individual s crime and decide on an appropriate punishment
however i recognize that congress must make sure it does not overstep its constitutional authority by imposing legislative solutions on matters best resolved by the judicial branch
rigid sentencing formulations could prevent judges from properly assessing an individual s culpability during the crime of other factors that have bearing on recidivism thus sometimes resulting in harsh and inappropriate sentences i am also concerned that removing authority over the prevention and punishment of gang crimes from state and local jurisdictions will prevent states and localities from coming up with innovative ways to prevent gang crimes
supporters of this bill make a good point that federal money is being wasted on ineffective prevention programs like the infamous midnight basketball program
instead it spends more taxpayer money on unconstitutional crime programs
the sponsors of this bill could have attempted to stop wasting taxpayer funds on programs such as midnight basketball by defunding such prevention programs and using the funds to pay for the new programs created by hr 1279
i myself can appreciate the destruction that gang violence can impose on a community
each of these gangs controlled large amounts of territory and have wreaked havoc on the chicago community
in addition a better approach as opposed to this illadvised approach would be to focus our energy on more programs for at risk youth such as head start job corps and family focused intervention programs
again i rise against hr 1279 and urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to do the same
in fact as many of my democratic colleagues have repeatedly stressed imposing mandatory minimums on youths often results in a greater likelihood of repeat and more violent offenses
prevention and intervention programs on the other hand have a proven track record of keeping kids out of gangs but at the committee on the judiciary markup of this bill and in the committee on rules last night amendments to include intervention and prevention programs in this bill were defeated along partyline votes
instead this bill would lock up young people in adult prisons and take away judges discretion to review on a casebycase basis crimes committed by youth
the schiffbono bill represents a comprehensive effort to increase gang prosecution and prevention efforts in order to crack down on criminal street gangs
the sponsor of the bill before us today has spent much time on highlighting the groups that have supported his bill
with all due respect to my colleague from virginia on the opposite side of the aisle the most significant difference between the bill i introduced prior to the bill that is now before us is that all of the prevention funding in the senate bill and in my own bipartisan bill has been stripped out of the antigang measure and all we are left with is the deterrence
a small amount to preventive funding that we invest now saves us a lot on the back end
investing a small amount on the front end in timetested and true programs that keep kids out of trouble makes infinite sense both in terms of dollars saved and in terms of lives saved
and my hope madam chairman because my amendment to restore this funding was not allowed by the rules committee we were not allowed to put it to my colleagues on the house floor for a vote i hope madam chairman it comes back from the senate in a form that we can both support on both sides of the aisle
yes it is true that the feinsteinhatch amendment that i offered in committee did not enjoy broad support on either side of the aisle
some on my side of the aisle thought the sentencing enhancements in this bipartisan legislation were too strong and could not support it
not a single gop member of the committee on the judiciary would support the prevention funding in committee
and we do not have the ability to raise that issue on the house floor
no amendments in this rule are allowed to address the death penalty which has been shown to be racially discriminatory which has been shown to have no effect on crime and shown to be so inappropriate that the supreme court with seven republican appointees sitting on the court ruled that for juveniles the death penalty was unconstitutional
if you are going to have an effect on gangs the money ought to go to where the gangs are actually fought on the local
keep the kids out of trouble and if they get in trouble to begin with get them right back on track
i have got to admit that the sound bites and slogans are stronger on the other side but all of the studies show that this bill would do virtually nothing to reduce juvenile crime and is certainly not an effective use of the taxpayers money if your goal is to actually reduce crime
rather than following through on the proven crime and violence prevention techniques that work we are back to toughtalking sound byte policies that have been proven to not only fail to reduce crime but actually increase crime waste taxpayers money and discriminate against minorities
this bill is in no way like the bill we developed a few years ago on a bipartisan basis to address youth crime and violence following the dark days following the columbine school shootings
that bill was cosponsored by all of the members of the subcommittee on crime and was based on combined wisdom and expertise of law enforcement juvenile court judges administrators researchers criminologists and juvenile justice advocates along with the entire political spectrum
the fully bipartisan bill we developed from recommendations of those experts was full of collaborative efforts between federal state and local officials aimed at addressing the problems caused by young people and addressing them early focused on prevention and keeping them out of trouble to begin with
and when they first get in trouble intervene early and provide sufficient sanctions and services to get them back on the straight and narrow
madam chairman we already lock up more people than anywhere on earth 714 per 100 000 way above whatever is in second place way above the national average of 100 per 100 000
the coalition of juvenile justice study childhood on trial coincidentally released the same day as this bill was introduced covers thousands of cases over a long period of time and confirmed that adult treatment of more juveniles increases crime and violence and is discriminatory in its application
that is primarily because if the judge finds a person guilty in adult court his only possibilities are lock the child up with adults or let them walk on probation or parole
in fact a few weeks ago i met with some students at monument high school in south boston massachusetts and i told them about this upcoming hearing we were having on the gang bill and i asked them what did they think needed to be done to keep kids out of gangs
none of them asked us to waste money on these programs
but on this bill we unfortunately have to disagree
interstate gang members can be caught by rico and organized crime continuing criminal enterprise fbi is already working on that
madam chairman i yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from california ms linda t snchez a member of the committee on the judiciary
mr chairman i yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from michigan mr conyers xz4000800 the ranking member of the committee on the judiciary
mr chairman i yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from michigan mr conyers xz4000800 the ranking member of the committee on the judiciary
finally mandatory minimums require the sentencing court to impose the same sentence on offenders when sound policy and common sense call for reasonable differences and punishment
madam chairman i wish to take a minute to underscore the support for this measure from law enforcement and by that i mean the brave men and women who are on the streets every day putting their lives on the line to fight the gang epidemic in our country
when law enforcement speaks with such a clear and unanimous voice we have a duty to listen to act now and to give their members the tools and resources they need to fight and win this battle on behalf of america s lawabiding citizens
i want to thank my two colleagues the gentleman from virginia mr forbes xz4001370 and the gentleman from virginia mr wolf xz4004350 for their strong and committed leadership on this issue
they have dedicated both time and effort to hr 1279 and should be commended for their focus on combating this disturbing national trend
he put forth his proposal in committee and it was defeated on a rollcall vote of 3 ayes to 22 noes
we can have a legitimate disagreement on mandatory minimum sentences but i think there are some crimes that are so severe and eat away so much at the roots of our society and the fabric of our society that those who are convicted of those crimes ought to be locked up and locked up for sure because only with a certain jail term are we going to be able to punish those who have killed people in the most brutal manner and deter those who might be thinking of doing it to others in our society
i have here an april 26 story from the associated press dateline houston violent gang linked to nine houston area killings i am not going to read the whole story on the floor but i am going to read one paragraph of this story to show that those who wish to delay this bill because it has a mandatory minimum or because it does not do enough social work are wrong harris county sheriff s investigators arrested five members of mara salvatrucha which is ms13 in connection with the shooting death of 18monthold alden naquin who was trapped in his car seat april 12 when a man opened fire on a car driven by his father ernest naquin i think if someone is convicted of murdering an 18monthold in that circumstance they ought to be locked away for sure and for a long time
mr chairman the opponents of this bill seem to zero in on two things
people may have a philosophical disagreement on mandatory minimum sentences but it seems to me that given the violence of gang activity the number of murders the number of maimings that a mandatory minimum sentence is absolutely necessary to get these people off the streets if the twelve persons on the jury believe that that defendant has committed those crimes beyond a reasonable doubt
the other thing we hear from the opponents is they dust off the same old tired arguments that we need more and more spending on prevention programs but no one has proven they work
when we talk about spending more on prevention consider these facts conservative estimates show that the department of justice has already spent over 2 billion that is with a b of the taxpayers dollars between fiscal years 2001 through 2004 on juvenile and gang prevention programs
this is yet to be proven because juvenile gang violence is on the rise
mr chairman the material that is on page 20 relates to a clarification of the ban on possession of hand guns by juveniles
it provides an authorization for a program that already has been funded by the committee on appropriations
i would hope that that concern would spread as we deal with other immigration matters such as the numbers of border patrol people that we need to put on the border
i support this amendment because it creates enhanced penalties for illegal aliens or those ordered deported on the grounds of having committed a crime who subsequently commit a crime of violence or a drugtrafficking crime
in addition the amendment would require the department of homeland security to provide the national crime information center with information on illegal aliens
mr speaker on that i demand the yeas and nays
it is absolutely essential we have strong legislation on the books to send gang members who commit violent acts into jail and off our streets
mr speaker just last week the house spent another 82 billion of taxpayer funds on the war
it not only deals with gangs but it amends the criminal laws on matters concerning hearsay venues statute of limitations and sentencing
mr speaker i urge a yes vote on this commonsense motion to recommit
if we want to deter gang violence and protect our communities we need to focus on effective and comprehensive solutions to address the root causes of youth violence not simply punitive actions
and we are spending a disproportionate amount of money on incarceration
i submit to my colleagues that i think deportation is the answer but have they thought about the fact that they should place the responsibility on keeping these criminals out of the country on the heads of the leaders of those countries
we go right along with the leaders of these countries on trade agreements on foreign assistance with all kinds of assistance to these governments
mr chairman allow me to shock the members on the opposite side of the aisle and join with them in support of this amendment
while this is limited to the link between illegal aliens and gang membership we need more studies on gangs period
mr chairman reclaiming the time i would hope that the gentleman would also support the idea of a broader study on gangs period and that we could identify a number of areas to be looked at
mr chairman all of us know that mandatory minimum sentencing has not worked and it does have a huge disproportionate impact on minorities
mr chairman mandatory minimums also impede on the role of our judges
the mandatory mr chairman to be tough on gangs we must focus more on gang crime prevention
we need to implement more effective prevention tactics that focus on both individuals at risk of joining gangs and on former gang members at risk of rejoining a gang after being released from prison
we should focus our attention on what works
mr chairman i think it is important for me to say on behalf of most of the members if not all of the members of the congress of the united states of america we are all against crime
what we do not support is using this terrible issue to get your law and order credentials on
we do not want you using this issue on the backs of young people who may be victims of gangs rather than criminals themselves
i know that there are people who are just salivating for this amendment to remain on the floor so they can catch democrats voting for something that they will use in their campaigns
i would also like to thank my colleagues on the committee on rules for allowing me to bring this important issue to the floor today
their opinions should be heard on the state and federal levels
local officials know better than anyone else what is occurring on a day to day basis in their jurisdictions
this amendment would allow participation on all levels of government in this designation process
mr chairman i urge my colleagues to support this amendment and allow local elected officials in conjunction with federal and state officials to have input on how their communities are branded as high intensity gang areas
this amendment would also help local law enforcement and the batfe compile muchneeded data on how weapons are obtained and used by gangs
mr chairman i believe that we should make every effort to prevent gang members from obtaining their weapons of mass destruction i urge my colleagues to support this amendment and help the bureau of alcohol tobacco firearms and explosives continue the assault on crime in our communities while cutting off the flow of guns to gang members
and every member of this house on both sides should thank the gentleman
the eldest son age 15 was sitting on the steps of a nearby apartment with two friends when he was gunned down
they prey on the poor
they prey on the poor in the inner cities
they prey on the poor in culmore
and i hope and i pray on behalf of brenda paz who was stabbed 16 times and the families that live in culmore and the families that live out in la
and the families that live in houston and the families that live throughout the state of virginia that are suffering with this that this bill passes overwhelmingly and goes on to the senate and they pass it so we can finally get relief not for the wealthy but for those who live in culmore and the inner city who up until this time have been forgotten by this institution
let me read an article from the washington post in what officials suspect is the latest horror committed by gangs 28 people including six children were killed december 24 when gunmen opened fire on a bus full of passengers near the northern honduran city of san pedro sula twentyeight individuals six of them were children
i think the gentleman s amendment is exactly right on target
while i commend my colleagues on the other side of the aisle for addressing this important issue i am deeply disappointed in their legislation
driveby shootings are becoming so common that the newspapers no longer report the incidents on the front page
this bill does not provide significant funding to states and local communities to build on their successful local programs
it relies in significant part on mandatory minimum sentences
the terrorist attacks on our homeland highlighted the potentially disastrous effects of porous borders and the need to bolster border security
the norwood amendment requires the justice and homeland security departments to conduct a joint study and to report to congress within 1 year on the connection between illegal aliens and gang membership
i was torn on voting for hr 1279 because of my concern for states rights but i was swayed in the end to vote for it because of the number of illegal aliens involved in gangs
with more than a million legal and illegal immigrants settling in the united states each year a level higher than at any other time in our nation s history immigration has an impact on education health care social security taxes employment the environment crime and countless other areas of american life
i sympathize with those who desperately wish to live the american dream here on american soil
madam chairman gang violence is on the rise across the united states
the house committee on the judiciary reports that over 631 gangrelated homicides occurred in 2001 perpetrated by an estimated 750 000 active gang members
in this case however as i expressed in the committee on the judiciary i think there are three problems with the bill first it federalizes state crimes
and then congress comes along and slaps on mandatory minimums on top of that framework doing violence to the framework of a sentencing guideline system
this portion of the bill that treats juveniles in some cases the same as adults is a good idea because in our country victims continue to be discriminated against based on the age of offenders
mr chairman by helping law enforcement share information we will be giving our police on the streets a powerful tool in the fight against violence and help them better protect our citizens
one of the things i know about cops is that they need all kinds of tools and we do need police officers on the street but one of the most important things that cops want is to know that their community supports them local state and federal
i believe in taking problems head on not running away
we can not afford to lose those talented youths in our community to a life on the street with drugs and a gang hierarchy whose form of discipline is violence
in may of 2001 des moines patrol officer steve underwood was shot to death and killed after approaching a car with four gang members on a latenight watch along pacific highway south
i am telling you that first hand as someone who worked on the streets to stop gangs
though the world trade organization has failed to deliver on the promises of economic gains to developing countries and general worldwide trade policy the solution is not to withdraw us support or approval
i think like many people like most of us we have no fear of free trade that the united states playing on a level playing field can easily compete in the world market and i do not ascribe to some of the statements that i think have been somewhat overzealous or vitriolic in describing policies here
i intend on either giving a symbolic vote or maybe a symbolic speech in place of that vote with concerns of sovereignty issues that are dealt with here and that some of those voices that are concerned about sovereignty issues are not just simply those fearful of the dark but there are legitimate concerns which require a periodic reanalysis of what we are doing
it may not be specifically on that point but it does at least give us the opportunity of saying not only is that an issue and a concern for the future but it is an issue that we should take seriously and we should discuss seriously and we should address seriously so that these particular problems especially as it deals with state issues and state rights will not be put in jeopardy with the future
mr speaker earlier this week the committee on appropriations passed an amendment to prevent the us trade representative from using trade pacts as a tool to block prescription drug reimportation
congress should not have to scour every trade pact to make sure that some patent extension or importation barrier or other big government crutch designed specifically for the drug industry has not been inserted into the trade agreement by the us trade representative or by the president or by my friends on the other side of the aisle
i support the resolution to bring forward h j res 27 that has come out of the committee on rules
we have had legislation that we could have acted on that would do that
we need to spend more effort on enforcement
we need to work on tariff and nontariff barriers for us manufacturers
we need to do that on an ongoing basis and the congress needs to exercise its authority to make sure that we are as aggressive as possible at opening up markets for us interests
i am sure people are wondering why we have a resolution on the floor that would withdraw us from the wto and how that comes to the floor from a recommendation of the committee of jurisdiction that it be reported unfavorably that is that we vote against this resolution
as the ranking democrat on the trade subcommittee working with the gentleman from florida mr shaw xz4003690 we very much oppose this resolution and urge the rejection of the resolution
when we see other countries infringe on our intellectual property rights and we do not enforce our existing rules to make sure that we do not allow the stealing of our intellectual property rights that is wrong
it is generally agreed that in order to have a successful meeting of the ministers this december in hong kong the members of the wto will have to come to a significant level of agreement by july on three key areas
i must tell the members i am concerned we have not made anywhere near the progress on agriculture that we need to do
i am particularly concerned about the negotiations on the ntbs which lie far behind at this time
but we have to do a better job in our negotiations within the wto and that is what we need to concentrate on
that is what we need to work together on
mr speaker i am pleased to yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from louisiana mr jefferson xz4002010 a distinguished member of the committee on ways and means
mr speaker i am now pleased to yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from michigan mr levin xz4002380 the former ranking democrat on the subcommittee on trade one of the senior members of the committee on ways and means
i agree with him on cafta and to elevate the wto to do better on international standards
only by working within a rulesbased trading system can we raise the international bar on labor standards on environmental standards
these jobs increasingly have moved overseas and it is hard to support a family on service sector wages
meanwhile i have tried twice in the last year to pass an amendment to simply study the issue of the outsourcing of american jobs and have twice been defeated on close votes
i urge my colleagues to undertake this work and vote yes on h j res 27
mr speaker the economic disaster wrought by a radical free trade policy on the working people of america is well documented but i am going to focus on another aspect of this wto agreement that the previous gentleman spoke about
following world war ii the world s major trading partners came together the global leaders and established the general agreement on tariffs and trade the gatt
the general agreement on tariffs and trade was the predecessor to what is now known as the world trade organization
and of course remember a tariff is a tax so by reducing that tariff burden through the goal of the gatt and now the wto we have been able to reduce the tax burden on consumers throughout the world
we are on the forefront of i hope passing the dominican republic central american free trade agreement which is critical to continuing on that path of prosperity that began with the gatt back in 1947 and has continued through the wto the north american free trade agreement and a wide range of bilateral agreements that we have put together over the past several years with israel jordan chile singapore australia and morocco among others
we are very fortunate to have our former colleague rob portman now serving as our ambassador as the representative the head of focusing on the whole issue of trade the us trade representative for us
mr speaker i believe the resolution on the floor today provides the ideal time to pause and reflect on the shortcomings of the current wto system and on ways both the congress and the administration can make changes to the wto structure so that it works better and rebuilds confidence in the system among our constituencies
i would submit that instead of debating whether to withdraw from the wto congress should have an active debate on ways we can make the current system work properly as it was designed to do and ways to make it better
we were one of the founders of the general agreement on tariffs and trade as well as its successor the wto
north carolina s economy depends on exports and we need to break down barriers to overseas markets so that our technology agriculture manufacturing and other sectors can expand on our progress in international competition
studies show that one in five manufacturing jobs in north carolina depend on exports
these jobs on average pay 1318 percent more than the us average
mr speaker by direction of the committee on rules i call up house resolution 304 and ask for its immediate consideration
mr speaker house resolution 304 is a rule providing for 2 hours of general debate on h j res 27 withdrawing the approval of the united states from the agreement establishing the world trade organization to be equally divided among and controlled by the chairman and ranking member of the committee on ways and means the gentleman from texas mr paul xz4003110 and the gentleman from vermont mr sanders xz4003570
that law authorized the president to accept the united states membership in the wto and requires a report to be submitted to congress every 5 years on the united states participation in the wto
i believe that members of the house should be afforded this opportunity to register their views on this question through a vote of the house which i urge my colleagues to vote on in support of this rule
i am pleased that in 2003 the world trade organization stood up for the apple growers in central washington and across the nation by leveling the playing field in a dispute over japan s import restrictions on imported us apples
trade restrictions should be based on scientific evidence and should be implemented on a limited basis not used merely as tools to create unfair trade barriers
withdrawing from the world trade organization would result in our farmers growers and producers being shut out of these export opportunities and the loss of millions of jobs depending on them
our nation s economy can continue to grow if we have access to global markets on a level playing field
mr speaker i am pleased to yield such time as he may consume to the distinguished chairman of the committee on rules the gentleman from san dimas california mr dreier xz4001150
however our success in selling these goods in a global marketplace and we have to admit that we are in a global market is dependent on fair and open markets
the debate on house resolution 27 is an important one and one that should be had
mr speaker i yield back the balance of my time and i move the previous question on the resolution
a motion to reconsider was laid on the table
the wto imperfect as it may be is the forum that we along with the other members of the international community established to enforce trade rules and more importantly allow for an open dialogue on the trade issues that concern us
we can only work to protect american workers from anticompetitive practices of foreign countries from within the wto not by sitting on the sidelines
but addressing it today does give us a muchneeded opportunity to focus on the wto and how the us can maximize its membership for the benefit of us firms workers and farmers
i will continue to work with my colleagues on the committee on ways and means and in the congress to ensure that the us provides technical support and capacity building measures to assist developing countries in meeting their wto commitments
the wto and its predecessor the general agreement on tariffs and trade have opened foreign markets around the world for us goods and services
we can accomplish this by fully integrating the work of the wto committee on trade and environment into the work of wto negotiating groups
on my right this chart shows on july 31 2003 in north carolina we lost 6 450 jobs
however members intend to vote on the resolution before us the issue of trade remedies under the rules established by the world trade organization wto is of paramount concern to the industries of my district in the years ahead
congress is on record as opposing these efforts and i welcome this opportunity to advocate that our top priority should be to preserve core trade disciplines
if the administration comes back with an agreement that waters down our trade remedy laws even further i am confident we will see a strong backlash in congress and a major effect on support for any new trade agreements
i urge the administration to focus on this issue and to reject any wto deal that would weaken us trade remedy laws
mr speaker i rise today to comment on h j res 27 which seeks to withdraw the approval of the united states from the agreement establishing the world trade organization
what occurred puts the viability of the wto in question but it also allows the us to go forth with trade promotion authorization on its own
mr speaker i thank the gentleman from florida for yielding me this time and i want to associate myself with his remarks and i appreciate his leadership on this
tell that to those millions of families who have seen their lives destroyed by this trade structure which is based inherently based on inequality
i have been all over this country and i have seen padlocks on gates and grass growing in parking lots where they used to make steel where they used to make cars where they used to washing machines where they used to make bicycles
another papal encyclical from pope paul vi populorum progressio but it is unfortunate that on these new conditions of society a system has been constructed which considers profit as the key motive for economic progress competition as the supreme law of economics and private ownership with the means of production as an absolute right that has no limits and carries no corresponding social obligation he goes on to say that this leads to a dictatorship rightly denounced by pious xi by producing the international imperialism of money there is a moral imperative here that we have to recognize that we need trade agreements that have workers rights human rights and environmental quality principles and we can not have that with the wto
it is time to get out of the wto and set up a trade structure based on those principles
i urge that we look at this basic question on balance would we be better off if there were not a wto
did it have some impact on us laws
i think on balance that was a good idea because otherwise every country could veto and that was not workable
there is not an openness that there should be and when it comes to our safeguard provisions that many of us worked hard to put into law the gentleman from maryland mr cardin xz4000640 who is the ranking member was part and parcel of that as well as the gentleman from new york mr rangel xz4003330 and those on the republican side we worked hard to put safeguards in
so my suggestion is that we focus today on the accomplishments but also the barriers to effective operation of the wto
on environment they have kind of a group that looks at environmental issues
on core labor standards there has been resistance to address this
so i just wanted to comment on this because the bilateral agreements were supposed to be a building block where the wto did not address an issue and there is a failure at this critical point of globalization a critical missed opportunity in terms of helping the benefits of globilization being widely shared
so in a word what we need is a trade policy built on a bipartisan foundation which is not true today
on the latter this administration continues to fail
mr speaker i rise today to urge my colleagues to reject any attempts to withdraw the united states from the wto and vote no on final passage
these subsidies in particular launch aid have lowered airbus development costs and shifted the risk of aircraft development to european governments and thereby enabled airbus to develop aircraft at an accelerated pace and sell these aircraft at prices and on terms that would otherwise be unsustainable
as a member of the house committee on international relations and the fact that john f kennedy international airport is the economic engine of my district it is imperative that this body support ustr ambassador robert portman s efforts to have a wto dispute resolution panel put an end to the unfair subsidies to airbus
what we need to do on our own is to pass our energy policy that is otherwise costing us millions of jobs and to pass our own health care reforms to cut costs and not cut care
therefore there are many of us who ally together to argue that case although we may have a disagreement on how much tariffs we should have because the congress should decide that
we could have no tariffs we could have a uniform tariff which the founders believed in and permitted or we could have protective tariffs which some of those individuals on our side defend and i am not that much interested in
but i think we have to be very careful because it is a very big transfer of power i agree with newt gingrich on this
the wto has ended up politicizing trade by putting the stamp of officialdom on some very bad policy so my message is to appeal to those who believe in limited government free markets free trade and the constitution
not too long ago utah repealed a ban on electronic gambling for fear the wto would come in and find that violated free trade
another area of importance to so many of us both on the left and the right of the political spectrum has to do with the codex commission regulation set up by the united nations
how much regulation are we going to have on vitamins and nutrition products
we have clearly given up our prerogatives on the declaration of war and on monetary issues
and here it is on the trade issue
among them the current trade deficit of 618 billion the disappointing enforcement efforts of the administration on past trade agreements and the lack of consensus in the wto on how to move forward with the doha round
in its 2004 report on agriculture the oecd notes that the producer support estimate for the united states decreased in recent years and that this is a part of a long term trend in us agricultural policy
what this means is that european farmers rely on the government for twice as much of their income as do us farmers or 37 cents from each dollar versus 18 cents for us farmers
what relevance do all these statistics have to the current wto negotiations on agriculture
on domestic subsidies the framework states specifically higher levels of permitted tradedistorting domestic support will be subject to deeper cuts in the section of the wto framework agreement on export competition it is agreed that export subsidies will be eliminated
average us tariffs on agricultural products is 12 versus 30 in europe and 50 in japan
the world average tariff on agricultural products is 62
this means that the us tariffs on agricultural imports should be cut less than european japanese or other countries tariffs on our exports to them
as with all negotiations the framework agreement reached last july on agriculture allows for a bestcase and worstcase scenario to exist which future negotiations will determine
in these negotiations we will depend on our us trade representative to achieve a result that upholds the principle of harmonization that was set out in the original us negotiating position in june of 2000
it is a good healthy debate that we are having here on the floor of congress
the earlier speaker the gentleman from ohio cited some papal encyclicals but as a practicing catholic i will be the first to defend his right to do that here on the floor but i also think there are some bigger issues we need to talk about
exports on average pay more than other jobs
i have joined with my colleagues on the other side of the aisle criticizing the administration on their china policy
in the ongoing doha round of trade negotiations the us and our global partners have the opportunity to substantially improve the wto by reaching agreements on service negotiations the reduction of tariffs and nontariff barriers and the authority of the wto dispute resolution system
i find it amazing to hear the gentleman from california mr dreier xz4001150 give his portrayal of what is going on in america and the world
the reality of what is going on in america today is that globalization is not working for ordinary people
just yesterday we learned that general motors is now going to cut back on another 25 000 goodpaying jobs for american workers
large corporations like general electric general motors all of those companies who are throwing american workers out on the street they think this agreement is greet because they are moving to china lock stock and barrel hiring desperate people for pennies an hour people who go to jail when they stand up for their political rights when they try to form a union
well i think he is going to be disappointed because i think that the results are so clear in terms of what nafta has done for american workers what permanent normal trade relations with china have done for american workers that not only are the american people catching on that cafta will be a continuation of a failed policy i think the american people are demanding that it is time for congress to represent workers and not just the big money interests
mr speaker let me simply conclude by saying this all of the objective evidence in terms of job loss in terms of the loss of goodpaying jobs in terms of the growing gap between the rich and the poor in america which is now wider than in any other industrialized country on earth wider in the united states than it has been the 1920s all of that suggests that the economy is not working for the middle class
the wto was signed in 1995 and our current support of unfettered free trade has gone on for some 30 years
today our trade deficit is a recordbreaking 617 billion and is on pace to become 700 billion next year
mr speaker it is not only blue collar jobs that we are on the cusp of losing
millions of white collar information technology jobs are also on the line to go to china and india
we can not continue on the policy of the race to the bottom
another issue that has not been touched on today a moral issue which is very important when i was mayor of the city of burlington in the 1980s we passed as did cities throughout the country as did the united states congress legislation which said to the apartheid regime which had then imprisoned nelson mandela we are going to impose trade restrictions against an apartheid regime
mr speaker what my friends on the other side of this debate have really failed to discuss is the impact of the unfettered trade policies that we have been developing over the last 30 years
i would yield a moment to my friends on the other side if they want to tell the american people that they think it is fair that our working people should have to compete against desperate people working for pennies an hour who go to jail when they stand up for their rights
the issue here is that these trade agreements have been forced on congress not forced congress willfully did it because of the power of big money
some of us who were here for nafta some of us here for the china agreement we know the millions and millions of dollars in campaign contributions and huge lobbying effort on the part of the large corporations
mr speaker on that i demand the yeas and nays
mr speaker i ask unanimous consent that all members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on h j res 27 the joint resolution under consideration
as the world s leading economy the largest economy that has ever been on the face of this earth we all too often focus our attention on the aspects of trade we disagree with
finally i congratulate mr pascal lamy of france on his selection as the new world trade organization director general
mr speaker i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from wisconsin mr ryan xz4003511 a member of the committee on ways and means
in this letter he says if the united states congress were to turn its back on cafta it would undercut these fragile democracies compel them to retreat to protectionism and make it harder for them to cooperate with the united states
on both sides of the aisle i believe i am correct on this that the decision by the ways and means committee to report this out unfavorably to the house which we had to do procedurally but to report it out unfavorably i think was unanimous on both sides of the aisle
the only sanction for a violation of the world trade organization is that affected world trade organization member and that member country may in some cases impose retaliatory measures on trade of the country that violates the rules
the on the question of jobs and the exporting of american jobs exports account for about 25 percent of the united states economic growth over the course of the past decade
exports support an estimated 12 million jobs and those workers wages are estimated to pay 13 to 18 percent more on the average than nonexport jobs
i think that the only responsible vote here today for the american worker and the american economy is to vote no on this resolution
some improvements could be made in the trade bill particularly on the labor protection side but more importantly our own national security and hemispheric influence will be enhanced with improved stability democracy and development in our poor fragile neighbors in central america and the caribbean
they have put their credibility on the line not only with this trade agreement but more broadly by promoting market reforms that have been urged for decades by us presidents of both parties
if the us congress were to turn its back on cafta it would undercut these fragile democracies compel them to retreat to protectionism and make it harder for them to cooperate with the us for the first time ever we have a chance to reinforce democracies in the region
those who defend our current policies acknowledge that free trade puts pressure on countries to race to the bottom on environmental and labor standards so they can be the lowcost highvalue producer
so when an airline in the united states goes to decide which airplane to buy it does so on economic factors
mr speaker i thank the gentleman from florida mr shaw xz4003690 on that clarification because i find it kind of ironic the fact that we are on a fundamental question should the united states continue to belong to the world trade organization or not complaining about degrees of differences in various pieces of trade legislation
following world war ii there was an agreement that we should not do that again and we created a rather imperfect agreement called the general agreement on tariffs and trade
as we continued to operate under the general agreement on tariffs and trade with socalled rounds named after various cities which has become a tradition now the uruguay round the tokyo round the rome round we decided that we need to move to another level a higher level of integration and coordination and that became the world trade organization
as the gentleman from michigan mr levin xz4002380 indicated i think there needs to be a much higher degree of transparency especially on the resources used to research decisions
but what is good primarily i think for the united states and the world trade organization restructure from the general agreement on tariffs and trade is that agriculture became one of the points of discussion and importantly for the us services and financial instruments and in the protection of intellectual property rights
that really is not a difficult decision for most members and overwhelmingly we will agree to stay in the world trade organization when we vote on this particular measure
but as correctly pointed out by the gentleman from florida mr shaw xz4003690 this is narrowly on the wto issue
now how many trade agreements do you think we would reach if we went to a country and said come on in negotiate with the house and the senate wait until we go through a conference committee in deciding what that agreement is going to be and you ought to agree ahead of time before you see the final product
we were able to enter into an agreement with singapore the united states and singapore to set a mark for other countries on what is the best way to deal with those particular concerns and that is down now as an agreement which we can point to as a model that we should move forward on dealing with other countries
obviously it is voluntary on both sides but the incentive of getting into the us market is a terrific reason to push the agreement probably farther than they would want because the reward is getting into the us market
that is basically what the united states does with the rest of the world on bilateral and regional agreements
and that is why overwhelmingly the vote today will be no on withdrawing from the wto
but shutting our doors on the wto is nt the answer
today i am voting against the wto because it has failed to deliver on any of its promises
the wto has no restrictions on sweatshops child labor prison labor or slave labor
wto rules promote investment opportunities for multinational corporations without regard to their impact on workers the environment or the public interest
and when the wto ruled in favor of the united states in a case on bananas it was to benefit who
mr chairman i would like to thank the gentleman from illinois mr hyde xz4001920 and the gentleman from california mr lantos xz4002310 for their work on this issue and my good friend the gentleman from virginia mr cantor xz4000600 for cosponsoring this amendment with me
because he is not on the floor at this point i am not going to take this opportunity i will have many more to express in some detail my affection my respect and my admiration for the chairman of our committee who sponsors this bill and who has announced his intent not to seek reelection to the next congress
on the surface this may look like a partisan conflict but in reality it is not
a recent commission cochaired by our former speaker newt gingrich not a man enamored of ideological multilateralism prepared a report on muchneeded un
but the area that i want to most focus on does not deal with the dues cut but has a provision on peacekeeping that is particularly egregious
based on the failure to implement five reforms by the effective date of this bill the day after this bill is signed into law and those reforms are much needed i think they are on the way to happening i do not quarrel with any of them in fact i think they are compelling in their nature this bill mandates the president of the united states to instruct our ambassador to the united nations to veto any new or the expansion of any existing peacekeeping operation
in other words the congress steps in usurps the executive branch function of formulating foreign policy in exercising its discretion on what its appointee will do in the end without regard to us national interests and in direct violation of executive branch prerogatives
i just want to respond to what i think was an inadvertent misstatement by the gentleman from indiana on what i think is an overthetop provision of this bill requiring a veto of any new or expanded peacekeeping operations in the security council
madam speaker by direction of the committee on rules i call up house resolution 319 and ask for its immediate consideration
the rule provides for the offering of the 28 specified amendments according to subject areas as designated in the text of the resolution and with a cumulative total of an hour and 40 minutes of general debate to be divided equally by the chairman and ranking minority member of the committee on international relations
in fact madam speaker when these two distinguished gentlemen were testifying before the committee on rules on this bill i was struck by the fact that the house and indeed the entire nation is the beneficiary of decades worth of their collective wisdom and firsthand experience
this specific act has generated 28 potential amendments on a single topic and madam speaker i know my colleagues are going to love listening to all 28 of those amendments but let that not overshadow the reality of this bill
there is a small disagreement on who should trigger that penalty which differences i know my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will bring forward but there can be no doubt as to the underlying need of this penalty phase
if students ever thought i was not seriously going to follow through on my disciplinary commitments i would lose all credibility and lose both the respect and the cooperation of the kids
commission on human rights
it made every single amendment in order all 28 which were filed before the committee on rules
madam speaker i yield 1 minute to the distinguished gentleman from illinois mr hyde xz4001920 the chairman of the committee on international relations
madam speaker i yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from florida ms roslehtinen xz4003440 one of the leading voices on the committee on international relations
in 1994 we insisted on an oversight committee and an oversight committee took place
and under the bipartisan helmsbiden approach once again we insisted on changes with the united nations
mr speaker i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from indiana mr pence xz4003150 a member of the committee on international relations
mr speaker i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from texas mr mccaul xz4006540 also a member of the committee on international relations
there is no disagreement on that point
mr speaker i yield back the balance of my time and i move the previous question on the resolution
a motion to reconsider was laid on the table
mr speaker i thank my friend for yielding and also for the cooperation of those on the appropriations bills this week as we move to an early conclusion of this week s work
any votes called on those measures that members are given notice of will be rolled until 6 30 pm
on monday
on tuesday and the balance of the week the house will consider several bills under a rule
certainly based on the experience we have had for the last three fridays the cooperation of both the ranking member and the leadership of the chairman and the subcommittee chairmen on the appropriations committee we have been seeing this work go a little faster than we had anticipated
we will get this work done early if we can but would advise members to plan to be here on friday because we will want to complete the entire agenda that we have laid out for next week s schedule
mr speaker i believe we will do those in the order that they appeared starting on tuesday
so i would expect tuesday s work to include the science commerce state justice appropriations act and then move on to defense appropriations on wednesday if we are completed with the previous bill and then to bring the bill to the floor on united nations reform after that
i would say in response that interestingly the discussion on that bill it is an important discussion is largely between the new director of national intelligence and the armed services chairman because of some commitments that seemed to have been made and i think were made during the adoption of the 911 bill of things that would be included in this bill
that discussion is going on
we are going to work hard to do everything we can to facilitate a final and complete understanding between the administration and the house on the issues that they are discussing right now
mr speaker if i could comment i would say that we are eager to reach a final understanding on this
i do not know what their position on that is
i appreciate what the whip has said and would only say that we could vote on this and solve it that way but i assume that would not present the right solution as well
mr chairman i rise today in strong support and appreciation really of both of our leaders on this bill the gentleman from california mr lantos xz4002310 and i am particularly pleased to see this bill named in appreciation and recognition of the great leadership of our committee on international relations chairman the gentleman from illinois mr hyde xz4001920
i think we all know on both sides of the aisle that the united nations has not lived up to its expectations
on the korean peninsula they face a brutal dictator
as a member of the committee on international relations i frequently hear of the problems that we have with peacekeeping the atrocities in various parts of the world
on a periodic basis provides a means for introducing new ideas techniques and experience without having to deal with terminating contracts or moving people and positions
i want to thank my chairman and thank the ranking member for their work on this and again our staffs
she had the night before seen a program on television
we were told that basically the implication was on the battlefield these things happen sexual abuse occurs
we really appreciate all his hard work on this bill
you can not do anything to put pressure on the united nations because if you do the whole world is going to hate us
the state department has been working with the united nations for the last 20 years that i have been here and working on the foreign affairs committee international relations now
mr bolton needs to be confirmed on the other side because we need a tough guy over there to force the issue
now he is hedging his bets on that because the case against him and the oilforfood scandal is growing and growing and growing
on his watch everything has been going haywire
but this body needs to put the hammer by using american taxpayers dollars on the un
we can not go on day after day week after week month after month year after year letting this thing be completely out of hand
we are the big guy on the block
but the fact of the matter is they are not listening in many cases and the corruption goes on and on and on the mismanagement goes on and on and on and nothing changes
and what has to be done is we have got to put pressure on the un
i want to thank chairman hyde and ranking member lantos for their exceptional work on this bill
for their work on this bill i would first of all like to thank the gentleman from illinois mr hyde xz4001920 the chairman and the gentleman from california mr lantos xz4002310 two giants of this institution and people who i am pleased to call friends
what is more every us citizens can view the epls on line
this section requires a report to be filed with the congress of the united states on the status of the un s reform
my amendment requires a report on the contracts entered into by the un
or any of its specialized agencies with parties on the us government s epls
as a bipartisan report featured in yesterday s wall street journal stated until and unless it changes dramatically the united nations will remain an uncertain instrument both for the governments that comprise it and for those that look to it for salvation it is only logical that the same restrictions we place upon on our federal agencies be applied to the money we give to the un
but how can one really believe that iran needs a civilian nuclear program when it sits on the world s second largest proven reserves of natural gas not to mention its petroleum deposits
but i do want to take this time mr chairman to recognize the extraordinary leadership of the gentleman from illinois chairman hyde of the committee on international relations
he is an icon of this institution and i for one know i am joined by every member of this house in thanking him for his leadership on this bill and the number of other measures that he has worked on and done such a tremendous job with
i note that the gentleman from new jersey mr smith xz4003801 is on the floor our chairman
hr 2601 regrets the lack of implementation by many of the osce participating states and their commitments to track and report on antisemitic crimes and hate crimes
while we can all agree that our country as the biggest contributor to the un must help the organization become more efficient and effective the lantosshays substitute finds a compromise that i think reflects where the majority of americans come down on this issue
alternatively automatically withholding funds may derail our international and global commitments and could have a devastating impact on poor nations around the world
while we can all agree that our country as the biggest contributor to the un must help the organization become more efficient and effective the lantosshays substitute finds a compromise that i think reflects where the majority of americans come down on this issue
this onceutopian organization has degenerated into an institution that is largely dysfunctional and on the verge of becoming irrelevant and that is why we need these reforms and we need them now
but i just want to stress one that relates to budgetary reform and the way that people vote on that
in fact if you take the top three countries they contribute over half the dues and yet everybody has the same vote on budgetary matters
and at the time to decide how to spend it the four kids get up and say this is what we want to do this is where we want to go on our vacation this is what hotel we want to stay in
one of the reforms in this act would say that when you vote on budgetary matters then you weight those votes
so i think it is time that we got a handle on how the money that american taxpayers send off to the united nations gets spent and this haphazard budgetary process can be changed by weighted voting
hr 2745 calls for weighted voting on budgetary matters
weighted voting on budgetary matters would give the un s biggest contributors more leverage to ensure that their money is achieving the purposes for which it is intended
i would also like to give my sincerest thanks to all the staff of the committee who have worked so hard to make sure that all the members of this committee had an opportunity to way in on the bill to make improvements that were important to us
this clause simply calls on the government of poland to develop a final and complete settlement for private property that was seized or confiscated by the nazis during ww ii or by the communist government of poland after the war
the president of poland alexsander kwanieski met with congressional leaders from the united states helsinki commission and said that he intended to draft a new law intended to provide compensation that would not discriminate based on residency or citizenship of an individual and it would be ready to take effect by the beginning of 2003
this clause calls on the president of the united states and the secretary of state to engage in an open dialogue with the government of poland and work with them to ensure that restitution legislation is implemented
another initiative that was included was regarding language to create a report on what the united states is doing to assist our friend and ally israel in their efforts to establish diplomatic relations
another issue i worked on was the inclusion of a sense of congress on the need for an additional consular post in southern india
finally on the issue of iraq i was able to include by a bipartisan vote language calling on the president to put forth a plan for success in iraq
this clause requests a plan from this administration on how we will be providing for a stable and secure iraqi government military and police force that will allow the united states presence to be diminished
i have served with the chairman both on the committee on the judiciary and on the committee on international relations
i recognize that some a few on the other side honestly believe we should end any participation any us participation in the united nations
they prefer to go it alone but they forget that without the united nations it would fall on us to do much of what the united nations is doing on the planet today and that the united nations has supported the united states in some of our critical foreign policy needs
the united states advocated for the sanctions on iraq in the aftermath of the gulf war and then supported the oilforfood program advocated for it but it was the security council not some amorphous united nations somewhere up in new york that had the responsibility to oversee the oilforfood program and the sanction regime
my friend the chairman of the subcommittee on oversight and investigations talks about 10 billion 8 billion of that came from the security council s inaction while looking the other way
it is important to note it was the security council that approved all prices on oil exports from iraq and every contract needed their approval for humanitarian goods coming into iraq and yet when the secretariat brought 71 contracts to the attention of the security council because of concerns of pricing irregularities the security council did nothing did nothing and saddam profited and stayed in power as a result
the icc then represents a clear and present danger to the ultimate success of the civilized world s war on terror and an affront to both our troops and the nation they serve
the icc on the contrary could be an instrument of undemocratic scoresettling a shadowy kangaroo court in which despots and their diplomats can humiliate and even imprison the men and women who have the courage to do the work the un
mr chairman i first want to thank the gentleman from california mr lantos xz4002310 for his longstanding leadership on issues related to the united nations and human freedom
far from promoting justice and respect for international law the united nations has become one of the world s greatest apologists for tyranny and terror where justice is merely one point of view a place where sudan and syria and castro s cuba are given a soapbox on which to lecture the free world on human rights a place where international lawyers scheme to haul american soldiers before a rogue court irrespective of constitutional rights a place where an international humanitarian mission to feed and heal the iraqi people resulted in 10 billion in siphoned bribes and kickbacks
will continue to betray its charter and betray the billions of people on this planet who look to it for hope
and every man woman and child on this planet will owe a great debt of gratitude to henry j hyde
i just ask my colleagues to vote no on the democratic substitute
vote yes on the hyde reform bill and let us put the united nations back on track to fulfill its promise to the human race
let me begin by extending my hearty congratulations to the distinguished chairman of the committee the gentleman from illinois mr hyde xz4001920 and my very dear friend and neighbor the gentleman from california mr lantos xz4002310 not only for their fine work on this legislation but for their support of the amendment that i am offering here
madam chairman one of the president s top priorities for this new office is to create a civilian rapid response unit to deploy on short notice to sites of international instability
and i would just like to congratulate him for the emphasis that he has had on the education aspect of this along with training as a very important part of our effort here
and where i am very pleased that the first one of these activities is going to take place at the naval postgraduate school on august 1 with ambassador pascual coming out to california where for the first time the military the civilians the state department and so on will all be together in developing this
mr chairman on rollcall no
also let me take this opportunity to express my appreciation to the chairman s staff as well for their efficiency in bringing these matters to the floor and their cooperation in working with our offices in order to proceed along on these matters
not long after hiring him cotecna was awarded a lucrative contract to inspect goods going to iraq with the newly implemented oilforfood program that we have heard talked about on this floor earlier
we could count on their support now the volcker commission only now is hastily reevaluating its initial findings in light of this new evidence and kofi annan as suspected is dodging questions and hiding now behind the commission
even real estate magnet donald trump states in speaking about the proposal in new york city about their planned expansion of their headquarters the united nations is a mess and they are spending hundreds of millions of dollars unnecessarily on this project if donald trump says they are wasting millions of dollars i can only imagine what the average american taxpayer s view must be on the un
now my friends on the other side want to pass a bill which will withhold peacekeeping funds while conflicts rage around this world unchecked
everyone in this body realizes that the united nations is not a perfect organization but on balance the united nations has been and will continue to be good for america on a range of global issues
the substitute gives the secretary of state the flexibility to make decisions regarding funds based on the needs of the united states
madam speaker i yield 4 minutes to the distinguished gentlewoman from california ms matsui xz4006631 my colleague on the committee on rules
madam speaker i am very pleased to yield 8 minutes to my very good friend the gentleman from california mr lantos xz4002310 the distinguished ranking member of the committee on international relations
mr speaker i want to join in wholehearted endorsement in echoing of all of the words of praise that have been directed toward the distinguished chairman of the committee on international relations
i have known the gentleman from illinois chairman hyde to not only be gentlemanly and eloquent but fairminded and bipartisan in a substantial number of efforts and i like all of our colleagues here deeply appreciate the work that he has done on behalf of this nation and indeed this world throughout the course of his career and i compliment him in that regard
i also accept the chastisement of the distinguished chair with reference to rhetoric but i would urge that some of the rhetoric that i may have used is rhetoric that i learned here in the house of representatives that has been used on both sides of the aisle much too often in my judgment
the gentleman from illinois chairman hyde the gentleman from california mr lantos xz4002310 my good friend the distinguished ranking member the gentleman from connecticut mr shays xz4003700 his colleague in filing this measure all of the members of the committee on international relations indeed all the members of this body recognize that the united nations has problems
they operate on the consensus rule and it primarily stagnates the mission of the osce
first if the distinguished whip knows my presumption is based upon the schedule that has been submitted that the probability is we will not have votes on friday next
i note mr whip that the intelligence authorization bill which was schedule to be on the floor today which had been pulled is not on the schedule for next week
and it is i would say to my friend as i understand it a bill which has the agreement between the chairman of the intelligence committee and the ranking democrat on the intelligence committee
so it would seem to be a bipartisan agreement on the substance of the bill
can the gentleman tell us when that might be on the floor
it may be helpful to know that i believe on our side of the aisle we believe that the gentleman from michigan mr hoekstra xz4001820 and the gentlewoman from california ms harman s agreement was appropriate in the sense that the flexibility be given to the national intelligence director to provide for the best possible personnel assignment with reference to maintaining our security and intelligence apparatus in the most effective mode would be correct if that is of any help to the whip as he considers the support that that proposition may have on the floor
i realize there are those on his side of the aisle who have some concerns about it
the gentleman does not have to comment on that but i thought that it might be useful information for him
i will ask one more question on the intelligence issue
does the gentleman know whether the administration is supportive of the position taken by the chairman of the intelligence committee and the ranking democrat on the intelligence committee or not
has the administration taken a position on that
lastly we just had a vote on the privileged resolution that was offered by the democratic leader the gentlewoman from california ms pelosi xz4003140
but i think the gentleman is correct it would not resolve it any more than the vote on the rules in january resolved the changing of the rules and the feeling that they were not appropriate to provide the context in which we could proceed
i know that the gentleman from missouri mr blunt xz4000340 very honestly and sincerely as i do wants to see this matter resolved and see the committee move forward so it could become a matter of history and not a matter of current debate so we can focus on the important issues confronting this country
well reclaiming my time madam speaker i thank the gentleman but the bush administration is on your side not mine this time
but we are opposed to the legendary bureaucratization to political grandstanding to billions of dollars spent on multitudes of programs with meager results to the outright misappropriation of funds represented by the oilforfood program
members on both sides of the aisle in congress agree that the time has come for farreaching reform
he is on the right track god knows but it is overkill
we are paying big dues 442 million a year just on the dues part
in closing this bill reflects contributions of the administration as well as the republican and democratic members of the committee on international relations

madam chairman i just want to briefly respond to the comments of my dear friend the gentleman from california mr lantos xz4002310 on the un
but if we do not cut off the money if they fail to get certifications on 46 points that we all agree are essentially reform we do not dispute the democrats and republicans the need for reform nor the items of reform
madam chairman i just want to say to my good friend that it is not on automatic pilot
we need a more flexible approach which does not dictate unrealistic deadlines for changes or threaten automatic withholding of dues will achieve us goals without causing widespread resentment among member states whose support we depend on
the hyde bill on un
the hyde bill claims to pursue a streamlined efficient and accountable regular assessed budget of the united nations yet in reality the approach taken by the bill will wreak havoc on the un
unfortunately this bill on un
this legislation is far reaching and will have a broad impact on the direction of our foreign policy
it also requires a report on administration strategy and efforts to advance democracy around the world and it increases funding for the state department s human rights and democracy fund which currently faces a 20 percent decrease in the fy2006 budget request
i wrote a letter to president bush on memorial day along with my congressional colleague to ask him to allow the public to once again view the flag draped coffins of our soldiers who have paid the ultimate sacrifice to their nation
both prime minister singh and president musharraf declared that the peace process is now irreversible in addition they agreed that they would continue talks on kashmir in i do have concerns about china and especially its bid to purchase unocal
i am satisfied that the house of representatives recently voted to not approve any sale of unocal to china based on national security grounds
however i feel it does not go far enough on many vital international issues such as the genocide in darfur and the deteriorating situation in haiti
we need a more flexible approach which does not dictate unrealistic deadlines for changes or threaten automatic withholding of dues will achieve us goals without causing widespread resentment among member states whose support we depend on
the hyde bill on un
reforms will require careful implementation the united states of america have always prided ourselves on helping those who can not help themselves on aiding those who are being massacred simply because of who they are but now this bill seeks for our nation to turn a blind eye to these people
the hyde bill claims to pursue a streamline efficient and accountable regular assessed budget of the united nations yet in reality the approach taken by the bill will wreak havoc on the un
unfortunately this bill on un
fighting the war on drugs is an important part of creating a safe and stable hemisphere and mr burton xz4000550 must be thanked for his efforts to assist the colombian government in fighting drug trafficking
the burton amendment will help to wage the war on drugs and will make it more difficult for colombian drug traffickers to export their products
i support this amendment for those reasons yet acknowledge that there is an entire other part of the war on drugs that we must face
we must insist that our actions in the war on drugs are not simply military programs but social and economic as well
to truly win the war on drugs we must take action to help sectors of colombian society most adversely affected
in our course of action in the war on drugs we must be vigilant in maintaining support for the socially marginalized
we can not accept the undue burden placed on these groups as an acceptable side effect of the andean counterdrug initiative
in the war on drugs afrocolombians have become the forgotten victims of the conflict
american resources must be used to help alleviate the pain and suffering on the part of afrocolombians and provide them access to a better more stable livelihood
i support the burton amendment because it assists the colombian government in fighting the war on drugs
let us get them back on the path towards prosperity and hope for the future
mr chairman i thank the gentlewoman from oregon for yielding me this time and for her leadership on this very important issue
i thank again the gentlewoman for her leadership on this
at the outset mr chairman let me join with my other colleagues in commending the gentleman from illinois chairman hyde for the outstanding leadership he has demonstrated on this bill
it is an amendment on which i urge its adoption
this is extremely wellcrafted legislation that the chairman has brought forward in close cooperation with many of his colleagues on the committee on international relations and i am in very strong support of this bill
i want to be very clear that i am in strong support of this legislation that has come forward by the committee on international relations but there are things that raise my interest and my concern
a few weeks ago media outlets throughout the world proudly parroted amnesty international s unfounded charges of torture and ill treatment in the socalled america gulags instead of condemning the governmentinflicted famine in kim jongil s north korea or continued human rights abuses in castro s cuba the executive director of amnesty international usa revealed the true goal of organizations such as his when he called on foreign governments to arrest and prosecute us government officials and military personnel
to place the highest priority on the improvement of international labor rights
the following are examples of recent reports in paper published by the ilo global report 2005 a global alliance against slave labor an economic study of the costs and benefits of eliminating child labor a report by the director general a fair globalization the role of the ilo towards a fair deal for migrant workers in a global economy eleventh synthesis report on the working condition situation in cambodia s garment sector
a strengthened ilo would have a civilizing effect on corporate behavior
first i want to thank my friend from utah for his most gracious words at the outset of this debate and i would like to commend my distinguished colleague the gentleman from florida mr hastings xz4001701 for his leadership on foreign policy matters and for his invaluable assistance on the committee on rules
madam speaker as we embark upon today s historic debate at the outset i would like to publicly express my respect my admiration my affection and my friendship to the chairman of the house committee on international relations
his contributions to the work of the congress and to the welfare of our nation are without limits and it has been one of the great privileges of my congressional career to have had the opportunity of serving on his committee
where we part ways is on how to accomplish this incredibly important goal
the united nations reform act is truly a guillotine on autopilot
this provision makes the bill which has many good provisions in it a guillotine on autopilot
it will only force the united states to take on greater global responsibilities at the very moment when our troops and our diplomats are already spread thin
we are in full accord on dramatically enhancing accountability at the united nations
secretary general kofi annan has stated on numerous occasions that he would never allow the un s diplomatic immunity to protect any employee from prosecution for a crime she or he may have committed
i want to commend him on bringing this matter before the body
we do not question the need for improving the peacekeeping process we are with you totally on that but we would like to have our secretary of state have the opportunity of exercising her judgment in a rapidly changing and evolving situation
i want to commend him on this most important amendment
but i am particularly thrilled that the chairman has embraced the principle of providing our secretary of state flexibility in dealing with this issue and i very much hope that during the course of the remaining few minutes of our debate the chairman will see the wisdom of providing secretary rice with flexibility on similar issues
i refer to the hyde bill as a guillotine on autopilot and i think it is in the true american spirit that the gentleman now has a more effective fasterworking more suicidal guillotine which he is offering to this body
mr chairman this is yet another occasion that chairman hyde and i stand shoulder to shoulder on attempting to reform the united nations
but maybe upon reflection he might propose that on a future occasion
we saw a tragic demonstration of terror this month in london s underground and on its famed doubledecker buses
in this security environment mr chairman legislation on foreign policy should be bipartisan
and our legislation passed unanimously by the committee on international relations by a vote of 44 to 0 is a tribute to my friend the gentleman from illinois mr hyde xz4001920 and his effort to work in a bipartisan fashion
to address the dangers of terrorist attacks on our embassies which are the platform abroad for every agency of the us government our bill fully funds the administration s request for worldwide embassy security
continued attention from the international community on this critical next step is essential if reformers are not to be intimidated by narcotraffickers and warlords
we are engaged in intense diplomacy on every continent
mr chairman i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from new jersey mr menendez xz4002720 the chairman of the democratic caucus a serious and hardworking member of the committee on international relations
mr chairman i am delighted to yield 3 12 minutes to the gentleman from oregon mr blumenauer xz4000330 a distinguished member of the committee on international relations and the conscience on environmental issues of both the committee and the congress
mr chairman i yield 2 12 minutes to the gentleman from california mr schiff xz4003610 a valued member of the committee on international relations
madam chairman i yield 2 12 minutes to the gentlewoman from california ms lee xz4002370 a distinguished member of the committee on international relations
madam chairman i yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from maryland mr cardin xz4000640 who has done extraordinary work on the helsinki commission
if adopted this amendment which barely passed along partisan lines last month will blight a very serious and bipartisan effort by the committee on international relations to create the authorization bill before us
with such a mindlessly inflexible mechanism this amendment is a guillotine on autopilot
it will only force the united states to take on global responsibilities on a unilateral basis at a moment when our troops and our diplomats are already spread thin
during an earlier debate on this very issue practically every single democrat voted to approve a more flexible measure that would put the punitive power into the hands of our distinguished secretary of state not leave it on automatic pilot
the administration is on record opposing this amendment
we just do not put it on autopilot
i strongly urge all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to reject this amendment
this amendment serves only to divide this house which is ready to pass an important state department authorization bill practically on a unanimous basis
there is no earthly reason to have a divisive provision which we have debated and on which we have voted
i urge all of my colleagues on both sides to reject this amendment and move on with the bipartisan authorization measure
it is of critical importance that the united states not be outgunned or outmaneuvered by narcotics traffickers either in the streets of our towns or on the high seas
accordingly i intend to vote for the principal substitute to the committee bill but against either the committee bill or the substitute on final passage
the former represents a congressional directive that in all likelihood will require the us to declare financial war on the united nations
the alternative approach while more restrained has the effect of authorizing the executive branch to conduct a financial war on the un
although we have differing perspectives on this bill i have the utmost respect for our distinguished chairman as well as his staff who are among the finest on capitol hill
what is astonishingly dja 2 vu about these charges is that tongsun park had been indicted on bribery and conspiracy charges in the late 1970s for using his role as a rice agent for the us food for peace program to bestow money and gifts on members of congress who had legislated the guidelines that allowed commissions on those agricultural sales
in this regard in december 2004 congress directed the united states institute of peace to establish a task force on the united nations
by background in the early 1990 s i cochaired the united states commission on improving the effectiveness of the united nations
also like the gingrichmitchell commission the us commission on improving the effectiveness of the united nations recommended the establishment of a un
the reform bill before us today is silent on each
commission highlighted severe management concerns neither advocated linking progress on un
the committee approach represents a congressional directive that in all likelihood will require the us to declare financial war on the united nations
the alternative democratic approach while more restrained has the effect of authorizing the executive branch to conduct a financial war on the un
the vienna convention on the law of treaties provides that every treaty in force is binding upon the parties to it and must be performed by them in good faith article 26
one obvious issue especially for my republican colleagues is whether on matters of multilateral diplomacy deference to the judgment of house leadership is more compelling than deference to the president
accordingly i intend to vote for the principal substitute to the committee bill but against either the committee or the substitute on final passage
madam chairman let me first thank our ranking member for yielding me this time and i also thank him and the gentleman from illinois chairman hyde for their continuing bipartisan efforts reflected not only in this bill but in many of the bills which we work on in the committee on international relations
with regard to this bill together and i want to thank them for their efforts on this we were able to incorporate the provisions which i offered on minority recruiting hiring and contracting at the state department and also helping to support the development of predictive models on famine in subsaharan africa into the text of this bill
while this bill represents a very diligent effort a bipartisan effort i am deeply concerned that the committee on rules made in order many ideologically driven amendments
the republican leadership continues to stifle any debate on the most pressing issues of the day especially the quagmire in iraq
and the reform effort itself as well as the un s ability to take on responsibilities critical to protecting our national security
is the wrong methodology these distinguished former ambassadors go on to assert that withholding us dues to the united nations may sound like smart policy but would be counterproductive at this time
mr chairman i thank the ranking member for yielding the time and i want to express my enormous respect for the gentleman from illinois mr hyde xz4001920 my dear friend with whom i agree on some things but not on this issue although the majority of the bill i know is consistent with the gentleman from california s mr lantos xz4002310 and my view although i do rise in strong support of the lantos substitute and in opposition to the underlying bill but it is with great respect and i appreciate the opportunity to work with my colleague on this and many other issues
has embarked on a mission to adapt to the changing times
has dragged its feet in addressing some of our world s worst crises such as the darfur genocide and has been impotent on human rights issues and the record of the un
madam chairman last week i rose in opposition to bringing up the east asia security act of 2005 hr 3100 on the suspension calendar because it contained some provisions that created unintended consequences for our exports to china as well as some of our largest export markets in canada and europe
at a minimum hr 3100 would have required an export license for every transaction and a notification to congress regardless of dollar value adding a costly new regulatory burden on us companies specializing in the defense trade
commerce would then provide a report to congress every quarter on the information provided by affected exporters
included in this list was a prohibition on the approval of dual use export licenses
thus the provision would have imposed a new huge licensing burden on us exporters selling to china
the compromise also retains commerce as the lead agency to decide on commercial dual use export licenses
this compromise will allow our federal export control agencies to focus on what is truly important and will also not impose an undue regulatory burden particularly upon our small business exporters
the united states and europe are worried that iran has a clandestine nuclear weapons program but all the while iran is insisting on its right to receive all nuclear materials nuclear technology and assistance for its peaceful program
we must not allow the shortterm diplomatic or political agenda of any president or any secretary of state democrat or republican to interfere with the overarching goal of ensuring that nuclear weapons are not used anywhere on this planet at any time
it goes a long way in sending a message to the rest of the world that the united states intends on being the leader on the issue of nuclear nonproliferation regardless of which other country in the world is involved and regardless of which other country in the world was the supplier of those materials
the bush administration and congress must work with mexico and apply real pressure to the mexican government to attack meth production and the trafficking on their side of the border
while states like minnesota continue to limit and ban pseudoephedrine these superlabs operating outside of our boarders are continuing to put the chemicals that are destroying families on our streets
i would like to say that the rationale for bringing this forward is to provide a practical benefit to the reform effort at the united nations but i think it also is important that we recognize as martin luther king jr once said there can be no great sorrow where there is no great love we are engaged today to try to redeem the dream of franklin roosevelt that the united nations in the age of the nuclear bomb that in the age of a global war on terror at some point we could have something at night to get us to sleep and that is the belief that the united nations would be a force for good in the world that international disputes could be resolved there that the finest and most noble motives of humanity could find expression and implementation
it has been an honor to work on this issue with them
it is an important initiative one that i have been working on in similar context for some time as a member of the committee on international relations
it is certainly appropriate that we be voting on this amendment tonight the day after iran admits that it has once again lied to the international community this time about its plutonium experiments 5 years after they said that they had ceased continuing such experiments
i rise to support hr 2601 in its present form and to comment on some of the positive elements of this bill
this bill also includes language i offered on the religious freedom and rights of the ecumenical patriarch in turkey
that is why my language states that turkey must immediately eliminate all forms of discrimination particularly those based on race or religion
if we reject that then we can be on our way to a very good state department authorization
no nation has exercised as much restraint as israel yet no nation has been subjected to so much condemnation indeed vilification and demonization including those countries that practice slavery torture and genocide some of whom have been privileged to sit on the united nations commission on human rights a right denied to israel in the more than half a century it has been a member
no nation has exercised as much restraint as israel yet no nation has been subjected to so much condemnation indeed vilification and demonization including those countries that practice slavery torture and genocide some of whom have been privileged to sit on the united nations commission on human rights a right denied to israel in the more than halfcentury it has been a member
finally it is to achieve multilateral cooperation on the critical global crises of our age
in 1991 the united nations placed sanctions on iraq for saddam hussein s persistent noncompliance with the provisions of the ceasefire that ended the first gulf war
in an effort to mitigate the sanctions impact on the iraqi population the oilforfood program was created in 1996 to allow the iraqis to sell oil in order to pay for humanitarian goods
mr hussein would then complete oil contracts based on the allocations list
mr sevan was in a position of influence and could lift restrictions on various parts of the oilforfood program
additional oil allocations granted through the years of the program as restrictions were lifted on aspects of the oilforfood program
reform act and i rise today in support of the rule and with a profound sense of gratitude for the leadership that my mentor and friend henry j hyde of illinois has provided on this bill and throughout an illustrious career in this congress
it focuses on budgets streamlining prioritization of programs oversight accountability peacekeeping and human rights
i rise for a few brief moments to speak on behalf of title vi of this bill which calls for farreaching reforms in the areas of planning management conduct and accountability of peacekeeping operations within the united nations
peacekeepers were accused by human rights watch of systematic rape of women and the list goes on and on and on
in fact the united nations special committee on peacekeeping operations has endorsed specifically all seven of the reforms that are included in this legislation
in fact those reforms have been endorsed by prince zeid of jordan the secretary general s special advisor on sexual exploitation and abuse and all but one the signature of an oath have already been adopted by the un
they are the adoption of a uniform code of conduct the training of peacekeeping personnel on that code of conduct the signature of an oath to abide by the code of conduct design of programs to explain prohibited acts to host populations so there would be greater accountability for the behavior of peacekeepers and the creation of a centralized database to track these areas of misconduct
dues to a series of reforms the legislation would finally give the american people a voice on things like religious freedom political oppression and abuses of power that have plagued the un
countries like syria sudan libya north korea china and cuba have had seats or still have seats on the human rights commission the un s body for addressing human rights issues
those nations are all members of the un and we should not kick them out but they should not be setting policy on human rights
sudan from its seats on the commission has vetoed efforts to condemn the genocide it is committing in darfur
we could go on and on
also i might add we are grateful for the honorable adversarial relationship that we have on the other side of the aisle the gentleman from california mr lantos xz4002310 a champion of human rights a dear friend and someone who i greatly respect and whose guidance i might say has been important to my own career
the oilforfood program was set up in order to make sure that the women and children and noncombatants of iraq did not die of lack of food and medicines because of an oil boycott that we had put the united nations had placed on iraq under saddam hussein s regime as a way of pressuring saddam hussein to give up his chemical and biological weapons weapons of mass destruction and to continue and to refrain from his hostile acts like the invasion of kuwait
without approval the new york office of the banque de paris or paribas this was the bank that oversaw the oilforfood program the un s bank for the program made unauthorized payments from the program to socalled third parties on more than 400 occasions
we could go on about that for hours
family of organizations at wipo also in geneva michael wilson an annan family friend is being investigated by a swiss judge on charges of bribing a senior official at wipo to win a renovation contract on the agency s headquarters
is on the wrong path
in the hearings on the oilforfood program that i have held in the subcommittee on oversight and investigations in the international relations committee is that the un
mr chairman let me just note that what measures that we have been suggesting in the bill as you have just underscored are very reasonable and the fact that we have bipartisan support on the measures demanding accountability suggest that these are things that the united nations should not be opposing
this is nothing that should raise the fur up on the back of the necks of any official at the united nations
so i appreciate the gentleman and also all those ladies and gentlemen on the other side of the aisle coming at these issues of accountability in a very bipartisan fashion
there is broad agreement on both sides as to the need for reform in the united nations
there is agreement on the problem
what is going on
we deserve to try to put pressure on the united nations to live up to its standards
on monday as we were preparing for the debate on reforming the united nations a constituent of mine was at one of the sessions of the economic and social council one of the many united nations bodies and he was immediately struck by the almost orwellian and secretive nature of the proceedings as well as by the vitriolic antiamerican attacks in which the chairman and other members of the committee were engaged
it had a note encouraging the congress to overhaul the united nations and the picture on the postcard is a sculpture of a broken world implying that the united nations is the means by which to fix it
i would just like to close by saying that it is very fitting that this bill before us should have the name of our distinguished chairman of the committee on international relations the gentleman from illinois mr hyde xz4001920 who has been the conscience of the house the voice of the people for so many years has had such a distinguished public service career in the house and led us through some very difficult times as chairman of the committee on the judiciary as well as chairman of our committee on international relations
i rise in strong support of the henry j hyde united nations reform act and would like to provide some insight on the background and the impetus for title iii of the bill that relates as the chair pointed out to the international atomic energy agency
in 2004 the iaea reports enumerated more iranian breaches including work on an element that could be used for nuclear explosions
in fact iran recently served on the board of governors of the international atomic energy agency because under the current structure under its policies countries that are suspected of breaching their safeguards they are allowed to serve in leadership positions within the agency
also it establishes a special committee on safeguards and verification to advise the board of governors on additional measures necessary to enhance the agency s ability to detect undeclared activities by member nations
furthermore it seeks the suspension of privileges of member states that are under investigation or in breach or noncompliance of their obligations and the establishment of membership criteria that would keep such rogue states such as iran such as syria from serving on the board of governors
had the amendment called on the us permanent representative to the un
member states policies such as social security schemes and employee benefits and these are issues that in the us for example we in the congress are working on and are responsible for
it does not concern itself with dictating internal substantive outcomes on the un s budget process
in short today we are focused on reforming how the us how the un
makes the decisions not on what decisions it makes or what the member states make
the gentleman from ohio would have been i believe better served by offering his amendment as others have by it having called upon the president to direct the us permanent representative to work to ensure enhanced funding for the international labor rights organization which i believe is a worthy goal and on that very issue in fact this is already being done
does on its own institute these reforms then we have no problems
the onus is on the un
this is an issue that is especially important to me as chairman of the subcommittee on international terrorism and nonproliferation
we held a hearing in april on the nuclear nonproliferation treaty and one of the key issues that we looked at was how npt states should address the noncompliance or attempted withdrawal of a state from the treaty
with our ranking member we could not have two more talented members at the helm of the committee on international relations
while the united states has stringent controls on our nuclear weapons and weapons materials security in other countries is less exacting
the third amendment requests a report by the secretary of state on the feasibility potential contributions and desirability of employing former soviet biological weapons scientists in developing biomedical countermeasures
i thank him for being such a clear thinker along with the gentleman from illinois on so many issues
i want to thank the gentleman from illinois chairman hyde for his great leadership on this and on so many human rights issues around the world
on behalf of the majority we are also very happy to accept this amendment
mr chairman i want to congratulate the gentleman on his amendment and we are accepting it again as well
mr chairman on behalf of the majority i want to thank the gentleman from utah mr cannon xz4000590 for offering this very very important amendment
i think by getting all of the information on assessed voluntary and inkind contributions i think americans will be amazed as will international friends around the world in like manner will be amazed how much the us government does provide
so often inkind contributions like airlift for military operations in no way gets on the ledger so we do not have a thorough and a full accounting of the us contribution and how the money is spent
mr chairman by way of background the small quantities protocol frees countries from reporting the possession of up to 10 tons of uranium up to 20 tons of depleted uranium depending on enrichment and up to 22 pounds of plutonium
let me just say to my friends and colleagues that this is a good amendment and on behalf of the majority we would like to accept it
i have already chaired two hearings on it myself in my subcommittee
i want to be clear on this point
it would be wrong for a state to lose their membership when there was no omission no commission on their part with regards to crimes against humanity and that is where the fortenberry amendment got it right
i would echo the statements of the gentleman from california mr lantos xz4002310 in applauding chairman hyde for his extraordinary leadership on the committee on international relations
as chairman of the subcommittee on africa global human rights and international relations i chaired eight hearings on issues related to the bill and the full committee met twice for consideration of these provisions
the legislation mr chairman puts a heavy emphasis on security and authorizes 15 billion for securityrelated construction at us missions 690 million to increase security for diplomatic personnel and 930 million for border security programs
the bill also increases funding for minority recruitment and continues the annual report on minority recruiting efforts at the department of state
it increases the ceiling on differential pay for hardship and danger at a time when we are operating new posts in extremely dangerous locations
mr chairman i am grateful the committee has included a number of provisions that i proposed including services for overseas children suffering from autism a global prevalence study on autism steps to promote human rights and democracy in vietnam belarus and zimbabwe support for a strengthened rule of law in northern ireland as well as assistance to maternal and child victims of chernobyl and the creation of a program to repair and prevent the tragic condition of obstetric fistula
but it is not just the commission on human rights that is broken
let me also point out that the hyde amendment mandates that countries that fail to uphold the human declaration of human rights should be ineligible for membership on the human rights commission or any followup like the human rights council that is being proposed
reform act also focuses on the area of peacekeeping
we need to ensure accountability and transparency in the 12 billion in taxpayer money we spend on peacekeeping every year
this amendment would facilitate the provision of much needed food medical and other humanitarian relief and i thank the gentleman for offering it on the floor today
mr chairman on behalf of the majority we welcome and support the amendment by the gentleman from indiana mr souder xz4003850
the souder amendment will let us know whether we are getting cooperation and support from the government of afghanistan on this critical part in the fight against illicit drugs extraditions
we need to know if we are getting cooperation on these requests and if not why not
we will work very closely with the gentleman on this
mr chairman i want to thank the gentleman from minnesota mr kennedy xz4002141 the gentlewoman from oregon ms hooley xz4001860 the gentleman from nebraska mr osborne xz4003030 and the others who have been working on this amendment and many others over the last few weeks on methamphetamines a scourge that is sweeping our country starting to hammer some of our major cities and is going to be something that we have not seen for a long time in america unless we can get control of this
this report will enable congress to evaluate the level of cooperation from the afghan government on this vital aspect of counterdrug activity
because of that although i know that the committee supports this i am going to ask for a rollcall vote because i believe it is important that we in a bipartisan way go on record and say we must pursue in afghanistan for the protection of our soldiers and families and workers all over the world as heroin pours out of afghanistan at three times the level of anything that ever happened under the taliban
i ask my colleagues for their support on this amendment which would authorize new resources for our drug interdiction efforts
the amendment i propose seeks to build on the efforts of the gentleman from illinois chairman hyde by authorizing the state department s bureau for international narcotics and law enforcement affairs inl to acquire a refueling vessel for the benefit of the us and allied drug interdiction activities such as the us coast guard and navy operating in the eastern pacific region
that would be the area on the west side of mexico and as you come down through central america
according to testimony provided by the coast guard department of defense office of national drug control policy and other agencies to the government reform subcommittee on criminal justice drug policy and human resources which i chair drug traffickers have increasingly pushed their routes into that area further and further west from landfall
we now have more intelligence about drug trafficking than assets to act on it meaning that we have to watch helplessly while some shipments of poisonous narcotics are brought to the us the testimony provided to the subcommittee by federal agencies has indicated that the acquisition of a refueling vessel would be of significant benefit in stopping this gaping hole
mr chairman i would like to seek the support of the chairman in acquiring three cables from the state department one cable from the us embassy in kabul describing the lack of assistance from the afghan government on heroin trade and two cables from the us embassy in bogota regarding lack of us support thus far for the demobilization program
mr chairman i thank the gentleman from illinois mr hyde xz4001920 again the gentleman from new jersey mr smith xz4003801 and the gentleman from california mr lantos xz4002310 for their support on these amendments
because they do not happen on the same day at the same place it is not as dramatic as what happened on 911 but they are still dead
i thank the leadership of the committee for their support on these important amendments so we can in a bipartisan way make a dent in this terrible scourge drug use
i would also say mr chairman that i had a dream last night and this dream was of the gentleman from illinois mr hyde xz4001920 the distinguished chairman of the committee on the international relations
mr chairman i wish to reclaim my time because the gentleman from california mr lantos xz4002310 is very eloquent and i would like to continue to have a little less say on my amendment
my colleagues when you come down to the house floor to vote on the amendment i want you to vote yes for the stearns amendment because in your heart of hearts in fact in the heart of hearts of chairman hyde in my dream he wanted 75 percent
this legislation rightfully prevents some of the world s premier human rights abusers such as cuba sudan and libya from having a seat on the un
sixty percent of inmates in nebraska jails have problems with meth and the toll on families in nebraska is incalculable
the hooleysouder amendment is critical to support our police officers on the front lines in the battle against meth
is a critically important body that has taken on many of the world s problems and solved them problems such as poverty disease and international disputes
i think its primary result would be to further isolate the united states while at the same time actually undermining ongoing efforts at reform and potentially jeopardizing the un s ability to focus on global threats and work toward greater global stability
as it stands the bill is problematic on a number of fronts
the substitute also included incentives by supporting an effort to pay our dues on time an increased un
mr chairman i rise to commend the gentleman from illinois mr hyde xz4001920 and the gentleman from california mr lantos xz4002310 and the gentleman from new jersey mr smith xz4003801 and the members of the committee on international relations for their work in bringing this legislation to the floor today
the secretary of state is also directed to prepare an annual report on democracy which will designate countries as nondemocratic or democratic transition countries there is so much else in this bill but before i run out of time i want to thank the gentleman from illinois mr hyde xz4001920 again and the gentleman from california mr lantos xz4002310 and the gentleman from new jersey mr smith xz4003801 and i want to give my special thanks to the gentleman from illinois mr hyde xz4001920 not just for his work on this legislation and for his support for our advance democracy effort but i want to thank him for his dedication to preserving freedom and protecting the innocent throughout his many years in public service
mr chairman i can remember being on the floor late at night during the situation with regard to the contras down in nicaragua and following the leadership of the gentleman from illinois mr hyde xz4001920 on all of these issues
i want him to know that i personally have followed him on many of these issues
convention on the elimination of discrimination against women which is the un
treaty on the rights of women around the world
the impact of cedaw can be seen in countries like australia where the government cited its treaty obligations in passing national legislation against sexual harassment in the workplace based on cedaw or in pakistan where education for young women was introduced in primary schools after treaty ratification in pakistan causing sharp increases in female enrollment in their schools
that is why i urge my colleagues to cosponsor my resolution on cedaw h res 67 to support the lantos amendment and to vote against this base bill unless we do something drastically to improve it
i would like to take this opportunity to thank the distinguished gentleman from illinois mr hyde chairman of the international relations committee for his leadership on this critically important issue
for years americans have watched with disbelief as the united nations has put brutal dictatorships like syria and sudan on its human rights commission while at the same time it lectures free democracies on what it means to respect human rights
accordingly the committee rose and the speaker pro tempore mr simpson xz4003760 having assumed the chair mr bass chairman of the committee of the whole house on the state of the union reported that that committee having had under consideration the bill hr 2745 to reform the united nations and for other purposes had come to no resolution thereon
adopt criteria for membership on any human rights body
counts some of the world s leading human rights violators and state sponsors of terrorism among its membership and even taps many of them to be in leadership positions on its subcommittees
security council we have a duty to insist on a higher standard
adopt criteria for membership on any human rights body
counts some of the world s leading human rights violators and state sponsors of terrorism among its membership and even taps many of them to be in leadership positions on its subcommittees
support the rule on the henry h hyde bill
this ideal however has over its more recent course become a body where some member nations appear more focused on institutional antiamericanism than addressing the growing maladies that face the world s citizens
the ban on our funding antagonistic nations however would not begin until march of 2006
march 31 of 2006 the next report will come out that says how everyone voted on each position
on numerous occasions i have had citizens ask me why government is sending their money overseas to support governments and countries that are against the amendments and things for which we stand
my amendment simply would require the omb to give a yearly report to congress on all the contributions whether they be assessed voluntary or inkind that the united states gives to the united nations
first of all i want to say as one of the new members of congress and serving on the international relations committee i appreciate the example that the chairman of the committee and ranking member set for all members of the international relations committee on how both sides of the committee can work together to achieve goals that are best for the united states
my fellow colleagues on both sides of the aisle have echoed this sentiment
and i want to thank the gentleman from illinois chairman hyde for his leadership on this important issue and it is an honor to serve with him on the committee on international relations
it is important for the united states to remain engaged and a player on the world s stage to enact these important reforms
madam speaker the second secretarygeneral of the united nations dag hammarskjold commented during his tenure that the united nations was not created to take humanity to heaven but save it from hell a keen observation on the fundamental tensions present in such a massive and massively important institution
but the central debate here on the house floor is not about what the reforms should be
there are 191 individual members of the organization that must agree on the reforms sometimes unanimously if we are to make the un
we should not advocate a policy of withdrawal from the world community on the one hand and ask for it to engage on the other
mr chairman i speak in rabid opposition to this amendment not because i oppose the total intent of it but because it is legislating on an appropriations bill
if it were to pass and remain in the bill it would make the committee on energy and commerce much more difficult on reconciliation
he apparently in trying to be balanced is to some of my friends on the other side of the aisle indicating that he is maybe going too far
and the people working in indian gaming on the reservations have the right and are entitled to the protections of the nlrb
mr chairman due to a previous and unavoidable appointment i was unable to vote on several amendments to hr 3010 the fy 2006 labor health and human services education appropriations act
had i been present i would have voted aye on rollcall votes numbered 315 316 and 317 and no on rollcall votes numbered 318 and 319
this bill is a stunning example of the impact that this congress s misplaced priorities can have on what most consider to be a basic human right access to a quality education
unfortunately the bill before this congress imposes draconian cuts to the essential services that americans rely on everyday
students who take regular arts courses are proven to score on average 90 to 100 points better on their sats than students that do not take arts classes
he has been a strong advocate on behalf of education programs and it has been a privilege to work with him in support of our priorities
and the agreement that we came to on the floor of this house in a very broad bipartisan way was that to the extent that a school sells or shares student data they must treat military recruiters in a nondiscriminatory way or in other words treat all people who would want access to this data to have access to it in the same way
it has been a wonderful career for tens of millions of americans and the fact is that the practice is going on in far too many schools discriminates against the needs of our military
now that bill the reauthorization of the higher education act is to be before the committee on education and the workforce immediately upon the return of congress from the july 4 district work period
now i am as disgusted by this scheme as the gentleman from maryland is i can tell you and why this practice went on for as long as it has is really very troubling to me
again i would urge my colleagues to vote no on the amendment
the onus of responsibility is on us
if a commission would be useful let us make it a health care commission and let us ask its members to recommend measures to stabilize health care spending and let us give the bush administration a vote on that commission
but do not allow the bush white house to put medicaid on trial as if it is some twobit criminal when medicaid is actually a lowercost health insurer than any private insurer out there
and i just would reiterate though on this amendment that this is a medicaid commission that the white house is not even giving members of congress a vote on reforming the whole system
so they are going to come here with the commission recommendation from the white house to congress about cutting 10 billion but are not even going to give any real congressional input because we will not even be able to vote on these recommendations
so in that vein i ask members of this body to support the brown amendment on medicaid
the social security disability system has a backlog of more than a halfmillion cases on appeal
social security commissioner jo anne barnhart testified last year that on average it took more than 3 years to complete processing of a disability claim on appeal from the day it s filed to the day it s finally adjudicated
it was supposed to be on the reading is fundamental program which is much more appropriate to this title and i have asked the chairman if he would engage in a colloquy
thirtyseven percent of american fourth graders read below the basic level on the national assessment of education progress reading test
i would like to learn more from the chairman about his views on this program and if he will assist in making sure that funding is appropriated
i salute the chairman for his efforts on behalf of homeless veterans
and as i read the amendment it is on new medicare cards and not ones that exist at the present time
the problem is pbgc jumped too easily at a deal to put taxpayers on the hook for pensions while allowing united to walk away from its responsibilities to its employees
at the same time ual chief executive gerald grinstein has said that united would gain a competitive advantage on rivals by dumping its employee pension obligation
it plays well on some radio and television stations but in reality it will have no effect
it will just be a chilling effect on all people who question their status in this country and they will then not go and get the care that they need to protect the rest of our children
in a time when much furor exists over the decency of much of what is broadcast on our televisions and radios it is only logical that congress support an organization that has held traditional values to a high standard which is reflected in its programming
children s programs such as sesame street and arthur programs which undoubtedly educate our children and instill them with positive values will lose the necessary funding that keeps them on television
they are now neutral on this amendment
this amendment only restricts the waivers of privacy and an incredible extension of waiving all privacy laws relating to people on medicare or medicaid and giving discretion to the secretary of health and human services to turn over that data as he sees fit no matter what the will of the seniors is
at a time when the american people have come to rely on their health care providers more than ever eliminating this resource would be devastating to the country s neediest communities
on january 6 the department of labor entered into an agreement with walmart to settle violations of child labor laws in 3 states connecticut new hampshire and arkansas
if a state government can get tough on a child labor violator one that happens to be our nation s largest private employer there is no reason the federal government should not be able to do so as well
mr chairman i simply want to put all members on notice that as soon as the committee rises i will seek an order of the house to permit 5minute voting on any motion to recommit
mr speaker i ask unanimous consent that the minimum time for electronic voting on any motion to recommit may be 5 minutes notwithstanding that it would be the first vote in a series
on march 23 2004 the legislative directors of the disabled american veterans the paralyzed veterans of america and the veterans of foreign wars said that passage of the budget resolution as presented would be a disservice to those men and women who serve this country and who are currently serving in iraq afghanistan and around the world in the fight against terrorism
the bottom line is this house on a partisan basis through the budget resolution has underfunded va medical care
mr chairman major data security breaches are occurring on a daily basis and identity theft is the fastestgrowing white collar crime in the country
they have become a cornerstone of the ryan white care act since advances in drug treatments like antiretroviral therapies have had a profound effect on extending the quality and length of life of those infected with hivaids
even with this emergency measure as of may 12 of this year almost 1 900 individuals were on adap waiting lists in 10 states
nearly every adap state has already had to make incredibly tough choices on cost containment measures such as closed enrollment reduced formularities per capita expenditure limits lowered income eligibility waiting lists and increased client costsharing
the elimination of funding for valuable programs such as the area health education center ahec and the health education and training center hetc would have an immediate damaging impact on medical education care and research especially in the state of new york
by including social security numbers on medicare cards the department of health and human services places millions of medicare beneficiaries at risk of becoming victims of identity theft
it prohibits the department of health and human services from including social security numbers on medicare cards
some states prohibit companies from displaying social security numbers internally and assign consumers unique numbers that would appear on medicare cards
the department of health and human services has said that the health insurance claim number that they use is merely a variation of the recipient s social security number not the actual number and has noted that the number may be based on the social security number of a spouse or parent
i introduced a similar bill to stop the irs from putting social security numbers on its mailings and the irs found a way in short time to stop the practice that could lead to identity theft
there is simply no excuse mr chairman for leaving medicare beneficiaries vulnerable to identity theft with a thinly disguised social security number on medicarerelated mailings
that led to i guess it falling between the cracks of the two appropriate subcommittees so that while i understand there is support for the program and the gentleman from new york mr walsh xz4004200 a former chairman of the hud subcommittee tells me that he strongly supports it and i understand there was a very close vote in the appropriations committee on an amendment to put it back into the bill both bills now come to the floor so i would ask the chairman of the subcommittee given the i believe support it was in the president s budget there was virtually a tie vote in the appropriations committee could the gentleman tell me is there some hope that we can give to these young people that this important program will survive
i wonder if the gentleman from ohio could give us some guidance on what the chances are for the ultimate survival of this very important program which the president supports and i believe is supported on the merits
my good friend a member of the committee on appropriations pointed out that charter schools are public schools that charter schools in fact offer services to children with special needs
mr chairman in may 2004 the national labor relations board overturned 30 years of its own precedent and ruled that it has jurisdiction over tribal government enterprises located on tribes own sovereign lands
this decision is a frontal assault on tribal sovereign rights
but the nlrb incorrectly decided that it should exercise its jurisdiction over tribal governments on their own lands
the heavyhanded activist nlrb overlaid an incompatible legal regime where a tribal one agreed to on a governmenttogovernment basis with the state of california was in place and was working
mr chairman quoting the words of my friend the gentleman from rhode island mr kennedy xz4002151 to indian country today newspaper he said he would push for a compromise bill through congress that would support onreservation tribal sovereignty against the jurisdiction of the national labor relations board while accepting the board s role as arbiter of laboremployee disputes and union organizing on offreservation tribally owned business
what happens on tribal lands with their sovereignty should likewise be governed by the sovereign governments there
we have been working to introduce new language that i believe both sides have agreed to on this particular amendment and my inquiry is do i have to offer an amendment to the amendment
i will simply say to both the majority and minority staff of the committee on appropriations and to members on this side the gentleman from georgia mr gingrey xz4001510 the gentleman from virginia mr goode xz4001530 the gentleman from texas mr culberson xz4000890 the gentleman from california mr rohrabacher xz4003430 the gentleman from oklahoma mr sullivan xz4003920 who were all prepared to speak on this amendment we thank them for their involvement
i thank both sides for their cooperation on this and though we may have sincere differences in the challenges of the day i do appreciate everyone s constructive attitude on this amendment
as hard as the chairman and ranking member have worked on this bill there are still many wonderful things in the bill very meritorious things in the bill but things that do not have to be done some of them
i commend the committee and the chairman on that
it also prohibits the cpb from violating the policies set forth by congress which include a prohibition on outside interference
mr chairman i rise in opposition to this amendment because if passed this measure will place extreme financial and legal hardships on border and urban hospitals
therefore i respectfully ask my colleagues to vote no on this amendment and yes to safeguarding access to health care in all cities
i support the military s right to recruit on every high school campus but i do not believe the current provision advances our national security or reflects our nation s respect for individual privacy rights
this is but another egregious attack on the privacy rights of our students
the remaining 15 million would be used to educate both service members and employers about the employment rights of veterans including their rights and responsibilities under the uniformed services employment and reemployment rights act userra which prohibits workforce discrimination based on military service
this is a bad promise on a bad premise
i would hope that my colleague would join me on finding an amendment to stop the abuse of lobbyists who take money from native americans and indian tribes and reservations and not do a darn thing with it
i do not know if my colleagues are going to thwart the administration s desire to find some common ground on immigration
nevertheless i hope my friends on the other side do not do that
our nation faces many challenges on the issue of immigration
to refuse to put more boarder guards on our frontiers only to rob those who are attempting to create a better life for themselves
i would like to compliment him on a very thoughtful amendment
in 1988 1989 when the ryan white care act was initially authorized texas was number 13 on the list of hivinfected persons
as many of you know as a result of his infection ryan white was expelled from his school on the account of being a health risk to other students
this shameful behaviour on behalf of the school board as well as multiple death threats to him and his family required the white family to move to cicero indiana
his inscesant work landed him in washington dc to testify before the president s commission on aids
mr chairman today we will vote on hr 3010 the labor health and human services and education bill for fiscal year 2006
on behalf of the educators administrators and students in dallas texas i would like to express my strong opposition to the education appropriations outlined in this measure
it slashes education technology by 196 million 395 percent on top of a 196 million cut last year
this bill turns its back on these schools
two hundred thousand new beneficiaries sign up every month and anything that would disrupt their entry up into the system would be a terrible hardship to impose on our seniors
that project is currently in the informationgathering phase focusing on identifying all of the systems and entities and understanding the nature of the transactions that rely on a beneficiary identifier
there are many parties involved with a variety of information claims processing and data exchange systems and once they get this base research done they can move forward on reforming the use of the social security system
i certainly support denying impotence drugs to sex offenders but to arbitrarily eliminate any class of drugs from a formulary first of all sets a terrible precedent and has the same potential for mischief as state mandates on health plans have demonstrated is possible
mr chairman i thank the gentleman for yielding me this important time and we have all observed with awe the marvelous photos of construction workers sitting on ibeams swinging high above new york city as we admire their bravery their daring and their skill
well the worst construction accident in federal transportation history in the city of toledo took place on february 16 last year effecting serious loss of life and injuries among these modern soldiers of the sky
crushed to death on the job were mike phillips age 42 arden clark age 47 mike moreau age 30 and robert lipinski junior age 44
joe blaze the president of the local ironworkers observed what happened will affect us for generations the local paper reported the toledo blade workers told investigators the crane s rear legs were held up with 14 inches of shims and no anchors while each front leg had shims and only one of two anchors these workers were crushed to death by a severalmillionton crane falling on them
i tried at the full committee level to place simple report language in this bill merely asking the department of labor s occupational health and safety administration to gather all records relating to inspections or the lack thereof on this job and to also provide any communications that have occurred with the us justice department related to this accident
i along with the gentleman from new york mr owens xz4003060 the ranking member of the subcommittee on workforce protections were prepared to offer an amendment right here today to ask the department of labor to assist our county prosecutor in the investigation of this tragedy
this amendment is also being denied to me on a technicality rather than being discussed on its merits
osha s midwest office had ruled there was willful negligence on this job and for reasons not completely understood they have changed that ruling to unclassified
where was the state of ohio on this the largest federal transportation project in ohio history
why is this congress now denying me the ability to get a vote on this amendment which merely asks the department of labor to engage with our county prosecutor to investigate the real causes of those deaths
these men died in my view because of the apparent willful negligence of the us department of labor and osha and their allies here in the congress who have been cutting back on worker safety laws and who have abdicated their responsibility to conduct aggressive oversight
today it is likely that my amendment would have been ruled out of order as my simple effort to get on the record information from the department of labor was denied to me as a member of congress because the full committee would not even allow report language a most unusual practice
instead today i am left with a personal appeal to the secretary of labor to use her existing authority to provide assistance to the lucas county prosecutor for the full prosecution of this case wherever it may lead and i ask that we all push for the swift implementation of construction crane safety standards so that no other family or community need endure the great tragedy that has befallen us in northwest ohio on the largest federal transportation project in our state s history
dear secretary chao the city of toledo s police department and the lucas county ohio prosecutor s office are attempting to carry out an exhaustive investigation into whether criminal charges should be filed regarding safety violations resulting in the deaths of four ironworkers on construction of the i280 maumee river crossing in toledo ohio
on february 16 2004 our community was shocked by tragedy when a two millionpound construction crane collapsed at the i280 maumee river crossing construction site in toledo ohio
an investigation of criminal wrongdoing on a project of this magnitude is an enormous task for any local agency
this year we are spending 134 billion a year on pell grants and the maximum award is up to 4 100
on january 14 2005 president bush gave a speech in florida where he said we want to increase the pell grants by 100 per year over the next 5 years
on february 7 2005 president bush followed up his florida speech on pell grants by submitting a budget which also called for increasing the pell grant maximum award of 4 050 by an additional 100 this year
on may 26 2005 i sent the gentleman from ohio chairman regula a letter signed by 46 members of congress which encouraged the appropriations committee to fully fund the 4 150 request by president bush
mr chairman i would also like to hear the comments of the gentleman from ohio chairman boehner s comments on the issue as well
using taxpayer dollars to bribe journalists to bias their news coverage in favor of legislation is a waste of taxpayer money it is a black eye on the independence of our free press and it undermines the integrity of our democracy
specifically under the contract armstrong williams was paid to regularly comment on nclb during the course of his broadcasts to encourage the producers of a cable tv program to periodically address the nclb law and it specified that the secretary of education and other education officials would have the right to appear from time to time as guests on williams tv programs
our agenda ought to be able to stand on its own two feet
mr chairman it is dead wrong to use taxpayer dollars to pay private contractors such as public relations firms journalists and media commentators to promote legislation pending before this congress and for that reason i wholeheartedly thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for voting yes on my amendment
instead of addressing this issue in a substantive manner in committee we are once again addressing it in a political way on the floor of the house simply for political gain
mr chairman the danger in our society now is basing policy on old stereotypes that somehow mental health and mental science is not real science
the gentleman from ohio mr boehner xz4000360 and i have had discussions on scheduling hearings in the committee of jurisdiction the committee on education and the workforce
i have often led the fight to defeat legislative riders on appropriation bills because of my confidence in the regular procedures guiding us through the legislative process
i urge my colleagues to vote no on the hayworth amendment
and i will never abdicate my responsibility on that
i think it is extremely important that this congress on an issue so delicate and so important to two groups for whom we have great affection be done in the appropriate committee the committee of jurisdiction
the appropriations committee had to make tough choices because of the strict budget allocations brought on by the misguided and irresponsible tax cuts for the richest of americans and the cost of the war but programs that help millions of americans should not be on the chopping block
mr chairman i would ask unanimous consent for 2 additional minutes on each side
i have recently had conversations with the chair of the committee on ways and means and the chairwoman of the subcommittee of the committee on ways and means who are interested in working with many of us to try to resolve this issue with cms
based on their assurances in those conversations we feel very confident that we should be able to work this out with cms so that we do not go forward on this very restrictive and narrow rule
hopefully through the conference process hopefully through the cooperation we expect to receive through cms further legislation on this matter will not be necessary
and let me just conclude that based on assurances that we received from the appropriate people on the committee on ways and means the chair the subcommittee chairwoman and also the fact that we still have time in which to cut this rule off before it is fully implemented it is my intent today to ask unanimous consent to withdraw the amendment and hope that we can get this resolved without further legislative action being taken
mr chairman first i would like to state my appreciation for the work done by the gentleman from ohio mr regula xz4003340 committee chairman on this overall bill and his work and cooperation at all levels and the flexibility that he has demonstrated in the interests across this broad country
it is something that i think we have a consensus on
to bring this towards a close as i listen to this debate i think it is clear to us that this is an inappropriate investment on the part of taxpayers dollars for us to compel the taxpayers to pay for sexual impotency drugs
section 505 of the illegal immigration reform and responsibility act of 1996 clearly states that notwithstanding any other provision of law an alien who is not lawfully present in the united states shall not be eligible on the basis of residence within a state or a political subdivision for any postsecondary education benefit unless a citizen or national of the united states is eligible for such a benefit in no less an amount duration and scope without regard to whether the citizen or national is such a resident my amendment simply seeks to enforce existing law
not only is providing instate tuition to illegal aliens against the law it would also place a huge financial burden on our society
but i yield to my chairman on this point
i rise in opposition to this amendment because it seeks to overturn two court decisions and what judge wedoff said was the least of the bad alternative choices here has got to be the one that keeps the airline functioning that keeps employees being paid we have to look out for the interests of all people especially the 62 000 employees of united airlines right now just crawling out of bankruptcy on whom the future of the entire western chicagoland region ohare airport and many of the related businesses depend
we will also jeopardize the crown jewel of the economic development i think we should make sure that this process moves forward we should make sure that this airline continues to function and we should make sure that the 62 000 current employees of united are allowed to find their way back into profitability so they can put food on their table especially in my district and other illinois districts
i think we must fund gifted education on a national level to allow millions of children across the country to have the same types of challenges our tenth district laureates enjoy
it is a program particularly needed given the low scores of americans on standard international math and science tests
i will consume very little time on this because others have greater knowledge about it
the tucson medical center in my home state of arizona a crucial level 1 trauma facility shut its doors on its trauma facility because of uncompensated care
this amendment is an attack on our communities
as the gentleman knows hhs at one time conducted a program on gulf war illnesses research
and the gentleman also knows that according to the congressionally chartered research advisory committee on gulf war veterans illnesses there has never been a better time to invest in this research
if we can learn from our mistakes an emphasis on handson efforts particularly in the creative arts should become a focal point of 21st century education
secondly in the statement i will submit for the record i have outlined a reason for this particular grant that is in my view again very compelling which makes a political attack on it quite again in my view uncompelling
mr chairman i recognize that sometimes committees decide to accept a series of amendments to bills en bloc on the house floor and then review them further in conference
in this circumstances i rise to express a great disappointment that the committee has agreed to accept for the time being the neugebauer amendment which represents a philosophical assault on the peer review process that serves as a hallowed barrier to scientific censorship
mr chairman the neugebauer amendment is about exasperation with nih research on nonhumans ie animals and birds and targets a grant given a respected research institution in my district the university of iowa
it is no accident that the remarkable results that have been obtained in developing miracle drugs and intervention approaches in so many diseases begins with research on animals and birds
the research which focuses on how the pigeon discriminates between visual stimuli could be singularly important to our understanding of how brains and mental processes operate
new thinking and teaching methods which may develop from research on pigeons and other life forms could better enable impaired individuals to interact with a world of complex patterns and categories thus allowing them to be productive decisionmakers less likely to need institutionalization
the pigeon may seem an obscure subject but the application of research on this bird which is so talented it can find its way home even if transported and released thousands of miles away could be quite meaningful
when we vote on this conference report we will be taking away 125 million promised to sick 911 workers
in fact this bill is full of misdirected priorities when we consider that the republican leadership will spend more on tax cuts this week 70 billion than they will on education and labor programs for the entire coming year 68 billion
this shell game would be comical if it were not so sad and so hard on the lives of these people
i understand that his hands are tied on this issue
i speak for all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle certainly in the new york delegation that we are not going to stop until we meet the needs of the heroes of 911 and this promised money of 125 million is restored to the budget
these cuts will have a dramatic impact on the system at a time when essential health care services are already facing funding cuts and program eliminations
it dragged on the negotiations with its employees and then in the middle of the night got up from those negotiations and dumped those retirement plans into the pbgc causing those employees to lose somewhere from 30 to 60 percent of their retirement nest egg of their retirement assets of their future standard of living
over 2 000 people participated and told us what the real impact of these cuts would be on their families on their children on spouses with illnesses on their parents
it is not a question of whether the ayes or the noes will prevail on a recorded vote
the question is what happened on the floor at that particular time
a number of years ago we had very heated debates on this floor from the republican side from mr walker because they felt that they were insulted especially when cameras came into this chamber that the chair would call votes against their interests when they clearly prevailed on the voice
so i would ask the chair in the future and future chairs to recognize that the chair is calling the event that takes place in front of the chair on the floor not what the chair perceives to be and may be correctly so the outcome of the vote later on in the day when the recorded vote is taken
mr chairman i demand a recorded vote on the chair s ruling
mr chairman i demand a recorded vote on my amendment
and first and foremost we must understand that this amendment that is being offered has no impact on this process
what this amendment does is suggest that somehow that those workers on a reservation working in a casino who are not enrolled members of that tribe have no rights have no rights
it just kicks the can down the road and people are still in limbo if they are seeking to work out an arrangement for those tribal lands and for labor relations on those tribal lands
this is recreating this on these lands
before the vote on nclb i heard reservations from local educators and my constituents that nclb not become another unfunded mandate like idea for special education
the elimination of the programs will have an immediate impact on the training and recruitment of health professions students and the educational opportunities developed and supported by title vii
community health centers and the national health service corps for example rely on graduates of title vii programs to fill their ranks
they are spending approximately a half a billion dollars a year on television advertising saturating the airwaves during family viewing hours when they know the parents and the kids are sitting in front of the television and now the taxpayer is going to be paying for this cost of advertising
but the point is these ads on tv today are offensive and we are spending half a billion dollars on them
mr speaker on rollcall no
the president s new freedom commission on mental health clearly stated that schools should work collaboratively with families on mental health services and support to children
i urge my colleagues to vote no on the paul amendment to do what is right for medicine what is right for mental health and what is compassionate for those with mental illnesses
i would like to thank the gentleman for working with the senate each year to increase funding in conference and thank the gentleman from wisconsin mr obey xz4003000 for his leadership on this issue
mr speaker i am not clear that i am going to ask for a vote on this amendment
i will ask the chairman to express himself on that subject
i will at this point not ask for a vote on this amendment
mr speaker on rollcall no
it complies with the budget resolution provisions on advance appropriations
i commend the committee on appropriations for bringing us a bill that funds many priority programs members care about while living within our means in an era requiring tougher fiscal discipline
as we indicated at the beginning of the debate the gentleman from ohio and i were trying to work things out so that we could finish debate on this bill this afternoon
i would ask members in the future if they are offering amendments to any appropriations bill to please be attentive enough to what is going on on the floor so that we do not pass their amendment in the reading of the bill
it would be disgraceful if the congress allowed this program to fall through the cracks because neither committee included the funding for it and if congress simply played alfonse and gaston on us between the two subcommittees
the gentleman from illinois mr kirk xz4002220 and the gentleman from new york mr nadler xz4002890 both missed their opportunity to offer their amendments in regular order because the reading went fast and neither of them was on the floor
the committee majority preferred and i can understand why because it was time consuming the committee preferred to simply rely on our ability to get unanimous consent to go back to consider yours and the gentleman from new york s amendment
so i do not think that anyone is breaking an agreement this is what happens number one when members are not on the floor when they need to be
we were relying on an assumption that proved to be erroneous and i am certain the gentleman from ohio feels as badly about it as i do
but in my view no one on the floor is breaking his word
the situation that the gentleman from ohio finds himself in on this issue is a very difficult one because he is trying to balance between two legitimate claims on the federal treasury
we have seen as was observed in the washington post article this morning a parade of members come down to the floor yesterday and today trying to wiggle out from the consequences of the budget resolution which was imposed on the entire house by the passage of that resolution
i have a little less sympathy for the gentleman from ohio than i do for myself on this issue because he voted for the budget resolution and i did not
but that being said there is no right position on an amendment like this
this issue simply demonstrates that when the money that you provide for education is inadequate when it is inadequate to the needs of the nation then we are going to be eating each other s favorite programs then you are going to have all kinds of interest groups in this country chewing on each other and each trying to get out from under at the expense of everybody else
so the amendment is half right and half wrong and i hope therefore that the members on the majority side and the minority side will understand why the gentleman from ohio is so reluctantly against this amendment
we have heard a number of members on the majority side of the aisle say we should not overturn a court decision
where were you on the schiavo case when you brought the congress back in order to stick your nose into the very painful endoflife decisions that were made by a family in agony
get straight fellows come on
this amendment is absolutely necessary if we are going to stop the dumping of pension obligations on the taxpayers of the united states
the taxpayers have enough trouble now getting their representatives to do real things to fix social security and now they are going to dump the responsibility for private pensions on the taxpayer as well
what i would say is this and i hope the house remembers this when the treasury bill is on the floor next week because i got added to that bill a requirement that the general accounting office do a study to determine whether or not we need to reregulate the airlines and treat them as a necessary public utility providing service to every community in this country in order to save our pension system for airline employees
this congress needs to start talking about matters that affect the people back home rather than continuing to focus on matters that deal with the welfare of people inside the system and inside the beltway in washington
it is about time congress quit paying attention to little details that have nothing to do with people s lives and start focusing on big problems like preservation of their private pensions
this is the only way that we can fire a shot across the donothing leadership of this congress bow and get some movement on this crucial pension issue
as i understand it the ig and what i understand is on the basis of a 2minute briefing what i understand is that the inspector general ruled that a number of these schools were in fact private and not public and also questioned the way that at least two of the schools had spent taxpayers money
the problem with the gentleman s amendment is that because he does not like the fact that the federal government has been ineffective with respect to immigration he wants to take it out on the local hospitals
the local hospitals when someone shows up on their door they have an obligation under the law to treat that patient
mr tomlinson is the person who appointed a consultant in order to try to measure the number of instances when people on pbs programs were quote antibush or quote antidelay
it is also mr tomlinson who was reported to have worked to raise money in order to put the wall street journal editorial board on public broadcasting
mr chairman i do not mind seeing republicans on public broadcasting
i do not think there was a better show on television than bill buckleys s program through the years
bill buckley had a huge intellect and i think the country was served by the programs that he had on that program for many years
i do not think the country is served well when mr tomlinson takes upon himself the duty of being the thought policeman for the entire country on public television
mr chairman i would simply say that while i am dubious about the content of several of these amendments in the interest of moving the bill forward i would also urge that we accept the en bloc amendments and move on to the others
mr chairman reclaiming my time let me simply say that like the gentleman from ohio i see no problem with accepting the amendment on this side because as i read it it does not do nothing to nobody for anybody or about anybody
mr chairman all through last year on this side of the aisle we continually insisted that we needed more money for veterans health care and were consistently told by the administration and the other side that we did not
the gentleman from texas mr edwards xz4001180 is going to shortly be asking unanimous consent to consider an amendment which would on an emergency basis add the 1 billion which the administration is saying is necessary to pay the bills at the va
res 95 l09th congress the concurrent resolution on the budget for the fiscal year 2006
i am speaking as one member of the house i am not speaking as ranking democrat on the subcommittee or committee
but let us understand this bill in my view is still an assault on the country s future
because of the fact that this house is deciding that large tax cuts for very welloff people are more important than anything else this bill on the worker protection front guts the program that we rely on to try to protect our workers from having to compete against child and slave labor
we want this bill to go back to the committee so that the committee can also do what it should have done in the first place which is to add 1 billion on an emergency basis to take care of the shortfall in va health care that the white house and omb have been hiding from the american people and hiding from veterans for months
so i will personally urge a vote for my motion to recommit and when the vote on final passage comes i will vote against it because this bill just does not measure up to our national obligations
i urge an aye vote on the motion to recommit
for the last 2 weeks the attention of the house has been focused on the efforts of the majority party to pass its reconciliation bill which includes significant cuts in food stamps in child support enforcement in disability payments in order to pay for the tax cuts which this congress has already largely passed
it would provide an additional 15 billion in programs that are meant to discourage abortion programs such as a maternal and child health block grant head start domestic violence and numerous others onehalf billion dollars to restore health professions training and 3 billion to put title i on a 5year track to full funding under no child left behind 16 billion in additional funding for disabled and handicapped children trying to put that program on the same 5year glide path and onehalf billion dollars in restoration for worker training and job training programs
mr speaker on that i demand the yeas and nays
mr speaker 2 weeks ago the labor health appropriation bill was defeated on this floor largely because it contained inadequate investments in education and health
i would simply ask the majority to withdraw the point of order in order to allow us to simply proceed to at least debate and vote on the question of rearranging priorities so that we can add 2 billion to the low income heating assistance program and fully pay for that by cutting back the scheduled tax cut for persons who make over 1 million to 131 000
mr speaker the last motion sought to increase funding for the low income heating assistance program by 2 billion and fully pay for that with an offset on the revenue side of the ledger
mr speaker on that i demand the yeas and nays
this has been going on for a lot of years and there are a lot of bad results and once we talk about universal testing of everybody and there is no age limit matter of fact in the recommendation by the new freedom commission there is a tendency for overdiagnosis and overuse of medication
there is no evidence now on the books to show that the use of this medication actually in children reduces suicide
children on psychotropic drugs may well be even more likely to commit suicide
take for instance in texas 60 percent of the foster children are on medication
if you push on this type of testing the more testing you have let me guarantee it the more drugs you will have
i am not excluding any of this when a person has true mental illness but i am talking about the overuse of ritalin and prozac and many of these drugs that are pushed on these kids
let me tell members there have been some real problems with families who will not let their kids go on drugs because the schools pressure them to
they have been charged with child abuse and threatened with taking their children away because they will not be put on these drugs
mr chairman i was unavoidable detained on official business this morning
mr speaker i ask unanimous consent that during further consideration in the committee of the whole of hr 3010 pursuant to house resolution 337 notwithstanding clause 11 of rule xviii no further amendment to the bill as amended may be offered except pro forma amendments offered at any point in the reading by the chairman or ranking minority member of the committee on appropriations or their designees for the purpose of debate the additional amendments specified in this order and amendments en bloc specified in this order it shall be in order at any time for the chairman of the committee on appropriations or a designee after consultation with the ranking minority member of the committee on appropriations to offer amendments en bloc as follows amendments en bloc shall consist of amendments that may be offered under this order or germane modifications of any such amendment such amendments en bloc shall be considered as read except that modifications shall be reported shall be debatable for 10 minutes equally the additional amendments specified in this order are as follows amendments printed in the lt em gt lt em gt congressional record and numbered 1 2 4 5 8 10 11 14 15 16 17 and 24 an amendment by the gentleman from iowa mr king xz4002202 regarding coverage of certain drugs an amendment by the gentlewoman from connecticut ms delauro xz4001030 regarding enforcement of certain compliance agreements an amendment by the gentleman from new york mr engel xz4001220 regarding grants under the public health service act an amendment by the gentleman from wisconsin mr kind xz4002180 regarding designations of critical access hospitals an amendment by the gentleman from california mr waxman xz4004250 regarding certain appointments to federal advisory committees an amendment by the gentleman from california mr george miller xz4002780 regarding united airline pension plans an amendment by the gentleman from new york mr hinchey xz4001780 regarding the content or distribution of public telecommunications programs and services under the communications act of 1934 an amendment by the gentleman from california mr honda xz4001850 regarding military recruiters an amendment by the gentleman from wisconsin mr obey xz4003000 regarding funding levels and income tax rates an amendment by the gentleman from maryland mr van hollen xz4004150 regarding special allowances under the higher education act an amendment by the gentleman from massachusetts mr markey xz4002530 regarding interoperable information technology an amendment by the gentleman from ohio mr brown xz4000482 regarding funding for the medicaid commission amendments by the gentleman from ohio mr regula xz4003340 regarding veterans programs of the department of labor liheap section 503 of hr 3010 or a limitation on the use of certain education funds and an amendment by the gentleman from georgia mr price xz4003262 regarding funding for certain education programs

it just happens that i am on both of the committees and will work with the treasury or transportation treasury
i know when we get to conference with the other body that this probably will be one that has support but it all depends on what is available in funding
but on the other hand americorps is a very important program because it is made up of volunteers a lot of times young people
you have volunteers who are working in a community on education public safety probably doing mentoring for students which is extremely important
so i would hope the gentleman would withdraw his amendment or at least not go to a vote on it because i think the innovative program is good but americorps is good and in limited budgets we need to keep that program going
so it has a very powerful ripple effect throughout the community to have these americorps most like young people volunteers seeking other people and training them to engage in service as mentors and so on
here you have two good programs but on balance we have to at this juncture and with the limited resources we have go with the americorps as opposed to adding more in addition to the 100 million we already put in the program for innovative education programs
but we know with americorps that they work in the communities do a lot of great work in getting people involved in mentoring and all kinds of other activities and on balance i think we have to make a choice here
we have legislation moving through the committee on education and the workforce dealing with pensions and this would set a precedent i think for our body the us house to interject itself in something that should be handled by the parties and i think what they are trying to do is to work it out in a way that is in the best interest of both the active employees and retirees
i say this to my colleagues who are watching us on cspan i think the debate illustrates the complexity of this issue
i would hope that the committee on education and the workforce that is dealing with the pension problems would address situations similar to this
it is a disgrace in the united states that 32 percent on average nationwide do not finish high school
and i can not believe the body would not want to at least have a commission to look at the problem that is obviously looming on the horizon
we are going to be confronted with some very difficult choices in the future as we found out on the social security issue
i am particularly pleased that in this bill we will erase the 43 billion shortfall that had existed within the program and put the program on a solid financial footing
mr chairman i reserve a point of order on this amendment
this would prohibit cms from spending any funds related to using social security numbers on a medicare identification card
but in the meantime there are 43 million people who are on medicare
for that reason i would oppose the amendment if there is a vote on it
mr chairman i yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from texas mr barton xz4000180 the chairman of the committee on energy and commerce
it has been on the docket before
i would hope my colleagues would agree in voting against this if it were brought up on a roll call vote
this amendment would negatively impact on cpb s ability to assist in the production of quality educational programming
for example if this amendment were to be law if ken burns whom we all are familiar with were to serve as a consultant to the national park service on battlefield conservation he then would be prohibited from producing any documentaries for pbs or local public tv stations
the amendment would alter public broadcasting s authorization that is presently in the law and i think it would cripple the abilities of cpb to do what our colleagues on the other side of the aisle want it to do and that is to be an objective medium to present all sides of every issue and not attempt to politicize the message
i have said many times that i have three goals on the committee
the sponsor mentions 26 million and let me point out that the funds provided in this bill that respond to recommendations put forward in the final report of the president s new freedom commission on mental health achieving the promise transforming mental health care in america go toward state incentive grants for transformation to support the development of comprehensive state mental health plans and has absolutely no funding included for universal mental health screening
i think that is why the great majority of members voted against it last year and i would urge members to vote the same way this year on this amendment
for example walmart would no longer be required to provide additional training to walmart managers regarding the requirements of the child labor laws would no longer be able to discipline managers who fail to comply with the child labor laws would no longer be required to post warning stickers on all equipment the secretary has designated as hazardous for the operation by minors would no longer be able to perform quarterly selfaudits of all of its stores for the duration of the agreement and it would not stop walmart from receiving advance notice of most investigations
for this reason i would oppose the amendment and i hope my colleagues would do likewise if we do have a vote on this
if we get into the role of trying to secondguess and to pass judgment on them there is no end to it
obviously this is a committee on ways and means and committee on energy and commerce issue
i would think that members would take that into consideration because these cover a broad spectrum of opinions on this and they universally agree that this is a bad amendment
mr chairman i reserve a point of order on the gentleman s amendment
accordingly the committee rose and the speaker pro tempore mr thornberry xz4004040 having assumed the chair mr putnam chairman of the committee of the whole house on the state of the union reported that that committee having had under consideration the bill hr 3010 making appropriations for the departments of labor health and human services and education and related agencies for the fiscal year ending september 30 2006 and for other purposes had directed him to report the bill back to the house with sundry amendments with the recommendation that the amendments be agreed to and that the bill as amended do pass
mr speaker i urge a nay vote on the motion to recommit
mr speaker pursuant to clause 1 of rule xxii and by direction of the committee on appropriations i move to take from the speaker s table the bill hr 3010 making appropriations for the departments of labor health and human services and education and related agencies for the fiscal year ending september 30 2006 and for other purposes with the senate amendment thereto disagree to the senate amendment and agree to the conference asked by the senate
mr speaker i reserve a point of order on the gentleman s motion
tom friedman the writer for the new york times in his book the world is flat points out that we will be enormously challenged as a nation in the years ahead by other countries that are spending a lot of money a lot of energy and a lot of human resources on education because they too recognize that the winner of the future will be determined by the way in which they can educate their people
i would hope all of my colleagues who are going to be voting on this bill in the next couple or 3 hours would take a look at what is in there and how important many of these programs are to the americans
there are 500 programs covered in this bill and each one of them in some way or another touches the quality of life of the people of this nation so that every american in one way or another as pointed out by the gentlewoman from california has a stake on this bill and what it does in their lives
and what we tried to do on a bipartisan basis in the subcommittee and we have a great group of members that serve on this subcommittee from both sides is to make those very difficult priority judgments on behalf of the american people
mr speaker pursuant to clause 1 of rule xxii and by direction of the committee on appropriations i move to take from the speaker s table the bill hr 3010 making appropriations for the departments of labor health and human services and education and related agencies for the fiscal year ending september 30 2006 and for other purposes with the senate amendment thereto disagree to the senate amendment and agree to the further conference asked by the senate
chairman regula and the staff of the subcommittee have been extremely patient with my many requests and chairman regula has been extremely generous within his tight budget allocation in trying to make progress on several important priorities of mine
representative frank wolf and i were joined by 44 of our colleagues in requesting the funds to carry out a multimedia campaign directed at parents and i am grateful to chairman regula who understands the terrible impact of underage drinking on our youth and the importance of an effective national media campaign to address it
based on this effort as well as the fortification of us grain products with folic acid the rate of neural tube defects has decreased by 26 percent over 7 years and the committee has continued to provide incremental increases to this important cdc program
my no vote on this bill should therefore in no way be seen as a lack of respect or lack of appreciation for ralph regula and his efforts on behalf of those who depend on the resources provided in this bill
however this bill more than any other appropriations bill we act on by providing the funds for health and education programs of importance to our constituents i goes to the heart of what we democrats in the house stand for and for what i stand for as a member of congress representing the people and communities of the 34th district of california
and if that patient can not prove their legal status because they do not happen to have the documentation on them that same doctor must make the choice not to provide care to this person or at least they must report them to immigration officials before providing lifesaving treatment
i urge my colleagues to vote no on the tancredo amendment
and it is on top of the we are on the cusp of a pension crisis in this country
these schools have in fact been funded for years and the only point that has not been made on this floor yet today i do not believe is that if the ruling is allowed to stand funding will be cut off in less than 30 days
it will be cut off in about 12 days on july 1 my colleagues can say what they will about the impact upon the school
i think we ought to focus upon the impact on students
in arizona schools begin the school year as early as august 1 my wife who is a teacher will be going back to school on august 1 parents need to plan where their children are going to go to school this fall and were this ruling to be allowed to stand it would mean children would have less than a month to try to find a new school
to do that to lowincome and specialneeds children to deprive those schools of the funding they need to provide that type of education and to do it on that short of notice is inappropriate
the ruling i think ought to be discussed on the merits and i think the congress should do that but we appreciate the opportunity to at least temporarily suspend its impact for the sake of the children in arizona who want to continue to be educated at these schools many of which are in lowincome areas and these moneys in particular go to lowincome needs
mr chairman as the gentleman knows he and i have discussed on several occasions now my interest in funding the nci national cancer institute for more money to expedite finding a cure for cancer or finding that cancer becomes a manageable disease
i realize picking up on what the gentleman from wisconsin mr obey xz4003000 has just said that this is a very tightly crafted bill but i would ask the gentleman as chairman and this is coming from one who has suffered from lung cancer that the gentleman find that money or look for the money in the conference so that we can increase the funding for nci so that we can expand those centers
it proposes to change existing law and therefore constitutes legislation on an appropriation bill in violation of house rules
i do this on behalf of the gentleman from virginia chairman tom davis of the committee on government reform
mr chairman i was regrettably delayed in my return to washington dc from an official visit to norfolk naval station virginia and was unable to be on the house floor for rollcall votes 308 to 314
had i been present i would have voted nay on rollcall 308 an amendment offered by representative price ga yea on rollcall 309 an amendment offered by representative miller ca nay on rollcall 310 an amendment offered by representative brown oh
mr speaker on rollcall no
573 on hr 3010 i was unavoidably detained
this bill grossly underfunds key domestic priorities in education health human services job training public broadcasting and the list goes on and on
it also goes on to freeze funding for afterschool programs even though only 38 percent of eligible programs can obtain funding at these levels
at the same time the bill wastes 115 million on unproven abstinence only education programs
on the human services front this bill fails to provide needed funds for child care
i m pleased that we passed an amendment on the house floor to eliminate that cut
i urge my colleagues to join with me in voting no on the wrongheaded priorities of the republican majority
this bill fails on all fronts
as chairman of the commerce trade amp consumer protection subcommittee i have held many hearings on data breaches and consumer data security and showed broad support for a comprehensive federal notification requirement to consumers for these security breaches
private health insurers do not rely on the ss no and neither should our nation s health provider for seniors and the disabled
the gao is wellpublished on the risk of using ss nos and the facility with which the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms could assign an alternate number
now 1 million dollars sounds like chump change up here to us but to americans voting back home and to the veterans who are on the streets and in despair it would pay for quite a lot
i can assure you they most certainly do lobby the congress because my amendment has been on the negative receiving end of this
it should nt the program on which it was modeled did nt according to americorps website it is based upon franklin d roosevelt s vision of the civilian conservation corps ccc in 1933 a program created by president roosevelt to provide relief for the unemployed during the great depression and to implement conservation projects
over 3 million young men served until the program disbanded eight years later when the united states entered world war ii sir america has relied on the contributions of selfless volunteers for centuries and the generosity of americans will endure without a federal program
we have had a number of debates already on this issue on the issue of how much money is in this bill and whether it is enough money to fund all of the worthy programs that are out there
i suggest to my colleagues there is a place we can easily go and get at least 1 billion out of this bill and use it for the other programs that have been so eloquently advocated on this floor
as a matter of fact on the final page of the payment determination form it says patients should be aware that the department of homeland security will not access or use information related to medical care to initiate enforcement of united states immigration laws unrelated to an ongoing terrorism or criminal investigation
does that not encourage even more people to come to the united states and obtain these services putting even more of a burden on these hospitals
on healthcare the bill takes a huge step backward in efforts to maintain basic health care services for the people in this country who are uninsured or underinsured
on the education front the republican majority has imposed the first freeze on education funding in a decade while requiring local school districts to implement federal mandates under the no child left behind act
mr chairman this amendment is designed to stop what is an ongoing scam in the college student loan program whereby a small handful of lenders are receiving a guaranteed 95 governmentpaid return on certain student loans
the gentleman from michigan mr kildee xz4002160 the gentleman from california mr george miller xz4002780 and i have offered legislation to address this issue but we should address this issue right here on the floor and right now
first of all it only lasted a year so we could come back this year to fix the problem but the other part of the problem was it left a big part of the loophole still in place what is called recycling so that the lenders can continue to receive this windfall of 95 percent guarantee on those loans
nobody who has been promised certain returns on their loans will lose the promises they have been made
mr chairman i have a very different view of this amendment and what it will do obviously than the chairman of the committee on education and the workforce
this will give the subcommittee on education of the committee on education and the workforce the opportunity to provide more funds to do what they have been saying all afternoon that they want to do
this is not going to have a negative impact on these nonprofit lenders
according to some estimates if we do not plug this hole we will cost the taxpayers 13 billion if we let it go on indefinitely
i know that we will be dealing with it in the committee on education and the workforce but in the budget that passed this house we did not deal with this issue
because if we adopt this amendment if the congress adopts this amendment it will immediately free up additional resources that we can spend as a nation on providing students with more loans and providing more grants
we will be holding an oversight hearing on tuesday at 9 am
at which time members of the veterans administration i believe we will also have people from defense health and possibly the office of management and budget will come up and give us the straight scoop on what actually happened and who knew what and when
that role is to offer policymakers the best available expertise on scientific matters
it would prohibit funding for any committee where members are chosen on the basis of political affiliation unless required by law
unfortunately the current administration has a terrible track record on this issue
a nationally recognized expert on substance abuse was asked if he had voted for president bush
a nobel prize winner was nominated for an important nih panel on international health
this is the only way our government will have the information it needs to make the best policies on behalf of the american people
our system of peer review is the envy of the world and for good reason it is based on science and it is immune from political interference
or research on psychological distress and marriage that can reduce domestic violence
elias zerhouni stated yesterday defunding meritorious grants on the floor of congress is unjustified scientific censorship
it undermines the historical strength of american science which is based on our world renowned apolitical and transparent peer review process
but instead of the promised income they were counting on to help cover their kid s college tuition their own health care or the mortgage payments on their houses they were left with a court ruling dumping their dreams into the pension guaranty benefit corporation pbgc which is significantly less than what they were counting on
i am assisting my family financially as my mother is in a nursing home in canada and my younger sister has been on welfare
on top of mr honda s discussion mr chairman according to the washington post the pentagon is now developing a comprehensive invasive recruiting database on highschool and college students who are age 16 or older
this is why i was curious when i saw that two nimh grants have been going on for years that do not focus on our most pressing mental health issues
now on its fifth year a second study has spent hundreds of thousands of taxpayer dollars to determine how the selfesteem of newlyweds affects their marriage
i urge my colleagues to support research on serious mental health issues by supporting the neugebauer amendment
the committee on appropriations was only able to provide 100 million for this program
mr speaker on rollcall no
it is also the principal funder of some of the most innovative and practical research going on today at the universities and colleges across the nation
they are making strides on identifying genes that cause specific cancers
and having established that this bill is a crucial bill for the health welfare education and prosperity of the american people i would ask my counterparts on the republican side of the aisle why on earth is it that no one has seen this conference report
why is it that as of this morning this very morning we are scheduled to consider and vote upon this legislation that no one in the house of representatives with exception of a very few in the republican leadership has even laid eyes on much less read or analyzed
because in the face of gross fiscal mismanagement on the part of this majority they want to pass a 56 billion tax cut for wealthy americans this coming week
the debate i urge my colleagues to have a debate not yet addressed by my friends on the other side of the aisle is really about shared sacrifice and about what the true priorities of the american people are
our priorities should be to make decisions based on shared sacrifice and a longterm view that seeks to fight for the least powerful among us
i chair the committee that has jurisdiction over the committee on foreign investment of the united states cfius and i plan to hold a hearing on this when we get back sometime in the very near future after the july fourth recess
mr speaker i appreciate the gentlewoman s courtesy in permitting me to speak on this bill
in fact the republican majority s energy bill according to the department of energy is going to increase our dependence on foreign imported oil by 75 percent
this resolution is completely beside the point on these critcial factors
we are going to have a 40minute debate tonight on this particular issue
in that 40 minutes on average over the last 4 12 years america will have borrowed 3 million from china
i do not want to pick on china
mr speaker i had hoped to come to the well to speak on a bipartisan resolution
this would be a major lever that would accumulate to the chinese communist government on top of the sovereign class missile cruisers that they have acquired on top of the mig fighter production that they have acquired on top of the other acquisitions of major us economic interests
i want to thank her first of all for focusing the house on this very important issue and as has been said before giving us an opportunity to affirmatively stand against an idea whose time has not come
on the shadow of celebrating the freedom day july 4 our day of independence it is a time now to stand up for investing in america
because we have not kept our eye on the prize and we have not reminded not only our individuals but our large corporate sector of investing in america
i think the warning signs that are going up from this house about the chinese government s interest in cornering the market on a strategic asset such as petroleum today is a dire warning indeed and one we should take heed of
it will become increasingly difficult for usbased companies to compete for scarce energy resoures on the world market against china s stateowned andor controlled energy companies
as you are aware the committee on foreign investment in the united states cfius was established to monitor the impact of foreign investment in the united states and to coordinate the implementation of us policy on foreign investment
in 1988 cfius was given additional authority under section 721 of the defense production act of 1950 the exonflorio amendment to authorize the president to conduct investigations to determine the impact of foreign acquisitions of us companies on national security
they are trying to trump our strategic edge over in afghanistan now because the unocal pipeline running through afghanistan has all that natural gas just ready to flow but it is right on the border of china
and so we ask ourselves what is going on here
what is going on here is america is losing her independence starting with petroleum
we do not have any more choice because we expect we will be 75 percent dependent on petroleum if this congress does not trump this president of the united states and produce a real energy bill that will put us on the road to true energy independence
meanwhile we sort of have to limp our way across the finish line on this july 4th celebration and admit america is losing her energy edge around the world
the house went on record earlier today in a strong bipartisan way to support that we would first of all make sure that cfius which is the committee on investments in the united states chaired by the secretary of the treasury snow that we go on record making sure that we not spend money at this time for a chinese company that is communistowned by the communist government to take over our ninth largest oil company
mr speaker how much time remains on each side
i believe it has been a good debate and we do support the amendment many of us on this side of the aisle although a couple who spoke do not support it
we call on cfius the committee on foreign investment in the united states secretary snowe and his 12member committee to look closely at what is before them to do the proper investigation and then not to recommend to the president that we go forward with this sale
and only a few years later the japanese sold it back to the united states for pennies on the dollar
briefly this resolution asks that the president initiate a thorough review of any potential takeover of unocal corporation by the chinese national offshore oil company as soon as any agreement of such a takeover is announced on the grounds that such a purchase could threaten the national security of the united states
mr speaker at a time of rising prices on global oil supplies ready access to energy resources is a vital element to our economic security
they borrow on the open nonsubsidized credit market or they would be able to offer a few billion dollars more in an instance like this
mr speaker i yield 2 minutes to the chairman of the committee on energy and commerce the gentleman from texas mr barton xz4000180
mr speaker i yield 1 minute to the gentleman from california mr hunter xz4001910 the chairman of the committee on armed services
mr speaker i yield 6 minutes to the gentleman from california mr pombo xz4003220 the chairman of the committee on resources
mr speaker on that i demand the yeas and nays
mr speaker a review of any unocal merger agreement with cnooc would be done by the committee on foreign investment in the united states known as cfius which was created pursuant to language inserted into the defense production act dpa nearly two decades ago
the dpa is solely in the jurisdiction of the committee on financial services because it seeks to identify stop or mitigate negative effects on the economy from our efforts to protect the nation s security
the uschina commission s 2004 report to congress indicated that china s strategy for securing oil supplies is still focused on owning the import oil at the production point
geopolitically this could soon bring the united states and chinese energy interests into conflict the united states in contrast has a free market strategy based on global market supply and pricing the same report indicates that china plans to expand its strategic reserve to fifty to fiftyfive days worth of oil imports by 2005 and sixtyeight to seventy days by 2010 so as today s washington post points out it makes perfect sense that a majorityowned chinese oil company seeks to acquire control of oil and gas production and reserves
as well mr speaker i urge swift convening of a conference committee on a comprehensive energy bill for the united states an adoption of the president s comprehensive energy program for the us and swift adoption of the conference report
if in the united states a private company does not have the right to be sold on the free market should we really be criticizing the lack of freedom in china
many conservatives who have decried the recent supreme court decision that severely undermines the principle of private property in the united states are now on the other side cheering this blatant congressional attempt to do something that may be even worse than kelo vs
it is based on energy
but what we are asking for in this resolution is for the president for the administration to convene the commission on foreign investment into the united states and investigate this possible sale to look at it and determine whether or not this is in the best economic and national security interests of the united states
that is the purpose of the commission on foreign investment
at a time like this when we are looking at international shortages on energy skyrocketing prices we need to do what we can to increase domestic supplies and to hold on to what we have got
but it also has the realistic view that in the short term we are dependent on fossil fuels which are oil gas and coal
the other part of it is looking at the future and how are we going to replace our dependence on current technology
mr speaker i rise in opposition to h res 344 which blames china for our dependence on foreign oil
mr speaker where were these patriotic republicans when the house passed an energy bill and could nt even muster the votes to raise fuel economy standards on automobiles
mr speaker i ask unanimous consent that all members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks on hr 741 the bill now under consideration
congress passed the osha law only after being assured that judicial review would be conducted by an autonomous independent commission which without regard to the secretary can find for or against the employer on the basis of individual complaints congress even separated the commission from the department of labor
congress intended there to be a truly independent review of disputes between osha and employers and when a dispute centers on osha s interpretation of its authority congress intended the independent review commission not the prosecuting agency osha to be the final arbiter
mr speaker having been an employer i realized early on that the greatest asset in my business were the people who work for me
to ensure that these individuals are safe and protected on the job osha and its state partners have approximately 2 100 inspectors including complaint discrimination investigators engineers physicians educators standards writers and other technical and support personnel spread over more than 200 offices throughout the country
we have all observed with awe the marvelous photos of construction workers sitting on ibeams swinging above some of our nation s major cities
high above new york city is one photo that comes to mind as we admire the skill and the daring of these americans who put their lives on the line every single day
well the worst construction accident in the history of the state of ohio occurred in our city on february 16 of last year
it occurred on a federal project a federal project that i had authorized and that has been being built now for several years
well on february 16 2004 these four men lost their lives
several others were seriously injured on this job
crushed to death on this job were ironworkers mike phillips age 42 arden clark age 47 mike moreau age 30 and robert lipinski jr age 44
so who was on site
who was not on site
i tried last month during the markup of the labor health and human services appropriations bill to include simple report language in that bill which is never denied to a member of this house merely asking the department of labor s occupational safety and health administration to gather all records relating to the inspections that should have been done on the job or lack thereof prior to the accident and to provide them to the public record as well as to provide any communications that have occurred with the us department of justice related to this accident
it was denied to me by the republican majority of this house by the republican majority of my committee and by the republican leader of the committee that is on the floor today
no word yet on their willingness to agree for a request for a hearing
osha s midwest office has ruled there was willful negligence on the job
i was up on that bridge last winter
i represent the saudi arabia of wind up there on lake erie
for 4 lost lives ohsha will impose a fine totalling 280 000 on a 300 millionplus project
who was investigating and who was inspecting on site
why did they sign an acceleration agreement with the company to make work on the project move even faster when the workers were a year and a half ahead of schedule
did osha not inspect nor require equal standards on a foreign made crane similar to one that is made in the united states of america
on whose hands does the blood of these men lie in this house
on whose hands does it lie
the state of ohio as the contractural agent for the federal government fell asleep on its oversight
i have appealed already to our committee on education and the workforce to hold hearings into this tragedy in ohio
it is my hope that in spite of the actions being taken today there might be some accountability some conscience out there that asks no that demands that this congress act on behalf of the mothers and the fathers and the wives and the children and every single person in our community that goes under that bridge every day or looks at that construction project all the people that still lay wreaths at the site they are numerous all the prayers all the offerings all the memories that are there forever
i want to say to my colleague from new york mr owens you have my strongest support on your bill
but those of you who care about union members think about them on these votes
i want to make my comments on this bill very briefly
i urge my colleagues to vote no on hr 741
between 5 000 and 6 000 american workers are killed on the job every year by willful and negligent safety violations on the part of errant employers
we should be considering a bill like hr 2004 the protecting america s workers act which i introduced on april 28 to coincide with workers memorial day a day set aside every year to honor workers killed on the job by safety violations
this committee the committee on education and the workforce has oversight over the work of the department of labor and osha
even by conservative estimates 15 workers in this country will be killed on the job today july 12
they will be killed due to serious safety lapses on the part of their employers
why are we wasting our time playing around with the adjustment of a commission when these workers deaths are still going on in america
and they go on in different parts of the country because we are not aware of the seriousness of the situation
the list goes on and on
we welcome this opportunity to get on the record from both the members of congress and the american people the fact that these things are continuing this steady rate of somewhere between 5 700 and 6 000 workers dying each year and it has been going on too long
patrick was buried alive on june 14 2002 working on a sewer pipe in a 10foot trench
unlike surviving relatives of other crime victims family members of workers killed on the job are left without any victim services or assistance under current law
we are often on this floor talking about the need to not be soft on crime to come with the hardest possible punishment as a deterrent
yet i know that there are many on the other side of the aisle who are absolutely allergic to what i am proposing here the prospect of holding accountable any employer whose willful or grossly negligent safety offenses kill workers
as i understand it senator enzi and i might differ on the maximum penalty for corporate manslaughter but we agree on the need to make this a felony offense
senators kennedy corzine and others introduced the protecting america s workers act on the senate side and they agree with setting the maximum penalty for corporate manslaughter at the 10year mark
mr speaker i want to commend the new york committee on the safety and health nycosh joined by cosh committees in other states for launching a national campaign against corporate killing
this is a serious business that ought to be on the floor today
although we have been making progress and making the american workplace safer in prior administrations that progress has stalled and we need to act immediately in a serious manner and stop the kinds of adjustments that are taking place in the bills that are on the floor today
mr speaker on that i demand the yeas and nays
i thank the gentleman from ohio for yielding me this time and i appreciate the leadership that he has presented to this congress on making america more competitive in the world economy
mr speaker this week congress embarks on an important agenda to make america more competitive in the global marketplace
i want to thank the gentleman from georgia for his vision and hard work on all these issues
these constituents told me osha was planning to fine builders for plastic cups on stairs and for workers failure to wear earplugs while operating a wet vac
while osha claimed these reports were exaggerated there is no way i can exaggerate the impact osha s hostility and excessive regulation can have on the stillrecovering wichita economy
the american political structure is based on a system of checks and balances federal and state the executive legislative and judicial branches
the secretary of labor should be the final authority on how osha law is interpreted and this bill undermines the secretary s authority
if the commission s authority on the interpretation of osha law trumps the secretary of labor what legal basis would the secretary have to appeal a decision with which heshe disagrees
if the administration was really interested in helping workers it would nt be focusing on these unnecessary semantics in the law
i am reminded of the newspaper correction column that column that is on page 5 or 6 or 10 or 12
they fail to file the paper on time or they have some other surprise or circumstance
on a casebycase basis osha is able to say there are special circumstances which justify missing the 15day deadline
what this bill does is to shift the burden of proof to osha to prove that the 15day deadline was somehow unreasonable instead of properly vesting the burden on the employer to show that there was an accident or a surprise that made them fail to hit the 15day deadline
on behalf of our profession i guess we have to express our appreciation
i think that the door should be wide open for people of all backgrounds and ability to serve on the commission provided they are qualified
it appears that the language would permit two members of the commission now it is expanded to five only two members of the commission to transact business on behalf of the commission
i know of institutions where a minority can veto a decision bit i am not familiar with a situation where two members out of five could in fact act on behalf of the commission
the first is the result when osha is right when they win on every question
the third kind of case osha brings is one where osha loses on all counts but the claim was not unreasonable where they made a judgment call and they thought they were right but the adjudicator the court the decisionmaker made a different decision
now our friends on the other side say well this has been rarely invoked
and they draw from that the conclusion mr speaker that there must be many many cases where osha has done something arbitrary or unreasonable but not been called on it not been caught at it
i am glad that the securities and exchange commission is not going to be held to this standard because if every time someone on wall street were accused of stock fraud the sec had to say well are we sure we are going to win before we bring this case the cases of stock fraud that we have seen would be far more rampant than we have seen in recent years
if it does so on a consistent basis we should change the law
i would urge both sides to cast a no vote on this bill
republicans need to stop confusing people on the reason why jobs are leaving the mainstream and are being sent to mainland china
that is american jobs that we could put on working families
republicans need to stop confusing people on the reasons why jobs are leaving main street and being sent to mainland china
mr speaker i rise today in support of all four of the osha reforms bills on the floor
their reward in this bill comes at the expense of hardworking employees who depend on osha to keep an eye on their working conditions
it is yet one more corporate handout that could have been better spent on job training reversing the tide of outsourcing or raising the minimum wage
if osha already has the authority to review missed deadlines on a casebycase basis why would we need a bill that changes this process in a onesided way that could further disadvantage workers encourage litigation and undermine health and safety protections
madam speaker i ask unanimous consent that all members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks on hr 739 the bill now under consideration
this decade of progress on regulatory reform should give every american confidence that congress is making positive steps every year to improve government accountability
the first bill on tap today the occupational safety and health small business day in court act gives the occupational safety and health review commission additional flexibility to make exceptions to the arbitrary 15day deadline for employers to file responses to osha citations when a small business misses the deadline by a mistake or for good reason
this bill essentially codifies administrative action taken by the labor department last year and ensures appropriate disputes are resolved based on merit rather than legal technicalities
madam speaker i yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from georgia mr norwood xz4002960 the chairman of the subcommittee on workforce protections
now some of my colleagues on the other side have suggested well no they already have this authority
the ability of the commission to waive a deadline on a casebycase basis when circumstances warrant it have been drawn into increased legal uncertainty by the recent decision of the us circuit court of appeals for the second circuit in chao v lefrois builder incorporated and indeed as recently as 2003 osha has argued that oshrc does not have the authority to apply this rule
mr speaker on that i demand the yeas and nays
mr speaker i ask unanimous consent that all members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks on hr 740
lastly the bill permits incumbent members whose terms have expired to stay on until a replacement can be confirmed by the senate and most vacancies occur during these turnovers
mr speaker i ask unanimous consent that all members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks on hr 742
in 2004 osha cited 86 708 violations based on its nearly 40 000 workplace inspections
we heard testimony in our committee on this issue and what we found is that the law s substantially justified and special circumstances standards have made it easy for osha to deny small businesses the ability to recover attorneys fees
what these numbers tell us is that small businesses can already see the writing on the wall
the focus is on improving workplace safety
well there is no way we can compete with other countries with these burdensome rules and regulations like osha puts on our small businessmen and women in this country who create most of the jobs
none of them will be on the injury site log because the law does nt require them to list contract workers
there is no reason the republican leadership could nt allow at least some discussion on the reporting issue today
mr speaker as a former small businessman i rise today in support of hr 742 and republican efforts to reduce the regulatory burden on small businesses the job engine in this country
these are the folks who alleged that some workers face death or serious physical harm from lifting the top of a sandwich cookie from one assembly line and putting it on the bottom of the cookie on another
the commission already has the ability to review specific cases of missed deadlines in a manner that protects the lt center gt lt pre gt page h5685 lt pre gt lt center gt it is clear that hr 739 is designed to ease the burden on employers at the expense of the health and safety of workers
a us construction worker is 4 times more likely to be killed on the job than one in denmark
many responsible employers are tired of continually being underbid by unscrupulous and reckless operators that refuse to spend anything on protecting workers lives or promoting public safety
we must remember that workers killed on the job are someone s son or daughter husband or wife andor father or mother
i am a cosponsor of all four of these bills on the floor today and i believe they will improve the workplace safety level the playing field for small business and ensure that employers and employees are treated fairly
as chairman of the subcommittee on employeremployee relations i have seen these bills through the committee and the full house in the past and i look forward to their passing again today
again i applaud my colleague from georgia for his hard work on behalf of american small business owners and their employees
mr speaker i thank the gentleman for yielding me time and for his tremendous leadership on this issue
the gentleman from georgia mr norwood xz4002960 mentioned earlier that we have heard language today that ranged on a wide variety of subjects and i am not sure at all that they were talking about the issue before us today
i have listened to language today earlier this afternoon on these four bills that talked about us losing millions of jobs to china and elsewhere
the latest numbers from the bureau of labor statistics show a rise in deaths of american workers on the job
in 2002 5 524 workers were killed due to injuries on the job
let us remember what osha is osha is the federal cop on the workplace safety beat
the fundamental question that faces this house here is do workers have rights to fair compensation when they are hurt on the job
we should not give up on workplace safety because of some odd notion that osha should pay if it brings a proceeding that is not upheld in a higher jurisdiction
we as members of this house will pay a price if we fail to uphold workers rights if we fail to uphold the rights of a safe workplace if we fail to uphold the right to fair compensation if someone is injured on the job if we fail in our moral obligation to assure that corporations have a responsibility to their workers
mr speaker i thank the gentleman for yielding me this time and i thank him so much for his service to this committee and for his constant support of workers rights workers health and safety and the protection of their families if they are injured on the job
every day 15 workers are killed on the job
hundreds of thousands of workers face serious injuries on the job every year
on march 23 of this year a huge explosion at the bp amoco texas city refinery killed 15 workers and injured 170 others
rather than taking decisive action on behalf of hardworking employees like increasing the minimum wage stopping runaway pension terminations or expanding access to health care these bills do nothing more than jeopardize the health and safety protections of employees on the job
the commission already has the authority to review any missed deadlines on a casebycase basis in a manner that protects both employers and workers
on december 13 2004 the solicitor of labor issued a memorandum to regional solicitors announcing a change in the department s legal interpretation
moreover the previous interpretation had a disproportionate impact on small businesses in that these entities are more likely than larger companies to file untimely notices of contest
our new position avoids further needless and often futile litigation on an issue that is collateral to osha s primary safety and health mission
in this way we can focus our limited resources on protecting worker safety and health rather than on litigating a collateral procedural issue
no attorney in the office of the solicitor shall argue on behalf of the secretary that the commission lacks the authority to apply rule 60 b s excusable neglect standard to consider late notices of contest
where appropriate sol attorneys shall protect the department s interests by opposing late notices of contests on the grounds that the employer has not established excusable neglect for the late filing
last year the house approved this measure with bipartisan support of 251177 and i again urge my colleagues to vote yes on this measure
why beat up on small businesses
i know he is really busy today and had to go no on all four bills but maybe i can refocus us just a little bit and explain that we are on one bill right now and it is a very simple bill
maybe we can concentrate just on this bill now for this hour and understand that this is a badlyneeded change in osha unless you do not believe osha ought to work unless you do not believe that the osha commission should be in place
the bill changes the quorum requirements from two members to three members and allows the president to consider legal training in addition to education and experience as criteria in selecting an individual to serve on the board
i believe it is important to prevent the commission from being stalled and unable to rule on cases when there is a gap in appointees
my colleagues on the other side have been very critical of the inclusion of legal training as a qualification for commissioners criticism that i can not understand
the simple fact of the matter is this when the commission is unable to rule on cases resolution does not occur in a timely manner
and i will say if you live in a district where there are no small businesses in that district then i would vote no on this
but we do think some legalese is advisable on the commission
mr speaker how much time do we have left on each side
i do wish my friend the gentleman from new york mr owens xz4003060 would get the aflcio to send him talking points just on this bill
you take it on yourself to tell us what the majority party wants
i know about this kind of thing going on in my area all of the time
witnesses before the committee on education and the workforce have described the economic calculus small businesses make where settling osha cases is concerned
i know it has been hard to tell what we have been talking about today because there has been so much superfluous conversation going on not concerning these four bills
mr speaker i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from texas mr hensarling xz4001750 and just say we still are on hr 742
it has been a long 4 hours on four bills
we stayed on the subject for about 2 hours
number one there is nobody on our committee including myself any of us who made these bills that believe for one minute any of these bills are going to harm the workplace safety or health factor
mr speaker i yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from ohio mr boehner xz4000360 chairman of the committee on education and the workforce
we have had several sets of hearings and markups on these four bills and one would think they are very important
i understand each of the four bills amending the occupational safety and health act now on the floor will be considered individually and i would therefore save my comments on the specifics of the other three bills until the appropriate time
an article published in the april 10 issue of parade magazine assessed our national priorities based on 2005 dollar allocations for government programs
the osha bills being voted on today will only serve to exacerbate this huge divide between federal investments in business versus safety
this bill would reimburse firms that are repeat safety offenders for attorneys fees whenever osha citations are downgraded on a technicality during administrative or court proceedings
the american people are serious about seeing tougher laws enacted to improve safety on the job and their concerns are well founded
sponsored by the new york committee on safety and health this report recommended more vigorous osha enforcement and the hiring of more osha inspection officers among other remedies
if we have the money for 41 new auditors to audit the petty cash records of labor unions surely we ought to be able to find the money to hire more inspectors and have those inspectors be inspectors not on a voluntary compliance basis but on a serious basis to save lives and injuries
i urge my colleagues to join me in voting no on these bills
hr 742 will have a chilling effect on both osha enforcement and osha standard setting
similarly unless osha is certain that a standard will not be challenged which they are routinely for any number of reasons it would not dare begin the rulemaking process on any hazard no matter how grave the threat of the hazard to workers
occupational safety and health review commission efficiency act the bill requires that the number of members on the commission be increased from three to five and that all members must be attorneys
it also seeks to allow members whose terms have expired to continue serving on the commission for an additional 365 days in cases where no successor has been confirmed by the senate
allowing members whose terms have expired to continue serving on the commission for an additional 365 days unless a new appointee is confirmed by the senate may mean a sitting member could have a de facto seven year term dending on the political makeup of the senate and white house
the current requirement that a member step down at the expiration of his or her term is appropriate and maintains pressure on all parties to work together to select a qualified person for the commission
dear representative on behalf of the more than 14 million members of the international brotherhood of teamsters i am writing to express our strong opposition to four bills that would amend the occupational safety and health act hr 739 hr 740 hr 741 and hr 742
osha would not dare or be extremely reluctant at best to begin a rulemaking on any hazard no matter how serious
hr 741 the occupational safety and health independent review of osha citations act would we believe turn the osh act on its ear by giving deference to the commission
hr 742 the occupational safety and health small employer access to justice act would require taxpayers to pay the legal costs of employers with 100 or fewer employees and worth up to 7 million who win administrative or enforcement cases brought by osha or any challenge to an osha standard regardless of whether osha s actions were substantially justified the uaw is deeply concerned that this legislation would have a tremendous chilling effort on the ability of osha to enforce workplace health and safety protections
during the time a case is on appeal to oshrc employers do not have to pay any assessed penalties nor do they have to abate the violations for which they were cited
dear representative on behalf of the 14 million members of the american federation of state county and municipal employees afscme i am writing to urge you to reject hr 739 hr 740 hr 741 and hr 742
hr 739 specifically creates a legal loophole for bypassing the obligation on an employer s part to meet a 15day deadline for contesting osha citations
given that the osha commission already has the authority to review any missed deadlines on a casebycase basis such litigation is completely unnecessary
at present the osha commission relies on its longstanding practice of reviewing on a casebycase basis any missed deadlines
yet a trench box designed to protect workers had been left on higher ground and more than 100 feet away from the site
as jeffrey walters of cincinnati ohio testified before me last year his only son patrick died in a cavein on june 14 2002 only weeks after osha cited the firm patrick worked for which is moeves plumbing for willful trenching violations
i urge my colleagues to vote no on this bill again
i think we need more light thrown on this subject and for that reason we have prepared some information for each member of the committee by district and they can get familiar with the problem in their district with this information that we have compiled
yet there is a tremendous amount of construction going on and if we go around the construction sites we will find that the workers doing the manual labor unskilled labor are immigrants and in many cases there are tremendous accidents and these people are shuffled off and frightened and intimidated to the point where they never even report it
now personally i know and i have related on this floor the total accidents that have taken place since then in new york city
those in power are insensitive to the needs of those who are out there working on the front lines whether it is in domestic service or in dangerous jobs like construction trucking and a number of chemical plants
just as the soldiers on the front lines in iraq afghanistan or anywhere else always deserve the best that we can give them
every soldier is automatically a hero when he goes out to fight for his country because for every one who goes out to fight there are a few hundred thousand left behind who will what we have found in this present war in iraq is that people on the top with their classconscious sentiments at work did not provide at first the kind of protection that should have been provided to the soldiers on the front lines out there
we find it very unusual that the majority party with great emphasis on saving dollars on education and a number of much needed programs wants to waste a little money on two additional members create a little bit more of a bureaucracy by having two more members to make a decision
last but not least i find it quite ironic also that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle want to tack on the requirement that the commission members have legal training
we happen to know there is a great push on to drive the unions into the ground with trivial audits financial audits mostly of petty cash the receipts for cab fare and receipts for lunch
on february 24 osha issued a list of 14 200 us facilities that had accident and illness rates at twice the national average
walmart stores the nation s largest retailer had the largest single number of georgia facilities on the list 11
of the companies based in georgia united parcel service had the most facilities on the list with 174 nationwide
in addition to the safety violations that contributed to that explosion osha cited the company for allowing employees to work at heights of up to 50 feet without fall protection and for requiring employees to stand on a conveyor belt to remove jammed logs without adequate protection against being caught in a machine
the pattern goes on and on
they can continue as i pointed out pay workers the lowest possible wages and they can also not spend any money on guaranteeing worker safety
so given the fact that we are on the floor for the second time in 2 years with these four bills it is an opportunity for us to educate our colleagues as to the seriousness of the current situation in the american workplace today
and the attack on osha which is consistent the harassment of osha the downgrading of osha the chipaway erosive effect of osha is all part of that pattern
a department of labor which declares it has no money to really have an osha that functions appropriately is the department of labor which has managed to spend a great deal of money on the faithbased initiative
it was on the front page of the new york times
so i want to just conclude with another section from the report of the aflcio their annual report on worker safety
on average 15 workers were fatally injured and more than 12 000 workers were injured or made ill each day of 2003
the occupations of greatest risk of workrelated fatalities based on the number of fatalities per 100 000 employed were logging workers
mr speaker on that i demand the yeas and nays
under this bill osha will find itself paying the attorneys fees of repeated safety violators whose penalties were reduced on a technicality
even after a city worker issued a stopwork order eric ho secretly had the workers stay on the job
osha s inspectors will be forced to perform many mental gymnastics trying to predict whether a citation no matter how justified might have the slightest chance of being adjusted or overturned on a technicality in review proceedings
they will be required to predict any and all possible scenarios in which a specific citation might be reversed on a technicality
mr speaker there are members on the other side of the aisle who would have us believe that every osha inspector is like police inspector javert in victor hugo s famous novel les miserables these members compare every business owner to hugo s noble character jean valjean hounded by osha s javertian inspector for having innocently slipped up on one point one miniscule point of an obscure and archaic osha safety rule
in reality we do not have to turn to 19th century novels to enlighten us on workplace safety conditions in this country
we need merely turn to the last year s astounding new york times investigative series on worker deaths by david barstow
reporter barstow reminded us all that someone harassing a wild burro on federal lands in 2004 would get a stiffer penalty that is up to a year in prison than an unscrupulous employer whose willful safety violations resulted in the death of a worker
rather it is because a provision in the omnibus appropriations act enacted at the end of the 108th congress repealed the protection of wild burros and horses on federal lands
mr speaker i yield myself the balance of my time and would like to point out that despite the rhetoric of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle and we did hear again the last speaker mention the fact that one of the reasons we are attacking osha is because employers feel they can not compete with these regulations
as a matter of fact that is the definition used on annual congressional appropriation riders which exempt firms of 20 or fewer workers from scheduled osha inspections 20 or fewer workers not 100 as this bill treats
again osha inspectors in reality are hardly like the draconian police inspector javert from the famous novel les miserable it is important mr speaker to realize that there is a need for both parties to come together and for the republican majority to yield on its strategy to destroy labor unions
they are likely to insist on their rights
but if you allow capitalism to go to extremes it tramples on the rights of workers
it tramples on the rights of consumers
twothirds of our economy is dependent on what people buy
they find it so profitable to take the product the production the manufacturing to china and bring back the products to capitalize on the sales here
we started this discussion about minimum wage and we are going to end it on minimum wage
that is class hatred to stamp on those at the very bottom and refuse to use the authority invested in us by the american people
working families are going to determine that we do not have domestic terrorism spreading in america because working families are going to save america by rising up to throw out people who insist on stamping on them and have contempt for them
mr speaker in closing i urge a no vote on all four of these bills today
mr speaker on that i demand the yeas and nays
if a worker gets injured on the job their insurance rates go up there is loss of productivity and quite often small employers especially hire family members
the last thing they would want to do is to go to the next family reunion and explain why their brotherinlaw or their sister or some member of their family was injured on the job
however osha regulations placed upon our small businesses continue to be among the most complex and difficult legal mandates imposed on employers
as a member of the committee on education and the workforce and cosponsor of the four bills today i have been honored to work with chairman boehner and the gentleman from georgia mr norwood xz4002960
you can not put a price tag on life madam speaker and you can not put a price tag on serious injury
grieving families across america depend on osha to stand up for them and for their deceased and injured loved ones
what does it matter to the worker the size of the business or how many members sit on a commission
they have enough angst because they ca nt count on their employers to provide protection
putting this unique burden on osha may take away the only recourse employees have to stand up for their safety
the list goes on and on
if my colleagues on the other side of the aisle really wanted to help workers they would increase penalties for employers that ignore safety regulations
they would protect companys from dumping their pensions on to the taxpayers and raise minimum wage
mr speaker i urge my colleagues to join me in opposing hr 742 which is an unnecessary attack on worker protections
madam speaker i appreciate the opportunity to talk on this bill
i want to commend the chairman for his work in this area and commend the gentleman from georgia mr norwood xz4002960 who has labored long and hard on these issues
no one is putting a price tag on life
no one is putting a price tag on life here and no one is interested in giving employers a pass
the mission today as described by osha on their web site is to ensure the safety and health of america s workers by setting and enforcing standards
we have got to get that on the table as often as possible
mr speaker i have come down on these four bills and i have come for a variety of reasons but one main reason is to make those corrections that are so necessary with the arguments on the other side
madam speaker i want to thank the gentleman from ohio mr boehner xz4000360 for his leadership in the committee on education and the workforce and the fact that he has been able to pass reasonable legislation that not only helps the employee but the employer and gives us a better business atmosphere in this country
they can not employ fulltime osha compliance officers and most owners are not going to be experts on the fine print of federal regulations
madam speaker i am proud to support and cosponsor all four of these important pieces of legislation on osha reform
according to a study discussed in the office of management and budget s draft report to congress on the costs and benefits of federal regulations for 2005 it is estimated that the quote total cost of federal regulation environmental workplace economic and tax compliance regulation was 60 percent greater per employee for firms with under 20 employees compared to firms with over 500 employees
we are certainly not advocating that every small business be given a pass on this deadline to respond to a citation but let us be reasonable here and give them the benefit of the doubt by instilling just a little bit more flexibility into these regulations
these are the burdensome mandates that we hear talked about on the floor
republican and democratic governors have looked at this bill and said laws that they have passed that many of our friends on the majority amendments that would have addressed these issues that would have let us discuss these issues on this floor were prohibited by the rule that we are debating right now
there is a point of agreement that the consequences of that price increase is a tremendous burden on small business and a high likelihood that more people will be uninsured
when the premiums go up on the rest of those in the pool fewer of them will be insured
mr speaker i yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from new york ms velzquez a person with whom i share an important goal but have a disagreement on means
i urge our colleagues on both sides of the aisle to protect the benefits that our constituents earned and deserve and to prevent the increase in the number of uninsured and the increase in health insurance benefit premiums and vote no on this bill
my friend the gentleman from wisconsin mr obey xz4003000 often refers to speeches on the floor as posing for holy pictures and i think that is what is going on here today where everyone is embracing the small businessman or small businesswoman and saying how much we love them and care about them and i am sure everyone does
but i think what matters is the impact of these various proposals what the proposals would have on the small business person
vote yes on the kindandrews substitute
mr speaker on that i demand the yeas and nays
mr speaker by direction of the committee on rules i call up house resolution 379 and ask for its immediate consideration
this resolution provides for a structured rule and provides for 1 hour of debate equally divided between the chairman and ranking minority member of committee on education and the workforce waives all points of order against consideration of the bill and makes in order an amendment in the nature of a substitute offered by the minority
amendments not made in order were offered and discussed by the committee so it is appropriate i think not to duplicate that committee action here on the floor
to the chagrin of some of my friends on both sides of the aisle it does not move our country in the direction of government control and taxpayerfunded universal health care
we can take one direction which would be to have greater government control especially on the federal level which ultimately would lead to a singlepayer federal program where decisions right or wrong would be made here
regardless of how one votes on this issue in the past or in the future this is a fair rule
mr speaker i am pleased to yield 3 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from ohio mr boehner xz4000360 the chairman of the committee on education and the workforce
i must admit that much of the opposition gloomanddoom predictions are based on assumptions of what people and companies will choose to do and therefore the government should make those mandates
i am pleased that this particular piece of legislation is based on the assumption that people have the ability to make good choices for themselves without the assistance of the heavy hand of government
i appreciate those who have spoken on the bill today
and i appreciate the gentlewoman from california and her wonderful and kind way in which she handled the rule on the minority side
with the debate we have had in previous years every element of this bill has been thoroughly debated both on the floor and in committee this year as well as in years past
i was reading on the airplane coming back yesterday of a story of senator bunning when he was a pitcher for the detroit tigers and he was facing the yankees
by this time the pitcher is upset with what is going on and takes a couple of steps to turley and says next time you whistle i m going to drill the batter he takes a couple of steps to the batter and tells him the same thing
once again fastball the whistle comes yogi does not take it but then remembering what happened he steps out of the batter s box cups his hands and yells back at senator bunning who is the pitcher at this time and says he may be whistling but i ai nt listening mr speaker there are a lot of people who have been whistling at us on this particular issue
but my nextdoor neighbor who is trying to make a living in a shop down on main street that does not have insurance could under the provisions of this bill
mr speaker i urge support of the rule on the underlying bill hr 525
mr speaker i yield back the balance of my time and i move the previous question on the resolution
a motion to reconsider was laid on the table
the bill we will consider on the floor later today responds directly to their needs
last year the house passed this measure on a bipartisan basis with the support of 37 of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle
unfortunately the other body has yet to act on this bill
senator enzi who chairs the senate committee on health education labor and pensions has expressed a strong interest in working on this proposal and i am more optimistic than ever that the senate will address this problem
mr speaker i ask unanimous consent that all members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks on hr 525
clearly we need to focus on providing affordable health care to the uninsured as well as ensure employers who provide health benefits to their employees are not forced to drop their coverage because of rising premiums and high administrative costs
mr speaker i yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from texas mr sam johnson chairman of the subcommittee on employeremployee relations
mr speaker i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from georgia mr norwood xz4002960 the chairman of the subcommittee on workforce protections
so what we have been proposing now for some 10 years and the house has passed this on a bipartisan basis at least five times is to allow businesses and selfemployed individuals who belong to bona fide organizations to group together for the purposes of health insurance
as i said before this bill has passed the house on a number of occasions with broad bipartisan support and i expect that will occur again today
mr speaker i thank my colleague for yielding me this time to speak on the substitute that has been offered
one of the most damaging parts though is that each employer who would take part in this plan that is being offered would still be subjected to the state mandates on health insurance in their particular state
mr speaker i thank my friend and colleague on the committee on rules the gentleman from utah mr bishop xz4000291 for yielding me this time and i rise today in support of the rule and the underlying legislation the small business health fairness act
this house has acted on four separate occasions in a bipartisan way to pass reforms that will allow small business owners to provide their employees with affordable health insurance options yet our efforts to help reduce the ranks of the uninsured has not gone forward
however the association health plan ahp legislation we are considering on the house floor today is not a viable solution
this bill would be devastating on a national level as well
now let my friends on the other side understand i am not against ahps
so when you are talking about unleashing the free market to work for the individual the federal employee health benefitstype plan and this would not infringe on federal employees benefits but it would set up a parallel organization that small businesses could benefit from the opportunities for the small businesses of america are magnificent under this approach
men and women of goodwill on both sides of the aisle know that this sort of approach works it lowers the sales load it increases the risk pool to the maximum size which you need for lower group rates
by completely overturning all state regulation as ahps would do that is a truly radical approach and while my friends on the other side may be radicals in this regard i think they are going further than they realize
mr speaker i rise today to urge a no vote on hr 525 and a yes vote on the kindandrews substitute
so i ask our friends on the other side of the aisle why do we have before us a bill that does nothing to really address the problem for small businesses and very well may end up hurting the people who we say we are trying to help
if we pass the substitute we can make a true impact on the status of millions of uninsured workers across this country and for that reason i urge a no vote on hr 525 and a yes vote on the substitute
mr speaker the house will convene on monday at 12 30 pm
any votes called on these measures will be rolled until 6 30 pm
on tuesday and the balance of the week the house will consider additional legislation under suspension of the rules as well as several measures under a rule hr 525 the small business health fairness act of 2005 hr 5 the health act of 2005 and hr 22 the postal accountability and enhancement act
there is no way that we can tell what hour of the day on friday that we might be finished with our work
for now i would note that our plan is to consider both postal reform and small business health plans on tuesday and after that we will have to see where various components are and how they come together
yes we plan to present the postal reform bill on tuesday
we think we can do both that and the small business health plan on tuesday
if the gentleman will continue to yield we would have to go to conference on those three bills for sure and depending on the progress of the other body we may be going to conference on others
there are still discussions going on about that bill and until those discussions are concluded we can not predict when it will come to the floor
it is possible it could be added to the calendar but looking at how busy a week we have next week and the controversial issues that we will be bringing to the floor of the house it is hard to say if we could put that bill on the floor next week
i serve on the conference committee so i am very encouraged by the accomplishments and progress that has been made over the course of this week
the expiration date is set on wednesday
we are working on it
this is another item that the house and senate are working on through the weekend and at least encouragement has been brought to my attention by the chairman of the committee on energy and commerce that with a lot of hard work it is very possible that we could get this energy conference report to the members for a vote by the end of next week
the senate is working on appropriations bills and we will be doing those conferences as they present themselves
also we do know that at least the first week back we could be looking at the coast guard authorization bill and possibly a research bill from the committee on science
the campaign finance committees are still working on those issues
the way that i am watching the schedule of the other body we will probably be here at least a week or two after october 1 and we would be working on those issues
i have every expectation that the committee on ways and means will put out a retirement security bill for us to consider in september or the first of october
these mandates just go and on and you have got them in all 50 states
i commend it to my colleagues on both sides of the aisle
by taking away these vital patient protections the policies purchased under ahps would be worth little more than the paper they are printed on
the coverage and benefit mandates enacted by state legislatures ensure that small businesses wo nt fall victim to sham policies and that their employees can depend on quality health insurance when an illness strikes
hr 525 would allow the creation of association health plans to help alleviate the enormous health care burden on america s small businesses
at the origin of our problem we are the only major country where your health care coverage depends on who you work for
the only restriction on premiums is that differences could not be based on health status
this provision is essentially meaningless because it permits ahps to accomplish the same goal by varying premiums based on age sex race national origin or any other factor in the employers workforce including claims experience
as a nation we have recognized and are committed to eliminating health disparities based on race ethnicity and national origin
realizing that next week is a busy week and there are a number of very important items on the agenda how likely mr leader do you think it is that we will be in on friday
might it be possible with some assurance to let the members know when the cafta bill will be on the floor in effect adopting a similar procedure
would it be fair however mr leader to say that it would not be considered on the last day we are here on friday or not so that we could make sure that members knew and had some degree of confidence because it is such an important piece of legislation that it would not be considered on the last day we are here
are we likely to have motions to go to conference on appropriations bills next week and if so can you anticipate what bills that might be
those conferences would be on the floor is that what the gentleman is saying possibly
in terms of motions to go to conference do you anticipate motions to go to conference on any appropriations bills next week
on the bill of the gentleman from arizona mr shadegg xz4003680 i think it is hr 2355 dealing with the insurance issues there is a lot of interest on our side of the aisle
reclaiming my time mr leader i take it that in light of the fact you have not mentioned it at this point in time it is not on the schedule
but there is a lot of discussion on this side of the aisle about that bill
because there is so much interest in that bill on our side mr leader would it be fair to say that that decision would be made prior to the close of business on monday so that we would have some notice of that in time to fairly consider it
the other bills that i would like to talk about the highway bill conference report the gentleman indicated as a possibility can the gentleman inform us of the status of that conference and where we are on this bill
we are certainly hopeful on our side and i know the gentleman is on his side that we get this bill through
in light of the fact we will not have a colloquy next week because we will be going on recess for the summer work period can the gentleman tell us what he anticipates might be on the agenda when we come back on september 6 what might be on the agenda early in the september weeks
clearly appropriations bills conference reports to the extent they are done will be on the calendar but other than that can the gentleman enlighten us as to what your thoughts are
can the gentleman give me his thoughts on where they stand and when they might come on the agenda if in fact they will be coming on the agenda
premium contribution rates for any particular small employer can not be based on the health status or claims experience of plan participants or beneficiaries or on the type of business or industry in which the employer is engaged
ahps are expected to save small business owners and their employees as much as 30 percent on their health insurance
i urge a yes vote on this rule
mr speaker we have heard it over and over again today on the floor
let us vote yes on hr 525
it will impose new mandates on employers and saddle the american public with yet another government program to fund
and on top of that the substitute would force small businesses to deal with a host of new mandates
the committee on education and the workforce and the department of labor through our oversight of erisa have jurisdiction over employersponsored health care
however the way to do that is to build on the success of the current system by utilizing the strengths that enable large employers and unions to offer cadillac health plans
i had the happy privilege of flying down to orlando florida with president bush on air force one on march 18 of this year
it called for the passage of association health plans fixing the death tax and cracking down on frivolous lawsuits
this house is on record as supporting that
vote yes on the rule and vote yes on hr 525
facts are insurance ratings are really dependent on the notion that some people are higher risk than others
they love to insure them because if they have low risk every dollar that they pay in terms of premium is another dollar down on their bottom line of profit
my friends from across the aisle would like the american people to believe that association health plans are the only available option to relieve the burden of increased health care costs on small business owners
my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are right about one thing small business owners are facing a crisis
the reason i rise in opposition is because this is such an important issue that we really should have an open and fair and reasonable debate on the floor of the house of representatives
instead we have a closed rule that will allow some time for general debate on the ahp underlying bill an hour on the substitute and that is it
you would think that alone would be enough for a no vote on this underlying bill
mr speaker i ask my colleagues to defeat the rule so we have an honest debate and support the substitute and vote no on the underlying bill
mr speaker i want to commend my friend and colleague the gentleman from new jersey mr andrews xz4000080 for the leadership he has shown on this issue
more and more small businesses are realizing that despite the bumper sticker pitch in its favor ahps are simply put bad public policy they go on to cite the mercer study saying that premiums for those outside the ahp market would increase an additional 23 percent and an additional 1 million people would become uninsured as this policy plays out they go on to state that the minimal price savings realized by some businesses through ahps would come from attracting healthier participants and depleting benefits that are currently required by states
but mr speaker houston we have got a problem right here on earth today and that problem we all can agree to is the rising cost of health care the impact that it is having on businesses large and small family farmers individual employees
but today the gentleman from new jersey mr andrews xz4000080 and i are offering the right way an alternative way another approach to dealing with the health care crisis that our small businesses are facing one that we believe would extend health care coverage to millions of americans while keeping a lid on the rising premium costs
mr speaker it is one of the more amazing aspects of this debate that the party that claims to be for states rights and tries to take political advantage of saying listen states we stand for you and what you decide to do on a policy level is so quick to jettison states rights when it becomes politically inconvenient for their political allies and that is exactly what is going on here today with the proposed associated health plans which will preempt and trump the public policy decisions that have been made throughout this country by state legislatures
but what is also different with our substitute is it actually offers premium support payments to make it more affordable to small businesses to offer health care coverage to their employees something that the underlying ahp plan is silent on
again an analysis of our bill would show that it would actually increase the coverage of the uninsured help premium prices come down by building on this purchasingpool concept but also maintaining important and safe consumer protections
mr speaker i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from maryland mr cardin xz4000640 a person who has built up considerable health care expertise from his position on the committee on ways and means
we are waiting to get a cost estimate back but based on two previous debates on this issue it was comparable to the amount of money set aside for the health savings account that has been a part of this bill in the past but is not this year
mr speaker i think there is wide agreement bipartisan agreement that we have got a serious issue on our hands a huge challenge that is facing our nation that is rising health care costs and the impact it is having on economic growth the opportunities for businesses large and small to grow and hire additional workers
it is something that we must address in order to deal with an expanding economy at a rate that we would all like to see but also to get a grip on the stagnant wages right now that are holding so many of our workers back
that is why again we have had an important debate today but it is one we should be working on in a bipartisan fashion to address the underlying causes
that is why so many of the governors and so many of the attorneys general and the commissioners of insurance the association of state legislatures in a bipartisan fashion have roundly criticized and condemned the underlying associated health plan because they feel as we do on this side that it will do more harm than good
i understand and appreciate the motivation on the other side to try to move forward on this issue
one of the issues that really has not received that much attention and i would just like to close on and highlight it is again the fact of the federal preemption and taking away from states the ability to conduct proper oversight and accountability with these insurance plans
i would encourage a yes on the substitute and a no on the underlying bill
mr speaker on that i demand the yeas and nays
this is the fourth time the house has voted on association health plans and the fourth time it has been the wrong answer for small businesses and the uninsured
mr speaker i want to thank the gentlewoman for yielding me this time and for her leadership and consistent work on behalf of the american people regardless of what issue and what bills we are dealing with today
millions of americans are calling on congress to address this question by debating and voting on meaningful proposals like universal health care reimportation of prescription drugs and allowing hhs to negotiate drug prices for medicare recipients
in march of this year i held a hearing on ahps
mr speaker this nation spends millions and millions of dollars on cancer treatments
we also spend millions of dollars just on research and development
the gentlewoman from california ms woolsey xz4004360 and i offered an amendment to this legislation both in committee and again last night in the committee on rules
i know many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle have supported similar measures while in their home states as legislators
mr speaker as we worked on this on the committee on education and the workforce we tried to put our thoughts into it
this house spends money constantly on cancer research and here we are using a tool that we can prevent cancer and make sure that women are treated earlier
i must say the republicans are on a roll here
last week they voted in the committee on education and the workforce to raise the cost of education to those students seeking a higher education by raising the cost of the loans that they will seek to finance that education
this legislation says not necessarily so they do not get that on the theory that we have heard argued here that some plan is better than no plan
they would blow the whistle on people running plans where they take premiums from middleclass workers but they do not give the benefit that they want
later this week we ought to reject the energy bill and maybe we can do something to keep people in decent health care plans lower their energy costs and when the higher ed bill comes reject that and we can save them some money on a college education
mr speaker i submit a motion to recommit along with my colleagues on the committee on education and the workforce the gentlewoman from new york mrs mccarthy xz4002570 the gentlewoman from california ms woolsey xz4004360 and the gentlewoman from minnesota ms mccollum xz4002590
mr speaker on that i demand the yeas and nays
studies have shown that ahps would save the typical small business owner between 15 percent and 30 percent on health insurance
this is the bottom line a small business owner in remission from cancer likely can not get health insurance for himself his family or his employees if he lives in a state that allows for rating based on health status
based on the language as i understand it as i believe it to be true he will not be able to get that insurance
but if time proves my position correct i want these comments on the record so we will know exactly where to go to fix this when the milk turns sour
mr speaker i appreciate this opportunity to speak on behalf of the rule and the underlying legislation
there is not the kind of protection on this kind of terrible rating scheme in this plan
if there is one part of this bill that i think just screams out this is stupid it is the part on solvency
there is a 2 million cap on the solvency required for an ahp no matter how many lives you have
this legislation would expand the health care options available for small businesses by building on the efforts of many state governments that are providing health care plans specifically for small businesses
what the kindandrews substitute will not do is preempt state consumer protection laws laws that have been enacted by state legislatures on a bipartisan basis in response to reallife problems in the insurance market
we have a prudent layperson rule to ensure access to emergency services direct access to obgyns and a ban on hmos gagging doctors in their communications with patients
and despite having socalled insurance if workers can not afford to pay those costs on their own they might as well be uninsured
this is the fourth vote on this exact same legislation in as many years
small businesses that do nt choose to offer these inadequate policies would see their premiums increase by 23 percent on average
the problems go on
it s bad policy and our colleagues on the other side of the capitol know it
taking yet another vote on ahps is an enormous waste of time and taxpayer resources and has nothing to do with providing affordable healthcare options to our citizens
mr speaker i thank the gentleman from new jersey for his leadership on this
i want to focus on one of them which is that this bill will strip away the consumer protections and the patient protections that exist under state law for our constituents today
we said let us look at six patients rights that have been agreed to on a bipartisan basis by this congress in previous legislation and which are overwhelmingly agreed to in our states and let us say with respect to those six rights you ca nt take that right away from one of our constituents one of our patients one of our consumers if you are an associated health plan
we did not even get to hear it or vote on it in this house
we did not even allow a vote on that
critics of the bill will come forward today and tell you how association health plans are going to lead to a devastating impact on small businesses and the insurance market
they are worried that they will lose their stranglehold on the smallgroup market
these insurance companies with highly paid lobbyists from blue crossblue shield for example that hold monopolies on state markets are worried that they will have to start negotiating premiums rather than dictating them
just as important i call on the senate to act on this legislation and the administration to put its full backing behind this bill
that is why i offered an amendment in the committee on rules along with the gentlewoman from new york mrs mccarthy xz4002570 that would protect mammograms and cervical cancer screenings from being preempted by association health plans
unfortunately the republican majority does not see the value in protecting women from breast andor cervical cancer because they would not allow our amendment to come to the floor to be debated before we voted on this bill
this is a risk we can not afford and i urge my colleagues to vote no on hr 525
in fact the american diabetes association cited a recently completed study on diabetes prevention that conclusively showed that people with prediabetes can prevent the development of type 2 or fullblown diabetes by making changes in their diet and increasing their level of physical activity
mr speaker i thank the gentleman for yielding me this time and for his work on this issue and so many other important issues
come on
i encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support it
assistant secretary ann combs testified to this at a march 2003 subcommittee on employeremployee relations hearing
and so i urge colleagues on both sides of the aisle to not support this amendment and to vote for hr 525 which offers a good starting point to creating competition in the health care market
nearly 60 percent of the 41 million uninsured americans are employed by small businesses or are dependent on someone who is employed by a small business
having worked on educational campaigns for over a decade i know that it has not been easy to convince women that they should be asking their doctor for a mammogram nor i might add has it been easy to ensure that health insurance companies cover the cost of these mammograms
today we are increasingly catching and treating breast cancer in the early stages yet the legislation we are debating here on the floor today would effectively roll back these advances and even worse doctors would now have to tell the 28yearold woman who thinks she has found a lump in her breast that her health care insurance does not cover a mammogram to better see the abnormality that her health care coverage is no longer subject to minimum standards established by her state because she is covered by an associated health plan an ahp which is located in a different state with far more relaxed laws on health care coverage
unfortunately the legislation we debate on the floor hr 525 which would create ahps will most likely worsen health care situations
it raises premiums on 80 percent of small businesses will increase the number of uninsured by 1 million people and reduce coverage for another 7 million individuals who are most in need of care
my friends on the other side might find these facts inconvenient but that does not make them less true
mr speaker on that i demand the yeas and nays
the fbi collects statistics on these crimes and for the past 10 years violent hate crimes committed on the basis of sexual orientation have been the third highest number of hate crimes committed
the legal protections are essential to our system of ordered justice but on a symbolic basis it is important that congress enunciate clearly that hatemotivated violence based on gendersexual orientation or disability is wrong because quite frankly too much of what we do in this chamber conveys the message that we really do not believe in equality for all and that is sort of like a wink and a nod that a little discrimination is okay
this sort of domestic terrorism demands a strong federal response because this country was founded on the premise that persons should be free to be whoever they are without fear of violence
just last year in separate instances two men in mississippi were brutally murdered based on their sexual orientation
scotty joe weaver was strangled beaten and stabbed before his body was carried to a wooded area and set on fire
as the person who represents the area that jessica lunsford grew up in and knowing her family very very well all of america was focused on jessica when she turned up missing
jessica is no longer with us and i commend the members of congress including yourself mr speaker with whom i have worked very closely and certainly the gentleman from wisconsin mr sensenbrenner xz4003650 the chairman of the committee on the judiciary in putting together the children s safety act
that is but one of the very excellent facets of this bill in addition to having the nationwide registration and availability on line so that parents so that grandparents so that anyone can go and find out who the offenders are in their neighborhood so that every family member can have a modicum of safety in knowing who is nearby
additionally the bill also picks up on some language that i had in the jessica lunsford act and part of this bill is named after her that provides for more frequent contacts a mailing or random mailings to the sexual offenders so that they have to report
if the mailer is not returned if they do not fill out the form and send it back at that point police will be alerted to be on the lookout for them because they are not at their last known address
with all of the various facets of the bill many members who are concerned who have lost children to these offenders to these violators of our most innocent children every single member who put a bill in and those who signed on as cosponsors realize the importance of protecting our streets of protecting our families of protecting our children from these lowlifes who prey on our most innocent young children
i want to make sure that the rule is adopted so we can go on pass this bill send it over to the senate and hopefully they too will see the need the absolute imperative need that america has in demanding that this bill pass so that our children will be protected
child molesters prey on those that are most vulnerable in our society and we must stop them
from the center on child abuse and neglect the editorinchief on child maltreatment the journal of american professional society of the abuse of children the director of crimes against children research center the national crime victims research and treatment center dr
the director s duties would be to track state compliance with new registration requirements in the bill and report back to congress on their progress
i would be happy to work on any suggested improvements to the amendment
i think we have special offices in the department of justice concerning violence against women and cops on the beat programs and i think our children deserve no less
mr chairman i offer this amendment to the bill to address a blight on our society the scourge of hate violence
this is an important omission as indicated by a special doj report on the subject in 2001
we have never had on the federal books in federal law a prohibition against killing someone because of their race
it has been dealt with indirectly here on the floor
mr chairman i just wanted to commend the minority leader on the legislative history she has recounted for the benefit of us who have dealt with this across the years and add that this is a bipartisan measure
i only wish that all of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle who support this measure would also join with their voices and their votes with us on this very important day
so i congratulate the gentlewoman on her explanation of why we are here
mr chairman when i worked in the white house we worked on passing megan s law
this legislation with this type of technology builds on the progress we made under megan s law to protect our children
an example of how this impacts victims of child abusers was raised at the house committee on the judiciary subcommittee on crime hearing by ms carol fornoff whose 13yearold daughter was raped and murdered in tempe arizona in 1984
we need to protect innocent defendants and we also need to allow victims and their families closure on these crimes
we are not limiting habeas corpus at all on that phase
we have worked over 1 year on this legislation with the national center for missing and exploited children the us department of justice and other federal agencies
they prey on our children as if they were cattle
and if we do not have a strict punishment on them they simply will continue to move about the country and prey on vulnerable children in other states
there are penalties for violating simple rules of video rentals and my colleagues would have us believe oh let us not be too harsh on these people
nothing in this law in any way this amendment that the gentleman from michigan who happens to be one of the greatest defenders of freedom of expression in the history of congress nothing in this amendment impinges in any way on anybody s right to say or write anything they want
well in fact of course our laws state and federal are replete with examples where the exact same act is treated more harshly depending on the motivation
we are dealing with a law which in no way impinges on anyone s freedom of expression and says that when individuals are physically harmed in part because of who they are that others who share that characteristic are also put in fear and that is a way to try to diminish that form of activity
as a result concerns have been raised regarding the cost on other states of such a system and these concerns should be addressed
finally my amendment calls on the gao to study the effectiveness of nevada s state law so that congress and this nation can learn from my state how this system might work on a national level and how we can do a better job in monitoring sex offenders
i look forward to gathering the necessary information and finding a legislative solution that will not put an undue burden on our states but will ensure the safety of our children
i want to thank the chairman and his staff for working with me on this issue
hr 3132 directly addresses the shortcomings of our criminal justice system and aims to make our country safer and more secure from those that would prey on our most vulnerable and our most prized assets our children
mr speaker by direction of the committee on rules i call up house resolution 436 and ask for its immediate consideration
mr speaker house resolution 436 is a modified open rule that provides 1 hour of general debate equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the committee on the judiciary
this rule provides that the amendment in the nature of a substitute recommended by the committee on the judiciary now printed in the bill shall be considered as an original bill for the purpose of amendment
mr speaker i rise today to speak on behalf of house resolution 436 and the underlying bill hr 3132 the children s safety act of 2005
members on both sides of the aisle recognize the need to continually find new ways to prevent sexual abuse and to thoroughly and justly punish those who commit these heinous acts
the children s safety act of 2005 would combat the sexual exploitation and abuse of our children through mounting an offensive on numerous fronts and through combining various pieces of good solid legislation into this one comprehensive bill
while the constitution always protects the accused and harmed alike we should not allow the law to be procedurally twisted by child abusers to keep them on the streets to harm another child because of a technicality or because of insufficient support for our law enforcement and communities
this bill would also require the attorney general to create a prioritized dna database focused specifically on those violent predators who would prey on our children
mr speaker i can not emphasize enough that our primary goal must be to prevent child abuse and stop these deviants before they get their hands on a child and before they destroy a child s fragile life
additionally mr speaker this bill would increase the existing mandatory penalties for several existing sexual offenses including engaging in a sexual act with a child committing abusive sexual contact and sexual exploitation of a child trafficking child pornography and the use of the internet to prey on children
i would also like to add that this bill places new requirements on our states to ensure that they perform complete background checks on potential foster and adoptive parents and grants relevant state agencies access to national criminal history databases
in conclusion mr speaker i want to encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to unite behind this commonsense legislation
again i want to thank the gentleman from wisconsin mr sensenbrenner xz4003650 and the committee on the judiciary for putting this bill together
mr speaker i yield back the balance of my time and i move the previous question on the resolution
a motion to reconsider was laid on the table
more importantly i thank the gentleman for his great leadership on the subject of child safety
the assailant went on to hold himself out as a youth minister and as you can guess he preyed upon a number of children destroyed lives damaging families and causing so much terror
in fact amie zyla was not notified of the release of this man until she saw him on tv actually saw him on the news and there was his face and she realized for the first time that the man who had done so much damage to her was back out on the street right where she was
this bill takes commonsense steps toward ensuring sex offenders are not free to prey on the most vulnerable members of our society
if there is a child abuser in california who has been proven through the courts to have a history of child abuse that history is on record in the state of california
i congratulate my cosponsor the gentlewoman from new york mrs kelly xz4002130 and i ask the house to move forward on this favorably
members of every local community would be able to access this registry online and be able to keep tabs on those who may pose harm to our children
i would be proud to support it and i hope it will be addressed on the floor in a more rational way
i am very disappointed that this bill weakens sound registration requirements and penalties by stacking them on fundamentally flawed provisions
not only is this enormous pressure on a child but it greatly diminishes the joys of childhood
the primary party responsible in most communities for checking up on the status of sex offenders who have served their sentences but must register is the local police
i have a feeling i could be accused of a kind of insensitivity or at worst a sort of obsessiveness by bringing this up now but after reading about some of the terrible things that have been said to have happened in new orleans after the destruction wrought by hurricane katrina on august 29 2005 this idea occurred to me in a kind of lightbulb moment
so does a disaster on the scale of what we have seen in louisiana and southern mississippi
just as invading soldiers from various countries in the past have made sexual assault a part of their subjugating of a native population so the criminals loose on the streets in new orleans and even inside the superdome have made sexual assault another part of their overall orgy of violence
of the survivors who have made it this long and perhaps been able to get to refuge in other states whatever procedures officials who run shelters in these states have in place for registering who stays there must certainly take into account the fact that many people left their homes so quickly and under such duress that they may have only the clothes on their backs no identification money etc
louisiana has an open and searchable sex offender registry just like many other states across the us the primary party responsible in most communities for checking up on the status of sex offenders who have served their sentences but must register are the local police
we can also guess that if the larger portion of the population of new orleans was able to leave before the storm or has now been taken to refugee centers in surrounding states a larger number of sex offenders are now not just out of the residence registered in the louisiana offender database but quite possibly off the grid completely and free to throw off what many of them surely must view as the shackles of having to register and have their faces placed on the internet next to a summary of whatever crimes they were convicted of committing
click on the thumbnail inserted into the first paragraph of this blog entry to see a screen capture of a map i made at mapsexoffenderscom the service that matches up sex offender databases with maps and satellite photos and marks the registered offenders homes with a red balloon
the blue balloon on the large map you see when you look at the screen cap i made represents the city center of new orleans
mr chairman i am delighted to be able to cosponsor this amendment and i thank the distinguished gentleman from michigan for presenting this amendment on identity theft and i thank the chairman
this amendment provides stiff penalties to criminals who prey on a child s future
after being detained in a meeting on hurricane katrina i was grateful that my amendment was able to be offered by mr conyers the ranking member
in both cases the crimes were committed by convicted sex offenders who were out on probation
this legislation also cracks down on those sex offenders who refuse to follow registration requirements
it is high time that our government cracks down on child molesters by implementing these commonsense reforms and i urge my colleagues to vote yes on hr 3132
while i stand alone at the podium i wish we were all standing together on behalf of foster children created by katrina
these organizations are working directly with others on the ground in the affected region and they said what we needed to hear the federal government must become an immediate and reliable partner for states trying to cope with the human needs that are outstripping their individual ability to effectively respond
it is clear that it will take a sustained effort on the part of volunteers and local state and federal governments to help these children and families quote and continuing to quote this legislation provides an assurance that the federal government stands as a partner with state and local governments to meet the needs of these children mr chairman there are no gotchas in this amendment
its intent is clear and will focus much more needed federal resources on foster children affected by the hurricane
mr chairman given the magnitude of the crisis and the urgency of the need i urge my colleagues to allow my amendment to be voted on
we witnessed the horror and the tragedy on tv
as the ranking democrat on the subcommittee on human resources this committee is responsible for protecting these children
it is clear that it will take a sustained effort on the part of volunteers and local state and federal governments to help these children and families cope
thank you again for your continued leadership on behalf of children and families
count on cwla to work with you in any way possible to help the children and families affected by this disaster
mr chairman i rise in strong support of the hate crimes prevention amendment offered by the distinguished gentleman from michigan mr conyers xz4000800 the ranking member on the committee on the judiciary and i thank him for his strong leadership on this subject
this vehicle is one that gives congress the opportunity to go on record and hopefully in the majority to reject hate crimes in our country
a year ago a majority of this house voted to support including hate crimes prevention legislation in the department of defense authorization bill on the heels of a strong vote in the senate
our nation was founded on the principle that all are created equal all are entitled to the protections of the laws and all are entitled to justice
mr chairman this amendment is based on hr 2662 the local enforcement hate crimes prevention act of 2005 introduced by the gentleman from michigan mr conyers xz4000800 and joined by 142 members as cosponsors of which i am proud to be one
reclaiming my time mr chairman i would just say to the gentleman that we passed this legislation as i mentioned at least two times on the floor with republican votes
as the gentleman knows we do not have the majority on the democratic side so it was with republican votes that we passed it before
we also in this legislation extend federal jurisdiction to socalled home pornographers that use downloading on the internet and digital and polaroid photography to essentially create an athome cottage industry for child pornography
she was abducted from a shopping center parking lot in broad daylight on a saturday afternoon nearly 2 years ago
the bill also has tough requirements for complying with keeping the registration information current so that the information on there is of value to families
mr chairman again i appreciate the opportunity to speak on this great bill today but i think we can add a few things
but it is not clear that putting that information indiscriminately on the internet regardless of the dangerousness of the individual with no guidance or restriction of what people should do with the information it is unclear whether that is helpful or harmful
that would be a necessary problem but there is no evidence that putting that information on the internet actually reduces the incidence of child molestation so the real estate prices all over the neighborhood go down
so when you put names and addresses on the internet 90 percent of the offenses are not even covered
we also have the situation where those on the internet are ostracized and subjected to public notoriety embarrassment ridicule and harassment
many offenders identified on the internet will not only become unemployed and unemployable because of that notoriety but they may also have to leave their home to avoid embarrassment or other consequences to themselves and their families and having done that may just go underground and not bother to register again
until they have reliable information to show that the impact of the internet will actually reduce the incidence of child molestation we should be circumspect on how we use this information
now we have taken a step in the right direction in the bill by encouraging those states and localities that are not already doing so to consider whether there are offenders who should be required to register but may not have to be put on the internet
now there are provisions in this legislation that are not based on research or sound reasoning like the death penalty mandatory minimums both of which have been studied and shown not to have any effect on crime
another provision that is in the bill that will not have much effect on reducing child molestation is eliminating the access to habeas corpus
here we have a bill with mandatory minimums death penalties that have been shown that have nothing to do with reducing crime it is primarily focused on native americans and i would hope that we would support amendments to eliminate such extraneous matters on the bill so we can concentrate the 500 million on effective crimereducing approaches
we ought to be focused on that
mr chairman we need to focus on the things that will actually reduce crime
mr chairman i would incorporate by reference the comments i have made on mandatory minimums and i think it would apply to this amendment
the amendment keeps the 20year maximum for both crimes and leaves it to the sentencing commission and the courts to determine the gradations of seriousness and the punishment for violations based on the facts and circumstances of the violation
it is absurd that misdemeanants and other minor offenders who get a suspended sentence for a crime that was committed 15 years ago could get a 5year mandatory minimum sentence for a technical violation of a registration requirement such as showing up at 5 30 on the last day of registration when the office closed at 5 oclock or failing to register the fact that they are in a community college that has different sites
if they guess wrong 5 years mandatory minimum no discretion on the part of the judge
a false statement on terrorism 8 years maximum no minimum technical violation on registration 5 years mandatory minimum 20 years possibility
any felonious attack on someone under 18 years of age
mr chairman i rise in support of the amendment and i yield to the gentleman from michigan mr conyers xz4000800 the ranking member of the committee on the judiciary
i introduced this legislation on june 30 in a bipartisan effort to address the growing epidemic of violence against children and the need for greater protection from convicted sex offenders through state registration and notification programs
two wellpublicized tragedies earlier this year in florida in which 9yearold jessica lunsford and 13yearold sarah lunde were murdered by convicted sex offenders further underscore the need for quick congressional action to address the danger posed by individuals who prey on children
in june of this year the subcommittee on crime terrorism and homeland security held a series of three hearings on child crimes issues focusing on violent crimes against children sexual exploitation of children and the sex offender registration and notification program and related legislative proposals
on july 30 the judiciary committee considered this bill and ordered it favorably reported by an overwhelming vote of 22 to 4 mr chairman there are over 550 000 sex offenders in the country and it is conservatively estimated that at least 100 000 of them are lost in the system meaning that nonregistered sex offenders are living in our communities and working at locations where they can and likely will come into contact with our children
the courage of some such as the father of jessica lunsford to speak out on this important issue in the face of unmistakable grief is truly admirable
mr chairman the time to protect our nation s children from sexual predators in our communities and online on the internet is now
fourth the amendment expands on the pilot program for electronic monitoring programs for sex offenders
so if this amendment is adopted judges will be given the power to place on probation those who were convicted of not registering in a new state or making a false statement to law enforcement relative to a sexual abuse investigation
the combination of incentives for the sex offender to comply and stiff criminal penalties and additional law enforcement resources to focus on this problem should help address the overwhelming number of noncomplying or missing sex offenders in our community
let me say that if all mandatory minimum penalties contained in this bill for sexual abuse and exploitation of children are eliminated it does allow judges to send out into society on probation people who have been convicted of sex offenses for or against children
i kind of listened with interest and with respect to the argument of the gentleman from south carolina mr inglis xz4006490 on mandatory minimums in the previously debated amendment
impeachment is a severe penalty and if you look at the 17 impeachments that the house of representatives has voted on in its history the only time where there has been an impeachment voted is when a federal civilian official ends up conducting himself or herself in a manner that obstructs the functioning of government whether it is the branch that that official serves in or the other two equal and separate branches
mr chairman i will make the same offer on this amendment
the first would amend title xviii to eliminate any statute of limitations on criminal prosecutions for kidnapping a child committing a felony sex offense or a human trafficking violation
the second provision in this amendment raises the class on the existing misdemeanor for failure to report child abuse thereby raising the maximum penalty for such an offense from 6 months imprisonment to a year imprisonment
mr chairman i am prepared to accept this amendment but i think it needs a little bit of work on it
the amendment requires clarification of these issues but i am willing to work with my colleague on this amendment to possibly modify or clarify the language at a conference later on
mr chairman this is a poison pill to a very good and strongly supported bill and regardless of whether or not one favors or opposes the federal hate crimes law i would ask the membership not to put highly controversial legislation of this nature on a bill that has attracted such strong and bipartisan support
statistics on hate crimes prosecution should be fully considered in a very thoughtful way including testimony that scholars have presented that says that hate crimes legislation actually increases those types of crimes rather than decreases them
i think both on the merits and on the process and on the practicalities of putting a controversial piece of legislation such as this amendment on a bill that has attracted broad and bipartisan support this amendment should be strongly rejected
mr speaker on that i demand the yeas and nays
once again this congress is attempting to address a very serious and complicated problem with a law that substitutes the talking points of tough on crime politicians for the wisdom of judges prosecutors treatment professionals and child advocates
as a father and someone who has fought for better foster care education and health care for children i object to this illconceived legislation that is as much an attack on our independent judiciary as it is a bill to protect kids
nobody especially the parents and victims of sexual abuse who have contacted me on this issue should confuse my objections to this bad policy with indifference to the problem of child sex abuse in this country
i want to thank the gentleman from wisconsin mr sensenbrenner xz4003650 and his staff for this support in working with my office on this provision
mr speaker sexual predators lurk in the shadows of our neighborhoods and prey on those who are innocent and defenseless
it is time to shed light on this most egregious crime and tighten the outlets sex offenders use to desecrate our world
i am a member of the committee on the judiciary and i have said there that i am more uncomfortable than ever with our use of mandatory minimums
in fact it is quite often the case that you send your possessions on ahead in a moving van and the question is when did you move from california to ohio was it when the moving van got there or was it when you took the first flight from california to ohio but then you returned to california to get the rest of your possessions and drove back
let the judge decide well the person actually did move to ohio on that second trip and when they moved they failed to register
on the other hand the judge could hear this person was not attempting to comply with the law
if jurisdictions have judges who do not do that perhaps there should be some pressure brought to bear on these judges and in fact impeachments if those judges consistently violate the sentencing guidelines
we have a confirmation hearing going on right now where we are confirming i hope somebody who is clearly a capable jurist
when he is on that court we should defer to him because he is a coequal branch of the federal government
and if we have sentencing guidelines and judges that follow those guidelines if they do not put pressure on them and then impeach them
the issue of protecting our children from predators is on the minds of every mother and father as they put their children on school buses every morning during the school year
in this country we are able to track a cow from the time it is born as a calf to the time it ends up on the supper table somewhere in the united states as a steak
as a coauthor and cosponsor of the children s safety act as a former judge in houston texas i urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to listen to their constituents listen to the people of this country vote in favor of safety for american children
these crimes committed against children on the internet are facilitated by the latest technologies and advances in computers and the internet
furthermore many cases involving exploitation and enticement of children on the internet cross jurisdictional lines and even international boundaries
this will allow law enforcement across the country and even internationally to work together and share information on cases that cross jurisdictions
while this rule is less restrictive than most rules we report out of the committee on rules i must point out that it is not an open rule
it restricts the debate we will be able to have today on this bill by preventing members from offering any new amendments
madam speaker i ask unanimous consent that all members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks on h res 437
or will we rely on proxies to do our work for us because we have judged ourselves incapable of carrying out our constitutional duty to ensure that we are providing for the general welfare which is what the preamble of the constitution clearly states we have a responsibility to do
last night in the committee on rules many of my democratic colleagues asked excellent questions
but pete wilson testified before the senate committee on homeland security and governmental affairs
it was a hearing that they held on recovering from hurricane katrina and he did this to share his experience and very valuable lessons that he learned from dealing with many many very very difficult challenges disasters that we faced in california earthquakes fire mudslides the devastation that we faced
a quarter of a million vehicles a day go on the santa monica freeway right over the la cienega offramp
he wrote a piece on this the day before yesterday in the wall street journal in which he referred to the fact that people said it would take a long period of time
we all know that when one looks at a public opinion poll it depends on how the question is asked
madam speaker i yield 3 minutes to the very distinguished gentleman from pasco washington mr hastings xz4001711 subcommittee chairman from the committee on rules and the chairman of the committee on standards of official conduct
madam speaker i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from miami florida mr lincoln diazbalart xz4001070 the very distinguished chairman of our subcommittee on budget and process reform
i have seen it on television i have heard it reported by my colleagues on both sides of the aisle who have been victimized themselves but it is impossible it is impossible to imagine how horrible this has been
we are dealing with other potential disasters on the horizon
i am perplexed mr speaker with the arguments that i have heard from my colleagues on the other side of the aisle
i hope that we will be able to have that sense of solidarity and so i am saying on behalf of the gentleman from illinois speaker hastert i know that he looks forward to having our colleagues on the other side of the aisle appointed along with those who he will appoint to serve on this very important committee and with that with our quest of trying to ensure that we never go through what we have gone through in the past several weeks i urge support of this very important resolution
mr speaker i object to the vote on the ground that a quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not present
but more importantly congress has a responsibility to the people we represent to investigate the preparation and response efforts to hurricane katrina and make recommendations on how we can better prepare and respond to disasters in the future
madam speaker some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle oppose the idea of a bipartisan congressional committee held accountable to the people and by the people who elect us
madam speaker i am saddened that hours after hurricane katrina rescue and recovery efforts began lawmakers were publicly pointing fingers rather than focusing on how to help the victims
in fact 71 percent of the public said that the proposed congressional investigation would get bogged down in politics rather than focusing on the facts such skepticism is wellfounded
madam speaker democrats want to make sure that we help the victims of katrina first secondly we want to make sure that there is oversight on the money that we are spending a lot of money and thirdly we want to have an oversight meaningful in depth honest searching courageous as to why the federal government was so inept in its response and so late
because we believe it is imperative to establish an independent commission modeled on the highly regarded 911 commission
i will ask my friend who chairs the rules committee who used to come to this floor on a regular basis and say when democrats were in the majority why will you not allow us to consider an alternative
it is the fact that you are so focused on not having meaningful oversight of keeping it inhouse of not having independence that you do not allow us and the american public s representatives to have that alternative considered on the floor
we oppose this bill which would create a partisan congressional committee to investigate the inept federal response to hurricane katrina because we believe it is imperative to establish an independent commission modeled on the highly regarded 911 commission
mr speaker i never rise on this floor addressing the question of hurricane katrina without thanking all of the enormous outpouring from americans of charity and concern particularly commenting on my city and my state that have welcomed now almost 245 000 survivors into the state of texas and now close to 100 000plus in houston in my congressional district and other congressional districts in the area
one of the first things i did in visiting those survivors in the astrodome was to apologize on behalf of the federal government
each meeting i subsequently went to and each time i was able to touch a survivor or hear their story of pain i again apologized for the complete collapse and ineffectiveness of our ability to deploy in advance of hurricane katrina to be able to be on the ground with resources whether they be the national guard or the military or fema or anyone else that might have contributed to the saving of lives or in fact providing the survivors with a pathway out of mississippi or alabama or new orleans
but mr speaker moving checkers on a checker board is not in fact a solution to our problem
the spouses of so many of our members who have not been recognized at all deserve nothing less than to make sure the efforts that have gone on already and the answers that everybody seeks are provided by an independent commission an independent commission blessed by both the gentleman from illinois mr hastert xz4001690 and the gentlewoman from california ms pelosi xz4003140 coming together in the way that we should as a country
the leadership of the house will not even allow democrats the opportunity to offer a substitute and have a straight upordown vote on it
i do nt think the american people are going to have much patience for partisanship on this issue
republicans would outnumber democrats on the committee 11 to 9 there would be no bipartisan subpoena power
i think it is important if we are going to follow through on some of these statements that have been made here on this floor if we are going to follow through on what the president would say tonight in another 20 minutes to the country are we going to be here for the long haul or are we going to give the people affected in the south what we call here in washington dc the potomac twostep
are we going to allow bigtime contractors to go down make a bucket of money on the back of tragedy and cut the wages for those very same people that were victims
we say we do not want to politicize the process but we step out on politics
if we are going to do something in the congress to find out where government failed where nonprofit failed and not have a 5050 relationship with the majority side to be able to get to the truth we are going to see partisan votes on that select committee
we are supposed to act on behalf of those individuals that can not stand for themselves
over in the other body across the hall yesterday there was a vote that went down on a partisan party line
one individual from the state one of the affected states did not even vote on the amendment and that amendment called for down to the last sentence a 911like commission
but i will say this that i believe the american spirit will rise on behalf of these individuals who are living in shelters right now and who do not even know what is happening to them
it was not the first idea of the congress or the administration to have a 911 commission but thank god that those family members on behalf of their families who had lost their lives took whatever money they had came to this congress and made it happen
so i do not know how long this media cycle is going to go on
so i say to my colleague that this is going to be one of those things like the committee on ways and means with partisan votes up and down like the committee on armed services partisan votes up and down like the committee on appropriations partisan votes along party lines
mr speaker let me just say this in order to clarify the whole issue on subpoenas
so your statement was correct the minority view on the committee or the democratic view on the committee if we wanted a particular individual to be subpoenaed could not be subpoenaed if we are not in the majority to be able to do so
if there was an equal 5050 power on the committee then obviously there would be time for compromise
if a member of congress wanted to go down and see exactly what the federal response was you can not go on what we call a congressional visit go down there on a codel
i happened to get down there on the relief flight taking food and necessities down
i can not help but look at exactly what is going on
some may be saying that the 30 something working group they are on the floor are talking about the majority party s failings with regards to leading and this national tragedy
a day later the president got called out on it
it was not a situation where they said fine electricity is off we do not have a lot of law and order going on so we are going to go into this store and take things
he was here before the committee on science this week and testified
he called the mayor of new orleans on saturday night before the storm and said mr mayor your levees potentially will break
i am not saying that he needs to wear that on his back but the bottom line is somebody appointed him to that position with no experience whatsoever
that played around and finally the administration took him out under pressure not only pressure from the democratic leader but from the media who started focusing on him saying things were going poorly because we still do not have good leadership there
but when it comes down to governance and responsibility and making sure if you are poor middle class or wealthy in this country that this government will govern on your behalf and that did not happen
the response to that request was we are going to put together a select committee we are going to make sure that there is a majority influence on it as relates to the republican leadership side and we will not get to the bottom of what happened
regular citizens were on the 911 commission a democratic and republican appointment cochairs to look at this and professionalize our response on all levels
i think it is important that the american people members of congress no matter what community you represent if you believe in making sure that people get the same representation for us to have a 911 commission and i must add and say to the gentleman from ohio mr ryan xz4003521 and we come to the floor to talk about what we should be doing and how we should be doing it or what we are doing on this side of the aisle it is important for us to know the facts
b michael brown would have gone to another job long before because the pressure and there probably would have been a vote to remove the director putting pressure on the white house to get someone more qualified
the votes that are going down here are partisan votes not votes on behalf of what we know
i am asking for the members of this house on both sides of the aisle and for the american people not to give up on these poor people
do not give up on them
they are not giving up on us
i know that the president is going to be on 8 oclock central but he is going to be on at 9 oclock eastern
but obviously he will be coming on very shortly
we have to make sure that members of this congress feel what we feel here on this floor tonight having an opportunity to touch these individuals
as it relates to the evacuation of poor people there was a bill dropped down today on the democratic side of the aisle that called for a response plan an evacuation plan for the poor for the elderly for the individuals that need assistance the most because what we saw in new orleans what we saw in louisiana what we saw in mississippi the individuals that were left behind were the individuals who did not know where their next 5 was going to come from or were waiting on their check to come in or did not have a car to get out and it is catastrophic
that is what the headlines on newspapers are saying
we are not saying that blood is on anyone s hands
we need to make sure that members know on both sides of the aisle that we have a responsibility to stand for these individuals
on their memory on behalf of them make sure that does not happen again
mr speaker i will just go ahead and say for those individuals that felt that the resolution that we passed today was the best thing since sliced bread and they are on the plane on the way back to their districts or what have you off for the weekend that they did their part now they go home and do what they have got to do in their district that is fine
but i think they should have a conscience a conscience on the fact that these individuals are not getting their just due and they are not getting represented and they are not getting what they deserve as americans
i am going to be positive on this
if it were not for black and white people of goodwill saying that somebody like me can have an opportunity to come to the congress and give a special order to talk about the very individuals who can not represent themselves if it were not for those individuals white and black people in the north saying something is not right in the south and we are going to risk our lives to get the attention of the government that they pay taxes to allow them to have the kind of representation they deserve this is far deeper than the resolution on the last day of a work week
i am talking about majority on both sides of the aisle
i am disturbed mr speaker i am disturbed by the fact they are partisan votes that are going on the other side of the congress and in this house as though it is just another piece of legislation
it is something we disagree on
people are wrapped up on the side of the road and bodies are still floating and we leave on our way to a picnic like it is nothing
on the commission procedural vote here on this house floor that was voted down for us to have this week voted down for us to have a 911 kind of a commission i believe that was today and yesterday there is an article and i will give it to the members just in case they were not watching the senate wwwsfgatecom there is an article senate kills bid for katrina commission now let me tell my colleagues something
if they wanted to get to the bottom of it and to make sure that it never happens again and to make sure that americans do not have to watch the horror the horror of people dying and bodies floating not because of katrina but because of lack of response because the levee broke and because of a lack of administrative duties and governance on all levels if we do not want that to happen again why are we not passing a 911 kind of commission for the people in the gulf states
i just want to give credit where credit is due some of them had an opportunity to come back and check on their families
i call on the members and the american people again not to allow this to be swept under the carpet not to allow individuals to sit up here and set the deck because these individuals are poor
i am encouraged by the fact that people are not only praying on behalf of these individuals but the american people have taken action on behalf of them making sure that they have the things that they need
i am glad that there is some leadership on this floor that sees the importance in that
mr tanner xz4003950 at the request of ms pelosi xz4003140 for today on account of a family funeral
mr istook xz4001970 at the request of mr delay xz4001040 for today on account of observing relief operations from hurricane katrina
mr gary g miller xz4002770 of california at the request of mr delay xz4001040 for today on account of illness
on account of traveling to his district with the president of the united states to survey hurricane damage
mr rogers xz4003412 of michigan at the request of mr delay xz4001040 for today on account of a family commitment
the vast majority of the american public supports the establishment of an independent bipartisan commission so that the inquiry focuses on the facts instead of getting bogged down in partisan politics
let us have an independent review of what has happened and what is going on
what happened right here on this floor today is a tragedy for the exact reason the gentleman just mentioned
and the majority party appoints to the committees members to the committee on ways and means the committee on appropriations the house homeland security committee the subcommittee on foreign operations export financing and related programs and all these different committees and subcommittees
and what has happened over the past few years here and the great example is the later clinton years with ken starr with the house committee on government reform the republican party that controlled this chamber they were the ones conducting the investigation into president clinton because they had the subpoena power and they had the opportunity to do it
this majority party does not have the credibility i say to my colleague the credibility to oversee what is going on here because they are going to do nothing but whitewash this thing
i just could not believe the debate on the floor today
he is saying should he not as a representative of a state in a congressional district that lost lives and homes and property and everything else should he not be able to subpoena somebody just like every other member of congress if i am on that committee
i think it is terrible that we have this kind of cronyism going on
come on
they want an independent investigation bipartisan equal power among both parties to investigate it so there is no coverups no whitewashing going on
we are giving our country away and we have got to pay interest on it
so here these guys are wasting all of their time all their energy on putting the screws to the workers guys in new orleans that are now living in baton rouge or in mississippi or in houston who want to go back home and help rebuild their community and make the going rate in their community the prevailing wage in their community and these guys are wasting all their time and energy trying to screw them to the wall instead of overlooking and seeing what halliburton is doing
these union workers pay like 5 cents an hour to go for the union dues 10 cents an hour it depends on what union you are in
eleven republicans nine democrats we do not have an ounce of power on this thing and we will get slammed just like we do every day down here and the end result will be a fema that continues to be inept and inadequate in its response to natural disasters
i have served in this body now 25 years and in that 25 years a little over half of it was under a democrat house and democrat leadership tip oneill jim wright three speakers in all on the democrat side
i would like to remind our friends on the other side that one of our constitutional duties as representatives of the will of the people is actually to represent the will of the people of the united states
apparently the people of the united states are to be patted on the head and told do not worry
and now to show how seriously it takes its constitutional responsibility to get the government back on track to show that it is not interested solely in rhetoric but also in results the majority has seen fit to create a partisan political body which we all know will care more about the political survival of the leadership than the actual survival of the people
should we here and now state that because it was not run by those managing the government on september 11 2001 for that reason what it discovered was illegitimate
not one member of this body would make such a claim and yet the majority makes this claim about the creation of a similar body to investigate what happened on the gulf coast
i vote no on this ridiculous proposal
madam speaker i recently heard the gentleman who represents hollywood speaking about how it is somehow fair that the only member of this body that i know of who was there on ground zero who rode with the national guard to distribute food because fema so thoroughly screwed up who realizes that if it were not for the united states military doing fema s job for them people would have starved to death people would have died of dehydration hospitals would not have gotten needed medical supplies that i will not be allowed to subpoena witnesses
fema could have avoided millions of dollars in unnecessary aerial replenishment of people that we could get trucks to because they insisted on one point of delivery in a county where very few people still had cars that were running and those that had cars that ran could not get gasoline
fema could have sent thousands of people on their way to their families in other parts of the state but did not bring gasoline in for them
and i would hope that i would have the opportunity to subpoena some of the people that need to speak on this
mr speaker i want to address the house on this subject that is before us today
instead the republicans met among themselves without talking to the democrats and have proposed this select committee on a takeitorleaveit basis
no we have not had hearings on that
no no hearings on that
the actuary working for this administration withheld from congress on the costs of the medicare prescription drug bill
both republicans and democrats were denied the facts before we voted on the bill
no nothing on that
we had more hearings when the republicans were in charge and there was a democratic administration on whether president clinton misused his christmas card list for political purposes
but we can not get hearings on these important subjects
but when you do not make an effort and you have a record of abusing the power that you have in running this institution and ignoring the oversight responsibilities on really important matters in order to protect a republican administration from possible embarrassment we have no confidence whatsoever that we are going to get to the facts of what went wrong in dealing with hurricane katrina
we need to rise above this raw partisanship and join together if not on an independent commission which i think makes the most sense at least on a committee that is equally divided with the powers equally divided where the intent is to work together
as a result of the 911 commission congress responded with legislation based on their recommendations
now is the time for congress to provide scrutiny on how the law was implemented
mr speaker i ask unanimous consent that all members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration
in 1976 president carter asked him to serve as the nation s attorney general but he declined because he did not want to leave his beloved south texas and his service on the federal bench
in 1982 he obtained senior status and even after his retirement he remained active by filling in on the bench whenever he was needed
he became an expert on comparative american and mexican law
it is indeed fitting that his name will be on this new federal courthouse
judge vela had one of the longest running and most successful radio programs on legal subjects which was broadcast in spanish to more than 2 million listeners in south texas and northern mexico
he also participated in 220 spanish radio programs entitled enriquezca su vida termine sus estudios meaning enrich your life complete your studies that focused on encouraging children to stay in school and off drugs
he served former governors john connally and mark white on commissions to improve the quality of education in texas
pope pius xii twice decorated judge garza for his work on behalf of public charities
his civic activities including being the charter president for the esperanza home for boys and the cosponsor of the spanish radio program enrich your life complete your studies judge vela s other civic activities include membership on the independent school district task force and membership in the general assembly of the texas catholic conference
i am confident i speak on behalf of some of the west coast members of congress as well as the mainstream american values and certainly have no personal animosity towards the lady for whom this post office is named in this bill
however there is a plethora of information on the record that sets her apart from i will say the most consistent of american values
mr speaker just to make a couple of gentle points the effort has been at least on the record as not i do not want to say fighting against injustice but a record of fighting against justice particularly in the case of the effort to free mumia abujamal
when they go back by that post office in berkeley and look at the name on the post office they are going to ask what were the principles that brought this about
mr speaker on that i demand the yeas and nays
unfortunately the other body did not act on that bill
i am hopeful that with our passage of the bill today the senate will take quick action on it
he also served on the brownsville independent school board the texas educational standards committee and the select committee on higher education
when judge garza was appointed to the fifth circuit judge filemon vela succeeded him on the us district court for the southern district of texas in brownsville
judge garza ended his career on the prestigious fifth circuit of the us court of appeals
mr speaker as a member of the committee on government reform i am pleased to join my colleagues in consideration of hr 438 legislation naming a postal facility in berkeley california after maudelle shirek
this measure was introduced by the gentlewoman from california ms lee xz4002370 on february 1 2005
i want the body to know the committee on appropriations is strongly committed to bringing back to this floor individual conference reports for each and every bill
the house and senate committees on appropriations are both committed to this goal
mr speaker i reserve a point of order on the gentleman s motion
throughout the year we on the democratic side of the aisle in the minority have worked with the majority on every possible procedural issue and cooperated with them procedurally at every juncture so that we could enable this house to pass the 10 appropriation bills that are necessary to pass even though we disagreed in most instances with the content of those bills
in my view it is because the majority caucus has such a fundamental disrespect for the basic functions of government that it has sacrificed and squeezed so many education and health and veterans and other programs in order to pay for huge supersize tax cuts for the most wealthy among us that in the end they have not been able to convince their senate colleagues to go along and go on record and endorse those cuts
and yet while it is chiseling on the wages of those workers it is saying to the persons who make over 400 000 a year on average you are going to get a 32 000 tax cut
they are voting to do not one blessed thing to deal with the longterm fiscal impact that they have on the country and yes will be chiseling on some of the programs that i just mentioned
i am going to offer a motion to recommit which number one would provide that the funding levels in this bill be at the current rate rather than the threeheaded rate spelled out by the gentleman so that we do not even for a month cut back on what we are doing on job training or community service block grants or lowincome heating assistance or other programs like that
but if persons on the majority side of the aisle refrain from lodging a point of order then the house would be allowed to vote on a measure which restores equity to the farm programs on a measure which restores equity to funding levels for all programs and it would restore davisbacon protections for workers as well
that means they still get at least a 9 000 tax cut on average
to those on the democratic side of the aisle who might find it a little nerveracking to vote to scale back tax cuts even for those welloff folks my suggestion is if they can not even stand up and do that they might as well go and cross the aisle
i have already explained the impact of that on program
mr speaker on that i demand the yeas and nays
the 50 percent cut to csbg in the continuing resolution would have a devastating effect on evacuees and on lowincome individuals
mr speaker by direction of the committee on rules i call up house resolution 469 and ask for its immediate consideration
this rule provides for 1 hour of debate in the house equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the committee on appropriations
additionally the resolution provides that suspensions will be in order at any time on the legislative day of thursday october 6 2005 and the speaker or his designee shall consult the minority leader or her designee on any suspension considered under the rule
mr speaker i want to commend the gentleman from california chairman lewis and the entire house committee on appropriations on both sides of the aisle for sticking to the timetable they laid out at the start of this legislative session
we are now just anticipating action from the senate on those last four appropriations bills so we can move forward finish the appropriations process and avoid a cumbersome omnibus funding bill
unfortunately the appropriations process within the two bodies has not been completed prior to the start of the new fiscal year which of course begins this october 1 we must institute a continuing resolution in order to allow the government to function through november 18 2005 while we complete consideration of the remaining appropriations bills waiting on the senate to complete their final actions and for the conference committees to do their work
i am most impressed with the work of the committee on appropriations on this continuing resolution
as a state that was hit by four hurricanes last year and had the beginnings of katrina come across our state this year our hearts go out to our brothers and sisters on the gulf coast and we recognize that this government has a commitment to help lift up those citizens on the gulf coast and where appropriate we have a federal responsibility in the rebuilding and reconstruction process in louisiana and mississippi and alabama and a lot of other places
there is an opportunity here for us to reprioritize using regular order using the strength and talent that sits on our committees and bringing about a measured approach to doing that
the numbers that are coming out of there fluctuate wildly and it is important that we have a handle on what those needs truly are
i think we can all be very proud of our appropriators finishing their schedule before july 4 and now we are in a position unfortunately of being in a bit of a holding pattern waiting on the senate and our conference committees to do their work
i think it is important that we all recognize on both sides of the aisle that offsets are going to be necessary and that we do have to reprioritize
mr speaker i thank the gentlewoman from california ms matsui xz4006631 for her work on the rules committee and what is essentially a broad commitment that we have to have this cr through november 18
frankly it is not for lack of effort on the house side
we had a herculean effort this summer to move these bills on schedule move them out before july 4th and because of supreme court nominations and everything else obviously the senate has had other issues on their agenda and we are in a holding pattern on the appropriations
mr speaker i yield back the balance of my time and i move the previous question on the resolution
a motion to reconsider was laid on the table
house of representatives committee on ways and means washington dc september 29 2005
as you know the committee on ways and means has jurisdiction over matters concerning medicare
there are two sections within the introduced resolution that are within the authorizing jurisdiction of the committee on ways and means
however in order to expedite this legislation for floor consideration the committee will forgo action on this resolution
an email on this issue sent by the committee states we are happy to concede your jurisdiction in this matter and included the language solely because of omb s office of management and budget request that we do so
we do nt believe that it prejudices any future action on your part i will place a copy of this letter in the congressional record during floor consideration
mr speaker i can not support a closed rule although i do understand the need for prompt action on the continuing resolution
as my good friend from florida has pointed out the senate s slowness in acting on appropriations bills means that the continuing resolution that we are discussing here today is necessary
i think there is an urgent need for both the administration and the congress to face hard reality and not continue with budget policies based on laws that defy the laws of fiscal gravity
it would do two things first it would authorize the president to identify specific items in federal spending that he thinks should be cut and second require congress to vote on each of those items
it would set deadlines for the president to propose cuts and for congress to act on them
under the bill congress would have to vote on each proposed cut
the president has said we should pay for responding to katrina and rita through spending cuts alone but the president s own party and the majority in this house are divided on what to cut
we may disagree on budget and tax priorities mr speaker but one thing is certain
if anything good can come from these terrible storms maybe it will be recognition by both the bush administration and congress that now we need to face hard reality and not continue with budget policies based on defying the laws of fiscal gravity
even if katrina and rita had taken less destructive paths and the new orleans levees had held the problems would have been serious because the federal budget was already on a dangerous course marked by tidal waves of red ink and towering piles of debt
but having campaigned on giving back most of the budget surplus in tax cuts president bush insisted on much more and congress went along
and then came the attacks of 911 and with them the need for increased spending on homeland security a military response in afghanistan and a war in iraq
even in the face of national emergency neither the president nor congress has seen fit to call on americans for any sacrifice and instead of temporarily scaling back tax cuts the president has insisted on making them permanent even as federal spending has skyrocketed
so now we are putting the costs of war and everything else the government does on the national credit card but the debt is owed not just to ourselves as in the past but to china japan and india
but all this can not go on forever
to help begin such a serious debate earlier this year i introduced legislation that would give the president authority to require congress to vote up or down on specific appropriations items the president deemed unworthy of funding a workable and constitutional alternative to the line itemveto legislation that the supreme court struck down in 1998
now i am introducing an updated version of this bill that focuses directly on the president s suggestion that disaster response costs be offset with spending cuts
that name fits because the bill would promote presidential leadership and congressional accountability on proposals to reduce other spending in order to offset the costs of responding to the recent natural disasters
toward that end it would authorize the president to identify specific items of federal spending that he thinks should be cut and would require congress to vote on each of those items
in each case if the president proposes a cut congress would have to vote on it we could not ignore the proposal as can be done under current law and if a majority approved the cut it would take effect
i think members of congress know the needs of their communities and that congress as a whole can and should exercise its judgment on how tax dollars are to be spent
the bill respects and emphasizes that congressional role by requiring a vote on each spending cut proposed by the president
the house would debate and vote on each proposed rescission within 10 legislative days after the bill s introduction
if passed by the house the bill would go promptly to the senate which would have no more than 10 more days to consider and vote on it
the facts on the ground have changed and our agenda here in the house must change accordingly
we know that because of katrina the victims those displaced from their homes are more likely to rely on medicaid
mr speaker we need to take care of our fellow citizens but what we do now should not mean we pass on an unsustainable debt to future generations especially when we know there is a way we can offset these costs
we know that we need some of these cuts such as amt relief but let us at least be reasonable and put them on the table
let us reject this bill and move forward on a better solution to our energy crisis
mr speaker i thank the distinguished member of the committee on rules for yielding me this time
my understanding is that the democrat substitute is similar if not identical to the democrat alternative that was put in play in the committee on energy and commerce at our 16hour markup last week
so point one is our friends on the minority side are going to get an opportunity to have their ideas on this issue addressed by the body and voted on so that would be a very good reason for everybody to vote on the rule
another good reason to vote for the rule is that the manager s amendment that has been incorporated into the base text takes into account many of the issues that were debated in the committee on energy and commerce and many of the issues that were supported by our minority members of that committee last week in particular the concerns about price gouging
the amendment that was adopted in committee on price gouging last week only referred to price gouging within a disaster area that had been declared by the president of the united states and it only applied to gasoline and diesel fuel
the manager s amendment incorporates many of the ideas that the gentleman from michigan mr stupak xz4003910 and the gentlewoman from new mexico mrs wilson xz4004342 on the majority side had in their alternative price gouging amendments
even with most of those refineries back on line there is still enough refinery capacity disabled that the prices remain somewhere between 30 to 50 cents a gallon higher than they were before the hurricane
it would not eliminate or reduce any environmental law on the books today but it would create an expedited process that a governor of a state that wished to build a new refinery or expand an existing one could utilize
it also has some incentives and some emphasis on carpooling
carpooling is not a real sexy hightech issue but if we could get one out of every three americans to actually carpool on their way to and from work we would save over 1 million barrels of oil per day which again reducing the demand would reduce the cost of the gasoline
i want to thank the distinguished committee on rules for bringing this rule to the floor and i look forward to working with them on this issue and other issues in the future
it follows countless hearings over the last several years on gasoline markets refinery capacity and clean air act issues
refineries went down and are struggling to come on line
some seem to believe that americans will float to work on a cloud of our good intentions
the energy policy act of 2005 will help on crude oil prices as will future legislation by the resources committee
we can increase refinery capacity today by voting yes on this rule and yes on the gas act
the gentleman from michigan mr stupak xz4003910 comments that his price gouging amendment does something on natural gas
mr speaker i ask unanimous consent that all members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks on the legislation before us and to insert extraneous material on the bill
mr speaker i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from wisconsin mr ryan xz4003511 a member of the committee on ways and means
mr speaker i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from michigan mr upton xz4004140 a member of the committee on energy and commerce and chairman of the subcommittee on telecommunications
mr speaker i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from indiana mr buyer xz4000560 a member of the committee and the distinguished chairman of the committee on veterans affairs
mr speaker i want to cut to the chase on this issue
on the right of the chart are additional permits in addition to the new source review
but it is a fact that we use 21 million barrels of oil a day in this country and we only have the refining capacity for about 16 on a good day and unfortunately since katrina and rita we have had many good days
what it does do is require the environmental protection agency and the department of energy to appoint officials within their agencies to consolidate and to coordinate all of these reviews if if a state governor wants them to or if the president of the united states wants them to on federal property
americans nationwide worried if the price would be higher on their way home from work than it was in the morning
my committee was voting on the gasoline for america s security act just 4 weeks after hurricane katrina crossed the coast
on that day 11 refineries remained closed by flooding and power failures and most had no restart dates
we encourage those who might build the alaska natural gas pipeline to speed up by setting a deadline on their incentives
i want to thank chairman cliff stearns of our commerce trade and consumer protection subcommittee and congressman greg walden for their help on this provision
we will have a vote in the future on this policy and when it passes our nation s supply of both energy supply and common sense will expand
our cars our jobs our nation s economic growth and our people s opportunity to prosper they all rely on gasoline
vote yes on this bill
house of representatives committee on the judiciary washington dc october 5 2005
dear chairman barton on september 28 2005 the committee on energy and commerce ordered reported hr 3893 the gasoline for america s security act of 2005 in recognition of the desire to expedite floor consideration of hr 3893 the committee on the judiciary hereby waives any consideration of the bill
several sections of hr 3893 contain matters within the committee on the judiciary s rule x jurisdiction
a summary of principal provisions within the committee on the judiciary s jurisdiction follows
these matters fall within the committee on the judiciary s jurisdiction under rule x 1 l 1 the judiciary and judicial proceedings civil and criminal
this matter falls within the committee on the judiciary s jurisdiction under rule x 1 l 1 the judiciary and judicial proceedings civil and criminal
the committee on the judiciary agrees to waive any formal consideration of the bill with the understanding that its jurisdiction over these and other provisions contained in the legislation is no way altered or diminished
this waiver is further conditioned upon the understanding between our committees that there are no provisions contained in hr 3893 that could be construed or interpreted to alter modify or to have any effect on any laws or regulations pertaining to any fuel additive including ethanol and mtbe
the committee on the judiciary also reserves the right to seek appointment to any housesenate conference on this legislation
i would appreciate your including this letter in the congressional record during consideration of hr 3893 on the house floor
james sensenbrenner jr house of representatives committee on energy and commerce washington dc october 4 2005
while the committee on the judiciary did not receive a referral of the bill upon introduction i appreciate your willingness not to seek a referral on hr 3893
i agree that your decision to forego action on the bill will not prejudice the committee on the judiciary with respect to its jurisdictional prerogatives on this or future legislation
further knowing of your interest in the debate surrounding fuel additive liability nothing in hr 3893 should be construed or interpreted to alter modify or to have any effect on any laws or regulations pertaining to any additive including ethanol and mtbe
i will include our exchange of letters in the committee s report on hr 3893 and i look forward to working with you as we prepare to pass this important energy legislation for the american people
mr speaker i yield myself such time as i may consume to enter into a colloquy with the gentleman from michigan mr stupak xz4003910 and the gentleman from virginia mr boucher xz4000430 if they are on the floor
on page 2 title i section 101 it basically says if a president has issued a declaration that there is an energy emergency it begins to talk about a price that is unconscionably excessive
well on page 18 the implementation plan just says the secretary shall transmit to the congress a plan
but it is your understanding that if this were to become law these refineries that would be built by the department of energy would actually be operated on a continual basis is that correct
let me simply say that it appears to be the stupak language on price gouging that was in the democratic substitute
it reminds me of what ginger rogers said when she was asked to comment on what a great dancer fred astaire was
she said yes but i do it and i do it in high heels backwards so we both agree on both sides of the aisle that we need to do something about price gouging
mr speaker i urge a no vote on the motion to recommit
as the gentlewoman from new mexico mentioned in her speech there is a wonderful provision on price gouging that will protect consumers against price gouging from the refinery on down
this difference shows that exorbitant increases began even before katrina wreaked havoc on our economy
in that spirit we offer this motion to recommit which attacks soaring gas prices head on
mr speaker i thank the chairman for his excellent work on this issue
but this issue has been on the table for 10 years and if former president clinton had not vetoed drilling in anwr in 1995 we might not be standing here having this discussion today
it is going to help us to be able to move forward on refineries in a more expeditious manner
the other thing is establishing the department of energy as the lead agency for siting refineries and eliminating some of the unnecessary requirements on waiting on multiple bureaucracies to respond to a request to build one refinery
it is about meeting real american needs of real families for energy uses on a daily basis
mr speaker i rise in strong opposition to hr 3893 the second energy special interest act of 2005 the bush administration s energy policy and the machinations of the republican leadership on this subject have an alice in wonderland quality
higher fuel efficiency standards public transit and even bicycles will do much more to reduce our dependence on foreign oil than what s in this bill
last but not least this bill s focus on making it easier to build more refineries by limiting our environmental standards completely misses the point
mr speaker i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from california mr waxman xz4004250 a senior member of the committee on energy and commerce
based on the evidence before us that would be the wrong remedy
the new reserve would build on the success of the strategic petroleum reserve and would provide the nation with a reserve refinery capacity that could be used in times of national emergency to increase the supply of gasoline and minimize supply disruptions and price spikes
mr speaker i yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from california mrs capps xz4000620 a member of the committee on energy and commerce
mr speaker i am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from new york mr boehlert xz4000350 the distinguished chairman of the committee on science
mr speaker i am pleased to yield 1 minute to the gentleman from washington mr inslee xz4001930 a member of the committee on energy and commerce
i also believe that hurricane katrina did reveal a weakness in our energy supply systems highlighting the reliance this country has on the gulf coast for our energy resources
so despite the noise that we maybe hear on the floor for the american people this is a good bill
i am pleased in a conversation with the chairman and the gentleman from florida mr stearns xz4003880 they are going to consider having a hearing on the issue and i think that is a good thing
i guess the best thing we can say about the bill is what is not in it namely the repeal of the longstanding bipartisan moratorium on new offshore drilling
and bottom line it fails to protect consumers from price gouging at the pump which we have seen going on on a regular basis
it affects businesses and families on a daily basis and i should know because my gas prices in my district are usually among the highest in the nation
this is a strategy that relies on increasing our supplies at all costs while conservation efforts are ridiculed by our vice president as signs of personal virtue this is a strategy that says if laws over the past several years we have had repeated chances to craft commonsense efficient and effective energy legislation that would set america on a more stable future but this republican congress has failed to do that and this failure is once again realized in this bill
mr speaker more than ever in the wake of the recent hurricanes congress and the american people are focused on meeting our energy needs
the longterm costs for backtracking on important pollution measures will be far greater than the short terms gains from this bill
and we must take a hard look at automotives from creating additional consumer incentives for domestic production and purchase of efficient hybridelectric vehicles to the possibility of increasing fuel economy standards so cars can go further on a tank of gas
a diversified approach based on a variety of resources will truly save consumers money at the pump and help to reduce our dependence on foreign oil
the legislation before us today can only hurt our states and our environment and i urge a no vote on this legislation
every american is paying 70 cents a gallon more to the refiners and 2 cents more on average to the retail people
it is the same thing enron did in california to stick it to everybody on the west coast of america
but they still can not take them on
they can not take on their benefactors here on the floor
the president offered last year to let valero or anybody else build a new refinery on a closed military base waiving all environmental laws and the chief operating officer of valero stock up 263 percent in one year you thought google was doing good he said why would we do that
we need real help for americans shortterm relief against price gouging take on opec in the world trade organization
number two i have been saying this for the 9 years i have been in congress we need a forwardlooking energy policy that puts real teeth into conservation and renewables so that we can reduce our dependence on foreign oil
well i offered an amendment both in committee and at the committee on rules which was denied
i think that the majority of coloradans who voted for an initiative on a ballot last year would agree with this along with the rest of americans
vote for the substitute and no on final
we have had no hearings on the specific measure before us
we do not know what these new provisions on refinery sitings are going to do
if we decide to act on an expedited basis we should be focusing on immediate problems of rising gasoline prices and anticipated increases in natural gas and home heating oil prices which are coming upon us in the fall
it would be more appropriate to call this the do nt hold your breath act as this bill will not do what my colleagues on the other side claim
this bill ignores this obvious fact and instead focuses on eliminating environmental protections which is nothing more than a scapegoat measure that will not do anything to address the basic problem
since he has left the floor i want to take this time to praise the very distinguished chairman of the committee on energy and commerce the gentleman from texas mr barton xz4000180
the combination of the base text of the bill and the manager s amendment which will be in fact passed when we pass this rule we address the concerns on heating oil put forward by the very distinguished gentleman from massachusetts mr markey xz4002530 and you can go right down the line and look at a number of issues that were brought forward by members of the minority including the gentleman from illinois mr rush xz4003500 the gentleman from washington mr inslee xz4001930 the gentleman from washington mr dicks xz4001090 and others who have raised issues of concern and the gentleman from texas mr barton xz4000180 has worked diligently to address those
i thank my friends for their hard work on this important issue
just today in the newspaper it reported that americans can expect to spend 45 to 90 percent more on home heating fuel this year than they did last winter
under the guise of responding to hurricane katrina we are voting on a bill that guts environmental and public health protections and does nothing to reduce our nation s devastating dependence on middle eastern oil
further we are once again witnessing the majority undermining states rights on the floor of the house
i offered an amendment that was turned back by the committee on rules that would have protected these lands which have been set aside for the american people
i think it is a sad day when the republican party is no longer holding on to the environmental mantle
one of my predecessors pete mccloskey was a great champion in the congress on those issues and i think it is regrettable that that is where the republicans are today because if there were more that would stand up we would be able to put into place a bill that would really serve the american people well
he wrote we just broke ground on a new brick plant and should be in operation by august of 2006
the bill on the floor today is nothing more than a giveaway to big oil companies and on top of this it contains environmental rollbacks that the administration has been unsuccessfully pursuing for years for gas and coal fired power plants
these provisions would relax existing pollution controls on thousands of industrial facilities across the country in what one energy industry official even called the most blatant attack on state and local environmental authority that he s ever seen
i urge my colleagues to vote against this bill and to support the substitute that provides real provisions to crack down on price gouging
mr speaker these are very hard times for energy consumers from people on fixed incomes filling up their tanks to multibillion dollar chemical companies facing soaring natural gas feedstock costs
throughout this process i have been concerned with both parties approach to consumer protection on gasoline prices
my constituents are extremely concerned with air pollution in our district and we are working on solutions with the help of both industry and residents
the amendment would require the department of energy to review and approve and offer recommendations on fuel supply segments of state evacuation plans
while the impetus for the bill arose from tragedy it opened our eyes to the vulnerability of our nation s gasoline supply and causes us to act to prevent the price spikes and shortages from happening again and everything we have said or done here on this floor is going to be in the lt em gt lt em gt congressional record for the american people to see
if you want your constituents to keep on paying these exorbitant prices then go ahead and vote against this bill
however i am appalled at this effort by the republican majority to exploit this national tragedy to weaken environmental public health and consumer protections under the guise of lower gasoline prices and protect consumers from pricegouging on gasoline
this is why it was opposed by every democrat on the committee on energy and commerce
it focuses all price gouging efforts on momandpop retailers rather than the big oil companies and refiners who are actually reaping enormous profits
the washington post reported last month that over the past year refinery profit margins on a gallon of gasoline have increased over 255 percent
yet the bill could also put taxpayers on the hook for unlimited damages if a refinery is stalled in litigation or must meet new regulatory standards
these communities will not be able to develop sites for years even if the federal government does not ultimately build refineries on them
i am incredulous as to how we could be considering a bill that is supposed to address high gasoline prices and not have a debate on increasing the efficiency with which vehicles use fuel
that is why i oppose hr 3893 and support the democratic substitute which will provide real enforcement against energy price gouging and establish a strategic refinery reserve patterned on the successful strategic petroleum reserve to protect against loss of refinery capacity
mr chairman had we had hearings on this bill perhaps your questions could have been answered
but do not take my word for it just listen to the republican chairman of the house committee on science the gentleman from new york mr boehlert xz4000350
in a letter that he sent today after the committee on rules reported the manager s amendment late last night the gentleman from new york mr boehlert xz4000350 wrote in a dear colleague please join me in voting no on hr 3893 which will increase the deficit harm the environment undermine the states and give charity to the oil companies while doing virtually nothing to help consumers chairman boehlert s remarks
further it provides the ftc with authority to stop market manipulation and provide information on price transparency
finally the bill builds on the proven success of the strategic petroleum reserve by requiring the federal government to operate strategic refinery reserve to ensure adequate supply of refined products in emergency situations
i appreciate chairman barton s willingness to work with me on this issue
the gasoline security act as reported by the committee on energy and commerce includes language that takes away states rights to have state decisions on clean water act permits and water quality related to the placement of refineries and pipelines decided in state courts
the provisions contained in both the refinery and pipeline titles of the gasoline security act are modeled on a similar provision in the recently enacted energy policy act
since 2001 home heating oil costs have nearly tripled and natural gas costs have more than doubled nearing crisis levels for homeowners and americans on a fixed and low income
president bush recently gave a speech calling on consumers to conserve gasoline and other fuels
oil is putting us on a path to economic ruin
dear representative on friday october 7 the house will consider hr 3893 the gasoline for america s security gas act of 2005 this bill takes the approach that environmental laws must be weakened in order to encourage the us refining industry to expand or construct new refining capacity
these prices were well on their way to hitting record highs long before hurricane katrina
and the washington post noted that those profit margins have soared even higher in 2005 to 99 cents on each gallon sold for a more than 300 percent increase since 1999
an executive of this company made clear that he would rather sell less gasoline and earn a higher margin on each gallon sold than sell more gasoline and earn a lower margin
it is important to note however that this gao report severely underestimates the impact mergers have on prices because their price analysis stops in 2000 long before the mergers that created chevrontexaco conocophillips and valeroultramardiamond shamrockpremcor
we have heard legitimate questions about how much of the recent increase in energy costs is the result of price fixing yet this legislation s provisions to combat price gouging are insufficient and amount to no more than a slap on the wrist
i support the democratic plan to establish strong federal laws and new penalties to crack down on price gouging
yet in the name of hurricane katrina the house majority leadership is pushing a bill that does nothing to reduce our dependence on oil lower gas prices or help americans get through the upcoming winter
we need to bring some real transparency into the oil industry and shine the brightest possible light on how these companies making billions in record profits are squeezing every possible dollar out of the american people
this amendment based on legislation proposed by connecticut attorney general richard blumenthal would have gotten straight to the heart of high gas prices by freeing our local gas stations from the hold of big oil companies
as a result many of these owners who may own two or more stations last night while i was waiting at the rules committee to testify on our amendment i had the opportunity to listen to many of my colleagues offer amendments that would have significantly improved this bill
from increasing fuel efficiency addressing the natural gas crisis and making our nation energy independent it was clear to me that there are many worthwhile ideas that deserve real debate on the house floor
let us take on the price gouging and market manipulation that is happening at all levels of oil production and distribution
let us have a real discussion on how we can free our nation from dependence on foreign oil and develop the hydrogen and fuel cell technologies that will lead our energy future
these debates are not taking place on the house floor today
once again instead of allowing us to take a real stand to address our shortand longterm energy needs the committee on rules has reported a restrictive rule that rejects consideration of many amendments which would have made this bill much better
despite a recent survey indicating that 86 percent 86 percent of americans favor an increase in fuel economy standards the committee on rules prevented prevented consideration of the boehlertmarkey amendment which would do just that
it would have discouraged price gouging by implementing a windfall tax on oil and gasoline profits
and we were also prevented from considering the larsonslaughter amendment which would have put an end an end to gasoline price discrimination based on location creating a free market for gasoline dealers
our current energy strategy will only further increase our dependence on foreign oil
the fact that gas prices shot up in the wake of this monstrous hurricane is a reflection of the reality that we do not have the capability to meet the sort of refining needs the country has that will put the kind of pressure on gas prices that are so important to our consuming public
in the last year i met on several occasions with adel aljubeir a representative of the country of saudi arabia
on any number of occasions he has rather smiled at me saying america does not have the capacity to provide the gasoline that your consuming public needs
i strongly urge an aye vote on this measure
rather it s another taxpayer subsidy from the republican majority to the oil and gas companies while the american people continue to face the increasing burdens that the rising cost of fuel is placing on family budgets
it is a set of giveaways to big oil and to big gas while simultaneously out here on the floor the last two speakers are calling for a gutting of environmental laws and cutting of medicaid and other social programs for the poorest people in our country as a response to hurricanes katrina and rita
this republican party is so out of touch that it believes that the oil and gas industries the wealthiest industries in our country the industries that are tipping american consumers upsidedown and shaking money out of their pockets is the first bill they should bring to the floor to respond to hurricane katrina even after 10 years of a conscious conspiracy on the part of the oil industry to shut down 30 refineries voluntarily
that is what is going on out here on the floor this leavenooilmanbehind bill
we should be debating out here on the floor which the republicans refuse to do
increasing fuel economy standards for automobiles they refuse to even allow that debate out here on the floor
increasing doubling tripling quadrupling solar energy wind energy out here on the floor they refuse to have that debate
president kennedy had a plan for us to take on the soviet union
what they have out here today on the floor is a huge excavation device digging our country ever deeper without looking at automotive technology solar technology and the future of technology for our country
we should be able to have that debate and vote on this issue today
when the last republican energy bill was on the house floor in july the speaker of the house said it promotes greater refinery capacity so more gasoline will be on the market and it increases gasoline supply by putting an end to the proliferation of boutique fuels eight weeks later this house is about to repeal the refinery provisions the speaker praised and replace with a whole new refinery bill
this bill is based on a false premise the premise that somehow our nation s environmental laws stand in the way of building more refineries around the country
twentyone of the 30 refineries that the refiners voluntarily closed or 78 of the shut down refinery capacity were located in states that are not on the gulf coast and therefore would not have been affected by hurricanes katrina or rita
consider this a 1996 chevron internal memo stated that a senior energy analyst at the recent api american petroleum institute convention warned that if the us petroleum industry does nt reduce its refining capacity it will never see any substantial increase in refinery margins a march 1996 memo from texaco discussed concerns that the most critical factor facing the refining industry on the west coast is the surplus of refining capacity and the surplus gasoline production capacity
but it s terrible news if you re a consumer paying 300 a gallon or more to fill up the gas tank on your car or paying a 1 000 more this winter to fill up the oil tank to heat your home
is it going to impose a windfall profit tax on the big oil companies
i strongly urge a no vote on the rule and a no vote on final passage
now that the public s attention is on it the republican majority refuses to have a debate on how we can dramatically increase the fuel economy standards for suvs and automobiles and we put 70 percent of all the oil we consume into gasoline tanks
we also are not having the debate out here on solar energy
europe now outspends us on solar energy by four to one
no debate however under the republican rules on solar energy as a solution
instead what we have here is new law which will allow for refineries to be built on closeddown military bases on wildlife refuges with a mayor or a state incapable of blocking it
the race is on
we re not even tying up the laces on our running shoes
they call on jihadists everywhere to attack not just people but also oil wells and pipelines arguing that the killing of 10 american soldiers is nothing compared to the impact of the rise in oil prices on america and the disruption that it causes in the international economy the decisions being made today by the republicancontrolled congress are handicapping our nation at the starting line
aggressive renewable energy policies have put europe on track to increase electricity generated from wind tenfold and from solar photovoltaics 45 times by 2020
we spend a paltry 80 million on photovoltaics for example whereas europe spends 300 million
we owe our citizens a new vision for america s energy future to hang their hopes on
by 1969 neil armstrong was standing on the moon looking up at the earth
instead of the bill before us now we should be bringing a bill to the floor of this house which would adopt a national policy of cutting our dependence on imported oil in half within the next decade
that is what we need to be doing on the floor of this house and that is what the bill before us today entirely fails to do
the republican energy bill that we passed just 8 weeks ago contained a refinery siting proposal that the speaker of the house said promotes greater refinery capacity so more gasoline will be on the market and it increases gasoline supply by putting an end to the proliferation of boutique fuels the bill before us today repeals that provision
the republican energy bill that we passed just 8 weeks ago contained boutique fuels language that you mr chairman praised on the house floor arguing that they would make it more efficient to use our boutique fuels by reducing the number of these fuels so that we have greater transportability of our boutique fuels between those regions of the country that need those fuel sources now the bill you have brought before us today has repealed that provision
instead of allowing state and local officials to make land use decisions to consider environmental impacts impacts on local communities on historic or cultural sites or other factors we are going to have the bureaucrats at the department of energy and the federal energy regulatory commission make these decisions
at the same time the substitute creates a new strategic refinery reserve that builds on the highly successful strategic petroleum reserve
if my colleagues on the other side of the aisle do not appreciate that fact i would suggest that they go home to their districts and listen to their constituents
that is what we should be doing today here on the floor
we must crack down on price gouging in the short term and find other ways to lower prices
in the long term we should reduce our reliance on foreign oil by aggressively pursuing renewable energy sources something that we should have been doing a long time ago
mr chairman as you know the high energy costs are having a very negative effect on the low income home energy assistance program and many state liheap programs are expecting a major increase in applications and need for additional funding immediately to help ensure lowincome families and seniors can afford to heat their homes
i recently joined with more than 100 of my colleagues in writing to the committee on appropriations members requesting 1276 billion in additional liheap funding and i hope mr chairman that you would work with me and other members who share those concerns to make sure this very important assistance program will be available to those who need it in the upcoming winter heating season
because we have a history on this house floor of illegalities taking place to change people s vote
instead we are turning our back on the people and are catering to the selfinterests of the highest bidders
history will not look favorably on the actions of this administration and this congress
so this amendment could permit a powerplant even one where its emissions directly affected a national park for example to refurbish or add a new boiler to double its no x and particulate emissions triple its so lt cite gt lt cite gt 2 emissions and cover these so lt cite gt lt cite gt 2 emissions by purchasing allowances and never have to demonstrate what impact this would have on visibility or other air quality standards
had the current president s father adopted tougher cafe standards put us on a gradual path to 27 miles per gallon for light trucks and 34 gallons for cars we would have displaced all oil we import from the persian gulf today
while coal uranium and some renewable sources such as wind and hydro comprise a majority of the fuel used to generate electricity most of our economy is dependent or exclusively reliant on oil from fertilizers for agriculture plastics for manufacturing to gasoline and diesel for transportation
it rushes us closer to the day oil shortages occur and sets us backward on our ability to address it
the gasoline for america s security act builds on the energy policy act of 2005 and keeps us moving in the right direction
there will be a temptation to blame the high gas prices on the storms alone or to use politics to block this
the second thing i want to point out is that i wish we could have included some important movement forward to make some changes on new source review
and they go on to say that delaying the new source review issue is costly to jobs
so i want to make sure that we address this the next time when we get on to more of these energy issues
dear congressmen barton and dingell on behalf of the members of unions for jobs and the environment and the united association of journeymen and apprentices of the plumbing and pipe fitting industry we write to express our support for section 106 of hr 3893 the gasoline for america s security act of 2005 the act to provide much needed clarification of the new source review nsr program
by applying nsr in that way our members will not have the opportunity to work on projects that we know are extremely important to energy efficiency
thank you for your consideration of our view on this important matter
and i was saying these guys on the republican side of the aisle have been building up deficits ever since president bush came into office
i have statistics here that this budget resolution which they were going to vote on last week and now they so far can not get the votes for it and hopefully they will never get the votes for it that they were talking about will increase the deficit by more than 100 billion over 5 years
on the other hand in iraq they rehabilitated 2 717 schools and 36 000 teachers and administrators were trained
i did not support the war and i still oppose the war but i do not mind spending some money to help rebuild iraq but it is not fair to spend all of this money on iraq and cut money for americans
mr speaker the budget bill that they want us to vote on the one we were supposed to vote on last week cuts funding for levees again not necessarily the one in new orleans but other levees in louisiana
they had just come back the republican colleagues had just come back from iraq and they had been there on the first day of school
i will never forget because i was on the floor waiting to do a special order and three or four of my republican colleagues they brought back with them the book bags and the pencils
they had these book bags that were in blue and they had emblazoned on them the seal of the united states with the eagle
they were so proud of the fact that every iraqi school child on the opening day of school had received a book bag with the seal of the us pencils pads all kinds of things free of charge
the pride that was on the faces of my republican colleagues for all the wonderful things we were doing in iraq and i kept saying that was very nice but we do not have those things here in my district
they do not want any kind of effort on a bipartisan basis which would happen with the gentleman s subcommittee because it might reveal that they have basically created a lot of problems and screwed up on a lot of things
i commend the gentleman from michigan for his great leadership and i thank him for his great leadership on behalf of the american consumer and the american taxpayer
i also want to commend the gentleman from michigan mr dingell xz4001100 the distinguished ranking member of the full committee for his extraordinary leadership on this and so many issues
yet for the second time in 1 month the republicans have brought a bill to the floor that fails to address price gouging fails to bring down prices and fails to put us on the road to energy independence
the republicans in this culture of corruption and cronyism came down on the side of greed
for weeks democrats have demanded a new federal law to crack down on price gouging by the energy industry
here we have a bill on the floor that will do just that
the stupakboucher bill gives the federal trade commission broad authority to crack down on price gouging for a wide range of fuels for businesses all along the supply chain
mr speaker i rise in support of the rule and the underlying bill and commend chairman barton for his exceptional and timely work on this legislation
for what began as a hurricane of nature very quickly became a hurricane of spending here on capitol hill 60 billion appropriated in 6 days paid for by simply adding to the national debt
so i rise today to say on behalf of house conservatives we are pleased but not content
when we bring on supply our market system works and prices will come down but then we have to have we have to have the refineries to refine it
it is the one we have where we can be totally selfsufficient in this country on the clean fuel natural gas that fuels our industry heats our homes heats our schools heats our hospitals
mr speaker i am a little surprised by the discourse from my colleagues on the other side of the aisle very 1960s rhetoric for a 2005 problem
it says we are going to protect the environment we are encouraging some conservation and we are going to build capacity so that we do not have to have this foreign dependence on refined product
this legislation builds on progress we had in the energy bill dealing with boutique fuels but what i want to do is explain the problem we have with boutique gasoline blends in america
so we go from 18 different base blends with 45 different fuels down to six fuels to make sure we can meet and exceed our clean air act standards no compromise on those and have stable fungible blends of gasoline
i would like to say my friends on the other side who were talking about saving money and controlling the deficits that are projected as far as the eye can see 500 billion i would like to say to our friends mr speaker go to wwwthomasgov and you can get the votes for two particular votes that i think the american people and members of this chamber would be interested in
that is a bill that spent 700plus billion dollars on the medicare prescription drug program and did absolutely nothing to control the costs of drugs by allowing for reimportation from canada that would drive the costs down or allow for the secretary of health now my friends on the other side who have spent the last hour being so critical i find their names on the aye column
a couple of our friends on the other side said well the projected budget is going to be 100 billion or 80 billion less than what they thought it was going to be because the tax cuts are actually working
so there was a tax put on a small business people that raised money to the tune of 80 billion
they are spending money on the country s credit card as my good friend has said
then they came back months later and said it was 700 billion no controls on the price
if you can hear and see and think you know what they are saying on the other side is not making sense
we have a plan you go to the house committee on the budget to balance the budget
i do not think that is a bold political move but the wealthiest people are the only ones in this country who have not been asked to sacrifice in some way to pay for the two or three wars that we have going on and the greatest natural and national disaster this country has ever seen
mr speaker if the gentleman would yield briefly i just want to share a thirdparty validator that we have as we continue talking about welfare in the united states and what it is being spent on
the money that is getting cut and we understand that reform needs to take place and our friends on the other side have not been willing to do it but to cut 94 million in community health care and community health centers that is preventative medicine
they have had the senate since 2000 or 2001 definitely since 2002 and on and off through the 1990s and the white house since 2001
mr speaker reclaiming my time the decisions that we need to make have to be focused on what is best for the country not what is best for one s political party and i think that has really been the problem
let us look at the cia leak and the corruption that is going on
to out a cia agent because their husband disagreed with them on the war is choosing their party and protecting their party over what is best for the country
and the democrats are providing time and time again in committee on the floor with amendments with ideas whether it is lend the money whether it is reduce the cost for prescription drugs whether it is strip the billions of dollars in subsidies that went to the oil companies the democrats have always provided an alternative a change to take the country in another direction
what they do not understand and find incredibly ridiculous is that we import refined product just making us more dependent on the industry
this bill is a tremendous step forward in decreasing our reliance on foreign oil new technology diversifying our refinery portfolio and i ask all of my colleagues to join me in support of this legislation
we have got a lot of good members on the committee on energy and commerce and i have great respect for my friends the gentleman from michigan mr stupak xz4003910 and the gentleman from virginia mr boucher xz4000430 who come here with serious public policy concerns
i want to speak on an issue they do not address in fact i think they roll back which i think is critical to addressing the price spike and that is boutique fuels
these environmental regulations on the boutique fuels really make sense
missouri s fourth congressional district is primarily rural and residents rely heavily on transportation in going about their daily lives
that is not me talking the chairman of the house committee on energy and commerce the gentleman from texas mr barton xz4000180 admitted this very fact in the committee on rules yesterday
i know because we debated many of those measures in the committee on rules just last night
we are offering that amendment by the gentleman from michigan mr stupak xz4003910 as a substitute for the bill but it begs the question what is the leadership doing with their time and energy if we can not have a real debate on how to solve these very real problems
amendments that were not allowed to be considered called for those things but the gas act is silent on them
by intentionally limiting the supply of available gasoline on the market they keep its price up
that is more money than we have spent on the war in iraq and it is split between just five companies
rather than punish this outrageous immoral and deeply damaging practice the bill will place a limit on the maximum daily fine that can be given to an individual guilty of that practice
the legislation included an unjustified attack on the clean air act and was intent on rolling back 30 years of progress on protecting the quality of air that we and our children breathe
thankfully the majority was shamed into removing such a provision from the bill as its own rank and file objected to this basic assault on the health of our country
mr speaker i object to the vote on the ground that a quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not present
mr speaker today i rise in opposition to the antipublic health anticonsumer gas act the legislation is an insult to the american public which needs real relief but this is an attack on our public health and it is a giveaway to corporate america
this is a washington bill drafted on k street by those lobbyists and is an attack on our public health
give the federal government sole authority to place new refineries even those not on federal land
we could have raised fuel economy standards today the one policy that would actually have a dramatic impact on gas prices but the majority blocked the house from even voting on the issue
then again it would hardly be germane to consider such an amendment on a bill that has nothing whatsoever to do with lowering gas prices
i vote no on this reckless bill
it will direct federal trade commission expertise and resources in addition to existing state antigouging laws on eliminating retail and wholesale price gouging in a designated disaster area as well as any extended problem in the areas around the country as determined by the president and the secretary of energy
if you are going to vote against this bill you are going to vote against a provision that establishes for the first time price gouging that is defined and prosecuted on a federal level
unfortunately the tremendous goodwill of the american people in helping their fellow citizens on the devastated gulf coast was marred by some now infamous instances of gasoline price gouging
the gas gouging prevention act will direct ftc expertise and resources in addition to existing state antigouging laws on eliminating retail and wholesale price gouging in a designated disaster area as well as any extended problem areas around the country as determined by the president and secretary of energy
i thank my colleagues especially mr walden for their help in making the amendment even better and i urge that we pass gas price gouging prevention act included in hr 3893 the gasoline for america s security act in closing this legislation will go a long way to better protect the us oil markets as well as all consumers who depend on them
so the chairman and i and others on the committee went back and we incorporated a lot of what the gentleman from michigan mr stupak xz4003910 brought up in the debate
as a member on this side of the aisle i wanted to thank the gentleman from michigan mr stupak xz4003910 for his help so that we are able to include in the manager s amendment some of his points and i think we made a stronger bill
i would say to those members on both sides of the aisle there is really no reason to support the stupak amendment because lots of what he is talking about dealing with price gouging as i mentioned earlier in my speech we have included in the manager s amendment
the stupak amendment caps damages at 3 million per day while the manager s amendment allows for 11 000 per violation with no cap on the amount of damages that can be assessed
the stupak amendment caps damages at 3 million per day while the manager s amendment allows for 11 000 per violation with no cap on the amount of damages that can be assessed
i would like to commend them for their support on this important initiative
i would also like to thank the gentleman from virginia mr boucher xz4000430 for his hard work on the refinery portions of this amendment
i would also like to recognize congressmen bishop barrow and etheridge and congresswomen herseth and schwartz for their valued input on this legislation
our amendment would ensure that the president has the tools needed to adequately respond to any energy emergency and prohibits price gouging on all petroleum products with a priority on refineries and big oil
currently there are only 28 states that have laws on the books that define price gouging and have enforcement mechanisms to go after those ripping off consumers
it will provide the federal trade commission with new authority to investigate and prosecute those that engage in predatory pricing from oil companies on down to gas stations with the emphasis on those who profit the most
our amendment also empowers the federal government to impose tough civil penalties of up to triple damage on all excess profits on companies that have cheated consumers
sadly the majority bill does nothing to crack down on those who are manipulating the market and price gouging
i urge a yes vote on our amendment
under the rulemaking process you myself just about all of us have an opportunity to put in our two cents worth on what we feel may be excessive market manipulation or price gouging
so again if you want to dwell on a word or two i think all americans know when they are being excessively gouged at the pump
mr chairman if you look on page 18 on how it would be implemented it is starting on line 9 we have the implementation plan and it must be established within 2 years and how they are going to do it
as i said earlier this year when the house passed the energy policy act there is nothing i d rather vote for than a balanced energy bill that sets us on a forwardlooking course one that acknowledges that this country is overly dependent on a single energy source fossil fuels to the detriment of our environment our national security and our economy
the bill instructs the president to designate sites on federal lands including closed military installations for the purposes of siting a refinery
as he writes in a letter on behalf of the adc shifting the responsibility to the federal government for planning how closed military installation will be reused would interfere with the timetested approach developed over the past two decades
there is nothing in the brac statute or in new dod regulations that prevents a local community through its redevelopment authority from building or permitting an oil refinery on a military base
it fails on the demand side by not increasing vehicle fuel economy standards which have been frozen since 1996
hurricanes katrina and rita did highlight a serious problem this country faces our excessive reliance on fossil fuels
instead we should act to wean our nation from its dependence on fossil fuels especially foreign oil
the republican leadership claims this bill will help us reduce our dependence on foreign oil by stimulating domestic development and production
our excessive dependence on fossil energy is a pressing matter of national security
we need to think anew to devise an energy security strategy that will give future generations of americans an economy less dependent on oil and fossil fuels
the bottom line is if we are not happy with 3 gas we need to vote yes on this bill
we have a bill on the floor today that had no hearings
there is no excuse for this legislation to allow children with asthma to have to suffer more medical problems on the eastern coast of the united states in order to address a tragedy in the gulf coast of the united states
when there is a markup without members having more than a day to review it when the bill is rewritten and put on the house floor without members having had a chance to review it when the vote is held open a long period of time after the time has expired does that not make the house a banana republic
mr speaker one of the things that bothered me at the time of katrina and then rita was when you saw on the television long lines of cars at gas stations that were charging 5 or 6 for gas that you knew they did not pay that much to get in there
only 23 states have antigouging laws on the books and definitions vary widely
today we rely on foreign sources of oil to supply 60 percent of our energy needs
i understand the serious impact that rising fuel prices have on the everyday lives of people and the strength of our economy
mr speaker i am giving the benefit of the doubt to chairman barton and the energy and commerce committee on this bill and i will vote for it albeit reluctantly to help move the process forward
but i believe we need more debate especially on the issue of making certain we maintain strong environmental protections for clean air and water and endangered species when siting refineries and i am hopeful that the house can negotiate with the senate to come up with a more balanced bill
if our nation ever hopes to reduce its dependence on imported oil we also must increase automobile fuel economy standards
i also believe we must have tough penalties on price gouging
indeed it is difficult to see how the house could be seen to have a complete debate on the availability of gasoline without a discussion of fuel economy standards
a debate on gasoline needs to include measures that will address that fact especially when the national academy of sciences concluded four years ago that the technology exists to accomplish fuel economy goals costeffectively and safely
the house needs and deserves to have a discrete debate on fuel economy just as it has had during the debate on past energy bills
we urge you to allow a clear full and open debate on the single measure that would do the most to reduce the us demand for oil
what that means is if they encounter some sort of reasonable delay government regulation or something like that and they suffer losses and they can not open on time or they are delayed in their operations we the taxpayer get to pay for that
mr speaker i hope the american people are watching this debate and if they are watching this debate on tv i hope they have a video recorder because they need to record this debate
let us quit blaming the people who are trying to be leaders in this country and put us on the right track for an energy policy
mr speaker i want to address a serious problem with the underlying bill and that is that it relies exclusively on the federal trade commission and its willingness and ability and resources to enforce the price gouging remedy in the bill
well mr speaker relying on a sorry bunch of people that do not know their job do not care about their job and do not believe in their job is like going hunting and having to tote the dog
mr speaker i rise in strong support of the stupakboucherbishopschwartzbarrow substitute amendment and i want to thank the gentleman from michigan mr stupak xz4003910 for his leadership on this issue of national importance
these steep costs make it difficult for hardworking americans to meet their financial obligations and they underscore the reality that the president and the majority party in congress have failed to enact policies to protect american consumers from price gouging and reduce the nation s overall dependence on gasoline and oil
it ignores the harsh realities of price gouging at the pump by weakening our ability to crack down on those trying to manipulate the market for their own profit
we must reduce our reliance on foreign oil
that comes on top of doubledigit price increases that they had to absorb last year and it means they will pay on average an additional 335 to heat their homes this winter
winter can be very cold in pennsylvania and if congress fails to take immediate action some of my constituents will simply not have enough money to pay these high prices and may be forced to choose between heating their homes and putting food on their table
mr speaker i was not present for debate on rollcall vote no
516 on approving the journal and rollcall vote no
the record is pretty clear on both sides that we have not built a new refinery since 1976
we put the doe in charge of shepherding the permitting process not making the decisions on behalf of the state and the federal regulators but simply encouraging them to get it done on a timely basis
we owe our constituents more than empty promises on high gas prices
a forwardlooking energy policy should curb our reliance on unstable foreign oil markets and accelerate research for alternative sources of energy
this is not exactly the bold outofthebox thinking that will free the next generation from dependence on foreign sources of energy
unfortunately the food industry has been targeted by a variety of unfounded legal claims which allege businesses should pay monetary damages and be subject to equitable remedies based on novel legal theories of liability for the overconsumption of its legal products
in the subcommittee on commercial and administrative law which i chaired last congress we explored the threat the food industry and its workers face from frivolous litigation the threat to personal responsibility posed by the proliferation of such litigation and the need for passage of the personal responsibility in food consumption act
without a complete ban on these frivolous lawsuits rogue trial lawyers and i have many trial lawyers who are friends and who work very hard to get the appropriate kind of compensation for people who are injured but many of these rogue trial lawyers will forum shop until they find a state and a district that gets them the exorbitant payday that they seek
mr chairman the amendment was defeated last year on the floor by voice vote
i am not sure when we would work together on the amendment
i suppose perhaps in conference we could work on the issue but i am loath to commit the chairman to that process
even the ultraliberal los angeles times has stated this is wrong saying in an editorial if kids are chowing down to excess on junk food are nt their parents responsible for cracking down
people should nt get stuffed but this line of litigation should even our best obesity doctors realize that this amendment is another sad assault on the concept of parental responsibility
this gutting amendment was defeated on the house floor last year by a vote of 241 to 177 and it should be defeated again this year
in any case section 4 5 b of hr 544 makes it clear that obesityrelated lawsuits can be brought by anyone who can prove he suffered harm as a result of a violation of state or federal law including laws that prohibit deceptive or misleading advertising by showing he individually and justifiably relied on such deceptive or misleading advertising and that such reliance was the proximate cause of the injury
mr chairman the amendment is substantially the same as the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from texas ms jacksonlee xz4001990 which was defeated on the house floor last year by a vote of 166 to 250 and it should be defeated again this year
he said the following at a senate hearing on this legislation lawsuits are pointing fingers at the food industry in an attempt to curb the nation s obesity epidemic
playing the courtroom blame game wo nt make anyone thinner or healthier section 4 5 b of hr 554 makes it clear that obesityrelated lawsuits can be brought by anyone who can prove he has suffered harm as a result of a violation of state or federal law including laws that prohibit deceptive or misleading advertising by showing they individually and justifiably relied on such deceptive or misleading advertising and such reliance was the proximate cause of their injury
so if a manufacturer of a health bar or a diet shake lies concerning the calorie content of the food and someone relies on that false statement and suffers injury the person can sue the manufacturer under this legislation
this is an industry that has a direct impact on the nation s economy and these fastfood obesity lawsuits are opposed by nearly nine in 10 americans
heart disease high blood pressure hypertension joint problems asthma diabetes and cancer are on the increase with these young children and a steady diet of fast food is the last thing they need
sure they ought to make the right choice and sure their parents ought to make the right choices but the pressure is on them through television
mr speaker by direction of the committee on rules i call up house resolution 494 and ask for its immediate consideration
it provides 1 hour of general debate equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the committee on the judiciary
it provides that the amendment in the nature of a substitute recommended by the committee on the judiciary and now printed in the bill shall be considered as an original bill for the purpose of amendment
this resolution makes in order only those amendments printed in the committee on rules report accompanying the resolution and it provides that the amendments printed in the report may be considered only in the order printed in the report may be offered only by a member designated in the report shall be considered as read shall be debatable for the time specified in the report equally mr speaker i rise today to speak on behalf of house resolution 494 and the underlying bill hr 554 the personal responsibility in food consumption act
first i want to take this opportunity to thank the distinguished chairman of the committee on the judiciary the gentleman from wisconsin mr sensenbrenner xz4003650 and the ranking member the gentleman from michigan mr conyers xz4000800 and additionally i want to commend the gentleman from florida mr keller xz4002120 a member of the committee on the judiciary for authoring the underlying bill
a recent gallup poll found that approximately 9 in 10 americans a number of whom are themselves in the ranks of overweight or even obese opposed holding the fast food industry legally responsible for dietrelated health problems of people who eat that kind of food on a regular basis
having practiced medicine for nearly 30 years i am well aware of the habit and complications that obesity can wreak on a person s health especially over a long term
like most other americans i am also well aware that obesity is on the rise in our country and particularly among our children
for every frivolous case that takes up a spot on the docket a legitimate case where an individual is truly harmed and truly needs expeditious judicial review gets pushed farther and farther down the line
this alligator skin was obtained from a louisiana hunt it says on this belt 1993 manufactured by the trafalgar limited belt company a good company
if someone puts too much pressure around their waist by wearing a belt inappropriately by cinching it up too tightly they put compression on that nerve that lateral femoral cutaneous nerve and i speak from knowledge on this from 30 years as a practicing physician
mr speaker i would like to close by thanking my colleagues for a productive discussion on the rule and the underlying bill
the personal responsibility in food consumption act of 2005 is a good bill and i look forward to further discussing its merits on the house floor today
mr speaker i yield back the balance of my time and i move the previous question on the resolution
mr speaker on that i demand the yeas and nays
he has actually written a book and has another coming out soon on the subject
some of the bullet points these may be a little bit difficult to see mr speaker but hopefully we can focus the camera in on the bullet points
and then to come see the physician on a regular basis during the pregnancy
i want to if the gentleman would allow me to expand on this a bit
just a little historical perspective on that
we really need to focus on preventive care
i used a little analogy when i was talking about this on the floor yesterday in discussing the rule of my belt which is a size 36
that is i hate to admit the size of my waist but if i wanted really out of blind pride to suggest that i had a 24inch waist and i cinched that belt down a couple of notches in doing so i put pressure compression on something referred to as the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve it would result in a condition of numbness and lack of feeling on the anterior thigh
but quite honestly when a child goes to school and there is this emphasis on thinness and you see these youngsters wearing these britney spears jeans and that sort of thing a child even a little bit overweight and certainly one that is significantly obese of course they are going to have a poor image of themselves
it is very likely they are going to be picked on
yes unfortunately some even go on to harm themselves and possibly even commit suicide
we are talking about fruit that is lying on the ground sitting there rotting waiting for us to pick it up
the gentleman is so right and i appreciate the opportunity to weigh in on this issue
of course that part d will go into effect and the modernization piece is already in effect for medicare but part d the prescription drug part will start january 1 but all we heard and continue to hear particularly from the other side and for those naysayers who keep wanting to talk negative about really a very good program that is going to be a godsend for our neediest seniors i talked about this on the floor my colleagues i know heard me last night
but the talk the emphasis is on the cost of part d and the cost estimate is based on the number of seniors that participate ultimately
you get no credit for the fact that many people who sign up and yes there will be an additional medicare cost for them on this part d program but the fact that they are able to take those medications they can finally afford to take that statin to lower their cholesterol and that medication that insulin to lower their blood sugar or whatever antihypertensive to lower their blood pressure guess what the truth of the matter is and what the gentleman was emphasizing is that you get no credit for saving those costs not to mention the fact that it is so much more compassionate to spend money on prevention rather than treatment particularly when the treatment sometimes is not very successful and a person could ultimately be in a nursing home for years and disabled for the rest of their lives
we had about 225 billion more dollars which on the scoring side we get no credit for
so many of these things that we are talking about tonight in this hour these innovations these community health centers that the president has funded recommended and feels so strongly about on the scoring side you get no credit for but we do save money as the gentleman points out
options on a menu do not lead to obesity but unhealthy habits do
our nation is plagued by childhood obesity and heart disease and we should be looking into real solutions to this problem we should not be focusing our efforts on getting rid of one lawsuit currently pending against a fast food outlet
mr speaker i rise to join many of my colleagues in strongly opposing the restrictive rule set forth on hr 554 the the personal responsibility in food consumption act of 2005 as you know in light of the world we live and the importance of nutrition this is a very important piece of legislation
third i believe the legislation constitutes an unwarranted and hastily considered affront on our system of federalism
in closing let me note that while this issue may be important there are far more urgent issues we need to be focusing on at this time
we were in a homeland security hearing which is going on as many of my colleagues know assessing the circumstances with hurricane rita and hurricane katrina
my amendment would prohibit the food industry which enjoys broad immunity under this bill from initiating lawsuits against any person for damages or other relief due to injury or potential injury based on a person s consumption of a qualified product and weight gain obesity or any health condition that is associated with a person s weight gain or obesity
this amendment is necessary to ensure that the public debate on the health and nutritious effects of massmarketed food and products is not completely quelched by this bill
after years of litigation in my state transfer of her television show to texas and expenditure of over 1 million ms winfrey prevailed at trial and on appeal
those advancing healthy diets by discouraging the consumption of certain foods their right their constitutional right even though i come from a beef state because of their adverse effects perceived on a person s health and weight gain should not be subjected to litigation from the food industry while it stands immunized from any accountability under this bill
again i wish we were on the floor talking about restoring the drastic cuts in the budget reconciliation bill that deal with health care and deal with housing and deal with the various issues of education and special grants to help the least of those but we are on the floor talking about mcdonald s and burger king certainly friends of young parents who through their professions and other responsibilities did a lot of eating at burger king and mcdonald s but it does not in any way give them the privilege of denying consumer rights and the rights of consumers not to be retaliated against because they have expressed their viewpoint and the rights of the first amendment
but if we are to end the public s right to a jury trial on issues of food safety we can not end the public s right to freedom of speech by leaving food critics who play an important role in educating the public as i close stimulating positive change on good sound eating habits
mr chairman this amendment would prohibit the food industry which enjoys broad immunity under this bill from initiating lawsuits against any person for damages or other relief due to injury or potential injury based on a person s consumption of a qualified product and weight gain obesity or any health condition that is associated with a person s weight gain or obesity
this amendment is necessary to insure that the public debate on the health and nutritious effects of mass marketed food products is not completely squelched by this bill
after years of litigation transfer of her television show to texas and an expenditure of over one million dollars ms winfrey prevailed at trial and on appeal
those advancing healthy diets by discouraging the consumption of certain foods because of their adverse effects on a person s health and weight gain should not be subject to litigation from the food industry while it stands immunized from any accountability under this bill
but if we are to end the public s right to a jury trial on issues of food safety we can not end the public s right to freedom of speech by leaving food critic who play an important role in educating the public stimulating positive change and promoting sound eating habits open to lawsuits from an immunized industry
this amendment addresses this concern and insures that every american can engage in or has access to an open and honest debate on matters of public health
and now because of the avarice of a few it has become a huge target with a huge bullseye on its back
they said we need a debate on health care and i am pleased to engage in that debate
lawsuits do not reduce the 127 million annual medical costs that our nation incurs on obesityrelated conditions in children and the increase in obesity rates
it forces us to take personal responsibility for ourselves and our families and put a priority on establishing healthy lifestyles
it is very important for all families in our nation and certainly an issue that concerns all of us on both sides of the aisle
but what this means is not just more discussions on we are cutting money out of medicaid or other aspects
when we go into hospitals inpatientoutpatient you will see the latest equipment the greatest skilled personnel mris pt scans ct scans but very often we also see that data is kept on patients on pieces of paper
we have 21st century health technology kept on 16th century monitors
maybe they skip a prescription maybe they did not pick it up on time maybe they do not fully understand all the elements of diet and medications for complicated diseases
if in such cases the care was given ahead of time whether it is through a community health center a clinic direct patient care with a physician if we monitored and kept a careful eye on those children with chronic conditions we could save massive amounts of money
perhaps the physician referred the patient on to have some testing done and it was never done
indeed it is something we all have to work on and have responsibility for because whether they are healthy snacks that a person eats too much of or unhealthy snacks whatever that is we have to make sure that we watch our diet and have proper exercise
we need to go upstream and work on some basic prevention and that means quite frankly mothers and fathers across america have to work on these issues of teaching their children to be responsible for their own bodies making sure that we as members of congress are talking about these issues but making sure as we monitor how money is spent we are much better off looking at ways that funding could be given to communities programs to schools to hospitals to help make sure we are working on prevention of obesity rather than paying the high costs at the end of the line for so much of the increases in health care because obesity has continued to climb
many a child i saw in my clinical practice as a psychologist oftentimes came in a child who was well overweight teased by their peers struggled with this on top of their other physical problems
we see perhaps mental health problems are some sign of softness that perhaps people should be a little tougher take it on the chin not be so sensitive
sometimes we ridicule those who are on medication
jokes still abound on television calling people crazy loony out of control retarded in derogatory terms for something that we continue to see in this nation as a sign of weakness instead of a real disease
i would like to point to a couple of things here and then call upon the gentleman from georgia mr gingrey xz4001510 my colleague on a couple of questions
now i ask the gentleman from georgia mr gingrey xz4001510 on this he certainly treated many a patient who had medical complications as well as some of the psychological ones and i would like to ask him in looking at some of these more comprehensive chronic care models of how we need to be moving forward in a modern system of health care and not be just looking at individual disease but how looking at more advanced forms of bringing technology and changing the system how he sees that affecting the patient in a costeffective way
i wonder if the gentleman can comment on some of the complications that might come for that mother and that baby not only during labor and delivery but the longterm effects for that child when the mother smokes during pregnancy
of course another reason why i believe it is so important not only for the government but really for individuals and businesses to focus so much on helping to change that is the state of california for example estimates that their statewide tobacco prevention program during the 1990s resulted in overall cost savings of 84 billion in health care
businesses are picking up on this
i am reminded of the story of the fellow who was on his hands and knees late at night under a streetlight in the city probably had too much to drink and a police officer sees him and says excuse me sir what are you doing
and it is one of those things where unfortunately the political rhetoric comes through in this chamber and i do not know of anybody who has ever been cured by a floor speech but it certainly is one where there is just so much talk that continues on spending too much here spending too much there
the problem is not what we are spending but what we are spending it on
and if we are continuing to spend on wasteful or fraudulent or abusive or simply health care issues that are not taking care of the disparity of outcomes between for example low socioeconomic families families that are struggling to make ends meet and feel they do not have the money to pay for their doctor visits and those that may be in poverty we need to work on those disparities of outcomes and make sure that we take care of those children early on and that is why the issue of community health centers for our kids is so critically important
but instead we may focus on only that aspect of the cost of that medication instead of all the other costs that are saved there
it is a matter of pooling our resources together and looking at the answers to be sciencebased and not emotionbased on this
this is where if we do things like looking at electronic medical records and make sure that every hospital around the nation has this and providers and pharmacists have these you can find out these things and work on them together
my hope is that our colleagues drop the gloves on this put down the swords stop looking for opportunities to send out sound bytes and to have people make phone calls and use it as political fodder but instead to be able to look our constituents in the eye and say when we were all here when we were all granted the authority to do something about america we took an opportunity to save lives and save money and we ought to start with our children
furthermore it is common knowledge that a diet centering on supersized cheeseburgers french fries and sugarfilled colas is not healthy
thanks to the welfare state too many americans believe they are entitled to pass the costs of their mistakes on to a third party such as the taxpayers or a corporation with deep pockets while i oppose the idea of holding food manufacturers responsible for their customers misuse of their products i can not support addressing this problem by nationalizing tort law
after all the federal government imposes numerous taxes and regulations on the food industry often using the same phony proconsumer justifications used by the trial lawyers
the majority in congress has apparently already decided the proper outcome of these cases and is adjusting the law accordingly just for these cases rather than trusting our laws and our courts to hear evidence from both sides and decide the cases on their merits
the committee on education and the workforce likewise considered a case on appeal between the department of labor and a bank and voted to retroactively change the law to fix the result on behalf of the bank
there will always be special interests but we should not make special laws for those who can get to a congressman to introduce a bill on their behalf
also because hr 554 applies only to claims based on weight gain or obesity lawsuits could still proceed if for example someone gets sick from consuming tainted food
according to a recent gallup poll nearly nine in 10 americans oppose holding the fastfood industry legally responsible for dietrelated health problems of people who eat that kind of food on a regular basis
those who describe themselves as overweight are no more likely than others to blame the fastfood industry for obesityrelated health problems or to favor lawsuits against the industry as one judge put it if a person knows or should know that eating copious orders of supersized mcdonald s products is unhealthy and may result in weight gain it is not the place of the law to protect them from their own excesses even the los angeles times has editorialized against such lawsuits stating if kids are chowing down to excess on junk food are nt their parents responsible for cracking down
musante said the following at a hearing in the other body on this legislation through working with obese patients i have learned that the worst thing one can do is to blame an outside force to get themselves off the hook to say it s not their fault and that they are a victim
mr chairman i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from virginia mr goodlatte xz4001540 the chairman of the committee on agriculture
mr speaker on that i demand the yeas and nays
but i do have some questions and i think i will just present them in my comments and if somebody wants to comment on them they can
weight gain is a whole different issue and weight gain may occur not from obesity not from getting fat not from putting on too many calories weight gain can occur for a variety of medical reasons related to a variety of different causes
i rise in opposition to the bill because i think it is an overreaction and indeed i think it is perhaps an ultimate attestation to the fact that many of my colleagues have lost confidence and faith in the legal system on the one hand or that regardless of what the legal system does if it does not yield for them the result that they are seeking they are willing to compromise any principle that they have professed to stand for to achieve the result that they wish to achieve
the bill completely preempts those laws and brings to a screeching halt the work of 26 other states that have been working on pending legislation
have we lost confidence in our state legislatures that are in the middle of responding in their particular states to any problems that may be on the horizon in this area
i do not see many people on the floor
i would just say the people who maintain that hr 554 is necessary to make people responsible for their own choices and to thwart the unwarranted imposition of legal costs and fees on the food industry are just not being upfront with us about this one
in that sense the bill represents yet another arrogant attempt by this congress to impose its will on the states and i urge my colleagues to get a grip and understand what we are about to do here
i said it when we debated this bill the last time on the floor
we can not be so intent on getting a particular result so resultsoriented that we disregard everything that we have set up in place to deal with problems of this kind our judiciary our state legislatures our common sense
they have to go out and decide are there enough facts here on each and every cause of action against each and every defendant to win this case and win it profoundly
i know that the argument on the other side is that we want people to take personal responsibility but is it fair to say that there is personal responsibility when a company hides thousands of serious adverse effects as was the case with a company that had a product with ephedra in it or when a company does not warn about its risks when companies know about dangers and do not market their product responsibly
i would think this is not a good argument that we have heard on the other side and i would hope members would make this exception
i commend the gentleman from florida mr keller and chairman sensenbrenner for their work on this legislation and i urge passage of the bill
we now have precious few legislative days left on the calendar and an everexpanding list of legislative priorities yet the majority leadership has decided to take up a bill that preempts a handful of obesity lawsuits that are already being effectively handled in the courts
i am sure the american people would appreciate a debate on any of those issues over what we are doing today
in touting the merits of hr 554 my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have cited the need for american people to take responsibility for what they eat and how they live
if you talk to any health professional in the country whether it be the director of the national institutes of health or a nurse at a local clinic they will tell you that our health care system is on an unsustainable path especially when it comes to obesity
certainly it is not about addressing the larger issue obesity and its impact on the american health care system
i think i have voted on it a number of times in the past
the fact of the matter is all this bill does is the same thing the last version did that we voted on before and the one we voted on before that it protects licensed and law abiding firearms and ammunitions manufacturers and sellers from lawsuits that seek to hold them responsible for the crimes that thirdparty criminals commit
i wish we had not reached the day that we have to protect as we may later on this week restaurants and public schools from frivolous lawsuits related to obesity claims but the fact of the matter is we need to do that
i urge my colleagues to support this bill because it is a sad reality that legitimate industries in this country need special protection against entities that are looking to make money to provide new sources of revenue outside of the tax base and other ways of looking for people that can afford to settle on cases that they would never ever settle on under any other circumstance
this is a good bill and i urge the congress to adopt it when it comes up on the floor
it is critical that the house once again pass this legislation in order to reduce the burden of unsubstantiated lawsuits and the infringement on our second amendment rights
we must focus on the perpetrators of the crime rather than frivolous lawsuits directed at gun manufacturers which will only restrict the rights of lawabiding citizens
this right so essential to our liberty is under assault by legal teams bent on destroying the firearms industry
these lawsuits rest on the misguided notion that those in the firearm industry are liable for the criminal misuse of their products
the protection of lawful commerce in arms act will stop these lawsuits while protecting causes of action based on negligence defective product and other valid claims
in july of this year we gift wrapped a provision in the medical malpractice bill that shielded the pharmaceutical industry from liability on any drug that made it through the regular fda approval process
i am gratified to see that this bill does include certain commonsense provisions such as child safety locks and a ban on armorpiercing bullets
despite my support for these ideas i must vote no on the overall bill
this bill is about a direct assault on our civil justice system that endorses unscrupulous corporate behavior
very reasonable amendments were offered but the majority adopted a restrictive rule that prevented them from being heard on the floor today
one of those amendments would have expanded the ban on armorpiercing bullets also
i urge a strong no vote on this bill
madam speaker by direction of the committee on rules i call up house resolution 493 and ask for its immediate consideration
it provides 1 hour of general debate equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the committee on the judiciary
madam speaker before we open debate on the rule for s 397 the protection of lawful commerce in arms act prohibiting frivolous lawsuits against the firearm industry i would like to say that our nation s judicial system is out of control
every day without this legislation puts more stress on firearm manufacturers their customers and their employees
madam speaker i yield myself such time as i may consume before calling on the gentlewoman from pennsylvania
i want to point out madam speaker to the gentleman from florida my good friend regarding this particular legislation s 397 we have in this body not just in the 109th this year passed very very similar almost identical legislation and there were some 11 amendments i think offered during the markup in the committee on the judiciary
i think the vote on that particular bill was 285 to 140
madam speaker i yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from pennsylvania ms hart xz4001680 a member of the committee on the judiciary
snipers were successful in court on these grounds
mr speaker i want to point out that this bill on the house side hr 800 which was passed as i mentioned earlier by the house judiciary committee this bill actually had 257 cosponsors mr speaker
my colleagues certainly can do the math on the other side of the aisle
mr speaker i yield 2 12 minutes to the gentleman from new hampshire mr bass xz4000190 a member of the committee on energy and commerce
mr speaker i yield back the balance of my time and i move the previous question on the resolution
a motion to reconsider was laid on the table
over 30 states have enacted legislation to prevent junk lawsuits against the firearms industry based on the criminal behavior of others
the house has passed the protection of lawful commerce in arms act on several occasions
these frivolous lawsuits are often based on the dubious premise that gun manufacturers should be held liable for the actions of others who use their products in a criminal or unlawful manner
this bill will protect the firearms industry from lawsuits based on the criminal or unlawful thirdparty misuse of their products
unfortunately the american rule can mean that frivolous lawsuits which have no chance of going anywhere still impose a terrible burden on parties
so these folks do not have a problem spending nonprofit money and public money on a losing lawsuit in pursuit of ideology
if we are going to sue firearm makers for armed robberies why not go on and sue the auto maker who made the getaway car
we need to enforce the many gun laws that are currently on the books
the gentlewoman from new york mrs mccarthy xz4002570 my good friend who will speak on this issue later had an amendment that expands existing prohibitions on armorpiercing bullets to include those bullets capable of piercing body armor
and the gentlewoman from california ms linda sanchez offered an amendment that permits courts to hear suits based on the sale of weapons to persons with domestic convictions
under this rule however not one of these amendments or any of the five other commonsense amendments offered by democrats in the committee on rules last night will be given any consideration by the full house
madam speaker our government was built on the foundation of an open and transparent participatory process
on the contrary it is outright political grandstanding
other rulings have resulted in major crackdowns on straw purchases where legally purchased guns are resold to individuals unable to lawfully purchase a weapon on their own
madam speaker i am pleased and privileged at this time to yield 3 12 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from massachusetts mr mcgovern xz4002630 my colleague on the committee on rules
the impact of this bill on the law enforcement community is well illustrated by the lawsuit brought by former orange new jersey police officers ken mcguire and david lemongello i gather that their lawsuit would be dismissed as frivolous
on january 12 2001 officers mcguire and lemongello were shot in the line of duty with a trafficked gun negligently sold by a west virginia dealer
police officers like officers mcguire and lemongello put their lives on the line every day to protect the public
when you close out amendments that would allow people to have an opportunity to come down here on the floor of the house of representatives and represent their constituents this is a closed rule and i urge my colleagues to vote against this closed rule
the measure on the house floor today is intended to protect a manufacturer or seller of a firearm from any legal liability stemming from the criminal or unlawful misuse of that firearm
furthermore lawsuits brought on behalf of officers injured or killed in the line of duty by guns negligently sold by dealers would be barred
if immunity for the gun industry is enacted police officers who put their lives on the line every day to protect the public would have no legal recourse when they are harmed due to another s negligence
first i oppose the look back provision in this bill that requires the immediate dismissal of civil liability lawsuits against gun manufacturers that are pending on the date of enactment
is it the second amendment that says to a philadelphia mother who won a settlement of only 850 000 from a gun dealer who negligently sold multiple guns to a gun trafficker a child found one of the guns on a street in philadelphia and accidently shot the mother s 7yearold son is there some reason mr speaker we should not have these kinds of lawsuits
in addition before the committee on rules earlier this week i joined my colleague from california ms lofgren xz4002450 in offering an amendment captioned lofgre x044 that proposes an additional exception to the definition of qualified civil liability action for law enforcement officers acting in that capacity
while i do sit on the committee on homeland security one does not have to sit on this body to know that our first responders need and deserve protection from unintended situations
it simply stated that when a gun dealer sells 12 or 50 or 100 guns to a person who is clearly going to turn around and sell those guns on the street that dealer should be held accountable
i would also point out more than 30 000 gun deaths occur each year so the almost blanket immunization from suit proposed in this legislation represents nothing more than an unwarranted and unjust special interest giveaway to the powerful gun lobby and a shameful attack on the legal rights of countless innocent victims of gun violence
congress has enacted this ban on machine guns semiautomatic assault weapons and large capacity ammunition feeding devices for an obvious reason these assault weapons are dangerous
police chief al phillipus said that with the firepower the shooter possessed the incident might have turned into a bloodbath and he could have killed multiple officers i will offer this amendment because the exceptions to the general ban on lawsuits against gun manufacturers and merchants is too narrow
my opposition to the measure is based on my belief that it is overly expansive and overarching
i urge my colleagues to vote no on s 397 and to support the rights of potential victims of gun violence
important issues that come on to this floor the minority is not allowed to debate them nor are we allowed to offer any kind of amendments to hopefully make a bill better
i can talk about his hand that was operated on because once the bullet hit it it shattered
and these are bullets that we want to have on our streets
come on
i am hearing this debate on the second amendment
but that does not mean that we can not enforce the laws that are already on the books
so if you want to talk about let us enforce the laws on the books then let us pass a good nics system that would enforce the laws that are already on the books
but we can have gun safety issues put out into place so that we can bring down the number of 30 000 people killed in this country every year so we can bring down the 100 billion that is spent every year on health care loss of productivity and using our police
mr speaker i thank my colleague from maryland for doing such a wonderful job on handling this issue
may i remind many of my colleagues that the nra has put extraordinary pressure on members and certainly even in the states
they keep statistics on this
madam speaker on christmas eve in 1999 in my hometown of worcester massachusetts 26yearold danny guzman was shot and killed
police determined that the guns were stolen from kahr before the weapons had serial numbers stamped on them and were then resold to criminals in exchange for money and drugs
now kahr did not conduct any criminal or general background checks on its employees
mr speaker i would urge my colleagues to vote no on the rule and the underlying legislation
and it is our understanding based on my conversations with members of the judiciary committee that in fact this would not be covered
so having said that i would urge my colleagues to vote no on this bill
standing on the street danny guzman was struck down by a stray bullet fired from a 9 millimeter handgun
that gun that killed him made its way into criminal hands because a gun factory employee had stolen it from his workplace and sold it on the black market
mr speaker i certainly appreciate the debate that we are having today on this issue
their attempt to force us arms producers out of business would have a serious impact not only on our freedoms but on our national security as well
mr speaker i rise today in strong opposition to the protection of lawful commerce in arms act this bill is an attempt to carve out an exclusive liability exemption and its vote on the floor today is a giveback to the gun industry at a significant cost to the american people
we are nt debating a product that has an inconsequential impact on our nation
instead of putting forth a national plan to end this futile cycle of death extending the ban on assault weapons or even prohibiting people we know are on our own terrorist list from obtaining weapons we are debating how to best shield the gun industry from accountability and responsibility
i also commend senator larry craig from idaho on his leadership on this legislation defending americans second amendment right to bear arms
i believe that manufacturers and sellers of firearms and ammunition must be protected from restrictions on interstate or foreign commerce
but trial lawyers are eager to cash in on the pain of victims and criminals rarely have deep pockets
as a firm believer in the second amendment to the united states constitution and an opponent of all federal gun laws i can not support a bill that imposes new unconstitutional gun controls on americans
senate amendments added two sections to s 397 that impose unconstitutional controls on american gun owners and sellers
this gun lock requirement amounts to the imposition of a new federal tax on each handgun sale because gun buyers will be forced to pay the cost of the secure gun storage or safety device that is required with a handgun irrespective of if that device is desired
to recognize the threat such regulation places on gun owners just consider that a gun without ammunition is nothing more than an expensive club
given the wide scope of criminal laws and the fact that people are on occasion accused of crimes they did not commit this provision promises to discourage many nonviolent lawabiding individuals from possessing ammunition protected under the second amendment
i am particularly disturbed that the house of representatives leadership has taken the unusual step of bringing s 397 to the floor for a vote without house members at least having an opportunity to vote on removing the gun control amendments
instead of voting on a bill that contains the new gun control provisions we should be considering hr 800 the house version of s 397 prior to its perversion by gun control amendments
last month i wrote to house speaker dennis hastert majority leader tom delay and committee on the judiciary chairman james sensenbrenner of my opposition to these antigun rights provisions in s 397
mr speaker i thank the chairman for yielding me this time and i thank him and the gentleman from florida mr stearns xz4003880 for their visionary leadership on this bipartisan legislation
but throughout the history of tort law in this nation we have built on the principle of individual responsibility in which a product may not be defined as defective unless there is something wrong with the product not with the way that it is used
i believe these cases are evidence of the remarkable degree of judicial consensus on the meaning of the second amendment
moreover such a requirement would create absurd results based on what a prosecutor may decide to do in a particular case and when he decides to do it
it would be absurd to allow one case to go forward and not others depending on which case was technically pleaded
and even where there is a conviction the timing of the conviction alone may be dispositive of the claim because there is nothing in the bill or the law which tolls the statute of limitations on a civil claim pending a conviction
mr speaker this bill is an unprecedented attack on the due process rights of victims injured by the misconduct of an industry that seeks to escape the legal rules that govern the rest of us and i urge my colleagues to oppose this bill
1971 vacated on other grounds 404 us 1009 1972
1942 rev d on other grounds 319 us 463 1943
1970 aff d on other grounds 451 f2d 1355 7th cir
mr speaker i ask unanimous consent that all members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on s 397 the bill currently under consideration
the committee on the judiciary considered and favorably reported hr 800 in may of this year
recent trends in abusive litigation have inspired lawsuits against the firearms industry on the theory of liability that would hold it financially responsible for the actions of those who use their products in a criminal or unlawful manner
various courts have correctly described such suits as improper attempts to have the court substitute its judgment for that of the legislature as explained by another federal judge the plaintiff s attorneys simply want to eliminate handguns personal injury lawyers are seeking to obtain through the courts stringent limits on the sale and distribution of firearms beyond the court s jurisdictional boundaries
a new york appeals court stated recently that courts are the least suited least equipped and thus the least appropriate branch of government to regulate and micromanage the manufacturing marketing distribution and sale of handguns law enforcement military personnel rely on the domestic firearms industry to supply them with reliable and accurate weapons that can best protect them in the line of fire
the lawful commerce in arms act by prohibiting abusive lawsuits against the firearms industry supports core federalism principles articulated by the united states supreme court which has made it clear that one state s power to impose burdens on the interstate market
before closing i think it is important to set the record straight on one item
failure to properly record on atf f 4473 the date on which the licensee contacted the nics response provided by the system andor any identification number provided by the system
date planned correction corrective action the licensee shall ensure that the complete background check information is properly entered in the designated area on the atf f 4473
see attached list of 78 firearms unaccounted for and report them on an atf f 331011 licensee theftloss report
see list of firearms that no atf f 4473s have been located on but other records of transfer have been such as 25 firearms identified by the washington department of licensing and computer records indicating a sale but no other information in regards to the transfer
report bushmaster rifle model pcwa3x serial number l284320 on an atf f f331011 licensee theftloss report and make note in the bound book
mr speaker i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from virginia mr boucher xz4000430 my democratic colleague on the committee on the judiciary
mr speaker i yield 1 minute to the gentleman from colorado mr salazar xz4006201 who is always welcome on this side of the aisle
i urge the members to support this legislation to send it to the president for his signature and then we can move on
mr speaker on that i demand the yeas and nays
mr speaker i thank the gentleman from wisconsin mr sensenbrenner xz4003650 the chairman of the committee on the judiciary for yielding me this time
i vote no on this bill because no industry certainly not the gun industry should have the right to conduct their business without the oversight of the judicial system
then the senate passed s 397 and i am pleased that we are taking action on this important piece of legislation today
the next session we had 250 cosponsors and an overwhelming 285 to 140 vote on the floor but then the bill just died in the other body
now we have 257 cosponsors on my bill
so not only is this bill bipartisan in the house and in the senate it is bipartisan in this nation with 33 states both democrats and republicans in the state legislatures and governors signing on to the bills that ultimately became laws
mr speaker i thank the distinguished chairman of the committee on the judiciary for his help in bringing this bill to the floor
he has been a leader on this bill in shepherding it through the committee on the judiciary time and time again
almost the same bill passed this house on this floor 285 to 140
this legislation will stop baseless lawsuits against gun manufacturers or dealers based on the criminal or unlawful thirdparty misuse of firearms
if my colleagues would bear with me i would like to focus on a recent case in this last chart which is circled
in conclusion mr speaker i am pleased that we are voting on this bill
at the very least the house should have been able to debate and decide on possible changes to the bill
but that did not happen because the republican leadership insisted on bringing the bill to the floor under restrictive procedures that essentially barred any amendments from being offered
this bill has the title on it protection of lawful commerce in arms act
let us focus for a minute on the victims of gun crimes in our country
why do we not have a bill entitled the protection of gun violence victims on the floor today
on many sunny days when the snipers gunned down people who were going about their ordinary business filling up their gas at gas stations shopping at grocery stores cutting their grass a child who was going to school
on january 16 2003 the families of many of the victims of the sniper attacks who were killed brought a lawsuit against that gun store for their losses and injuries
in fact this bill was being debated on the floor of this house 3 years ago this month when those killings were going on and this house realized how bad it would look to victimize those people twice to have them victimized once by the snipers and again by the united states congress by denying their day in court and that is why this house decided to withdraw the bill at that time from consideration from the floor of the house
shame on us
this bill will shut the courthouse doors on many victims who have legitimate claims
the impact of this bill on the law enforcement community is well illustrated by the lawsuit brought by former orange new jersey police officers ken mcguire and david lemongello
on january 12 2001 mcguire and lemongello were shot in the line of duty with a trafficked gun negligently sold by a west virginia dealer
police officers like ken mcguire and dave lemongello put their lives on the line every day to protect the public
mr speaker i yield 3 minutes to my colleague from new york mrs mccarthy xz4002570 who has been such a leader on this important issue in protecting the victims of gun violence
i want to address an issue we have not covered this morning which deals with the question of terrorists trying to get their hands on guns in this country
we know from our reports and records that osama bin laden and other terrorists have said to their terrorist network that they can easily obtain weapons in the united states and we know from a government accountability study from january of this year that between february 3 and june 20 of 2004 35 known or suspected terrorists those are people who are on the terrorist watch list purchased guns in the united states and that from july 1 through october 31 of last year 12 additional people on the terrorist watch list purchased guns in the united states
now i think many americans would be surprised to know that you can be on the terrorist watch list and you can go to the airport and try and board an airplane and because you are on the terrorist watch list we say no we want to protect the public we are not going to let you board this airplane and compromise the safety of other passengers on that plane
i am on the terrorist watch list and i want 12 semiautomatic assault weapons and under this bill if we pass it today we could not hold that gun store owner liable in any way for a wrongful sale
we had a vote in committee on this amendment
the gentleman from california mr waxman xz4004250 and i tried to get through the committee on rules an amendment so the whole house could consider this proposition
what did the committee on rules say
it seems to me outrageous that we would pass a bill that would allow someone to walk into that gun store the gun store owner knows that person is on the terrorist watch list they sell the person a gun the person goes out and murders people and under this legislation guess what
mr speaker a moment ago i raised the scenario of a terrorist getting denied access to an airplane because they are on the terrorist watch list going down to a local gun shop and saying you know i am on that watch list can i get some guns
now we all might say common sense tells us that that would cover a person on the terrorist watch list
the real reason was they have questions about the reliability of the terrorist watch list and whether or not someone who is on the terrorist watch list is legitimately put there
we have tried to make it a condition that people who are on the terrorist watch list can not purchase weapons at gun stores
the congress has not gone on record saying that someone on the terrorist watch list should not get a gun
it would close the door on lawsuits by the victims of the snipers in this area
we want to close the courthouse door on them
why do we not go about the business of passing legislation to protect the victims of gun violence rather than that small handful of badapple gun dealers who wrongfully and negligently help put the guns in the hands of killers in this country and allow them to go on the kind of rampage that leads to the death of so many people
dear senator i am writing on behalf of the american bar association to express our strong opposition to s 397 the protection of lawful commerce in arms act and to similar legislation to enact special tort laws for the firearms industry
the senate has not examined the underlying claims of the industry about state tort cases choosing not to hold a single hearing on s 397 or its predecessor bills in the two previous congresses
the bill also would likely limit the ability of state attorneys general to bring actions against gun sellers who violate state law such as those who engage in straw sales to someone who illegally buys guns on behalf of prohibited buyers
but even without those troublesome aspects the restrictions placed on law enforcement should be reason enough for congress to reject this dangerous legislation
instead of trying to close the courthouse doors to victims congress should be investigating the gun industry cracking down on the corrupt dealers who arm drug gangs and other criminals and passing stronger laws to stop gun deaths
this argument however rests on a fundamental misunderstanding of american tort law
one exception for example would purport to permit certain actions for negligent entrustment the bill goes on however to define negligent entrustment extremely narrowly
the negligent entrustment exception would therefore not permit any action based on reckless distribution practices negligent sales to gun traffickers who supply criminals as in the above example careless handling of firearms lack of security or any of a myriad potentially negligent acts
s 397 and hr 800 would turn this traditional framework on its head and free those in the firearms industry to behave as carelessly as they would like so long as the conduct has not been specifically my aim here is simply to provide information and insure that you are not inadvertently misled about the meaning and scope of s 397 and hr 800
i would like to thank the gentleman from florida mr stearns xz4003880 and the gentleman from wisconsin mr sensenbrenner xz4003650 and the committee on the judiciary for all their hard work on this muchneeded piece of legislation
i urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join me in supporting senate bill 397 a commonsense measure to protect small businesses and preserve the second amendment rights of american citizens
i regret the legislation we are voting on today contains the kohlreed storage device amendment
we need to protect the firearms industry an industry i would like to remind my colleagues on the other side of the aisle is responsible for arming our troops our law enforcement professionals including the capitol police
but responsible gun owners should not have further limits placed on their second amendment rights
i commend the gentleman from florida mr stearns and chairman sensenbrenner for their hard work on this legislation and i urge passage of the bill
for many years that has been the subject of discussion by the committee on financial services and prior to that the committee on banking
i can not express enough appreciation to chairman oxley for his longstanding tolerance on this matter the many hours of agony i am sure i have caused all members on this subject matter and i am very appreciative for his courtesies extended in bringing to the floor a bill which has been over many months hammered into the shape we currently find it
from the time at which a matter leaves committee until it arrives on the house floor can be a matter of days weeks or months
more broadly i think the rule has made in order a number of amendments that were not discussed in committee which the house will consider and vote on accordingly and i think at the end of the day no matter the construct of the final bill it is important to understand that a governmentsponsored enterprise reform is absolutely essential
i will speak more to that matter during general debate but i think those who only listen to the debate on the rule should understand a governmentsponsored enterprise is created by an act of congress
they take on great risk and accordingly deserve the highest standard of regulatory oversight possible
our nation s economic security and the housing opportunity of millions of americans is being played with on the floor today
as well as continuing on their path to destroying what this country stands for religious freedom home ownership and the ability of child to live a better life than his or her parents
some of our friends on the other side are very upset because rather than providing money for bricks and mortar what they would like to do is to provide money for politics
the goals of this campaign are threefold to increase voter turnout of working class mainly democratic voters without increasing opposition turnout number two to increase the power of progressive constituencies by moving a mass agenda putting together the capacity to get on the ballot and win and by putting our side on the offensive number three to deliver a wage increase to hundreds of thousands of floridians
the restrictive language being put forward which would say no faithbased group could participate has never been debated in this committee and we are not allowed to do an amendment on the floor
all we asked for was an ability to vote on some of these specific things
substantively this imposes restraints on getting lower income people to vote
the committee voted on this bill
much of what has been said on that side i agree with
members on their side now say we are for doing this affordable housing
yes we will get the vote on the manager s amendment
so what the gentleman from texas would have members believe both gentlemen from texas it is an open rule on this issue because if you are willing to vote not to give a preference to the hurricane areas you can also vote to let the catholic church participate in lowincome housing
we are not given a chance to vote on that
we will give you a chance to vote on it but it is still not a fair vote
i think it is very clear that there is one reason why the members are not allowed to vote on a specific amendment that says let us take all of the restrictions on the groups and when people say we do not want the money spent on other things it has always been clear that the money can only be spent on affordable housing
mr speaker all we are asking for is a chance for an upordown vote on three provisions which have never been voted on which were inserted here because the most conservative elements in the republican party the republican study committee got the majority leader to make them a condition of the bill coming to the floor
that amendment adds an important disclosure requirement to ensure that shareholders are fully informed on the charitable giving practices of fannie mae and freddie mac
the language would authorize the federal housing finance agency to require that fannie mae and freddie mac make publicly available each year the total value of contributions made to nonprofit organizations during the previous fiscal year and it would also request specific disclosures on donations to insideraffiliated charities
i hear some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle argue that essentially this is a closed rule yet i look at the fact that we will be voting on a number of amendments later today a number of which were offered by democratic members
i understand there is an accusation that somehow language dealing with the affordable housing fund that members do not have an ability to weigh in on that
so if for some reason you do not like this language you have an opportunity to vote on it
we have got counseling for home buyers supporting housing for the elderly and the list goes on and on and on
the question or the debate is not how much money we are going to spend on housing the question is who is going to do the spending
i do not understand if those who have advocated on behalf of the funds truly want to help the lowincome then why do we not simply increase the section 8 voucher program
mr speaker i rise in strong opposition to the rule on hr 1461
we urge you to preserve the integrity of hr 1461 by fighting to remove the restrictions on nonprofits
speaker i am writing to you on behalf of the jesuit conference board of the society of jesus in the united states to express our concern regarding an amendment to hr 1461 the federal housing finance reform act of 2005 that concerns the affordable housing fund
we strongly urge you to allow a vote on an amendment to delete the harmful provisions of the manager s amendment described above
mr speaker the problem is i tell the former speaker from the florida legislature you do not have the courage of your convictions on your side
you are not prepared to put your proposition to a democratic vote on your side
let me remind my colleagues what the chairman of the rules committee mr dreier said on this floor 12 years ago in march 1993 frankly it seems to me that the process of representative government means that a person who represents 600 000 people here should have the right to stand up and put forth an amendment and then have it voted down if it is not supportable
mr speaker so the public understands and our colleagues understand what i indicated was that the gentleman from massachusetts mr frank xz4001400 the ranking democrat on this committee who has been here over a quarter of a century wants to offer an amendment that was supported in the committee and he has been precluded from offering that amendment
to that extent the republicans have undermined the free and fair debate on this floor
mr speaker i rise in opposition to h res 509 as reported out of the committee on rules last night relative to our debate of the gse legislation hr 1461
the committee i serve on the committee on financial services has labored for 6 years 20 hearings hundreds and hundreds of hours and hundreds of witnesses to put together what i think is probably one of the best examples of bipartisan activity this house has seen in many years
i am convinced that the overwhelming majority of our friends on the other side of the aisle if they understood the restrictions in the manager s amendment and the denial by the committee on rules of a right to vote on the issue that is all we asked it was never considered in the subcommittee
i find it unfortunate that we are denied this right to have an up and down vote and as a result i urge my colleagues to vote no on the rule
mr speaker i rise in support for the underlying bipartisan bill on gses but in strong opposition to the rule that was put in at the last minute a provision that prevents any nonprofit recipient of a housing grant from conducting nonpartisan civic voter registration
this is an outrageous undemocratic provision that imposes restrictions on promoting the most fundamental of our civil liberties the right to vote
what in the world are we doing today in this congress in an attempt to limit this great right on which our country was founded
speaker the undersigned national organizations have learned that the compromise reached by house leadership on hr 1461 the federal housing finance reform act of 2005 includes provisions that would restrict the ability of american citizens to engage in our democratic process
specifically we object to the restrictions on nonprofit organizations that apply for grants through the affordable housing fund established in hr 1461
coalition on human needs
leadership conference on civil rights
national alliance on mental illness
national council on the aging
national council on independent living
national law center on homelessness amp poverty
national policy and advocacy council on homelessness
mr speaker clearly these organizations recognize an attack on faithbased values when they see one
i urge a no vote on this rule
mr speaker i rise in opposition to this rule which did not permit a vote on congressman frank s amendment to strike from this bill the provision that prevents any nonprofit recipient of a housing grant from conducting nonpartisan civic voter registration
this is an outrageously bad provision that imposes unconstitutional restrictions on promoting the most fundamental of our civil liberties the right to vote
what are we doing here limiting this great right on which our nation is founded
clearly these organizations recognize an attack on faithbased values when they see one
i urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to repudiate these provisions that strike all faithbased organizations
hr 1461 the federal housing finance reform act as reported out of the committee on financial services was a thoughtful reasonable bipartisan piece of legislation
as evidenced by the 655 committee vote in favor of the bill on may 25 hr 1461 clearly has the support from both democrats and republicans
i commend chairman oxley and ranking member frank for their actions on the financial services committee and for producing an excellent bill
why would we protect companies from these restrictions and impose them on lowincome and faithbased communities the very people who this legislation is supposed to empower
they are part of a pattern by the extreme right in the republican party in an attack on poor people
these provisions are a direct affront on the democratic principles upon which this country was founded
we can provide and expand the affordable housing market without trouncing on the bill of rights
when the republican leadership had a chance to stand up for people who do not have a voice for people who need help making ends meet they made a conscious decision to turn their backs on them
one of the icons of the civil rights movement rosa parks died on sunday
but it is hard not to see the irony that 2 days after her death we are going to debate and vote on a bill that will restrict the ability of the poor to have access to affordable housing and to vote in democratic elections in this country
dear congressman mcgovern on behalf of catholic charities usa the national association of catholic social services agencies and institutions serving over seven million people in need every year i urge you to support hr 1461 the federal housing finance reform act of 2005 and to oppose amendments that would prevent experienced faithbased and communitybased organizations from successfully competing for the proposed affordable housing funds
existing limits in hr 1461 on activities that qualify for affordable housing funds prevent abuse of this funding
mr speaker i include the following editorial that appeared in today s new york times entitled a ban on voter registration which is very much opposed to the offensive language in the manager s amendment
a ban on voter registration hurricane katrina made it politically necessary for republican congressional leaders to tone down their effort to kill off federal programs for affordable housing
but it has not stopped them from dragging their feet on an important bill to create a valuable housing fund by tapping into a small portion of the aftertax profits of the federally backed mortgage giants fannie mae and freddie mac
mr speaker the gentleman from texas keeps on saying this is about policy not politics but what would be more political than the language in here that denies poor people the right to vote
mr speaker i yield 5 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from massachusetts mr frank xz4001400 the ranking member on the committee
we are down 50 percent in real terms in elderly and disabled housing at a time when the leadership on the other side of the aisle has tried to eliminate the community development block grant program
they have significantly cut back on the number of section 8 vouchers for lowincome housing assistance and they have tried to limit housing assistance overall so it is important that this underlying bill pass and at the same time that this reprehensible provision this attack on poor people be struck from the bill
mr speaker on that i demand the yeas and nays
mr speaker let me thank the gentleman from texas mr sessions xz4003670 for conducting a worthwhile debate on this issue and the rule
the 655 vote that we had on final passage was quite extraordinary
indeed i think we came to a reasonable conclusion on that
there are several democrat amendments made in order republican amendments made in order four on each side
i know the gentleman from massachusetts will probably offer a motion to recommit based on the issue of fund availability
but this vote on the rule that i support is moving us forward to get to legislation passing to help the hurricane victims and to better regulate the gses
let us vote up the rule and get on with the debate
mr speaker by direction of the committee on rules i call up house resolution 509 and ask for its immediate consideration
this structured rule provides for 1 hour of general debate equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the committee on financial services
it waives all points of order against consideration of the bill and provides that the amendment in the nature of a substitute recommended by the committee on financial services now printed in the bill shall be considered as an original bill for the purpose of amendment and shall be considered as read
because of their size and potential to have a disproportionate impact on america s capital markets they require strong and effective oversight of their operations
this legislation also establishes an affordable housing fund based on the affordable housing program already in place for the federal home loan banks
finally the manager s amendment sunsets the fund after 5 years at which point the director will report to congress on whether funds should be extended or modified to improve its efficiency and effectiveness so that congress can exercise appropriate oversight of this new program
mr speaker i strongly support this legislation to reform and improve oversight of housing gses and i would like to thank chairman richard baker and chairman mike oxley and their colleagues on the financial services committee for their hard work on this important legislation
mr speaker it is right out there in front of everybody republicans are good on policy and evidently the democrats do not like the politics
i am pleased to yield 3 minutes at this time to the gentleman from florida mr feeney xz4001310 who serves on that committee
the gentleman from maryland understands that what we have done and undertaken in this rule is the opportunity that would allow any member but in particular a member of the minority a chance to vote on a manager s amendment a motion to recommit and certainly final passage
mr speaker reclaiming my time so that the gentleman does understand the facts of the case the committee had no discussion on this point
to increase the power of progressive constituencies by moving a mass agenda putting together the capacity to get on the ballot and win and by putting our side on the offensive 3
given these many key races exciting and mobilizing constituency has never been more important but in order to do this there must be a compelling issue on the ballot
our plan to win centers on a series of strategic premises layed out as follows 1
when you look at a web site for habitat for humanity you will see large corporations on that list who contribute to new houses in this country notforprofits and others and number four on that list is my church of the entire country my church the highland park united methodist church of dallas texas
mr speaker i yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from ohio mr oxley xz4003070 chairman of the committee on financial services
this vote today is simply on the rule
it should not be done on a political basis
mr speaker i yield back the balance of my time and i move the previous question on the resolution
i am opposed to this rule and i can not believe that my colleagues on the opposite side of the aisle would jeopardize the opportunity for us to provide housing for people who are victims of these hurricanes that have hit this country because they have interjected politics into this bill
we know that there are some people on the opposite side of the aisle that did not like the idea of providing funds for low and moderateincome housing but we also know because of the leadership of some people on the other side of the aisle who understood the homelessness and the crisis that we have in america lack of housing the lowincome people that they were able to prevail and we came out with a good bill
as a member of the committee on financial services i was proud to see the inclusion of an affordable housing fund in the bill and proud to support the bill in committee
i keep a photograph of the shack where i grew up hanging on the wall in my office to remind me that i have been given the opportunity to speak for those who can not and represent in this the interests of the most vulnerable and voiceless american citizens here in the congress
it is an assault on the poor in this country and it is obscene
vote no on the rule and vote no on the oxley amendment
the federal housing finance reform act as reported by the committee on financial services is a strong bipartisan effort
i urge my colleagues to maintain the broadly supported language that came out of the committee on financial services by rejecting the rule and the manager s amendment
vote no on this rule which will tar the affordable housing fund without giving the majority an opportunity to vote on it
this does strengthen regulatory oversight on freddie mac fannie mae and the federal home loan banks
what i do not like about the bill is a poison pill that has been put on there which i believe it is unconstitutional and restrictions aimed at suppressing the civil rights engaged in by poor minorities for voting
i comment my colleagues on the financial services committee for their bipartisan approach and hard work in drafting this important bill
this bill keeps the government sponsored enterprises gses safe sound and focused on their mission while preserving their mission to support financing for low and moderate income housing
hispanic families especially face difficulties buying a home as their incomes on average are lower and they might not have the same access to or understanding of financial institutions
while i support the bill for its merits i am strongly opposed to the restrictions added after it passed the committee that place severe restrictions on nonprofit entities and faith based groups applying for affordable housing grants
all other regulators are funded by assessments on the regulated entities
besides the criticism leveled at the bill today relative to affordable housing there is another issue which i feel appropriate to address and that is relative to the growth constraints on the investment portfolios of the two enterprises
that translates into if you do not see it on our list mr director go do it anyway because we are giving you the authority
finally as to the ability to establish how the portfolio should be reduced and to what level secretary snow testified before our committee he could not tell us how to do it or to what level they should be adjusted but he did go on to say it should be the subject of professional examination and recommendation
finally on page 273 of the bill we read an analysis of the potential systemic risk implications for the enterprises the housing and capital markets and the financial system of portfolio holdings and whether such holdings should be limited or reduced over time is the director s obligation to engage in professional study make recommendations to the congress if congressional action is needed or otherwise act in the best interest of the united states taxpayer
mr chairman i represent to the house this is a fair bill fair compromise and responsible action on the part of this house and i urge members to support its adoption
mr chairman i thank the gentleman for his continuing courtesy and leadership on this issue
i am going to try one more time on this thing
i know how you check on a house
it is not an attack on the basic civil rights of this country
if one were to go to trailer city on groom road in baker louisiana and walk up to one of those trailers and say hey folks i am here from the federal government and i want to buy a new van to haul you to the precinct next year to go vote what kind of response do you think you will get if you said that will come at the expense of advancing replacement housing for families to go home
you knock on the door and see if anybody is inside
currently only real property loans are considered for manufactured housing purchases but the vast majority of manufactured home buyers rent the land on which it rests
i have never seen during the time i have been here which is a number of years now a legislator work so hard on a particular issue and i congratulate chairman baker for getting it this far
we do not have a lot of legislation on this floor which is really done with the best interests of america at heart without any consideration for politics republican or democrat and i think this is one piece of legislation that does this
i doubt there are those other than the gentleman from massachusetts mr frank xz4001400 and the gentleman from louisiana mr baker xz4000120 and maybe three or four other people in congress a few on the outside who can really describe all that this means in terms of the gses
when you are dealing with fannie mae and freddie mac and the home loan banks virtually any mortgage out there is in some way touching on them
they have vast sums of dollars that they are handling on a regular basis
the members of that committee crafted a bill that passed the committee on a vote of 655 that would finally create a tough new regulator for the federal housing gses and the federal home loan banks something that was needed after some accounting missteps at the gses
this bill went before the committee on rules where it was hijacked by the extremist wing of the republican party that holds a grip over the house of representatives
this is a limitation on free speech
we are a religious country and we have many members of the cloth in congress most of whom i point out are democrats and the far right knows that their antireligious language can not pass on the merits
the ripple effects on local homeowners communities and economies could suffer all in the name of this theoretical term of systemic risk i should add this approach is not consistent with the banking world
mr chairman on rollcall no
if the conforming loan limit is not increased middle income families on the central coast of california will not be able to own a piece of the american dream their own home
i urge a no vote on the garrett amendment
i urge my colleagues to support the conforming loan limits language and vote no on attempts to remove it from the federal housing finance reform act
in the nature of parliamentary debate we will be focusing on some specific points where i disagree but i do not want that to obscure the fact that there is a great deal of agreement
mr chairman i yield 4 12 minutes to the gentlewoman from california ms waters xz4004220 who as ranking member of the minority on the housing subcommittee has had a major role in shaping our position and in the impact of the affordable housing front
we on our side have several times offered amendments to do that in the appropriations bill
mr chairman i yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from california ms lee xz4002370 someone who has been very hardworking both on voter registration and on housing
since this is a bill which in its form in the manager s amendment would interfere with voter registration efforts there can be no more appropriate speaker on our side than the gentleman from georgia who 40 years ago and more literally risked his life to advance the rights of people to vote
mr chairman i yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from california mr baca xz4000090 one of our most energetic members on the committee fully familiar with the need for housing in particular
mr chairman i yield 2 12 minutes to the gentleman from new york mr meeks xz4002710 a very active member of the committee on financial services who is very aware of the need for housing
mr chairman i have noticed a certain level of discomfort on some of my friends on the republican side and some of my not so good friends on the republican side
a lot of what is in the manager s amendment a lot of us like the preference for the gulf areas some of the restrictions on what people do with the use of funds
they will be able to see that they can then carefully and in good conscience vote against the manager s amendment and then vote for the recommit because it will be their amendment so they will get permission to vote for the recommit and they will get everything in the manager s amendment except the one thing that keeps out faithbased restricting it to people whose primary purpose is here and the nonpartisan restriction on voter registration
we will continue the restriction on electioneering and lobbying et cetera but we will say that electioneering and communications or partisanship are banned but nonpartisan voter registration and nonpartisan getoutthevote are not banned
the gentleman from ohio said well we are going to work on it
yes it has to be worked on because right now thanks to the demands of the republican study committee it is not there the right to do that
they can come in on their own but you can not cooperate
i did look up on june 29th this year the house by a majority adopted an amendment to increase section 8 vouchers
if that is what the house wants to vote on okay
in other words members will have a chance to vote on everything in the manager s amendment all the restrictions on what these groups can do with their own money all the restrictions of what they can do with affordable housing money put our faithbased groups in and have the voter registration be allowed
there are debates about restrictions on what happens when you go into the affordable housing fund but there is virtual unanimity about having an affordable housing fund
well i would say to the gentleman we agree on this
mr chairman first the administration has been somewhat inconsistent on this
sometimes like on casino gambling and medical marijuana i am glad to be with him
there is no way people down there will be able to do it on their own
the ranking member of the subcommittee has spent a good deal of time focused on the corporate governance of these gses
mr speaker a little while ago we had a vote on the manager s amendment
i am aware of no restriction as binding as saying it has to be the primary purpose and i will insert into the record at this point a letter not just from catholic charities but from bishop dimarzio on behalf of the united states conference of catholic bishops saying that proposals that would limit eligible recipients to organizations that have as their purpose the provision of affordable housing would effectively prevent catholic dioceses parishes and catholic charities agencies from participating department of social development and world peace washington dc october 3 2005
dear representative on behalf of the american association of homes and services for the aging aahsa i want to express our members deep reservations over an amendment expected to be proposed when hr 1461 the gse reform legislation is brought to the floor this week
the proposed amendment seeks to impose restrictions on the eligibility of nonprofit faithbased organizations interested in applying for development funding under the affordable housing fund created in this legislation
while on one hand congress and the administration call for greater participation by nonprofit faithbased organizations to carry the load in helping our neediest citizens the house now seems poised to cut us off from a funding stream that we need in order to continue to provide affordable housing to lowincome seniors
dear leaders of the house of representatives we write on behalf of the union of orthodox jewish congregations of america to urge you to ensure that the federal housing finance reform act of 2005 hr 1461 contains no provisions which would be disruptive to participation of the many religiously affiliated organizations in affordable housing programs
we urge you to oppose inclusion of these kinds of unnecessary limitations and prohibitions in hr 1461 and if they are to be considered by the house on the floor to ensure that these provisions receive a full debate and up or down vote
the consortium for citizens with disabilities ccd would like to go on record against language in the proposed manager s amendment that we believe would be of tremendous harm to communitybased nonprofit disability organizations across the country
a large part of our agenda focuses on civil rights and protections for the 56 million people with disabilities in the us it is ccd s understanding that the proposed manager s amendment contains language that would require many disability organizations to violate state law if they were to apply for grants made available through the affordable housing fund included in hr 1461
at the outset ccd would like to make clear that we oppose efforts on the part of congress to use federal funding as leverage to control how nonprofit disability organizations expend other resources including state and local as well as privately raised funds
the national voter registration act of 1993 motor voter law was enacted to facilitate voter registration with the goal of increasing turnout on election day
it does not seem possible that retroactively prohibiting activities disqualifying applicants based on their affiliations with organizations that do not receive any federal dollars or restricting the use of other unrelated funds would ensure that affordable housing finally the proposed legislation would affect disability organizations that are essential to the successful development of affordable housing and permanent supportive housing for persons with disabilities
ccd therefore urges you to remove the unfair and unwarranted restrictions on nonprofit disability groups in the proposed manager s amendment to hr 1461
sincerely curtis decker secondly it would say that yes the restrictions on electioneering are maintained
we maintain the restrictions on electioneering
we maintain the restrictions on making a communication vote for this one a vote for that one
all we want to say is that when we restrict and prevent electioneering it does not cover any voter registration or getoutthevote activity conducted on a nonpartisan basis
so that is what we are talking about not using the funds for this but using those funds on your own to help out
the leadership in the committee on rules said we did not stop you from voting you could vote on the manager s amendment and you get a recommit
this is the only chance we have to vote cleanly on whether or not we should exclude all faithbased groups and whether or not groups faithbased or not that agree to try to provide lowincome housing with these funds should be debarred with their own funds from doing nonpartisan voter registration and get out the vote
on the one hand we say we do not get a vote and the committee on rules people said oh no you have the recommit
on the other they said to the republicans but do not vote against recommit nice people do not vote against recommittal motions recommit is not a real amendment recommit is a procedural vote
here is the one chance the recommit to see whether or not members will frankly take back control of the house because as long as you accept this interchange of events bill comes out of committee majority leadership holds it up and insists on provisions that we never got to vote on and then you do not get a chance to vote just on those provisions the only chance you get is when we do the recommit and then what are you told you can not vote for the recommit nice people do not do that
the question here is will democracy prevail in the house and when members on the other side vote their conscience and not be told that they simply can not do what they know is right many of them because it is in a motion to recommit when no other alternative was presented to them
november of 2004 fannie announces that it is unable again to file a thirdquarter earning statement because its auditor kpmg refused to sign off on the accounting results
however we want to define who those people are and i think some things we can agree on those people who are making 200 000 and who want to expand and go up to larger houses should not be the ones that we define as lowerincome individuals
the statistics also show that came before our committee that even if we put this into place the differential on mortgage rates would account for around 60 to 70 per mortgage
we can do that best by limiting their function to what it was prior to this amendment in the committee and that is to focus on firsttime home buyers in every state of the union to be able to buy that first home people of low and modest means who need the assistance of a governmentbacked program such as fannie and freddie to be able to know that there is a program there that allows them to get into that loan
by voting yes on this amendment we be will be able to do that
those of us on the committee have worked very hard to ensure that the fund can only be used for affordable housing purposes
but apparently that was not enough for a small minority of radical conservative members who insisted on inserting a provision restricting nonpartisan civic activities by nonprofits
they are a part of the manager s amendment which also contains important provisions that were worked out on a bipartisan basis and provisions designed to help hurricane victims
the rules committee has unconscionably denied us an opportunity to vote to strike these offensive provisions on a stand alone basis
i thank the gentleman for his great leadership on this bill hr 1461
now when we saw all of these accounting irregularities earlier on with the enrons and worldcoms of the world congress was outraged
again when we see them engaging in activities like airplane leasing and activities related to loan originations and the list goes on if they are going to receive governmentgranted benefits we need to ensure that they use their charter to provide this liquidity in the secondarymortgage market
chairman greenspan has testified before our committee on numerous occasions about this
again as chairman greenspan said before without the needed restrictions on the size of the gse balance sheets we put at risk our abilities to preserve safe and sound financial markets in the united states a key ingredient of support for housing i urge a yes vote on the amendment
mr speaker i would ask the gentleman the bill which you just indicated would be on the floor next week and you asked for amendments to be filed in a timely fashion is a very important bill
in particular i refer to the provision which deals with the ability of those who may receive dollars under the provisions of the bill for the purposes of constructing affordable housing that if they receive federal funds that they will be unable to thereafter participate in encouraging voter registration drives or getting more people on the rolls to vote
i believe the ranking member is going to ask that that be struck from the bill so that there not be a preclusion on voter registration drives or participation
i may have a discussion briefly with the acting majority leader on that issue as well
i thank my colleague for yielding and would ask him if he can give us some thought on that issue which we feel very strongly about and hope that that amendment can be protected and made in order by the committee and that we will have a full and fair debate on the floor of the house with reference to that amendment
there has been some suggestion i understand however that although the bill may be in the same shape now that there is a manager s amendment proposed and that the vote on the manager s amendment which we presume we have not seen it would cover a multitude of subjects that are in the bill that the vote on the issue that i have raised could be made on that manager s amendment
i would hope and this is not a question just an expression that the majority would make in order an amendment so that we could have a debate on that issue if in fact the manager s amendment does what we are concerned about and some people are proposing undermining the ability of some groups faithbased groups
that is why the catholic conference is so concerned about it faithbased groups or other groups who would build affordable housing get money under the bill and then be precluded from participating in any efforts not partisan efforts but nonpartisan efforts to get people on the rolls
existing limits in hr 1461 on activities that qualify for affordable housing funds prevent abuse of this funding
mr chairman i support the legislation on the above limited basis
mr chairman the committee on financial services has studied the need to reform the regulation of housing governmentsponsored enterprises for nearly 6 years
since convening our first government hearing on gse reform in march 2000 we have examined these matters extensively
as the ranking democratic member on the subcommittee of jurisdiction i have also had the opportunity to participate in more than 20 hearings and to hear scores of witnesses
the legislation to address these matters that the committee on financial services ultimately reported earlier this year was a very very good piece of legislation
the bill also received the overwhelming backing of my colleagues on the committee passing by a vote of 65 to 5 while i still believe this base legislative package is a good bill i am concerned about some of the amendments that we will debate today
because the rule does not allow a clean vote to remove these troubling provisions from the legislation i must regretfully oppose this bill on final passage
these amendments which i will oppose would remove the treasury line of credit for the gses impose capital standards based on competition rather than risk create arbitrary limitations on gse portfolios for reasons other than safety and soundness and alter provisions of the bill that will help middleincome families purchase homes in highcost areas
i hope all of my colleagues will support this target amendment to retain an independent public voice on governmentsponsored enterprise boards
as a result i will oppose this bill at the end of the day but hope to work to improve the legislation as it moves on in the process
i am sure there are people on the other side that understand why we feel so strongly on this faithbased issue
secondly we will add in the terms that will allow for voter registration and getoutthe vote on a nonpartisan basis
finally what i urge my colleagues on the other side to do is vote down the manager s amendment accept the motion to recommit have a perfect bill that we can walk out of here today with almost a unanimous approval
i urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to vote no on this amendment
the amendment also has had bipartisan support in the committee on financial services
additionally in order to represent the public interest and provide an independent voice the charters of the federal home loan banks require at least six individuals to be appointed by the regulator to serve on each bank board
unfortunately the bill before us today would eliminate the requirement for presidential appointees on the boards of fannie mae and freddie mac
it would also abolish regulatory appointees on the boards of the federal home loan banks
in my view requiring presidential and regulatory appointees to serve on the board of fannie mae and freddie mac and the federal home loan banks is entirely appropriate given the unique nature of their charters and their important public missions
maintaining public representation on the gse boards is therefore critical to ensuring continued public trust in these very important financial institutions
this commonsense amendment to retain an independent public voice on the gse boards received bipartisan support during the markup of this bill
on the basis of knowing the importance to corporate governance of this body i urge my colleagues to adopt this amendment
i urge my colleagues to vote no on hr 1461
the principal reason does not relate to some of the debate that has occurred earlier on a very important issue it relates to the fact that the department of the treasury that is the administration does not want to have accountability for regulation if it is not given adequate authority
they are on the one hand secondary market institutions serving as intermediaries primary markets as well as a tertiary market
on the other hand when they hold mortgages in their portfolios they are in effect simply another s amp l
they become receivers of risk and as risk becomes concentrated within these institutions they disproportionately become on the hook if very extraordinary things happen in the economy something that is not beyond thinking
in the 1980s without sufficient capital s amp ls grew larger and entered new lines of business as their capital basis shrunk and when things got bad the taxpayer was on the hook for 250 billion
fannie and freddie today operate on a capital base much less than s amp ls did just before their collapse in the 1980s
i want to thank chairman oxley and ranking member frank for their leadership and their really tireless efforts on this bipartisan bill that we reported out of committee
sadly mr chairman the bill that i supported like all of us supported coming out of the committee a product that struck a fair balance a fair balance between regulatory oversight and the gses housing mission and goals would be turned on its head and gutted by the undemocratic provisions of the manager s amendment that would be offered today
it is shameful especially given those left homeless by katrina that our bipartisan efforts to support increased home ownership and wealth building through the creation of an affordable housing trust fund have fallen victim to the rights wing s ongoing assault on democracy and programs designed to help the poor the elderly the disabled the communities of color and our underserved community
they give us a vote on a housing bill but then they ensure that it will be undercut by an extremist provision inserted into the manager s amendment at the bidding of rightwing ideologues
then just to ensure that these provisions prevail the republicans deny a fair vote on the frank amendment to strike it
for example it means a preacher whose church received affordable housing funds would be prohibited from calling on his parishioners to vote or even identify voting locations
that is all we ask for is a fair vote on this critical issue that goes to the core of our democracy and has such dire consequences for our communities
currently there is a 25 percent to 40 percent difference between interest rates on a conforming loan versus a jumbo loan
mr chairman when this bill left the financial services committee on a 65 to 5 vote i felt we were on the way to a great accomplishment
we built on success the fund is modelled after the successful affordable housing program of the federal home loan bank program
this is an outrageously bad provision that imposes unconstitutional restrictions on promoting the most fundamental of our civil liberties the right to vote
i urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to repudiate these provisions that strike at faith based organizations and the fundamental right to vote
even the promise of housing money comes at too high a price when we must compromise the principles on which this nation is built
mr chairman as a member of the committee on financial services i am shocked and disappointed in the result of what up until now has been a true bipartisan policymaking effort
while my colleague might argue that this amendment would have no effect on the ability of families to purchase a home he is gravely mistaken
i urge a no vote on the amendment
while my colleague from new jersey argues that this amendment would have no affect on the ability of families to purchase a home he is gravely mistaken
adding this systemic risk language would likely add uncertainty and instability into the secondarymortgage market ultimately resulting in a negative impact on the housing markets
based on the current interest rate environment the current monthly payment difference between a conforming loan and a jumbo loan can save a homeowner up to 171 per month
i think that is an error on his part
this section sets conforming loan limits and requires the agency to make annual adjustments to the limits based on increases or decreases in a housing price index maintained by the agency
two it creates uncertainty on who is supposed to set the new loan limit every year
these are good sound loans based on people who need that
it is a worthwhile goal one that the recent scandals at these institutions and on wall street illustrate is sorely needed
this provision would have a chilling effect on the constitutional speech and association rights of all nonprofits
how can the republicans in good faith claim to work with us on the reauthorization of the voting rights act and turn around and tie the hands of those groups who are trying to incorporate the disenfranchised into the democratic process
those who claim to work on behalf of the faithbased community should take a close look at this bill and should watch this vote closely
once again my friends from across the aisle have poisoned legislation that would otherwise have received bipartisan support by picking on those who can least afford to defend themselves
as chairman of the subcommittee on housing and community opportunity i have had a keen interest in the strength of the mortgage market
more importantly i want to comment on the issues of affordable housing and the effect of the affordable housing fund which is a great fund to have and we have worked with the minority on this issue and the gentleman from ohio mr oxley xz4003070 and his staff and our staff
i believe that we will have a profound impact on the country with the fund
on the other hand i also understand that because these financial institutions are creatures of the federal government we also have a responsibility to ensure they achieve a publicpolicy purpose
the committee on financial services approved major sections on new singlefamily and multifamily housing goals the duty to serve lower income markets and i stress duty to serve them and a new affordable housing fund with contributions from the enterprises
today i just wanted to speak freely on the actual housing fund
last may the committee on financial services overwhelmingly approved hr 1461 by a vote of 65 to 5 we have worked a long time on gse regulatory reform
since the 106th congress we have had over 20 hearings and received testimony from more than 100 witnesses on gserelated matters
capital markets subcommittee chairman baker has worked hard on these issues for many many years
i also want to thank housing subcommittee chairman ney for taking a leadership role in developing the housing goals and affordable housing fund sections of the bill as well as our ranking member mr frank for his constructive input on many of the bill s key provisions
he is concerned about the systemic risk posed by the gses based on investor perception that gse debtholders are backed by the federal government
hr 1461 gives a new regulator broad discretionary authority to require portfolio adjustments depending on the circumstances at the time even if the gse meets minimum capital standards
such action must be consistent with the gse s safe and sound operations or mission relying on the regulator s expertise
it is funded by annual assessments on the gses not subject to the congressional appropriations process
a housing finance oversight board advises the agency on overall strategies and policies but has no executive authority
i look forward to working with the gentlewoman on that issue
this has been an excellent debate and we appreciate the efforts on both sides of the aisle for this legislation
it makes a lot of sense something that we have been working on for a long time
house of representatives committee on financial services washington dc september 14 2005
chairman on july 14 2005 the committee on financial services filed its report on hr 1461 federal housing finance reform act of 2005 the bill was then sequentially referred to the committee on the judiciary until september 16 2005
i am pleased that our staffs have been working together during this period and have reached an agreement on an amendment regarding independent litigation authority copy attached
it is my understanding that with this commitment no further action by the judiciary committee on this bill will be required and the time period for the sequential referral will thereby lapse
it is also understood that this procedure is without prejudice to the jurisdictional interests of the judiciary committee on this or similar legislation
yours truly michael g oxley house of representatives committee on the judiciary washington dc september 14 2005
dear chairman oxley this letter responds to your recent letter concerning hr 1461 the federal housing finance reform act of 2005 which was ordered reported to the house by the committee on financial services on july 14 2005 and sequentially referred to the committee on the judiciary
as you know the committee on the judiciary has jurisdiction over matters concerning independent litigation bankruptcy laws civil judicial matters and other subject matter contained in the bill
in order to expedite this legislation for floor consideration the judiciary committee agrees to forgo action on this bill based on the agreement reached by our committees and with the understanding that no other provisions affecting the jurisdiction of the judiciary committee are included in the amendment to hr 1461
james sensenbrenner jr house of representatives committee on ways and means washington dc october 25 2005
dear chairman oxley i am writing with respect to hr 1461 the federal housing finance reform act of 2005 which was reported to the house by the committee on financial services on thursday july 14 2005
as you know the committee on ways and means has jurisdiction over matters concerning taxes and the internal revenue code of 1986
a provision in section 144 of hr 1461 would provide an exemption for a limitedlife enterprise from federal taxes and thus falls within the jurisdiction of the committee on ways and means
however in order to expedite this legislation for floor consideration the committee will forgo action on this bill
this is being done with the understanding that it does not in any way prejudice the committee with respect to the appointment of conferees or its jurisdictional prerogatives on this or similar legislation
i would appreciate your response to this letter confirming this understanding with respect to hr 1461 and would ask that a copy of our exchange of letters on this matter be included in the congressional record during floor consideration
best regards bill thomas house of representatives committee on financial services washington dc october 26 2005
this bill was reported by the committee on financial services on july 14 2005
such matters concerning federal taxation fall under the exclusive jurisdiction of the committee on ways and means
however i appreciate your willingness to forego action on hr 1461 in order to allow the bill to come to the floor expeditiously
i agree that your decision to forego further action on this bill will not prejudice the committee on ways and means with respect to its jurisdictional prerogatives on this or similar legislation
i would support your request for conferees on those provisions within your jurisdiction should this bill be the subject of a housesenate conference
hr 1461 as reported by the committee on financial services greatly expands the affordable housing role of fannie and freddie
there are major sections on new singlefamily and multifamily housing goals duty to serve lowerincome markets and a new affordable housing fund with contributions from the enterprises
thereafter priority in funding will be based on greatest impact geographic diversity timely action as well as other disaster area needs
eligible recipients forprofit builders state housing agencies and nonprofit organizations must have a demonstrated capacity for affordable housing activities and make assurances that they will comply with limits on the use of those funds
in addition the manager s amendment includes a request from the committee on the judiciary to require consultation with the attorney general by the gse regulator when exercising new litigation authority and from the committee on government reform to remove a freedom of information act exemption for the proceedings of the new agency s oversight board
i know the gentleman from delaware mr castle xz4000700 and the gentleman from michigan mr ehlers xz4001190 and others on our side of the aisle have been very interested in this entire issue
i think it is a worthy amendment and we have no objection on this side
in fact it failed on a tie vote in the committee
but at the same time i think that president bush who has decided not to fill those vacancies on the board is on the right track and i think this amendment would simply add to the perception of the federal guarantee
mr speaker i never thought a debate on gse reform would be so emotional and it has been a long day and a very productive day and a good debate
let me first of all say to my friend from massachusetts who worked very well with us in committee on this important legislation let us not lose sight of the fact that this is the first major gse reform bill to ever come before any congress
a recent study has found that 48 million working families many of them middleincome have faced critical housing needs in recent years spending more than half of their income on rent or living in substandard housing
and i am not going to talk personally to the gentleman from new jersey but on this he is dead wrong
more importantly the line of credit is a promise on behalf of the government to engage in a massive unconstitutional and immoral income transfer from working americans to holders of gse debt
and of course independent regulators enforce the laws in the same way as do other parts of the executive branch yet independent regulators lack the daytoday accountability to the executive that provides a check on other regulators
the answer really to that is if they never use it why leave it on the books
it has been described as a subsidy because the gses can go into the market and get a discount on their loan costs therefore they can outcompete the private sector
my amendment merely eliminates that line of credit puts a greater burden on the marketplace to regulate the gses rather than depending on regulation
as it was stated earlier on this floor we may have some regulations built into this that may even precipitate the puncturing of the housing bubble
i urge a yes vote on this amendment
there are no similar restrictions on forprofit organizations
catholic charities agencies should not be forced to choose between affordable housing funds and fulfillment of their religious mission it is unacceptable to force a poisoned choice on these entities to help fill critical housing needs or to exercise their basic civic responsibilities
our democracy depends on protecting the right of every american citizen to vote and to register to vote in every election
as the supreme court noted no right is more precious in a free country than that of having a voice in the election of those who make the law under which as good citizens we must live we dare not we must not create barriers on the right to vote and undermine 40 years of progress
mr chairman i would like to congratulate the chairman and mr baker xz4000120 and mr frank xz4001400 and mr ney xz4002930 and the many members who have worked so hard on this issue for years now
i rise today mr chairman because i am concerned about specific provisions in the manager s amendment which could have unintended consequences on members of our senior population and the ability of nonprofits to work together to serve lowincome communities
specifically mr chairman i would like to receive some assurance from you that you will work with me on these issues as we move toward a final bill in conference
secondly i would like to see clarification that the intention of the language in the manager s amendment pertaining to overlapping board membership was not to disallow single individuals from serving on the board of two organizations
mr chairman today the house of representatives voted on hr 1461 the gse federal housing finance reform act of 2005
in short it will have a chilling effect on the free speech rights of nonprofit organizations
i would like to end debate on this amendment with the words of our distinguished chairman of the federal reserve alan greenspan who has publicly urged the house of representatives to defeat hr 1461 unless the threat of systemic risk is addressed
the bill was introduced on april 5 and referred to the committee on financial services which ordered the bill reported out by a vote of 655 on may 25 and filed in the house on july 14
any member wishing to offer an amendment should submit 55 copies of the amendment and one copy of a brief explanation of the amendment to the rules committee in room h312 of the capitol by noon on tuesday october 25 2005
members should draft their amendments to the text of the bill as reported by the committee on financial services on july 14
we once again encourage all members including the process that will be followed for the manager s amendment to be filed on that date october 25
i want to address a few key issues surrounding this legislation and share my thoughts on what i hope is ultimately included in the bill that is sent to the president
i oppose placing statutory or hard caps on the gses portfolios but consistent with the treasury department s recommendation it is prudent we provide the new regulator with the authority to consider systemic risk
do not deprive them of the benefits of these gses on the theory that they are wealthy
so despite the fact that we think there was an effort by some on the opposite side of the aisle to basically deal with the some of the arguments of the banks and savings and loans about the gses being too big getting too retail basically taking over their markets we support reform and we voted for the bill because we support reform
but what is absolutely mindboggling about what has happened from the time the bill left committee until the time it has reached the floor today is this politicizing of the fund by some of those on the opposite side of the aisle who never supported this fund for low and moderateincome housing to begin with
after the bill left committee they decided that they were going to try to put some unconstitutional boundaries on nonprofits and i guess profitmaking organizations alike that would not allow them to participate in the production of low and moderateincome housing no matter what the need no matter what the crisis if in fact they exercised their constitutional rights to assist people and lead people in doing voter registration
we are on record with doing that
these will have a disproportionate and disparate impact on the state of florida
i urge my colleagues to stay focussed on the issues that are at the center of people s lives and vote no on this amendment and ultimately support the gentleman from massachusetts motion to recommit
look we are down here on the floor it is empty
for once can we not come down on this floor and actually vote the way all of us really understand where our responsibilities are
if we are going to justify our job everybody knows in their heart that we should not be voting for this regardless of our good friends being on it like mr hansen and mr bilbray for example who are colleagues and personal friends to many of us here
so i appeal to everybody on their way over here
i voted against this brac in 2001 on the grounds that it presumptively put infrastructure decisions before force structure decisions
in its final report the commission faulted the department of defense dod for making infrastructure decisions prior to conducting a comprehensive review of the underlying strategic issues that is to be set forth in the 2006 quadrennial defense review which may have better informed and assisted the commission in making its final recommendations the commission also criticized dod for failing to provide necessary source data on its proposals for as long as a month after the dod list was submitted
my view has been validated by a recent revelation by brac commissioner phillip coyle that information gathered to support some of dod s brac recommendations were based largely on google searches
the commission observed that several dod plans to consolidate multiple military facilities were based not on indepth analytic work but on internet search engine queries used only to match facility names and functions
we jeopardize our security if we close infrastructure before we first come to consensus on an overall defense and homeland security strategy
the brac process is also a huge unfunded mandate on communities
while it was a worthy cause i regret that we were forced to spend so much time on brac rather than on new initiatives to improve our communities
the lost human productivity caused by brac not only for communities but on dod personnel as well is something we must calculate if we ever debate a future brac round
i understand the frustrations that have been expressed by some of our colleagues here on the floor about the brac safety valve
we were in the crosshairs in my community and some of the issues that were raised earlier about the friction within the pentagon the inability to appropriately focus on the value of the air guard and there were some other issues that were at work here
i appreciate the debate here on the floor
i would hope that our friends on the armed services committee would focus on adjustments that may need to be made to the brac process to allow a higher priority attached to homeland security in these decisions in the future
i would also hope that this would be an opportunity for us to focus on what we are leaving communities with after the bases are closed
as someone who has been on both sides of that issue let me say i know what it is like
but i would say to those who are on the short end of the recommendation one you should have confidence that the recommendations were made once again by the least political most professional brac we have ever had a brac whose individual members including the chairman were available not just to have a courtesy photo opportunity but to hear out those of us who had presentations before that commission
you can understand when you get on the phone and you try to get a conversation with chairman principi or general soandso or admiral soandso a lot of people want to talk to them
548 on hr 65 i mistakenly recorded my vote as yes when i should have voted no
a political calculation on the part of the pentagon that because tennessee had a great air unit in memphis with c5s and a great air unit in knoxville with kc135s that therefore nashville had to lose one of the best air guard units in the country
guess what almost every other facility on that base is less than 2 years old and we are taking away all of the aircraft
we can not just all protect our local bases but the pentagon s recommendation has to be based on sound military judgment and at least in this one small case it was not
but our decisions concerning future base structure must be based on what best supports the national security of the united states
moreover the brac analysis did not address the potential impact of realignments on state homeland security missions
for example in nashville we have spent over 55 million over the last five years on military construction to include a new state of the art hangarmaintenance complex that won an air force design award
i will vote yes on h j res 65
the recommendations seem to be based much more on bean counting than strategic value nowhere more so than in the case of ellington field in houston texas
i will continue to work on behalf of ellington field and to ensure national and homeland security interests of the gulf coast region
both the department of defense and the brac commission failed to follow the criteria established by congress to base its decisions on military values and cost savings
the brac commission recommended realignment of installations in the 17th congressional district of illinois but failed to base its decision on military value criteria
the brac decisions regarding not only bases in illinois but throughout the nation are extremely frustrating because the commission recognized the military value and cost savings provided streamlining of bases already undertaken on a local level
i look forward to working with him on the cleanup of this process and hope that we do not have to go through it again
i appreciate his leading the charge on this bill today
moreover gunter is home to one of four major defense information systems agency disa nodes which provide the backbone on which air force systems run
this culminated when my amendment was included in the house version of fiscal year 1996 national defense authorization act hr 1530 which blocked the army s proposal to relocate the attc until an outside independent study at fort rucker the attc is able to have their fleet of approximately 40 test aircraft maintained by the large maintenance and logistics operation that supports the training mission on post
the vast pool of pilots and aircraft from the aviation center also facilitates the attc s ability to realize a greater return on the testing dollar invested
finally with fort rucker being the army proponent for unmanned aerial vehicles uavs it is crucial that the attc be able to leverage the expertise associated with this proponency to conduct its tests on uavs
as costs of weapons systems crucial to winning the war on terror continue to rise it is important that we explore all avenues in order to find the money necessary to give the warfighter everything he or she needs to complete their mission
in conclusion i would like to thank all of the commissioners and their staffs for their tireless efforts on one of the most thankless jobs in government
i urge a no vote on the resolution and yield back the balance of my time
yet the base closure commission on a close vote decided to close ellington
as we know an airborne attack on a refinery complex could seriously disrupt our nation s energy supply causing major nationwide economic impacts
an attack on a chemical plant could result in a hazardous release and thousands of casualties
currently our 147th air wing provides air security in the area and the solution from the pentagon is rotating several planes to fly on alert out of ellington which provides a much smaller deterrent than having a full squadron
i urge a yes vote on the resolution
we have seen in the aftermath of katrina and rita the negative effects caused by disruptions in our oil supply and refining capacity and leaving this area unprotected is leaving the door open to a terrorist attack on this critical infrastructure
an airborne attack on the refinery chemical complex could seriously disrupt the nation s energy supply causing major nationwide economic impacts
an attack on a chemical plant could result in a hazardous release with thousands of casualties
currently the 147th fighter wing of the texas air national guard provides air security in the area and could respond to a threat on the complex or at the port in minutes because of the close proximity
rotating several planes to fly on alert out of ellington provides a much smaller deterrent than having a full squadron permanently stationed there and would not provide enough planes to respond to multiple attacks on multiple targets in the area
the area around ellington also provides the 147th with excellent training airspace including overwater airtoair training on the gulf of mexico allowing them to perform supersonic flights and lights out training from the surface to 50 000 feet
the savings estimated in the dod s brac report are minimal and do not justify moving the f16s away from ellington while it is estimated that retiring the f16s will save dod 36 million over 20 years an attack on any of the possible targets listed above especially the petrochemical facilities and port of houston would cost our national economy billions of dollars
each year i would offer an amendment in the armed services committee to put off the brac for many of the reasons that the gentleman from illinois has stated to put off the brac for 2 years until we could see where we are about bringing troops home to see where we are on our war against terror
on the positive side the brac commission removed several significant bases from the closure list
on the negative side the commission s actions on some issues like the commission s directive relating to the naval air station oceana for example raise a number of questions about the credibility underlying the brac process
to those of my colleagues who still may be on the fence about today s vote i would point out that disapproval of the brac 2005 recommendations would guarantee yet another round of base closures in the very near future
bases on today s closure list would likely appear again on the future list
mr chairman i yield 7 minutes to the gentleman from new york mr boehlert xz4000350 the distinguished chairman of the committee on science
that is what troubles me in this one because the air force set out on a plan to arrive at a number and they destroyed in my opinion much of what one of their components does best and that is the air national guard
will your state take this on
they said will you take this on at your springfield f16 base
mr chairman i rise today to support this resolution of disapproval on the base realignment and closure commission s brac recommendations that are now before congress
mr chairman this is the third brac round that i have been through so i understand the importance of community leaders and base officials doing the homework necessary to define the installation s military value and the potential economic impact this process will have on communities where bases are located
during this latest round i would argue that ohio had some of the most hardworking and competent individuals working on behalf of our state s installations
when we requested material on how they came to their recommendations we did nt receive it for weeks
second i was asked several years ago if i would support springfield taking on this training mission that would require specialized infrastructure to support it
the brac analysis on springfield shows that operational personnel will begin to leave the base in 2007 while there are student pilots scheduled for training in 2008
as we saw in the days following the recent hurricanes in the gulf coast region and on 911 the air national guard was a critical resource in transporting troops supplies and protection
finally i was dismayed that there was absolutely no discussion by the brac commissioners or staff regarding the national guard recommendations during the final considerations on august 26th
on the day the brac commission upheld their recommendation to realign the springfield air national guard base i wrote a letter to each brac commissioner to express my disappointment with the way they handled decisions regarding the national guard
i also asked for an explanation on how the commissioners arrived at their decision and i received no answer
our country s security depends on it
madam speaker pursuant to section 2908 d of public law 101510 i move that the house resolve itself into the committee of the whole house on the state of the union for the consideration of the joint resolution hj res 65 disapproving the recommendations of the defense base closure and realignment commission
on a final note i would like to thank the brac commissioners for their service
tony principi took on another tough one in chairing this brac commission
also we had on our committee two former members of the armed services committee who were on the brac commission jim bilbray and jim hansen and mr chairman they have served us well as senior statesmen in again what amounted to very very difficult roles
after a series of hearings and debates today the house will vote on h j res 65 disapproving recommendation of the defense base closure and realignment commission
since the department of defense released those dreaded base closure recommendations on may 13 2005 elected officials community leaders and employees have come together to make the case for keeping their respective facilities open
let me state that i am extremely pleased that on august 26 2005 the brac commission decided not only to reverse its decision to close the defense finance accounting service in cleveland ohio but to expand and add jobs at this facility
dfas cleveland is an integral part of the nerve center that supports our troops on the ground in iraq and worldwide
it has a track record of innovation and success that has been recognized on more than one occasion
in addition i would like to thank the gentleman from ohio mr latourette xz4002350 who is seated on the floor and his staff for all the work they did in supporting dfas as well as the gentleman from ohio mr kucinich xz4002270 for his tireless efforts
the 2005 department of defense recommendations put on the brac closure list inappropriately the cleveland area and they targeted cleveland with over 1 000 job cuts
i have supported president bush on every request that he has made before this house for the money to support our troops and now we have more than 135 000 troops and many men and women working in the state department and the embassy there trying to help stand up a democracy help stand up a police force and help bring about democracy in iraq
i know what the chairman said about those who served on the brac but i am not sure that we were quite as well served by some of those members as we could have been in some of their deliberations
the global war on terrorism has reached deep into our military structure and showed us that we can no longer ask our military to do more with less
the brac commission noted in its report to the president that the list of recommendations that were released by the department of defense on may 13 contained more proposed actions than all previous brac rounds combined
there was apparently no interaction between the pentagon and other federal agencies that share assets and installation space such as the department of veterans affairs and the united states coast guard agencies that could be now left in serious financial straits if the burden of maintaining these facilities falls completely on them
a number of governors have gone on record and refused to give their consent for the movement of their national guard units
on july 14 the brac commission s own deputy general counsel issued an opinion that not only are the proposed air guard moves in violation of federal law they may be unconstitutional
and there is also a quote from the commission on page 330 of their report in fact the commission is concerned that there is a likelihood that the 2005 brac round could produce only marginal net savings over the 20year period mr chairman i reserve the balance of my time
mr chairman let me just pick up on a couple of the people that have spoken
i want to pick up on a point that mr delay xz4001040 made
that was my point earlier on in my opening statement
the point that mr taylor xz4003991 made why not give congress the responsibility the armed services committee the responsibility why lay it off on somebody else
i know people that serve on the base closing commission and i know they spend a lot of time but this work is flawed
i mentioned earlier there is a law on the books passed by congress that says that you can not close air and guard bases unless you get the authority from the governors
the defense department has ignored us on this
so based on that argument based on the flawed brac report based on a law that is on the books a federal law that says you can not close these air and guard bases without the authority of the governor i ask members to speak up today to be a voice for the people to be a voice for the military to be a voice that says this brac is not right and i urge members to vote for the resolution
however they were given the job of examining a flawed proposal based more on achieving the bottom line then ensuring the security of our nation
since 2002 i have voted in the armed services committee and on the floor to either repeal or delay brac 2005 because i have felt all along that the process had serious flaws
governors and adjutants general widely opposed this plan citing the impact on recruiting and retention of guard members lack of consultation and reduced availability of personnel for vital state emergency response and homeland security functions
regardless of the result of today s vote connecticut has the law on its side and i am confident that we will secure the future of the one of our most important duties is to provide for the defense of our nation
this was a process done on facts
they paid attention to the arguments and observations and at the end of the day cleveland did not win because cleveland had more political muscle cleveland won on the facts and on objective standards
an integrated military force able to communicate and coordinate effectively in response to conflict remains crucial to national security and the war on terrorism
i am concerned by technical errors and the overall process used by the pentagon and the base realignment and closure brac commission to reach the recommendations before us this evening and it is my hope that in the future significant improvements will be made on the current model when realignment and closure decisions are made
in its decisions on hanscom the brac process recognized that the success or failure of a base in fulfilling its mission relies on the availability of skilled and experienced personnel and the connections that develop in intellectual clusters
when the brac commission held their new england regional hearing in boston on july 6 i submitted testimony to the commission arguing that the decision to realign the afrl at hanscom was inconsistent with other aspects of the pentagon s analysis of hanscom and could disrupt key programs operating there
while i strongly protest this decision i am pleased that overall the commission s recommendations on hanscom reaffirmed the value of the regional human capital capabilities in science and technology and i am encouraged by the commission s indication that the air force will look to expand the mission at hanscom outside of the brac process
for instance questions remain unanswered about the pentagon s failure to consult with state governors state adjutants general and the department of homeland security on decisions related to the national guard and key homeland security functions located outside the pentagon s bureaucracy
as we approach the end of this very difficult brac round it is important that we remain focused on promoting the best interests of the entire state and that we continue to work as one maine
but we could accept that and senator warner the chairman of the senate committee on armed services has said as well we can accept that decision but for the fact that it is inconsistent with the brac authorizing legislation which was designed to save money and to improve military effectiveness
we are going to in fact have to spend billions of dollars on building new facilities and the fact that that money is going to have to come out of the military construction quality of life appropriations subcommittee where we need to be conserving money to pay for veterans health care for the thousands of veterans that are coming back from the iraq and afghanistan war defies common sense
you can not do any of the things that you have to do in a metropolitan area like northern virginia or the washington metro area even though we have buildings that are right on the sidewalk that are just as important in florida and texas that were not touched
mr speaker i could go on at greater length on why i do not think that these recommendations make sense from a cost standpoint from a military effectiveness standpoint from just a commonsense standpoint
it is going to cause a brain drain in terms of many of the agencies that we rely so much on for technological superiority and intelligence
mr chairman i rise in support of the bill before us to reject the brac recommendations and i thank the gentleman from illinois for his work on this bill
doing this during a war and before we establish our global military footprint through the quadrennial defense review sends the wrong signal to our allies and to the soldiers and families who may depend on services at the bases we are closing
members of the airlift wing have served more than 195 000 days just since 911 in support of homeland defense and the global war on terror
i was disappointed therefore at the inclusion of the 179th on the pentagon s proposed closure list in may
when the joint systems manufacturing center located in lima in my congressional district was placed on the brac list with a recommendation to reduce manufacturing space by 27 percent top army officials working on the brac staff made themselves available to meet with representatives of jsmc and the community
the army s deliberations on jsmc were an ideal example of how the brac process works well when information is shared and all relevant parties are consulted
there is no reason why we can not make these decisions and to give these decisions to an independent commission i think is just a copout on our part
i am also truly disappointed because i believed that the brac ultimately would try to be an independent broker and that the commission would review each facility analyze the data and come to conclusions based on facts
but even so even though the brac was supposedly an independent commission tasked with ensuring that the dod s recommendations would not hurt the warfighter even though they admitted there was a serious concern about the warfighter and how in the days of fort monmouth the communications and electronics functions crucial to iraq might be seriously hampered they still decided to include it on the list
i cosponsored the measure h j res 65 which disapproves the recommendations of the defense base realignment and closure commission brac as submitted by the president to congress on september 15 2005
mcpherson remained on the brac list for closure despite the vital role they continue to play in coordinating the deployment of troops abroad and federal response to national disasters like this year s string of devastating hurricanes
even though i support the brac i would like to take this opportunity to comment on the process that was used in this round of brac
there are some outstanding prospects for jointness included on the list
it is clear we are leaning heavily on guard and reserve
the same service secretaries who said they wanted to cancel the crusader who said they wanted to cancel the arsenal ship who wanted to cancel the joint strike fighter the same guys who have no hesitation on canceling things and making tough decisions never named one base that they wanted to close
every time you lose a base you lose a place to put those people in the event weather whether it is a tsunami in the pacific a hurricane in mississippi a flood or earthquake on the west coast a flood in the midwest you lose a capability to help the american people
i can not understand why in a time that we are fighting a global war on terror a war where we are actively engaged on two fronts and obligated to also increase domestic defense against terrorism here at home the department of defense has suggested in fact recommended that we close bases across the nation
remember the department of homeland security has not been consulted mr chairman on the impact these base closures pose to our domestic security
the threat of international terrorism requires us to have the best tools available to respond to threats on our allies our interests and our homeland at a moment s notice and i am afraid that the current brac recommendations hamper our ability to do so
take for instance the recommendation that the largest joint reserve base on the east coast should be closed
hundreds of my constituents rely on that base for their national guard training
thousands of my constituents rely on the customer traffic the servicemen and women stationed at willow grove provide for their local businesses that surround the base
and on a larger scale both my constituents and americans from new york to baltimore benefit from the base s protection
mr chairman at a time when we are fighting a global war on terror and facing new and very real threats the nation must be fully prepared
hr 1606 would allow corporations labor unions and wealthy financiers to make unlimited soft money donations for campaign ads on the internet coordinated by candidates
why is this bill on the suspension calendar
today the majority is pushing through a bill that would enable monied interests to regain undue influence on federal elections
mr speaker that should be an amendment to this bill on the floor
now i do agree with my friends on the other side of the aisle that had this bill gone through the regular order we probably could have worked out some compromises that would have protected the rights of individuals and bloggers and so forth but we do not have that ability at this point so it is either an up or down vote on a complete exemption
in the absence of this compromise we have to depend on the fec for regulation
but now we are on the cusp of a new fec regulation that could stifle free expression
without congressional action today arbitrary restrictions would be imposed on blogs and other web content deterring participation from the very segment of our population that we want to encourage to be politically active
state political parties would also be allowed to spend soft money on internet advertising to attack and promote federal candidates
if the congress is really concerned with protecting internet bloggers i urge consideration of legislation introduced yesterday by my colleagues representatives shays and meehan which reaffirms that bloggers communicating on their websites are not covered by campaign finance laws without allowing members of congress and other federal candidates to use corrupting soft money to support their campaigns
i urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to vote no on the online freedom of speech act
mr speaker as i recall it was the gentlewoman from california ms zoe lofgren xz4002450 who thought this would be an appropriate procedure to bring it to the floor on suspension
i am grateful to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle who at least feel as concerns the internet that there are compelling policy reasons why that should not be subject to this kind of regulation
in other words it would have a chilling impact on people s exercise of what we believe should be their free speech rights
mr speaker i have to comment on the irony that we have people here defending vigorous open debate and free speech by invoking one of the most restrictive procedures of the house of representatives
is there some reason unbeknownst to me that kept us from having this as a bill that came to the floor that people can go to the rules committee and we could have amendments and we could debate it for more than 20 minutes on each side
it involves how you take technology and how you adapt basic constitutional principles to it and that is to be debated by 20 minutes on each side and that is to be preformed with no amendments
it achieves one goal but that goal is a worthy one the protection of free speech on the internet
the internet is a marketplace of ideas that welcomes all participants on equal footing
not only would such regulation be a nightmare to administer and enforce it would place complex responsibility on ordinary citizens that would functionally restrict their political free speech and violate their first amendment rights
today thousands and thousands of americans run blogs that are focused on politics and millions of viewers visit their favorite bloggers web sites for commentary often not found in the mainstream media
without hr 1606 i fear that bloggers one day could be fined for improperly linking to a campaign web site or merely forwarding a candidate s press release to an email list and the list goes on
in 2002 before i came to this body congress passed a sweeping new campaign finance law and in a rare moment of restraint nowhere in the new law did congress impose restrictions on the internet
under the new law public communications were clearly defined and just as clearly the internet does not appear on this list
so logically the fec declined to regulate public communications online equating the give and take on the internet to candidate forums and rallies and debates that are open to the public
just like on the street corner people can talk back to a blog by writing their own posts or establishing their own sites
despite congressional silence on this matter in 2004 a federal court instructed the fec to regulate internet communications and that process is under way
when the choice is between more regulation and more freedom we should always err on the side of freedom
the gentleman from massachusetts mr meehan xz4002690 and others have been bulldogs in moving us toward a more perfect democratic union by keeping government of and by the people not of and by some of the people and by special interests and this act would not add protections of freedom of speech on the blogosphere as it is purported to do
i myself am an occasional guest blogger on political web sites
the court decided that the fec the agency in charge of regulating our election laws was in error when it decided it did not have the authority to require the regulation of free speech on the internet
mr speaker bloggers do nt have to spend millions of dollars on printing presses nor do they have to invest in tv or radio broadcast towers
they are able to share their opinions and ideas free of charge on the most powerful tool of free speech the world has ever known
mr speaker i did opine at the hearings since there was complete agreement among all of the members present that we did not want to regulate the internet that we might be able to take care of this on the suspension calendar
mr speaker i understand the procedural objections to this and certainly when i made the suggestion during our hearing that we could probably handle this on the suspension i believed that was the case
what this bill would do would be to allow communications on the internet to avoid the heavy hand of regulation
we do not want the heavy regulatory load on the internet nor do we need to do it
under current law unless we pass this exemption daily chaos which if they call me for a comment on a candidate and it was run on their daily web site within the specified time we might have an actual problem here unless they are entitled to the press exemption
this bill will keep the fec out of the business of regulating political speech on the internet
i also rise in opposition to this legislation being considered on the suspension calendar when it is so clearly a controversial matter on which there has never been a committee markup for members to offer amendments and under the rules we can not offer amendments here today
the debate today is about what is the best way to approach coordinated expenditures that are campaignrelated on the internet
the question is whether to exempt individual speech as i have proposed or create blanket exemptions for entities as varied as labor unions and major corporations who make soft money contributions at the behest of candidates on behalf of candidates and at the direction of candidates
this congress could pass that bill in the middle of the night and then members of congress who passed the bill could actually ask those same pharmaceutical interests to write sixfigure checks for campaign ads for them to appear on the internet
the judge in that case colleen kollarkottelly wrote that the provisions would permit rampant circumvention of the campaign finance laws and foster corruption she went on to say that the provision would severely undermine the campaign finance law
under this legislation communications over the internet by individuals on their own web sites would be treated the same as they are in hr 1606
we do not exempt the internet from laws controlling child pornography we do not allow child pornography on the internet
on the floor he said he was opposed to any limit
he would just as soon have no limits at all on any campaign finance
mr speaker in this time when a cloud of scandal hangs over washington when the chief of staff to the vice president of the united states has been indicted for perjury making false statements when a top white house official is led away in handcuffs indicted on charges of making false statements related to an investigation of his dealing with lobbyists at a time when a top republican lobbyist and fundraiser has been indicted for fraud when that investigation is the subject of a department of justice investigation and today over in the other body there is a hearing going on looking into possible other misdealings at a time when the american people have indicated that they are fed up with scandals how can this house support a bill that would open up new avenues for corruption to enter the political process
mr speaker on that i demand the yeas and nays
mr speaker i ask unanimous consent that all members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on hr 1606
most importantly it has created a completely new opportunity for all citizens to exercise their right to free speech by opining on the most important issues of the day as they see them as the citizens see them
when congress passed the bipartisan campaign finance reform act in 2002 the law apparently was unclear on what impact it would have on political speech on the internet
in testimony before the fec and before the committee on house administration both liberal and conservative bloggers expressed their support for this exemption
the regulations proposed by the fec could limit the ability of online activists to talk to campaigns to give discounts on advertisements to spend money maintaining their site to link to candidates sites to advocate the election of a candidate or to send political emails
potentially the fec s rulings could become contentbased restrictions on speech and on free speech
unlike television and radio activists do not require large sums of money to post their message on the internet
there has been no demonstration that the growth of the internet has had a corrupting influence on politics
there is however ample evidence that the internet has had a positive effect on our political system by encouraging young people a whole new generation of people to get involved in our political process
bloggers and other online activists should not have to worry about accidentally running afoul of campaign finance laws when they are expressing their own opinions on the internet
the committee on house administration under chairman ney s leadership had a hearing on this topic back last september and at that hearing several members of congress and of the committee including myself actually suggested that the congress needed to step into this process to clarify congress intent on this issue instead of leaving it up to federal agencies and the court system
by debating and voting on this bill today the house will clarify once and for all its intent on this issue
it is the height of hypocrisy for the print media to use their right to free speech to opine against their competition on the internet
thanks to the hard work and commitment of democratic members on the committee it now offers grants to state courts so that they can make meaningful enhancements to courtroom safety and security
we will convene at 12 30 on monday for morning hour and at 2 pm
any votes that may be called on those measures will be rolled until 6 30 monday afternoon or early monday evening
on friday we will not be in session as members know so that there will be an opportunity for all of us to participate in veterans day ceremonies that take place in our districts
we have a great deal of work to do not only on tuesday but next week so we will be meeting here and we have the items that i mentioned the measures that will be considered under suspension we have the very important secure access to justice and court protection act that needs to be considered and we just have to proceed with our work
so let me say that we do want every member to participate in those elections but i suspect that in light of the fact that we will have so much work to do here that members should plan to be in washington during the day on tuesday
as you know we have just voted on the foreign operations appropriations bill conference report and we have three conference groups that are continuing to meet on energy and water the science state justice and commerce appropriation bill and the military quality of life appropriations conference report
mr speaker if the gentleman will yield as i think the gentleman heard in my announcement i announced that it is our anticipation we anticipate that we will consider what we call the deficit reduction act of 2005 and it is a measure which we will be working on next week
late next week or the middle to the latter part of next week we anticipate a vote here in the house on that very important measure that is designed to try and reduce the deficit and reform government and ensure that we can do the very important work that the american people sent us here to do
mr speaker if the gentleman will yield what this deals with is mandatory spending and what this deals with is the deficit challenge which democrats and republicans regularly decry here and we are trying to focus on the reduction of the deficit and that is the reason that we are appropriately referring to this as the deficit reduction act
they are working with the department of the treasury and members in the leadership of the banking committee on the other side of the aisle and we do hope very much that we will be able to put together a legislative package that can be considered before that very important december 31 date to which my friend referred
mr speaker i rise in support of the motion to instruct conferees on the patriot and terrorism prevention reauthorization bill
i urge a yea vote on the motion to instruct
in san diego police department records count no fewer than 3 750 gang members on the street
with such tragic incidents mr chairman we are in collaboration if you will on hr 1751 at least the premise the secure access to justice and court protection act of 2005
i commend the gentleman from michigan mr conyers xz4000800 the ranking member and the gentleman from wisconsin mr sensenbrenner xz4003650 the chairman for their collaborative efforts and the gentleman from texas mr gohmert xz4006510 my colleague a former judge and i guess one would say once a judge always a judge who has taken the leadership on this issue
in addition i would say that this hard work and commitment of democratic members on the committee have also now provided for offers of grants to state courts so they can make meaningful enhancements to courtroom safety and security
let me comment briefly on those mandatory sentences
the judicial conference of the united states would see the impact of mandatory minimum sentences on individual cases as well as on the criminal justice system as a whole and has expressed its deep opposition to mandatory minimum sentencing over a dozen times to congress noting that these sentences severely distort and damage the federal sentencing system
on the issue of the death penalty let me suggest these few thoughts
however unfortunately in petitioning to get a new trial on the basis of real definitive new evidence the courts would not consider such and of course frances newton has gone to her death
the judicial conference of the united states which sees the impact of mandatory minimum sentences on individual cases as well as on the criminal justice system as a whole has expressed its deep opposition to mandatory minimum sentencing over a dozen times to congress noting that these sentences severely distort and damage the federal sentencing system
before doing so i want to thank the chairman and the ranking minority member of the house judiciary committee for their efforts on this bill
the rationale for changing the language to make state supreme courts eligible for receiving grants for the creation of a threat assessment database is that the state courts are on the ground and have the best understanding of what type of threats are out there and where they are coming from
mr chairman i urge a yes vote on this amendment
mr chairman on that specific question i can not answer yes to or no to
the very nature of their work brings them in contact with dangerous criminals on a daily basis
the initial investigation focused on a likely suspect white supremacist matthew hale who had been convicted of soliciting judge lefkow s murder only a year before
one of the individuals on the hit list is a constituent of mine and while we are thankful he and his family are safe it is a chilling reminder that the security of judicial officials can not be taken for granted
even though matthew hale and his white supremacist group were not responsible for the letkow murders they were vocal in their praise for the killings on the internet
mr speaker could the chairman tell me what appropriations conference reports we might expect to see on the floor next week
mr chairman on which day next week might we consider the budget reconciliation bill that calls for more than 50 billion in mandatory spending cuts
this is an important issue that has had broad bipartisan support in the past and action is needed because it is scheduled to expire on december 31
i understand that our financial services committee democrats stand ready to work on a bipartisan basis on this and they have asked for a markup as soon as possible
mr chairman the entire country witnessed what happened in my district in the fulton county courthouse on the morning of march 11 2005
on that day brian nichols was to appear in a retrial for charges of rape and false imprisonment
in the aftermath of the security failures at the fulton county courthouse the entire atlanta metropolitan area an area of more than 4 million people was on edge
schools were put on lock down in several counties
if we had proper security measures in place on that fateful friday morning we could have avoided the hysteria and disruptions of normal life that followed
however the main focus of this bill is not the things that the courts have asked for to enhance their security but on extraneous death penalties and mandatory minimum sentences which will do nothing to improve the security of our courts or personnel associated with them
the notion that congress has to direct judges on how to sentence those who harm or threaten judges and their families and others associated with court activities or that congress has to replace the states in prosecution of murders of state judges and other state officials is absurd
the kinds of people we are talking about clearly have not been deterred by death penalties and mandatory minimum sentences already on the books and applicable to them for those kinds of crimes so they certainly will not be deterred by adding more such mandatory minimums
and judges facing such defendants clearly do not need congressional guidance on what the appropriate sentences may be
accordingly i have prepared an amendment which would remove the provisions allowing the federal government simply on the basis of someone s salary being paid in part by federal funds to take over traditional state prosecutions of state murder cases
dear representative conyers on behalf of the judicial conference of the united states the policymaking body of the federal judiciary
at a resentencing proceeding ordered by a state court on direct appeal a prosecutor could commit a flagrant violation of batson v kentucky by striking all africanamericans from the jury and a federal court would be powerless to do anything about it
dear representative on behalf of the american civil liberties union we write to express our opposition to hr 1751 the secure access to justice and court protection act of 2005
hr 1751 is scheduled for a floor vote on wednesday november 9 we urge you to oppose this legislation
the house rules committee has made a number of amendments in order for the floor debate on hr 1751 we urge your support for the following amendments 1 scott va 8 this amendment replaces all mandatory minimum sentences with higher maximum sentences
according to the death penalty information center 121 prisoners on death row have now been exonerated since 1973
for example this would result in federal courts not having jurisdiction to review habeas petitions involving claims in state capital cases that were based on ineffective assistance of counsel or prosecutorial misconduct during the sentencing phase of the case errors that could mean the difference between life and death for the petitioner
for the abovementioned reasons we urge members to oppose hr 1751 when the house votes on the bill on november 9 2005
having the experience of sentencing people on an ongoing basis judges see the differences in activities roles backgrounds of the offenders of crime
they know it makes no sense to sentence just on the basis of the name of the crime rather than on the basis of the facts and circumstances of the crime and the level of involvement and background of the offenders
some have suggested that mandatory minimum sentencing is necessary because of recent supreme court decisions that prevent sentencing increases based on factors not established at the trial
yet their positions on mandatory minimum sentences appear to be no different before those cases were decided
mr chairman this amendment would eliminate the expansion of the federal death penalty jurisdiction on the basis of any portion of the salary of a state or local official being covered with federal funds
nor is it surprising that with such a sorry record of death penalty administration that several states have abolished the death penalty or placed moratoriums on the applications of their death penalty while studies are being conducted and why some while they have it on the books have not applied it in many years
i want to point out more recently she has done further analysis in elaboration of her research and found in terms of deterring murders executions deter murders in six states have no effect on murders in eight states and increased murders in 13 states
i would ask the gentleman whether or not this applies to federal officials only we are not imposing this on state officials
this bill passed the committee on the judiciary by an overwhelming vote of 265
the bill also prohibits public disclosure on the internet and other public sources of personal information about judges law enforcement victims and witnesses to protect federal judges and prosecutors from organized efforts to harass and intimidate them through false filings of liens and other encumbrances against their property and improves coordination between the marshals and the federal judges
the bill is supported by those on the front lines of our criminal justice system and is backed by the conference of chief justices and the conference of state court administrators the federal bar association the federal criminal investigators association and the fraternal order of police the national association of assistant us attorneys the international union of police associations aflcio the major county sheriffs association the national law enforcement council the national sheriffs association the national troopers coalition the international association of campus law enforcement administrators and the american federation of state county and municipal employees
finally the amendment clarifies the language as to the coordination between the marshals service and the administrative office on security issues
sentences now for similar crimes are being handed in disparate fashion depending on the region where the offense occurs
these recent attacks follow on the heels of the 1998 bombing of circuit judge robert vance in the 11th circuit the 1998 shooting of judge daronoco and the 1979 shooting of judge wood outside his san antonio home
i urge a no vote on the amendment
he is opposed to a bill that has been worked on significantly on a bipartisan basis
in order to get it passed and signed into law to protect the judicial branch and those who do business and work for it vote this silly motion down and pass the bill as has been worked out on a bipartisan basis
mr speaker on that i demand the yeas and nays
what he is trying to do is to help that young person extricate him or herself and let the courts and law enforcement know aspects of gang crime that are key in convicting our most dangerous criminals on the streets
we know from the examples we have had judges families stalked based on information the criminals were able to find on the internet
i know there are going to be things on the internet that are troubling to us and we are always going to be in a tug and a push to try to figure out where we draw the line
if they simply compile the database and a police officer s name happens to be on it with no intention of ill will then obviously this would not make that illegal
but if one is a police officer if one is an undercover police officer imagine what it feels like to go home after a hard day at work dealing with some very bad people and find information about their comings and goings posted on a web page
i ask for a yes vote on the weiner amendment
four years ago on september 11 2001 without warning like missiles from hell two planes filled with the most innocent of victims slammed into the world trade center s twin towers 3 000 dead seemingly in an instant
on that day we as americans took a hit but we stood united and we responded with confidence blue states and red states suburban and urban black and white rich and poor together united
mr speaker the motion i offer today will impose stiff fines and criminal penalties on contractors who knowingly falsify information in order to win approval of government contracts during presidentially declared emergencies
mr speaker the motion i offer today at this defining moment in our nation s history will either reaffirm the promise of our nation s greatness or condemn us from this moment on for failing to live up to our obligations as a nation that deserves and demands only from us fairness and goodness
judge jane roth former chairwoman of the judicial conference committee on security and facilities also testified and was very helpful honorable paul mcnulty who was then the us attorney for the eastern district of virginia and also honorable john clark who at that time was a us marshal for the eastern district of virginia
it is an honor to serve with him on the judiciary committee that he chairs and i thank the chairman for that continued support
the folks that we attempt to protect are on the front lines
mr speaker i thank my friend from california mr stark xz4003870 for his leadership on the ways and means committee on trade issues and especially on health care issues
i would like to caution my colleagues just because ustr is giving us major face time on capitol hill does not mean they are actually listening to what we are saying
i was sitting on the house floor at the time
every trade agreement every trade agreement we voted on since jordan has been a step back and there is no indication that the administration even cares about that
we heard the same promises on cafta as we hear today
we hear the same promises in bahrain as we heard on cafta the same promises on cafta that we heard about china the same promises on china as we heard about nafta
if the administration continues on its current course we can count on a few things for certain
i want to thank the gentleman from wisconsin mr ryan xz4003511 for his persistence in keeping us focused on getting this agreement completed this year
as a result congress gives up a lot of its prerogatives and it is absolutely critical that in giving up these prerogatives that the administration consult and work very closely with the members of congress on both sides of the aisle in negotiating entering into and submitting to congress the implementing legislation
but thanks to ambassador portman thanks to the help from the majority side we were able to continue consultation with congress on both sides of the aisle prior to the submission of the implementing legislation
on substance the usbahrain free trade agreement is a good agreement for several reasons
so this does reflect what we should be doing on workers rights
this will allow the united states to initiate formal consultation with bahrain on these commitments on the procedures outlined in article 156 of the agreement
finally the ustr is committed to report periodically to congress on bahrain s fulfillment of its labor commitments
mr speaker i am pleased to yield 7 minutes to my colleague from michigan mr levin xz4002380 who has been one of the leading members of the ways and means committee and the trade subcommittee on insisting that trade agreements include protection for workers rights
many of my colleagues who have spoken of concern have talked about concern on economic policies related to trade here in the united states and i join them on many occasions particularly as they are referring to problems that we are having with trading partners
on the traditional barriers of tariff and nontariff issues i have not heard any debate against this agreement
so i think bahrain has passed the test on an agreement that we should support but at times there is more than just the economic issues that affect our country that we should be looking at whether we move forward with bilateral regional trade agreements
so for all these reasons this agreement with a very small country that will have minimum impact on the economic activities of this country i think it will be positive but it will be minimum because of the size of the country but represents progress as to how we should evaluate trading relations with other partners
mr speaker i rise in strong support of this agreement and i want to begin by extending my congratulations to the distinguished chairman of the trade subcommittee for his fine work on this effort and to thank him along with my friend from wisconsin and my friend from texas both of whom are here on the floor and who worked closely with us with our working group to promote the issue of trade
and so focusing on these issues is very important if we are going to deal with questions like the one we are going to address next week illegal immigration to try to enhance the economies of these developing nations
we want people who are struggling to get on to the first rung of the economic ladder and that is what these trade agreements are about when it comes to their relationship
on average jobs that are focused on exports into new markets which is exactly what these agreements are all about exactly what these agreements are all about on average these jobs focused on exports pay about 17 percent higher wage rates than those that are focused on jobs that are merely designed for domestic consumption here
if i could reclaim my time let me just say that it is fascinating to listen to my friends on the other side of the aisle who when we were in the midst of our debate just a few minutes ago on the alternative minimum tax they were very strong proponents of making sure we bring about reform so that people who are in that wage rate that goes all the way up to 342 000 a year get relief under the amt
so i believe that if you look at the jobs that have been created if you look at the wage rates that we have right now in the united states if you look at the standard of living in the united states of america juxtaposed to other countries in the world it is very clear that the united states of america is the single greatest nation on the face of the earth and it is in large part due to the fact that we have over the last several years put together a wide range of trade agreements
and i would argue that building on the central american free trade agreement this bahrain trade agreement which is what we are talking about at this moment i believe is very very critical to continuing that kind of growth
now let us look at the issue of the global war on terror
now one of the things that is essential as we seek our opportunity to try and turn the corner on the threat of terrorism we need to focus on economic growth throughout the middle east
all one needs to do is look at what mohammed atta and his cronies were doing before perpetuating the most heinous act on our soil on september 11 of 2001
i recall their being in south florida and las vegas nevada leading up to that meaning the focus on economic opportunity is something that we need to realize can help diminish that kind of terrorist threat there
so as i listen to my friends on the other side of the aisle and i am happy to say this agreement is enjoying strong bipartisan support but as i listen to those on the other side of the aisle who are opposed to this agreement it is very unfortunate that so many of them do not recognize the tremendous growth that my friend from florida the chairman of the trade subcommittee just went through the 43 percent gdp growth a 5 percent unemployment rate 215 000 jobs created last month alone in the aftermath of hurricane katrina and all of the other challenges that we faced that these have come about in large part due to the trade agreements that we have put into place
we are happy to provide the lead but every democrat who wants to jump on board in support of the cause of free trade is more than welcome and i am happy the democrats are understanding the critical importance of this effort
mr speaker my good friend and colleague has already pointed out the closed rule we are working on today is mandated by the fact that we are dealing with a trade agreement
so i take no issue with the type of rule on this specific occasion
i ask my friends in the majority to let the house work its will not so much on this bill but certainly any other in the future that comes before us
i suspect that it has nothing to do with the fact that an economic embargo based on religion is wrong and an affront to basic human rights
the nation of bahrain is a friend of the united states and an important ally in the global war on terror
furthermore on the issue of intellectual property rights the agreement requires each government to criminalize enduser piracy providing strong deterrence against piracy and counterfeiting
as the co chair of the caucus on bahrain with my good friend from wisconsin mr ryan we have worked closely to make today reality
this friendship is built on trust and respect for each other so much so that the us navy s fifth fleet operates in bahrain a friendly and secure environment for the fleet that watches over a dangerous region
as chairman of the financial services committee i want to focus on the benefits to american financial services and economic interests from this agreement
it has demonstrated a strong commitment to cooperate with the us on these issues
it has a knowyourcustomer standard and requires all financial institution employees to take a course annually on how to implement this law
mr speaker let me share with you the real facts of this trade bill and let me thank mr cardin mr levin and mr rangel xz4003330 for really doing the heavy lifting which has created an opportunity for real debate on a good trade bill
i do not stand here to create this divide that my good friend on the other side of the aisle who said you who are against trade bills
in contrast to the usjordan fta the bahrain agreement contains only one enforceable provision on workers rights which is an obligation to enforce domestic labor laws
mr speaker that is why i have introduced hr 4407 a bill to impose a 2year moratorium on negotiating or conclusion of any additional free trade agreements
as our trade deficit continues to set new records we should call a timeout on this headlong rush into these free trade agreements
in 2004 the united states had a record 162 billion deficit on goods trade with china and a 617 billion trade deficit on goods and services worldwide
mr speaker i urge my colleagues to vote no on this free trade agreement with bahrain and any free trade agreements in the future until we can create an american trade policy that is in the best interests of the american people
in addition the united states trade representative has committed to report periodically to congress on bahrain s fulfillment of its agreement and is prepared to invoke article 156 procedures if bahrain fails to carry out these commitments
bahrain is an important political economic and military ally and in the years since 911 has been a valued partner in the war on terror
this agreement is an example of the success that bipartisan engagement on trade issues can generate and this agreement should be a model a starting point for how we can achieve success in the future
in other words as we argued during the cafta debate workers rights should enjoy the same level of protection we place on goods and intellectual property rights a balance that was sorrowfully left out of the cafta agreement
in addition to this the bahraini government has demonstrated its world leadership by recently becoming one of the first arab league nations to remove its boycott on israeli goods and services
these steps are encouraging and indicate that countries are willing to accept minimum standards if the united states insists they be part of free trade agreements the agreement shows that working together bipartisanly on trade issues will produce agreements that address the standards we feel every trade agreement america signs onto should meet the broad fulfillment of america s economic interests the opening of fair markets for america s goods and services and the reversal of america s evergrowing trade deficit
to spread the benefits of globalization workers must have internationally recognized core labor rights prohibitions on child labor forced labor and discrimination and importantly the right of workers to associate and bargain collectively so they can advance their economic interests
unfortunately the bush administration has insisted on using a misguided cookiecutter approach as to the basic standard on worker rights saying to our trading partners simply enforce your own laws where internationally recognized standards of workers rights were wellestablished in law in practice in a nation s history so that there was unlikely a retreat many of us voted yes chile singapore morocco
those included the end of the boycott of israel and its impact on the movement towards security and potential peace in the middle east and american diplomatic relations with a nation moving faster than many others in the middle east towards democratic processes
that started an intensive process where the negotiating parties did work in good faith and where the ways and means committee at a hearing agreed across party lines that promises were not enough but that there must be concrete action on major gaps in labor laws
when all of these particular circumstances are taken into account those of us on the democratic side of the ways and means committee who have actively worked on this matter decided to support the bahrain fta
only then can we be confident that competition with our workers from other countries will not be based on who can most suppress the rights of other workers and that for our own businesses in this day and age as mentioned of our massive trade imbalances there will be increasing numbers of middle income residents in other nations to buy our goods and services
progress made on labor and economic reforms can stand as a model for future trade agreements with the middle east
bahrain has been a steadfast american ally through world war ii the gulf war and the war on terrorism
we have made sure that we are more interdependent upon one another and it is good to be interdependent because with that interdependence we as a nation begin to depend on others in this world
and while the language is not specifically in the bill in talking with the representatives from the bahrain government especially the ambassador that showed us a sincere desire to make certain that he accommodated not republicans or democrats but his respect for this body we were able to persuade most of the members on our side that this was something worth doing not only because of economic reasons but because of the courageous acts that were taken in the middle east by this very small country
mr speaker i thank the gentleman for his leadership on all the free trade agreements and his leadership on so many difficult issues
mr speaker i thank the chairman for yielding and for his hard work on this
also i want to start off mr speaker by thanking the democrats on the committee for working so hard and diligently with us
that is a part of our war on terror has controversy
we believe that freedom and democracy are the best ultimate tools in the war on terrorism
that is ultimately how we win against the war on terrorism
this is the way we do it on a bipartisan basis
this is the opportunity for republicans and democrats to go forward with one voice one face one message as americans going overseas going forward confidently to win the war on terror and help encourage the spread of freedom and democracy
zero tariffs on manufactured goods
zero tariffs on our agricultural goods
in fact after losing millions of good paying blue collar jobs we are now on the cusp of hemorrhaging millions more of white collar information technology jobs
what is going on in our economy today and what is destroying the middle class is that we are losing good paying jobs in manufacturing and information technology and we are replacing those jobs with low paying service industry jobs that provide low wages and minimal benefits
it is tremendously important that our trade agenda remain on track and that we seek bipartisan support in accomplishing this goal
bahrain took the commendable step of writing to ambassador portman to reiterate its commitment on this issue
in addition to these actions by bahrain i am also pleased with the commitment that the us trade representative made to me during the committee s consideration of this agreement to report annually on the status of the arab league boycott and efforts to dismantle it in bahrain and all other countries where it has been applied
dear ambassador portman please accept my congratulations on your recent appointment to serve as the us trade representatives
bahrain has no restrictions whatsoever on american companies trading with bahrain or doing business in bahrain regardless of its ownership or relations with israeli companies
as the home of our united states navy s 5th fleet as a key ally in the war on terror and by promoting an open and transparent market that will benefit our overall bilateral relationship
mr speaker i yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from florida ms roslehtinen xz4003440 who is the chairman of the subcommittee on the middle east and asia
this is not just a flea on an elephant as mr stark xz4003870 stated
i would urge all members to vote yes on this most important issue because i think a message must be sent out loud and strong that we are supporting free trade when we have a good agreement drawn
i would also like to thank mr cardin mr rangel and other members from the other side of the aisle as well as mr ryan xz4003511 and chairman thomas and all of those who have worked hard to bring this along and of course staff on both sides of the aisle
mr speaker on that i demand the yeas and nays
look at the footage when our delegation was in china and the hands that went in front of the cameras as china prohibits free and open press coverage of what goes on there
i urge a no vote on the bahrain free trade agreement
he is right bahrain is a flea on the elephant when it comes to the difference that it will make in economic impact to the united states
but if we really wanted to help in the middle east maybe we would have sold parts for c130s to iran and saved 100 people from dying because of our embargo on selling aircraft parts to a country that could not maintain safe aircraft because the united states refused to deal with them
while the issue should have been dealt with inside of the agreement rather than in a side letter the bahrain fta highlights the missed opportunities on labor protections in our trade agreements with chile singapore and central america
through cooperation democrats working alongside republicans on the ways and means committee who then coordinated with the administration we have before us a strong trade package that will open markets advance free trade and cement america s ties to a strategically important ally in the middle east
the united states leadership on trade is being tested here in congress and in geneva
because in the long term the only way for america to continue to lead the world forward on trade is for us to work across the aisle here in the house
i urge my colleagues to allow today s debate to serve as a first step toward reviving the bipartisan consensus on trade policy that has served this congress so well in the past
yet instead of solving the problem of the amt and helping middle class families this bill only focuses on helping the rich get richer by extending capital gains and dividend tax cuts that do nt expire until 2009
they get that this bill the republican majority bill is passing on enormous deficits to our children
if my friends on the other side of the aisle want to say if we do not extend the dividend and capital gains tax cut we have an automatic tax increase why not say the same about the amt fix
what you are not talking about is you are passing deficit on to our kids
you are passing debt on to our kids
one need look no further than the tax bill on the floor today to see why many americans are frustrated and disappointed with the work of this congress
instead of trying to make progress on the pressing issues facing american families house republican s top priority is passing this 56 billion tax bill that primarily benefits wealthy investors
the question today is whether this house will ever stand up for the many not just the few with budget and tax policies focused on need not greed
so on august 2 2005 i joined with a colleague of mine from colorado congresswoman musgrave a member of the small business committee and we explored the effect of at least one of those tax cuts that we are talking about extending today section 17 which increases the allowable expensing limits from 25 000 on depreciable assets to 100 000
mr speaker in a time of disasters rita katrina on and on in a time of massive deficits and in a time of war it is irresponsible to run up the nation s debt
mr speaker it is irresponsible to put debt on top of massive debt when we know at the end of the horizon there is still more debt that will come in the years to come 27 000 is what each and every man woman and child in this country owes as a result of our nation s debt
mr speaker it is irresponsible to move forward with these tax cuts at the same time that we are telling american families mostly middle class that rely on student loans so they can send their young men and women to college their young daughters and sons are going to have to pay 5 000 more a year in their student loans so we can take care of the 1 percent wealthiest americans in this nation in these bills
she is going to talk with us about her time on the road this week with the president as the president visited in her area in north carolina and she had the opportunity to not only talk tax reforms with the president but to listen to her constituents in north carolina and to hear what was on their mind as they enjoyed that visit and as they had prepared for that visit
at this time i would like to recognize the gentleman from texas mr hensarling xz4001750 who has worked tirelessly not only on budgeting and not only on looking at how we budget but looking at what happens with tax policy and the ramifications that that has throughout our economy both for our large businesses our small businesses and for our families
and if individuals are going to go on and look at this it is house resolution 4297
the gentleman from texas and i have worked long and hard on one provision which is in here which is continued deductibility of state and local sales taxes from your federal income tax filing
it is a deduction that we worked hard last year to get restored and we thank another gentleman from texas mr brady for his incredible leadership on this issue and we thank the leadership of the house for working so closely with us on it
mr speaker i yield to the gentleman from texas for comment on this
at this time of year coming in and voting a tax increase voting a tax increase on our nation s small businesses voting a tax increase on our nation s families
so then it becomes a tax increase on those businesses if they are no longer able to avail themselves of that
they depend on this
the gentleman is accurate on that
individuals that vote no on this tomorrow would be voting to increase that on our nation s teachers
they would be voting no on state sales tax deductibility
another one they would be voting no on is the savers tax credit for lowincome workers who contribute to retirement savings accounts
focusing on that savers tax credit that is something we want to do and we want to see that continue
mr speaker the gentleman is precisely right on that
i thank the gentleman from texas and i thank him so much for being here to talk with us tonight about why this is important legislation and why it is important that we stop a tax increase on the american people
and i know that my constituents certainly remember the recession the president confronted when he took office and they remember the impact that september 11 had on our economy
i thank my friend from kentucky mr lewis xz4002401 and chairman thomas for their work on this issue
this is no time to say we should put the brakes on this economy just because the unemployment rate is lower than the average of the 1970s 1980s and 1990s
those are the same people that on this floor yesterday we talked about how important it was they not be negatively affected by the alternative minimum tax
so did everybody but four people on the floor of the house that voted yesterday
the substitute takes a step backward in how we treat our soldiers and how we treat our families small businesses that are affected by the alternative minimum tax compared to legislation that this house passed just yesterday we treated soldiers better by providing them immediate cash refunds on their tax treatment
this tax relief just stretches the family paycheck a little farther and prevents hundreds of millions of dollars of tax increases on families that would start right after this christmas holiday
they had great pieces of paper saying they were wonderful companies but the fact of the matter is they were built on thin air
what we did under this legislation is we said to the companies prove that you have a solid profitandloss statement you have real assets show us the money pay it out in dividends we will lower the cost lower the taxes on those dividends
it is very important we not go back to the bad old days of high stock prices but built on thin air
this bill will allow america s teachers to receive tax deductions on outofpocket classroom expenses
employers will be eligible for incentives for hiring lowincome americans transitioning from welfare to work getting on that first rung of the economic ladder and states and local governments will continue to be able to qualify for tax credit bonds to help repair schools purchase school equipment and train teachers in economically distressed areas
when i hear about distressed manufacturers in michigan one of the main issues they are competing on is to innovate and find the newest technology to remain competitive in a global economy
i urge my colleagues to support this legislation and vote yes on the bill
when i hear so many on the other side of the aisle talk about highincome earners i remind members that many small businesses in the united states file as individuals
so when they have this 40 billion tax increase that is really on small businesses and the families that those small businesses support
actually in a few minutes we will have a vote on two tax bills and we have heard a lot of debate this afternoon about the two approaches the bill takes and i certainly appreciate my friends on the other side for recognizing the need for tax relief
twentytwo provisions in our underlying bill were taken by my friends on the other side and put into their bill
are those the rich we hear talked about so much on the other side
are those the very rich our friends on the other side are so worried about us assisting
and 80 percent of those taxes that tax burden would fall on small entrepreneurial businesses
if i could quote the chairman of the federal reserve board back in june of this year he said i do think that there are parts of the existing recent tax changes especially with respect to eliminating part of the double taxation of dividends which i think enhances economic growth enhances the tax base and therefore tax revenues and that it is good economic policy the second point that i think is being made in favor of the substitute and opposing the underlying bill is saying that the extension of the reduction in tax rates on cap gains and dividends somehow is a tax cut for the rich
and in fact our own joint committee on taxation on the amt extension s impact compares the two the one that we acted on yesterday and the one today
the amt extension impacts 14 million taxpayers 62 million taxpayers benefit from reduced rates on cap gains and dividends
the rangel substitute is sensitive to the need for us to make sure that we are on the right glide path to create jobs in our economy
governments on every level from local to federal are running record deficits the number of uninsured americans is on the rise people continue to go without heat food or shelter as an abnormally cold winter persists and the cost of health care and education continue to rise
the republican tax cut bill is bad policy and i urge my colleagues to join me in voting no on hr 4297
if you assert something that is not true it is true on the floor of the house
let us just look at one of the elements of the not raising taxes today it would be let the tax cuts in dividends on stocks
in the morning that cut things like student financial aid medicaid health care to poor people dumping that burden on the states foster care longterm care the school lunch program
they are going to help the obesity problem on this side of the aisle by starving kids
so now the wealthy will be able to buy more yachts to float on the sea of red ink that the republicans have created
under this bill the few individuals making over 1 million per year are rewarded on the average with over 50 000 in tax breaks
the taxwriting body in this chamber has truly become the committee on greedy ways and shifty means and this will be remembered as the cutandrun congress cutting taxes greatly for the few while running trilliondollar deficits for the rest of us
people can stand up and malign the dividend cuts and the capital gains cuts but i actually believe we should have no tax on capital gains at all
mr speaker we know as we look at the arguments that were provided in 2001 2002 2003 that our wonderful colleagues on the other side of the aisle regularly said the following things number one if you put into place these tax cuts the economy is going to head straight into the tank
now obviously we are not going to see probably the best improvement in the deficit number next year because of hurricane katrina and other costs that we have faced and we are doing everything we can so many of us to try to rein in mandatory spending with the reconciliation process we have gone through and to try to do what we can on both discretionary as well as mandatory as i said
this tax cut falls on the heels of a deficit reduction plan passed before thanksgiving that cut children s health care child care assistance college aid child support and will actually increase the deficit by 20 billion
with all the problems facing middleclass americans soaring energy costs coupled on top of skyrocketing health care costs educational expenses and flat incomes 5 years in a row what is the solution offered by this republican congress
fiftythree percent of the benefits of this tax cut on dividends and capital gains goes to people earning 1 million or more and 62 percent of the benefits go to those earning 500 000 or more
this growth mr speaker is attributable in part to reduced rates on capital gains and dividends
in 2005 an estimated 103 million families in the 10 and 15 percent tax brackets will save on their taxes because of the existing tax policies
to let these rates expire would simply be a tax increase on the productive sector of the american economy
to turn back the clock on our tax policies that have benefited american workers and encourage more american workers to own a stake in their future is simply the wrong thing to do
mr speaker those who oppose this legislation are asking for a perverse tax increase on the seed corn of our economy and are suggesting that we impose a drag on economic growth at a time when we need it the most
three is basically a reflection of what our inflation rate is at four for the percentage of which our economy is growing on an annual basis and five for unemployment rate that exists in this country with historic lows
when you reduce the taxes and the penalties on the accumulation of capital what we see is an economy that grows
in addition if you happen to be receiving dividends and i know many people across the country in socalled investor class receive dividends on a regular basis if the democratic substitute prevails you will be paying upwards of 20 percent more in taxes to the federal government
mr speaker i would like to thank my friend and colleague on the rules committee for allowing me this opportunity to speak on behalf of this rule and the underlying bill hr 4297 the tax relief extension reconciliation act
now mr speaker the opponents of this tax relief will try to obscure and confuse this debate by mischaracterizing this house s previous vote on budget reform and reduction with claims of and i have already heard it robbing the poor to pay the rich
in fact today s reconciliation package includes extensions of tax incentives that provide work for many lowincome americans such as the welfare to work tax credit and the work opportunity tax credit that encourages businesses to hire and pay people and families on public assistance highrisk youths qualified veterans and people who receive food stamps
the opponents of this bill would raise taxes on middleincome americans rich americans poor americans investors savers entrepreneurs small business owners universities veterans and even people who are trying to clean up the environment
so mr speaker each and every member of this house has an opportunity today to go on record and tell the american people where they stand on raising taxes and whether they trust the american people with their own money
if you would listen to those on the other side of the aisle you would think that we are in a shrinking economy
preventing a tax increase on these entrepreneurs who one by one are creating new jobs in our economy
in a district like mine where we need new jobs and i know some members on the other side of the aisle apparently have more jobs than they need we need jobs
i urge my colleagues to continue this situation and not allow a tax increase on the american public
it does not include the most important provision which is the reduced rate on capital gains and dividends that has created all of these new jobs
on the lefthand side you see all the bars below the line
on the righthand side all the bars are above the line
well on the first half it is from january 2001 until we passed the capital gains and dividends tax reductions
just as brother rex and everyone in mississippi and on the gulf coast are facing challenges we need to work together to make sure the climate of economic opportunity exists for all
as my friend from mississippi knows the most philanthropic state in the union where people step up to help neighbors in need that example does not fall on deaf ears
and not only has there been some 69 billion in immediate hurricane relief given by this congress and this government to the storm victims but the promise of future help and economic prosperity as the people of the gulf coast get back on their feet
mr speaker i certainly thank the gentlewoman for yielding and certainly appreciate her leadership in this body on helping promote policies that promote economic growth in jobs and being a true leader in trying to help reform government programs that too often take away from family programs because they are wasteful they are duplicative they are inefficient there is no accountability
she is one of the true leaders in congress on these issues
and if we do not act this week we will have yet another huge democrat tax increase on the american people
unless we enact legislation this week there will be an automatic tax increase on the american people
they are going to go out and create a new transmission repair shop on one street corner or a new barbecue stand on another corner
and the democrats on this side of the aisle they want to take away the people s capital
and again it is very important that the american people know this week we do not have a bill on the floor to provide tax relief for the american people
we have a bill on the floor to prevent a democrat tax increase
there will be an automatic tax increase on the american people if we do not pass this legislation and one of the things that we will lose is the ability of small businesses to expense what we call depreciable assets up to 100 000
well due to competitive pressures prior to being able to benefit from our tax relief economic growth program they were on the verge of having to lay off two people
that is five people that could have been on unemployment and food stamps and welfare five people taking from the federal treasury because they had dire needs
the class warfare rhetoric of our friends on the other side of the aisle we know it is coming
it was a job i did not want to hold for later on
by trying to increase the taxes on capital gains and dividends you are attacking investors you are attacking job creators and you are taking away jobs from american families and that is wrong and that is another reason we must defeat this democrat tax increase tomorrow
that is money that is put away for education for their children and yet our democrat colleagues on the other side of the aisle want to tax away that dream
but yet this week the democrats want to increase taxes on hugh dublin and east texas right of way
now all of a sudden the democrats want to raise taxes on eddie alexander and triple s electric
and yet this week the democrats want to raise taxes on travers and company home builders
we have increases in productivity and the list goes on and on and on
the democrats want to raise taxes on hugh dublin and his small business
the democrats now want to raise taxes on eddie alexander and his small business
the democrats now want to raise taxes on gill travers and his small business
the democrats now want to raise taxes on hugh dublin and his small business
the democrats want to raise taxes on eddie alexander and his small business
but the democrats now want to raise taxes on gil travers and his small business
with the deficit projected to rise to 640 billion by 2015 this is no time to pile on even more
this is more debt we will force our children and grandchildren to pay interest on
i have supported tax cuts in the past and i have worked with members on both sides of the aisle to achieve them
with this package republicans knowingly and deliberately have removed the amt correction and thereby will increase the taxes on more than 17 million middleclass working families next year by failing to extend the higher exemptions for the alternative minimum tax amt that expire in several weeks
after the cafta vote when only 14 of our colleagues on the other side voted for increasing our opportunities for trade
this will be an interesting vote because we have with the democratic substitute a tax increase of 40 billion on businesses
just last month the republicans passed a bill called the deficit reduction act this was a spending cut bill that slashed funding to many vital programs my constituents depend on including to medicaid student loans food stamps and child support programs
the republicans lectured us on the need to make sacrifices to control the national debt
by passing the spending cut bill the republicans actually asked the poor the downtrodden the disabled and the young to sacrifice on behalf of the rest of the country
the republicans are launching an unabashed attack on the american way by ignoring the neediest in our country to give tax cuts to the richest
mr speaker the decision to vote up or down on this legislation is nt a blurry line involving political ideology it is nt a debate of republican vs
i am strongly opposed to this legislation and i implore my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to vote against these unreasonable cuts and instead consider the revenue neutral democratic alternative
just last month the republicans passed a bill called the deficit reduction act this was a spending cut bill that slashed funding to many vital programs my constituents depend on including to medicaid student loans food stamps and child support programs
the republicans lectured us on the need to make sacrifices to control the national debt
by passing the spending cut bill the republicans actually asked the poor the downtrodden the disabled and the young to sacrifice on behalf of the rest of the country
they also choose to pass the burden of paying for these tax cuts on to our children in the form of a huge deficit
the republicans are launching an unabashed attack on the american way by ignoring the neediest in our country to give tax cuts to the richest
mr speaker the decision to vote up or down on this legislation is nt a blurry line involving political ideology it is nt a debate of republican vs
i am strongly opposed to this legislation and i implore my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to vote against these unreasonable cuts and instead consider the revenue neutral democratic alternative
the bill will prevent automatic tax increases on millions of americans and their families
unless congress acts individuals will pay higher taxes on their savings businesses will lose valuable incentives to provide research in the united states small businesses will lose the ability to expense new equipment essential to the support of new employees
right now they pay 5 percent taxes on dividend incomes
in 2008 lowincome taxpayers will pay zero taxes on dividend income
a widow living on 30 000 a year could see her tax bill increase by 1 200 a year
this act will build on our legacy of tax relief that is fueling our economy and will extend some very important tax provisions that will keep america s economy moving forward
finally we must extend the tax rate reduction on capital gains and dividends
mr speaker i would like to compliment my chairman mr charles rangel for his leadership on this issue
i am glad to be on the ways and means committee and glad to have the opportunity to talk about some of these taxing issues
it just amazes me that the majority can stand here and have the gall to tell veterans that they are going to treat them better to tell the people of america that they are better at solving problems than the government and so we are going to give them two cents back to pay for a 100 bill to have the gall to say that we are not going to create bigger government and then they created the biggest institution ever the homeland security department and that has not taken care of poor people across this country particularly the victims of katrina and rita as it goes on
and for them to have the gall to say that a janitor sitting on a stool is going to save some money or get some money on capital gains give me a break
you know it is not the janitor sitting on the stool you know it is the man who owns the janitorial company
this bill would raise taxes on 17 million american middleclass families by as much as 640
people who bet on the market are going to see their taxes cut or reduced while workers are not going to see that kind of relief because this bill is about a transfer of wealth upwards a transfer of wealth from the poor and the middle class to the wealthy
it is a moral question and the arc of our moral fiber here is going to be determined on whether or not we can stand up to this challenge about accelerating the wealth upwards
while republicans claim that the dividend tax cut boosts the economy the facts are not on their side
to quote the report we fail to find much if any imprint of the dividend tax cut news on the value of the aggregate stock market there you have it the nation s top economists have determined that dividend tax reduction does not boost the stock market or increase wealth for shareholders
the rangel substitute will revive the economy relieve the tax burden on working families encourage companies to invest in the future and create jobs
the rangel substitute is a commonsense alternative that prevents a tax increase on working families honors our troops and does not cost a dime
unlike the reckless tax bill on the floor the democratic alternative would help more americans help themselves and ensure that as a country we move forward together
we have 45 billion in extenders on which there is basic agreement
well last month the republicans lectured us on the need to have fiscal discipline
the amount of money that they were cutting on food stamps and medicaid and health care services and student loans is exactly equal to the amount of money they are giving in tax breaks to millionaires
the priest goes up into the pulpit on sunday and he says on wednesday father obrien will lecture on the evils of gambling in the church hall
on thursday in the church hall bingo
last month the republicans lectured us on the need for them to cut poor people to do something about the deficit
vote no on this republican atrocity in our country at a time when the poor need it the most and the rich need it the least
my friends on the other side of the aisle continually stand up for low income families and to their credit why on earth would they leave out a strong incentive for low income families to save
generally those on the other side of the aisle harp about the i will not say evils but the excess profits some of the bad things that big business does in this country and yet they leave out the tax benefit for small businesses in this country something known as section 179 expensing to help small businesspeople cope with the costs of keeping their businesses up to date modernizing their businesses so that they can compete so they can compete in the market place sometimes with those big bad businesses
what that means is this particular tax provisional allows companies in this country who conduct financial operations to compete on a level playing field with their competitors overseas
the joint tax committee the committee that is vested with crunching the numbers in this congress has produced these statistics for the capital gains tax one in five americans who claims capital gains on his tax return has income below 50 000
fiftyeight percent of those who claim capital gains on their tax return have incomes below 100 000
unfortunately the house is beyond embarrassment now i used this before but i wanted to bring it out here again because i think we need to demonstrate to people what is going on
we are going to load it on them
that is the lowerclass people who are trying to get through on loans
you can confuse the people but you can not confuse anybody who knows what is going on in here
the failure to index that tax has allowed it to creep down to people making 75 000 or 100 000 and suddenly instead of being a few people at the top it is now 14 or 20 million depending on how you want to figure
on their time this has happened
i would like to think as the gentleman from new york has indicated that i have had some consistency on the issue of alternative minimum tax not only in the committee but here on the house floor
in almost 14 years now on the ways and means committee we have spoken of addressing the alternative minimum tax issue
you can in a few minutes cast a vote on really doing something about alternative minimum tax
on january 1 that number kicks up next year to 19 million people who will begin to pay alternative minimum tax
now this congress had time in the last 5 years to repeal a series of taxes on the american people all by the way for upper income groups
give him a positive vote on amt
mr speaker i thank the distinguished gentleman from new york our ranking member on the ways and means committee for yielding me the time
i thank you and our colleagues on the committee on the democratic side for the excellent work you did in putting forth the democratic alternative today
a few weeks ago right before thanksgiving there was a bill on the floor which was the republican budget bill
it does not have the protection of the parliamentary process on the senate side and the same applies to what they did to try to give the illusion that they were helping our men and women in combat so that they would qualify for the lowincome tax credit
taking these two bills together we are giving tax cuts to the wealthiest people in america while we are putting a burden on our young people by saying that they will pay 5 800 more in their student loans so that we can give tax cuts to people making over 1 million a year
we are not putting adequate resources to cops on the beat or anything else in order for us to give these tax cuts at the high end
they are putting the burden of debt on america s children individual debt with their student loans and fiscal debt in terms of our national debt and what our kids will be burdened with
coming out of that administration we were on a trajectory of 56 trillion with a tr dollars in surplus
in the years of the bush administration that has been almost fully reversed over 4 trillion in deficit a swing of around 10 trillion an incredible burden on the future a tax on our children s future
it is just absolutely immoral immoral for us to heap those deficits on our children
i want to commend my colleagues on the democratic side for what they have done and put into their proposal
our democratic members on the committee have eloquently made an indictment against this budget which is immoral because of the 70 billion in tax cuts mostly for america s wealthiest
well this majority gives every child 27 000 of debt debt that will fall on their shoulders when the baby boomers retire with this debt woefully unpaid
they will come out on average 7 7 per under this dividend and tax cut provision
so in this christmas season we are hammering on programs that help those who need help
i urge a no vote on this rule
the preceding speaker on the republican side said we have got to pass this we have got to continue the progrowth policies
alan greenspan has got some words of caution on this
mr speaker by direction of the committee on rules i call up house resolution 588 and ask for its immediate consideration
this is a result of allowing workers to keep more of their hardearned money decreasing the tax burden on small businesses so they can expand and hire more workers and providing incentives for families to save and invest
mr speaker hr 4297 the tax relief extension reconciliation act not the most eloquent of names but an important one will continue to build on the economic progress we have already made
while we were unable as a body to settle on a social security reform plan surely we can all agree that encouraging lowincome families to save for retirement and giving them the tools to do so is a sound economic policy
our bill freezes the rate on capital gains and dividends and prevents an increase of the tax burden on 24 million families
it is imperative that we extend this tax relief so our economy will continue on its upward track
this hurts lowincome families who are struggling to save for retirement people who are doing the right things to prepare for their future rather than solely depending on the government to do it for them
the democratic substitute does not extend enhanced small business depreciation expensing so it increases taxes on small businesses the very engines of innovation and growth and employment in this country
the democratic substitute does not include an extension of the reduced rates on capital gains and dividends
the democratic substitute does include a tax increase on families and small businesses to pay for the bill
they buoyed the economy through major terrorist attacks devastating natural disasters and a global war on terrorism
now is not the time to increase taxes on the american people
failure to pass this bill would result in higher taxes on seniors savers small businesses and farmers
does raising taxes on the american people help lower the unemployment rate
perhaps some on the other side of the aisle would disagree
they want to pick and choose the winners in american society and we want everyone everyone on equal footing to have the opportunity to achieve their piece of the american dream
everybody has got a shot at paying less in taxes on capital gains
everybody has got a shot at paying less in taxes on dividends that are paid by companies that support all americans
the democratic substitute does not include the savers credit for low income families those low income families who are contributing to iras and pension plans scrimping and saving every day every week every month to put aside money to prepare for their own retirement to lt center gt lt pre gt page h11233 lt pre gt lt center gt why are they silent on the point of assistance for small businesses allowing them to increase section 179 expensing so that they can get that new piece of equipment add the new line which means more employees more growth more purchasing and a better economic ripple effect in the community
it is certainly something that we are proud of our record on with teddy roosevelt and our conservation effort
the democratic substitute is silent on these points
we dealt with it on a vote of 4144 overwhelming bipartisan on the suspension calendar which i will remind members under the rule requires a twothirds vote to pass
the amt relief bill moved through here in an expeditious manner on a bipartisan basis
it is vitally important that we pass this and not allow taxes to go up 3 weeks from now on those 10 states not allow teachers to lose their deductibility on classroom supplies not allow lowincome seniors and savers to be punished under the democratic plan
mr speaker i yield back the balance of my time and i move the previous question on the resolution
a motion to reconsider was laid on the table
i just want to set the record straight and that is that we all agree that the alternative minimum tax is an unfair tax on people because it was not planned by the ways and means committee and by the congress
now we all know that the bill that we passed yesterday on the suspension calendar is not protected like this 56 billion is protected today
it is true that you have decided that those people who want relief on capital gains taxes and corporate dividends even though they do not get hit until 2009 that you are prepared to have the people who get by the amt this year or next year rather in their tax burden to get hit at the expense of those people that are much richer and much smaller in number
now i am here on the floor to try to get people to understand that this tax cut for the rich is really to grow the economy and i want to make it clear to those people who have lost their jobs and not counted among the unemployed those that are looking at automobile plants closing and airlines going bankrupt that basically the economy is good and it is good because the president told us so
it is true that as the deficit increases more than history ever expected under this administration that soon 40 percent of the tax revenues that we get will be going just to pay the interest on this outstanding debt and that is why our republican friends believe that we just can not expand the deficit that we have to cut spending
it means it is protected when it gets over to the other side so we did not have to depend on 100 senators sitting down and not objecting
the house republicans passed both of them one on the suspension calendar that is not protected here but is protected in the other body and this bill which provides for relief for the taxes for corporate dividends and capital gains which is protected in our bill but is not in their bill
mr speaker i would like to ask the gentleman just one question on my time
so i need some help on this
mr speaker i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from massachusetts mr neal xz4002910 to answer some of these important questions a distinguished and acknowledged expert in this on the ways and means committee
many things we tried and include and did suggest in the brief time we had to work on this bill
yes we voted on the suspension calendar to provide relief for these people not as much as we do in our substitute but people have to understand the suspension calendar in the house is not protected under the other body s rules
why would they not include right in this bill that would be protected on the other side i do not know their political reasons
nor do we hit the poor who are sick or the kids that want to go to school or the foster kids or those kids that are dependent on money from their fathers who have abandoned their mothers
mr speaker i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from michigan mr levin xz4002380 a distinguished member of the committee on ways and means
so in order to have a more wellbalanced bill we concentrated on the middle class by putting the alternative minimum tax into this bill to make certain that when it gets to the body it is protected and we do not have to depend on just one of those people over there rejecting it for this higher tax cut which of course does not adversely affect anybody as the majority leader said until 2009
mr speaker it is my distinct honor to yield the remaining time to the gentlewoman from california ms pelosi xz4003140 to close on our side who represents the minority at this historic time
mr speaker on that i demand the yeas and nays
now they will scream out that they took care of it on the suspension bill
well you do not have to be a parliamentarian to know when you send something to that other side and put it on the suspension calendar you had better send a prayer over with it because any one guy can stand up and say i object
but we will know at the end of this vote something that john lewis knows that they said in the civil rights movement and that is which side are you on
but on this vote at the end of the day people might ask how did you treat the alternative minimum tax
we put it on the suspension calendar because it was not paid for and we did not think it would be controversial
mr speaker on that i demand the yeas and nays
mr speaker the ways and means bill before us today addresses a number of important priorities that are broadly supported by members on both sides of the aisle
mr speaker as a lead sponsor of the stealth tax relief act of 2005 the legislation designed to prevent massive increases in the alternative minimum tax or amt from sneaking up on millions of unsuspecting taxpayers next year i want to take just a moment to comment on the democrat substitute
to pay for it the democratic substitute increases taxes on families and on small businesses that create so many jobs in our community
but today just 24 hours later our friends on the other side of the aisle are back singing a familiar taxraising tune one that always leaves families with less money in their wallets on april 15 and small businesses with less money on their balance sheets
mr speaker earlier in this debate a colleague on the other side of the aisle claimed that the republican majority has done little to fight the amt since winning the house in 1994
i would further remind my friends on the other side of the aisle that in 1999 the republican congress sent a bill to the president s desk that would have repealed the amt entirely
finally i would remind members that in 1993 as an era of the democratic control was coming to an end one of the last things that our friends on the other side of the aisle did was to provide a retroactive increase for the amt without indexing the exemption levels
as a grandmother myself i believe it is morally reprehensible to leave my grandchildren to bear the burden of debtrelief because we spent our money on more tax cuts for the wealthy today
i also appreciate the fact that the gentleman from washington is willing to acknowledge christmas here on the house floor
it depends on the tax cut you are talking about
why is it important that we continue the tax relief progress that would expire in 2008 on dividends and capital gains
i have been listening to the debate here on the floor
i would like to point out who is going to benefit from the reduced rate on dividends
very briefly since the tax rate on capital gains and dividends was reduced in may of 2003 the economy has grown at an average rate of 41 percent 44 million new jobs have been created government tax receipts have increased 10 percent annually
what effect is this going to have on the economy to all of the sudden have that increase that we are looking at
we want them to be able to have a tax rate that people can count on one that people can look into the future as far as they could
does the republican party really think the american people do not see what is going on here
my friends on the other side of the aisle talk about the agenda of reform but they have controlled the congress for over 10 years and now they are the status quo
i would like to urge a no vote on the rule a no vote on the bill and say to every member of the house of representatives if they want the amt fix protected the only way in the world they can do it today is to vote for the democrat substitute
mr speaker over the last few days we have seen a flurry of tax cuts on the house floor three yesterday another one a big one today
so the net effect on the deficit is 301 billion in all political reality
so every member here who is in earnest about the deficit should be on notice
we stand at a crossroads today that cbo has depicted as follows on this particular chart
on the other hand you can take the path that this bill would take and you will be 640 billion in deficit in 10 years
under the tax break package presented today a family of four surviving on 30 000 a year will get an average of 50 extra in their tax return next april
people making over 1 million get a tax break of 4 250 a month that they could use to purchase one of the following leases on four bmw 750i sedans 17 ipod nano s a 50 inch flat screen plasma tv a five karat diamond tennis bracelet or a 10day european cruise
these tax breaks combined with last month s cuts on programs for those in need will rack up 44 billion in new debt
i urge all my colleagues to stop this insane fiscal policy by voting no on this bill
mr speaker on that i demand the yeas and nays
mr speaker i think the american people just want to hear us try to get along and give them the level be on the level with them give them straight talk
this is available on wwwpublicdebttreasgov
that data is available on the treasury department s web site
interest on the public debt grew more now what does that mean
this is hard to imagine but so far in this fiscal year we have borrowed 130 billion and spent 39 billion on interest in just the first 2 months of this fiscal year
we are on an unsustainable financial glide path and every reputable economist will tell you that
we do not have a balanced budget amendment that has ever been voted on
they are waiting on a fema trailer
it is going to cost about 5 billion to help those folks hang on to their homes and hang on to their mortgage and in 102 days we have not had a hearing or a vote on it
but if you are a member of the political contributor class the guys who write the big checks to the rnc guys who write a big check to a congressman here senator there we have got a vote on your tax cut that does not even expire for 3 years
by the way the guy on coleman avenue whose house washed away he does not write big checks
there are 12 000 mississippians waiting on a fema trailer
yesterday 414 members of the house voted to assist a group who on average are far richer than those who receive dividends and cap gains
all four of them were on the democratic side of the aisle
but out of the 188 democrats who voted aye i just have to point out that my friend who just finished speaking who is on the ways and means committee protesting the amount in this vote voted aye
some of the other folks just let me run down the list alphabetically which tends to touch on lowey lynch maloney markey you heard him lt b gt marshall matheson matsui mccarthy so as we listen to the rhetoric and the term millionaire is repeated over and over again by my friends on the other side of the aisle it begins to be a question of whose millionaire are they talking about
the truth is 188 democrats every democrat member of the ways and means committee voted to assist people yesterday that are far richer on average than the individuals who receive dividends and cap gains
mr speaker pursuant to house resolution 588 i call up the bill hr 4297 to provide for reconciliation pursuant to section 201 b of the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2006 and ask for its immediate consideration
mr speaker this is a bill that does not deserve the kind of rhetoric that is being delivered so far at least that which i have heard on the rule
i can not believe my colleagues on the other side of the line are opposed to that
but they are required to attack any bill that allows americans to hang on to their own hardearned money
my concern is if they are going to produce the kind of rhetoric they are producing on a piece of tax legislation which simply extends current law what are they going to do when we have to rethink the way in which we tax people today to make sure that we do not destroy the economic engine in this country that produces the quality of lifestyle for each and every american
they have already voted on it
the real problem with my friends on the other side of the aisle is that if reality does not coincide with their rhetoric they choose rhetoric rather than reality
if the gentleman from massachusetts mr neal xz4002910 voted yes on this alternative minimum tax bill yesterday he either was protecting the very rich in massachusetts
in 1993 they passed the largest tax increase on the american people and had a chance to adjust it again then
and on page 2 of the motion to recommit for purposes of this paragraph the term threshold amount means 100 000 and 200 000 in the case of a joint return so 200 000 is now middle income
this vote if you vote yes gives money to rich people to spend on consumption
this legislation extends tax cuts that are not even close to expiring cuts that are on the books for another 3 years
mr speaker as we debate this bill we must remember it is only part of a brew based on the republican leadership s budget recipe
unfortunately the republican leadership was not willing to follow that more reasonable approach and is insisting on sticking with their own recipe
so while i can not support this bill i am hopeful that the conferees will insist on a new and better mixture that will deserve support
in act i we learned who the majority felt most deserved to bear the brunt of their spending cuts poor citizens who rely on medicaid hungry people who turn to food stamps and families trying to afford college
additionally when faced with the choice of whether to use the reconciliation process to protect amt relief for middleclass taxpayers or tax breaks for the wealthiest investors the republicans chose to leave amt relief unprotected while extending tax breaks on capital gains and dividends that do nt even expire until 2008 tax breaks over half of whose benefits flow to those who made over 1 million last year
mr speaker i thank the gentleman for yielding me this time and for his leadership on this issue as well as many others
well if you think of your own communities and the south suburbs of chicago and rural areas that i represent we can always think of that gas station on a corner that has been closed for 20 years and which sat abandoned with no one buying it
mr speaker i appreciate the gentlewoman s pointing out the increase in tax revenue and the gentleman from texas pointing that out because it is lost on some folks
it was not lost on president kennedy by the way nor was it lost on president reagan who understood clearly that if you decrease tax rates for individuals and corporations what happens is that the economy becomes vibrant
and as has been so clearly stated if we allow if congress allows the democrat tax increase that they are planning on this week if we allow that to occur then what we will see is a decrease in revenue and a decrease in the vibrancy of the economy
as i heard the gentlewoman say if an individual in this chamber votes no on hr 4297 that means that they want to see the american people not be able to deduct sales tax state and local sales tax
as i understand it a no vote on hr 4297 means you do not want to allow for those deductions you want to increase taxes on teachers if you vote against this bill
mr speaker there are a couple of other items that are included and one that i want to highlight is the 2year extension on the reduced tax rates on capital gains and dividends
it is so incredibly important for americans to understand and appreciation that if a member of congress votes no on this provision it means that they do not want to extend that tax rate decrease on capital gains and dividends which is so incredibly important and vital for small businesses as the gentleman from texas talked about so eloquently
they are paid for by throwing 300 000 people off food stamps when hunger in this country is on the rise
the amt fix is set to expire at the end of the year and without an extension taxes will increase on the 17 million middle class families who will be snared by the amt
a fairer bill would have reduced taxes on the paychecks of the middle class working families who most need and deserve it
maybe this fiscal approach explains why the chairman of the president s own commission on tax reform said recently that he was not worried by tax policies that increase the national debt because we can always borrow some more from china
but there is a proper time for everything and at this juncture when we are running record budget deficits when we are funding our troops in iraq and when we are incurring huge costs to recover from hurricane katrina at this juncture we can not cut taxes to the rich and increase the burden on the middle class
our colleagues on the other side of the aisle seem to think that by saying things that are not true they can make them true
this has had a tremendously positive impact on our local economy
shame on the democratic national committee for insulting north carolina s thousands of highly skilled manufacturing workers who are driving our national economy
look for the democrats to continue their tired political attacks on the republicans effective economic policies but do not hold your breath for them to come up with good ideas
mr speaker as we begin debate on additional tax cuts hr 4297 we must consider them in the larger context of the challenges this nation is facing and the impact these tax cuts will have on our ability to face these challenges as well as future challenges
during my visit i read to these children who are about my granddaughter anna s age about clifford the big red dog it is truly a wonderful program and as i recall the joy and animation on each child s face with every turn of the page i am reminded just how important the decisions we make today are
are we being wise stewards in choosing to pass another tax cut on top of the nearly 2 trillion in cuts we have already passed
regardless of your view on our nation s military policy over the past five years we must pay for the wars and their subsequent cleanup yet to date they have been financed by deficit spending
ranking member rangel has offered a pragmatic and effective substitute bill and i am glad today s rule will allow a vote on it
president clinton had the first white house conference on the oceans out in california in 1997
they are on it a year with members and other staff
now we created a commission after 911 and after the recommendations came back yes there was debate on it but in the same year we adopted it and we took the recommendations
if we want to have some leadership on this can you give us a date when the oceans21 bill will be heard in your committee
can we have a hearing on it
the oceans blueprint for the 21st century is the report that we spent 10 million on
i will speak now for a few minutes explaining the legislation and i would hope mr speaker that we can have a bipartisan vote to move this task force along so that the myriad of issues that cover a broad range of committee assignments both on the house and the senate side and a broad array of federal departments and agencies can be viewed with a single entity this task force between now and june to understand the comprehensive magnificent work of the people under admiral watkins that put together this commission report
the members on the commission are people who have represented and continue to represent the oceans aquariums around the country the port authorities coastal studies offshore oil drilling the us navy shipping and marine transportation ocean ecology and fisheries environmental interests and the banking industry a broad array of individuals that were appointed by the president the house and the senate
the list goes on and on and on
seven of the 31 chapters come under the jurisdiction of the fisheries and oceans subcommittee on resources
we have held hearings on our part of the ocean commission report
those are the congress should establish for better leadership and coordination a national ocean council and a nonfederal ocean council of advisors to view the full range of issues in the departments the agencies and the executive branch and what goes on in the states and the tribes and the international arena regarding oceans
we have dealt in that ocean subcommittee with our jurisdiction regarding the ocean commission report which is marine debris fisheries management marine mammals coral reefs agriculture ocean observing system coastal habitats and so on
i would just like to respond to my colleague on the other side of the aisle
my colleagues on the other side of the aisle know full well that we have been working on this
we have had numerous numerous conversations since last may on this particular task force
admiral watkins who worked on the oceans commission s report is in favor of this task force
as a matter of fact both of those men leon panetta and admiral watkins are urging my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to vote in favor of this
now as far as my subcommittee that mr pallone xz4003080 serves on dealing with these issues this is a commission report that did cost a few million dollars and it is worthy of our close scrutiny not having staff make up a bill that we do not know the substance of that bill
we are working on the marine mammal recommendations marine debris recommendations coral reef recommendations magnuson act recommendations
we have held hearings on those issues
too often however we take these gifts for granted underestimating their value and ignoring our impact on them
this is an issue that we can get together on have a bipartisan working relationship and put aside our partisan bickering because the oceans are priceless
the subcommittee is moving legislation with the recommendations from the ocean commission report and the pew commission report on oceans
mr speaker i move to suspend the rules and agree to the resolution h res 599 establishing the task force on ocean policy
mr speaker i ask unanimous consent that all members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks on this legislation and include extraneous material thereon
mr speaker house resolution 599 will establish a house task force on ocean policy with the express purpose of developing recommendations and reporting to the house on the findings of the united states commission on ocean policy by june 2006
this bipartisan task force will have members appointed by the speaker and minority leader who will focus on the final report of the united states commission on ocean policy entitled an ocean blueprint for the 21st century while the task force will have no legislative jurisdiction it will put in place a mechanism to allow the house to look broadly at the question of caring for our oceans
we are able to bring this resolution forward today because of his good work and interest on this subject
the fact of the matter is we have the blueprint for what needs to be done on the oceans
when we did the energy bill the speaker told us that the energy bill would be on the floor by a certain date
we saw the bill on monday
we talked about it on wednesday voted on it on friday
it was on the floor the following week
not a great process but they obviously wanted to do something to have an energy bill on the floor
the republican leadership quickly ignored the report saying they wanted to wait for the results of the congressionally appointed us commission on ocean policy
well over a year has gone by and still the house republican leadership has sat on its hands and done virtually nothing for our oceans
at the end of 2004 the fisheries and oceans subcommittee on which i am the ranking member held exactly one hearing on the us ocean commission s recommendation
what we have done instead is to hold a random assortment of hearings on a few areas that are mentioned in the commission s report but without getting into any of the commission s recommendations
its task will literally be to write a report on a report that itself is already quite prescriptive in its instructions to congress
i would point out that the resolution says we are going to spend 400 000 that is on top of the 10 million that the us oceans commission has already spent
well why are we wasting another 400 000 in taxpayers money on a task force that does not even have any legislative responsibility
he is my chairman and i respect him greatly but he goes on to say that there are so many committees that have jurisdiction over this that we do nt have the time to deal with it
the truth is the real obstructionists are the republican leaders and the republicans on the resources committee not all but most who have refused to allow a comprehensive consideration of major ocean issues this entire year
i want to say that my democratic colleagues have specific recommendations that they have put in legislative form and some of them are here on the floor
and i would point out over and over again i am getting very frustrated and it may be obvious with the fact that there is no action on the republican side
they expect us to be working on problems facing our oceans
mr speaker as one point of clarification regarding the claim made by the gentleman our chairman that no select committee was formed to consider the stratton commission recommendations i believe that the gentleman from maryland was in fact wrong on that
mr speaker again i think it is very important that we vote no on this resolution
if you read section 3 jurisdiction under the resolution it specifically says the task force may develop recommendations and report to the house on the final report of the us commission on ocean policy making recommendations for a national oceans policy entitled an ocean blueprint for the 21st century
so again it says in the resolution this is nothing but a report on another report which is already 500 pages and 10 million of taxpayers money has been spent on it
why should we spend another 400 000 to come up with another report on the report with no legislative action
he asked the gentleman from maryland when is there going to be a hearing on that
because this republican congress does not want to take any action on the ocean commission s recommendations
the only way that we are going to see action on the ocean commission s recommendations the only way that we are going to see anything happen here is if we eliminate this task force and we demand and build pressure on the republican leadership to report out legislation that has already been introduced that would enact the us ocean commission s report
that is the main reason i believe why we must vote no on this legislation
mr speaker on that i demand the yeas and nays
as the ranking democratic member on the committee on resources i staunchly support efforts to restore our ocean and coastal environment
last september the us commission on ocean policy sent up to the congress a comprehensive report that included over twohundred specific recommendations to guide the development of a new national ocean policy for the 21st century
but instead of debating these substantive proposals the majority leadership trots out a resolution to create a toothless task force on ocean policy which will only waste precious time
sadly our oceans could be on life support before this republicanled congress acts to implement the commission s recommendations
but as highlighted in the more than 200 recommendations contained in the us commission on ocean policy report released last year much remains to be done
as a chief sponsor in the house of the legislation to establish the us commission on ocean policy i feel it is important to follow through and ensure the recommendations are effectively implemented
we need to build on the momentum generated last year by the release of both the us and the pew ocean policy commission reports and accomplish a true sea change in the way we utilize and manage our ocean resources
the first us commission on ocean policy was an important one but 10 years is just too long to wait
we need to capitalize on the enthusiasm and momentum generated by the commission reports and their recommendations
i urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this house ocean task force resolution so that we will better be able to deal with ocean issues
mr speaker i would just like to point out to my friends on the other side of the aisle that mr gilchrest xz4001490 has spent a great deal of time in working with leadership on this issue recognizing that there is a process problem here in that the oceans21 bill that we all want to see passed is in the jurisdiction of quite some number of committees
the other side of the aisle talks a good game on protecting our oceans but they control the resources committee
at any time they can use the house resources committee to bring up legislation to protect the oceans but they have yet to have hearings or move legislation on marine protected areas regional governance or coastal management
i have introduced hr 1712 to protect the coast of sonoma county california as part of the national marine sanctuary program but there have been no hearings on this bill or any other bill to protect our oceans
legislation just seems to come out of the woodwork sometimes like the resolution on the suspension calendar today
the bill before us today would spend 400 000 of taxpayer money to establish a house task force on ocean policy
this resolution just appeared on the schedule at the last minute with no explanation no details and no reason for its urgency
in fact there is a subcommittee on fisheries and oceans chaired by the gentleman from maryland mr gilchrest xz4001490
i hope that the resolution s sponsors and other members speaking here today will shed some light on the need to move so quickly on this measure
mr speaker i am going to vote to send this bill along to the conference and vote yes for two reasons first i think the bill very wisely includes relief for multiemployer plans an issue that many of us have worked on for a very long period of time
i think unfortunately they should have been worked out on this house floor with a proper rule but with those reservations i will vote to send the bill along to conference
next a slanted bankruptcy bill that puts no burden of responsibility on unscrupulous lenders and credit card companies and all of it on the families that face hardships from large medical bills family breakups and job losses
the latest attack on the security of american families is this pension bill
this bill falls short on both accounts
and i think all of us on both sides of the aisle have a responsibility to work hard to develop legislation that will in fact protect american workers and retirees in the pensions that they have been promised
we have worked with members on both sides of the aisle in order to develop this legislation
it will in fact ensure that there is more money contributed to these pension plans whether it is restricting the use of credit balances whether it is using a more accurate interest rate to determine what those obligations are whether it is closing down the amount of averaging that goes on
and i would urge my colleagues on behalf of american workers that we have a responsibility to pass this bill now
madam speaker i ask unanimous consent that all members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks on hr 2830
on june 4 2003 the committee on education and the workforce held the first of nearly a dozen hearings on traditional pension plans and from these hearings they have covered a broad set of issues ranging from what is broken to who it has impacted to how we should go about fixing it
and today we stand ready to debate and vote on the product of those 30 months of deliberations
while some are calling for suffocating pension funding rules which would place an incredible burden on employers who voluntarily offer retirement benefits our bill makes certain not to tighten the rules so much that employers leave the defined benefit system altogether
while others call for relaxation of pension rules our bill ensures that employers and unions keep their promises to workers and retirees who are counting on their pension benefits
as you can see on the chart that is next to me the measure would ensure that pensions are fully funded to restore worker and retiree confidence it has enhanced disclosure requirements so that workers and retirees are no longer kept in the dark about the health of their pensions it would improve the financial condition of the federal agency charged with ensuring some 30 000 private pension plans it would reform outdated laws that deny workers access to professional and secure investment advice while providing even more workers with 401 k type plans and it would end sweetheart deals like those we have seen at some airlines and other corporations that have terminated their plans in which executives enjoy a windfall of cash while workers and retirees are left wondering about their futures
as you can see on this second chart the pension benefit guaranty corporation which ensures nearly 30 000 private worker pensions is in dire financial condition
with some 450 billion in pension plan underfunding among financially weak companies looming on the horizon the pbgc s debt could balloon even further than its current 23 billion
that is why the pension protection act includes responsible increases to employerpaid premiums for the first time since 1991 along with substantial reforms to place the defined benefit system on more solid ground
madam speaker throughout this process i have made every effort to include my colleagues on both sides of the aisle
however some of my colleagues have offered nothing more than rhetoric based on quirky accounting schemes and purposely skewed modeling in an effort to characterize the pension protection act in a negative manner
madam speaker the pension protection act would not be before us if it were not for the work of my friend the chairman of the ways and means committee mr thomas the employeremployee relations subcommittee chair and vice chair mr johnson xz4002061 and mr kline my friend from ohio mr tiberi a committee colleague who worked tirelessly to garner support for the bill and all of the others on my committee and throughout the house who understand how imperative it is to reform our nation s outdated pension laws for the benefit of workers retirees and taxpayers alike
there are no winners when airlines default on their pension plans
madam speaker reclaiming my time let me thank my colleague from georgia for his work on this issue for lo these many months
madam speaker reclaiming my time as has been the case all year the lines of communication between those of us that are interested in this both on and off the committee and those on the other side of the aisle as well the lines of communication are open and will remain open
as we move into conference the process i remain committed to ensuring that the concerns of all stakeholders involved are addressed in a bipartisan fashion as we complete action on comprehensive reforms in an expeditious manner
my colleague from ohio correctly notes that we still have work to do on this issue of shutdown benefits specifically as it relates to the steel industry and as such i pledge to him and other members who may have an interest in this as well that on this issue we will continue to work on this matter throughout this legislative process
as i listen to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle i have to tell you that i am confused
some of them say the rules that we are proposing here are too tough and are going to drive employers out of the pension business while we have some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle saying the rules are not tight enough and we are going to create more deficits at the pension benefit guaranty corporation
now if the rules were not strong enough i would not have had virtually every employer in america who has a defined benefit plan beating on my office door complaining about the rules we were proposing
under this modified yield curve proposal they will have three different interest rates to use based on the longevity of their workforce 05 years 520 and those employees who will retire after 20 years
all of these will bring more funding to company pension plans it will bring more funding to the pension benefit guaranty corporation and put our pension system for american workers on a stronger foundation
those plans by and large are healthier than singleemployer plans and we have labor and management on both sides in the multiemployer sector come together to put rules in place so that their plans can never get into a very weakly funded position
why would all of the labor organizations and the business organizations all be on board in support of this bill
my colleague from ohio talked about the need to go further on cash balance language
we need to provide legal certainty for those who have converted to a cash balance plan so that we do not put in jeopardy the 7 million americans counting on benefits from those plans
mr speaker the debate today on the floor is about the massive underfunding in worker pensions and the need to change the status quo
third they are preserving the status quo on unrestricted use of credit balances which mask the massive pension plan underfunding we see today
last they preserve the status quo by promoting uncertainty among employers if these pension benefits and workers who are relying on them maintain the current interest rate package for 2 years and then go back to the 30year rate thereafter
i applaud the chairman of the ways and means committee the distinguished bill thomas as well as the chairman of the education and workforce committee john boehner for their hard work and leadership on this issue
people who put their lives on the iine for us everyday deserve our full support and they are receiving that support here today thanks to chairman thomas
they will vest in their regular pension plans and even if they participate in one of the new deferred plans and remain on the job longer will be eligible for retirement before they reach age 55
furthermore an increasing number of companies are using the bankruptcy system to dump massively underfunded pension plans on the pbgc
mr speaker i yield myself 30 seconds just to say that we had several hearings on this pension bill in the ways and mean committee including the select revenue subcommittee which i chair
mr speaker reclaiming my time i would just say to the gentleman as chairman of the select revenue measures subcommittee of ways and means i look forward to working with him on this and other issues as this legislation moves through the process and to conference
the bill requires trustees to adopt rehabilitation plans for critically funded pensions and protects employers from defaulting on their promises
the bill would give retirees and employees better information on the financial condition of their plan
the motion to recommit also has a 53 billion surtax contained in it on small business
so i would urge a no vote on the motion to recommit a yes vote on the underlying bill which would ensure that pension plans would be appropriately funded but not so strict as to cause employers to terminate their pension plans
i urge a yes vote on the underlying bill
second there is a failure to include relief for the airline industry clearly putting pressure on wellfunded and managed plans to pick up the costs for other industries questioning whether they should stay and provide these plans
the provisions dealing with the defined contribution provisions are needed and as it was pointed out in the ways and means committee contain many of the provisions that were worked on through the portmancardin process as well as legislation presented by mr emanuel xz4001200 and mr pomeroy
however when you look at this bill in balance we do need to pass legislation but on balance this legislation will cause more harm than good and i urge my colleagues to reject the bill
mr speaker i am curious is the majority on the ways and means side going to be using their time or not
can i inquire as to the amount of time that remains on all sides
mr speaker i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from michigan mr levin xz4002380 the senior democrat on the subcommittee for social security and who understands retirement security
mr speaker i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from massachusetts mr neal xz4002910 a senior members of the ways and means committee and one of the leading experts on retirement issues
mr speaker i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from north dakota mr pomeroy xz4003230 one of the leaders in the ways and means committee on pension issues the former insurance commissioner from north dakota
mr speaker i am sure that people who are watching this debate are somewhat confused about some of the technical provisions that we have talked about on the funding of a guaranteed fund
we should do that because a it will allow the guaranteed fund to concentrate on other plans and companies will not arbitrarily cancel their plans because they are afraid they are going to be stuck with the costs of bailing out the airline industry
but it also deals with the issue of the airline industry directly not on a promise that we will deal with it in conference and it deals with the revolving door of bankruptcy which if we do not correct we are going to have other problems in addition to the airline industry
second when pension plans are underfunded and worker retirement security is in jeopardy excessive executive compensation packages can add insult to injury by heaping lavish benefits on executives while workers and retirees wonder if they will have any retirement benefit at all
for example it provides retired firefighters and police officers who often retire early without medicare coverage with a tax break on pension withdrawals to pay for health insurance premiums
families that work hard to earn a pension depend on it for retirement security
i would especially like to commend chairman boehner and chairman thomas for their work on this very important pension bill
i was surprised at the comments of the previous speaker who has attacked the bill on that point
the senate bill allows the airlines to pay their pension obligations over an extended period of time ensuring that airlines can fund their pension obligation and helping to prevent the pension benefit guaranty corporation from becoming insolvent as a result of taking on the burden of the airline pensions
as my colleague from maryland just noted i have sponsored legislation on the automatic enrollment and 401 k plans direct deposit of tax savings into a savings plan and the savers credit for people with moderate income to start saving
so this legislation on the defined contribution level takes the right step
but in doing that they have added the provisions on the defined benefit plans
on a standalone none of that would pass
the pbgc and the congressional budget office have estimated that in fact 9 billion in defaulted plans would be left on the taxpayers
participants deposited 583 on average 47 percent of their refunds into savings accounts
as cochairman of the savings and ownership caucus i believe that reaching out and empowering working families is essential to increasing the country s savings rate and ultimately to improve on our trade balance strengthening our economy and providing a growth path for the american future
i urge a yes vote on this proworker proretiree prosavings legislation
mr speaker i rise to speak on behalf of 7 000 current and former ibm employees who live in my district
mr speaker i thank the subcommittee chairman mr camp and my colleagues for working so hard on this bill along with our chairman and chairman of the education and the workforce committee
without their urging this bill would not be on the floor today and this bill is so extremely important especially to constituents in my district
madam speaker mr mcgovern my distinguished friend from massachusetts my good friend the distinguished gentleman from the state of washington and i were in 6 hours of hearings yesterday on something called border security antiterrorism and illegal immigration and we came here this morning at 7 am ostensibly to pass out the rules necessary to hear that bill
until 15 minutes ago i was on this floor of this house waiting to hear that bill
what i want to say is we are getting ready to create fear and confusion and there is substantial confusion on the majority side in light of the fact that they are shifting from this bill to that bill and not dealing with the things we need to do and get on out of here
mr speaker by direction of the committee on rules i call up house resolution 602 and ask for its immediate consideration
madam speaker house resolution 602 is a closed rule providing for 90 minutes of debate in the house on hr 2830 the pension protection act as amended to be equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the committee on education and the workforce and the chairman and ranking minority member of the committee on ways and means
in lieu of the amendments recommended by the committees on education and the workforce and ways and means now printed in the bill the amendment in the nature of a substitute printed in part a of the report of the committee on rules accompanying the resolution shall be considered as adopted
hr 2830 the pension protection act will ensure that millions of hardworking americans who rely on single and multiemployer pension benefits can continue to count on them
madam speaker without a comprehensive fix to our outdated pension plans more companies will default on their worker pension plans and more will stop providing defined benefit pension plans to their workers entirely
now is the time for congress to act on this important piece of legislation
mr speaker i yield 6 minutes to the gentleman from ohio mr boehner xz4000360 the chairman of the committee on education and the workforce
mr speaker this debate has been on the rule to deal with a very important bill that has been talked about on both sides that needs to be addressed
i would just simply point out that there will be a motion to recommit which has always been part of what the republican majority has suggested on every major piece of legislation since we have been in control
mr speaker i yield back the balance of my time and i move the previous question on the resolution
i oppose this legislation because it will further erode an employer s willingness to provide defined benefit plans and will close the loopholes that allow companies to dump their pension obligations on to taxpayers
rather than being able to count on a regular pension check of a specified amount each month for the rest of his or her life many workers must now put money in a mutual fund or other investment and take what comes each month for as long as it may last
the decision of united airlines to force the pbgc to cover its pension obligations resulted in reduced benefits for its employees and retirees and shifted its burden to fulfill pension promises on to the american taxpayer
northwest and delta airlines as well as companies such as delphi are also on the verge of following in the path of united airlines
over 8 million workers have already been affected by cash balance conversions before the courts put a hold on the discriminatory way companies converted to these cash balance plans
with the dramatic increase in hybrid plans and defined contribution plans employees are now faced with making multiple investment decisions that will have a profound impact on their retirement security
mr speaker i have to join the gentleman from massachusetts on his concern and dismay frustration and i think that outrage that the opportunity for a democratic substitute first of all to express some of the failures of this particular underlying bill and as well the opportunities to improve this legislation seemingly has been denied
but this particular bill as it relates to the pension issue just does not go far enough because what it happens to do is it emphasizes the pension crisis and it causes many of the companies and i think those who are listening beyond the borders of this particular chamber should understand that this bill that will be voted on today really causes companies to freeze or abandon your pension plans
what we should be doing in this instance is then ensuring and shoring up those liabilities or the potential of those liabilities and the negative impact it would have on people who work so very hard
as a member of both the committee on education and the workforce and the ways and means committee we have been working for the last 2 years to get a pension bill to the house floor and i am proud to rise in strong support of the bill
our bill makes companies put their money behind their promises and keep employees well informed on the health of their pension plans
united airlines pilots pension plan was only 30 percent funded when it was dumped on the government
those pilots and their families did not know how bad the situation was and they are the ones that are now trying to figure out how to live on onethird of what they had planned to receive
the bill also helps to modernize the pension law on cash balance pension plans
we need to get this bill through the house and on to conference with the senate and quickly enacted early next year
in the many hearings on pension issues we have heard over and over again that companies need predictability and stability in their plans
i have been on the floor of the house ever since i came here
employers who went into a plan they even paid up for their employees to deal with the issue of wearaway and they can not get clarity on the programs that they have in place right now
i ask the chairman to work with me in conference to increase the threshold to at least 80 percent so that we encourage executives to take their pension funding obligations more seriously not leave their defined benefit plan beneficiaries and indeed the pbgc and taxpayers on the hook
had the majority permitted members on my side of the aisle to amend the bill i am sure that our suggestions would go a long way to improving the legislative product before us
the workers employed in local plant sites throughout the nation feel their future income security is threatened because their pensions are dependent on the financial health of companysponsored plans
i would like to echo my colleague from georgia s comments on this important subject
madam speaker i commend the chairman for all his work on this bill and ask for his continued good efforts on behalf of the airline industry as we go forward
over 34 million american workers currently rely on the benefits they receive from a defined benefit pension plan to make ends meet
hr 2830 makes significant changes to the rules for defined benefit pension plans increases the premiums that companies pay into the pbgc and does nothing to prevent companies from dumping their pension obligations on american taxpayers
rather than allowing an open debate on this important issue the majority leadership has chosen to close this bill from amendments or even allow consideration of a democratic substitute
but you know it is so hypocritical for anybody on the majority side to come here and say that the minority is just saying no when you will not allow us to put on the floor a substitute to which we want to say a resounding yes
so i want to close with this what you are saying and you have said it on the floor is leave it to the conference committee
what i think is going to happen if this bill becomes law and if it were to be combined in conference with provisions in the senate is essentially to undermine defined benefit plans and move us towards what are called defined contribution plans so more and more everybody will rely on a 401 k instead of the guaranteed benefit in the private sector
we asked the bush administration when they testified before ways and means tell us the impact on industry of your proposals
various people have scrambled to try to reduce the potential undermining of defined benefit plans through this provision on credit balances but i want everybody to know that that is not likely to work out in the main because this republican bill would discourage companies from doing the responsible and sensible thing advance funding their pension plans to free up resources in years when they needed to make big expenditures like rolling out a big product line and penalize those who would do it any way who would advance funds
what is likely to come out is a bill that would make this bill even worse and even if it did not what we face with this bill is this basic question do we want to strengthen defined guaranteed pension plans and payments or are we going to move to everybody on their own
mr speaker i rise in opposition to the socalled pension reform bill today on the house floor
specifically the sec found among other conclusions that p ension consultants may steer clients to hire certain money managers and other vendors based on the pension consultant s or affiliate s other business relationships and receipt of fees from these firms rather than because the money manager is bestsuited to the client s needs
i am hopeful that the pension legislation considered today by the house will be greatly improved during the conference with the senate so that we can have a vote on pension reform legislation that actually addresses the real problems that exist in the current system
american workers have relied on the pension promises of their employers
i urge a no vote on this republican pension bill and a yes vote on the democratic substitute
this pension bill boils down to one fundamental principle the republicans want all americans including flight attendants and everybody else out there on a pension to be entirely alone isolated from the strength and compassion of american values
get rid of social security privatize it put them on their own
medicare privatize it put them on their own
now we have the pension bill privatize it put them on their own
the republican vision articulated in this bill is that america is a sinking ship and the shout is for every man and woman you are on your own
but it really is you are on your own
imagine living in the united states on 15 000 after working for 45 years
so they get their social security 1 800 a month at the maximum and 385 oh they are living fat on 2 000 a month
we beat them on that and we should beat them on this
i urge my colleagues to vote no on this
madam speaker i yield 1 12 minutes to my colleague on the rules committee the gentleman from florida mr hastings xz4001701
madam speaker millions of americans who work in the private sector are relying on having an employersponsored pension plan when they retire
the net effect is a real strain on the pbgc and ultimately a crisis in the pension system
madam speaker this bill will have a real effect on millions of americans lives and on the quality of their lives as they grow older
instead passage of this bill will allow corporations to turn their backs on their loyal employees and shirk the responsibilities they face to provide a real pension to their employees
this report shows that pension plans are underfunded by 450 billion that the pbgc is 23 billion in the red with more obligations coming in every day and that the current pension and bankruptcy laws allow companies to dump their unwanted pension obligations on to the pbgc
proving that this bill makes things worse and not better the report documents that the boehnerthomas bill could and i quote cause as many as half of all large pension plans to freeze benefits ranking member miller along with ranking member on the ways and means committee rangel have an answer
now i am sure my friends on the other side of the aisle will boast about how their legislation they have crafted is fabulous
those of us on this side of the aisle believe we have a better approach one that is fair to millions of americans and their families who get up every morning put in a hard day s work and are the very backbone of america s economy and our communities
the republicans on the rules committee late last night said no an alternative viewpoint will not be tolerated can not be presented to the members of this house and it certainly will not be debated and voted on on this floor
they have decided that the united states house of representatives is really not a deliberative body it is a place that does not respect differing viewpoints and it is unreasonable to have a full and open debate on an issue as important as pension protection
now let me say with all due respect to my friends on the other side of the aisle it is the majority that is responsible for creating a climate in this house that is devoid of bipartisanship and civility
this is not the house of only republicans this is the people s house where serious issues should be debated and voted on
employees are blindsided when their plan is dumped onto the federal government because they are not provided uptodate information on the real financial condition of their pension plan
according the pbgc the delphi claim on the pbgc would be 41 billion
the hit on employees estimated over 10 billion in uninsured losses would be the largest ever
the pbgc s 35 page study released on october 26 2005 analyzed detailed information of 400 pension plans representing 50 of the liabilities and underfunding in the pension system
the bill fails to stop companies from dumping their obligations on to the federal government fails to provide employees with accurate information on the financial condition of pension plans fails to stop executives from cutting and running with their own sweetheart pension deal while slashing employee pensions fails to protect older employees when a company converts to cash balance plans permits conflicted investment advice and punishes employees for plan underfunding by curtailing benefits
requiring pension plans to give employees accurate uptodate information on their pension plans financial condition
prohibiting company executives in charge of underfunded pension plans from entering into sweetheart retirement deals while they re moving to dump their employees pension plan on to the taxpayers
the republican answer to this crisis is to hasten the unraveling of pension plans by allowing companies to skip out on over 75 billion in contributions over the next 10 years and increasing pbgc s red ink by billions of dollars
madam speaker we will have an opportunity to debate the substance of this bill i guess not only during the rule but afterwards but i am still kind of baffled as to why this bill has to be brought to the floor under a closed rule why the ranking democrats on the committee of jurisdiction could not even be given the courtesy of being allowed to offer an alternative
madam speaker the gentleman from georgia just gave a nice speech but nobody on that side has explained why on this very important issue that the democrats and people with alternative views should be entirely locked out from participating in amending this bill
the gentleman from indiana tells us we should all be happy because the education committee deliberated on this and there were votes in that committee
here we are being denied an opportunity deliberately on this floor on an issue that impacts millions and millions of our fellow citizens
you know i am amazed that people on the other side who only a few years back would decry a closed process like this have now come to embrace this process
this is a closed process where legitimate important debate on important issues is being denied routinely
however we can not support legislation that would clarify the legal status of cash balance pension plans without providing protections for older longservice workers involved in cash balance plan conversions and without including a prohibition on all discriminatory age based wearaway we are also deeply concerned that this bill would for the first time permit defined contribution pension plans to provide investment advice subject to inherent financial conflicts
they generally lose out on larger late career benefits have less time to accumulate benefits under the new cash balance formula and are less able to leave their current job if benefits are cut because they typically have fewer job prospects
while we agree that individualized advice can be helpful such advice must be subject to erisa s fiduciary rules be based on sound investment principles and be protected from conflicts of interest
hr 2830 would turn back the clock and replace erisa s prohibition on conflicts of interest with a weak disclosure model an inappropriate and unnecessary step given today s marketplace
i mean i could go on and on and on
the bottom line is that many of us who have been on the side of workers consistently have deep concerns about this bill and what its impact will be on working families
let me just say to my friends on the other side of the aisle that you are not perfect
for the life of me i can not understand what the hesitation is by the leadership on that side of the aisle to allow us to be able to deliberate on this bill to have a give and take to be able to offer an amendment to be able to have an upordown vote
we should be able to work them out in a deliberative way on the house floor
but here we are on a bill that impacts millions and millions of americans a bill that we believe adversely impacts millions of americans and we are totally shut out of this
and i would simply say to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle someday the tables are going to turn
mr speaker on that i demand the yeas and nays
when the pbgc can not pay benefit for plans where they have assumed planned liabilities taxpayers are on the hook for the difference
many people go their entire career thinking they will have this money upon retirement and regularly contribute even when they could use the money to take their family on vacation or buy their children clothes
i am especially concerned about the adverse affect this bill has on women
as a member on the aviation subcommittee and a frequent flyer i have worked for years with airlines and flight attendants
vote no on the pension protection act of 2005
they perform jobs that are difficult on them both physically and mentally and they have earned their pension
let us get it into conference with the senate and let us get on with the job of ensuring that workers are secure in the knowledge that the pension that they have worked so hard to get will be there when they retire
madam speaker i thank the gentleman for all his hard work on the rules committee
so let us applaud it in iraq today but let us understand what is happening here the gradual glacial process of destroying debate on the floor of the house of representatives and the right of members
this republican pension bill is the greatest assault on the middle class standard of living in the history of congress because this bill accelerates the process by which millions of american workers will lose the retirement nest eggs that they were counting on
they will lose the security of their golden years if you will because of the accounts that they were counting on
that means that a plan that was designed an insurance policy that was designed for when companies went out of business now companies can take their pension plans the retirement nest eggs of their workers and put them into bankruptcy and the company can go merrily on its way
i do not choose that term lightly merrily on its way because after what we saw after years and decades of manipulating the pension plans of united airlines about not being truthful with the employees not being truthful with the public not being truthful with the shareholders about their liabilities they put them into bankruptcy
it treats those in the corporate suites entirely differently than it takes care of the workers on the shop floor or on the airlines or in the repair facilities
that means a lots of people who may be 50 55 years old today just as we found out with the cash balance plans this makes it easier to do a cash balance a lot of people who are working today are going to find out that they will not have a retirement nest egg that they have been planning on
this bill does absolutely nothing about companies who decide to use the federal government to dump and run on their promises to employees
i worked midnights for many years with doing so i missed out on many family gatherings holidays etc
this is a sad time in this country for all the workers who are relying on a pension to ease their lives and make this time relaxing and enjoyable
you re on your own
this bill is also larded up with lots of special interest perks but none as pernicious as the repeal of the longstanding prohibition on conflicted investment advice
federal pension law has always required investment advice to employees to be on the level free from selfinterested tainted financial advice
mr speaker when united airlines announced it was going to go into bankruptcy the democratic members of the committee on education and the workforce planned an ehearing so those people who were most affected by the termination of that plan and the bankruptcy of that company would have an opportunity to talk to their representatives in congress
we were not going to have a hearing on this problem and these people could not come to washington and testify
but the decision was made and they went into bankruptcy without a hearing on that issue
they take an additional hit on their pension because they are early retirees not because they wanted to stop flying but because the law says they have to retire
we believe that our motion to recommit does not impose arbitrary benefit cuts and freezes on workers who do not control whether or not the employers fund the pension plans or not
this legislation if it is not corrected is the greatest assault on the pension benefits and the retirement nest eggs of hardworking middle class americans in the history of this congress
i say that because it is quite clear that this will expedite and will accelerate the freezing and the termination of these plans that so many millions of americans are relying on
one thing this legislation will do if you want to continue to debate social security you will now prove with the passage of this legislation that social security is the most secure retirement system in this country that it is the only one that people can count on because these other plans are in jeopardy
mr speaker on that i demand the yeas and nays
so this bill is now shuttled to the floor barely a word of consideration in the ways and means committee and the republicans on the rules committee would not grant us the opportunity to offer an alternative
i will bet you on the other side everybody has read that poll by now
the committee on investment of employee benefit assets a group that represents chief investment officers from the larger corporations in the country recently conducted their own survey and concluded that if this were to pass 60 percent of those employers would either freeze or terminate their pension plans
over the years union leaders have exerted tremendous pressure on employers in every commercial sector by negotiating benefit increases to defined benefit plans that are already underfunded
congress should not sit idly by while the defined benefit system continues to die on the vine and for that reason i urge all of my colleagues to avert the pending retirement security crisis by passing the pension protection act today
hr 2830 also decreases the likelihood that american taxpayers will be forced to bailout private pensions and reduces the tax burden on american workers to provide them with greater incentives and opportunities to save for their own retirements
therefore i will vote for this bill on final passage
the rule before us today does not allow any member to offer or vote on amendments that may improve this bill
in particular i was hoping to vote on an amendment protecting united airline retirees from having their pension benefits reduced or terminated even though united expects to make 1 billion in profit within 1 year of being discharged from bankruptcy
madam speaker i see the chairman of the committee on education and the workforce is in the chamber
now on the other hand the chairman deserves much rebuke for tolerating the process that is unfolding here
there are a lot of important constituencies watching this debate and i want them to know that the chairman of the committee on education and the workforce complicit with the chairman of the ways and means committee complicit with the majority leadership of this body worked to shut down the process to shut out the consideration of other views to present only their way or the highway as an ultimate resolution of this issue
shame on you for depriving us of our alternative
well the majority seems intent on giving them quite a present indeed 177 billion deeper deficit going on top of 8 trillion of debt
well they failed on that one
mr speaker i strongly support this important legislation to address pending funding issues for america s workers and i applaud the work of chairman thomas and chairman boehner on this bill
as my friend from north dakota on the other side of the aisle just pointed out relief for the pension plans of america s struggling airlines is not in the current house bill
northwest airlines is the largest employer in the third congressional district of minnesota and thousands of northwest employees are counting on congress to rescue their pension plan
we must act today by passing this bill so employees can get the benefits they were promised and so the pbgc and taxpayers will not be on the hook
the social security system if people have relied on their government when they get older or disabled do not let the government be involved
the demands that are going to be made on employers to reach sometimes the increase of 240 percent in making contributions to these plans will cause many of them to drop the plan and go into bankruptcy
but at the end of the day the same way people regret their votes for the gulf of tonkin resolution they will have to come back and ask did they do more damage than good on today
at this time with the house permission i would like to turn the balance of my time over to congressman ben cardin from maryland who has spent a lot of time on pensions and can share with the house the pitfalls that we have in this bill before the house today
yet on the other hand mr speaker as this legislation was being drafted we want to make sure we get to a time where companies fully fund their workers pensions
getting to that transition was difficult and i want to thank the chairman of the ways and means committee mr thomas the chairman of the education and the workforce committee mr boehner for working with us to address our concerns specifically on behalf of the auto sector
i encourage and i ask for a yes vote on this bill because it is fixed
mr speaker we do not tolerate discrimination in this country based on race gender religion or disability and we must not tolerate discrimination based on age with regard to pensions
mr speaker i rise to urge my colleagues to vote yes on this important piece of legislation for several reasons
we all know that delta airlines is in a bankruptcy fight fighting for its very life and the two most critical issues that they need help on is doing something to lower the high cost of fuel which we have problems with and how we can do it
so i urge my colleagues to vote yes on this important legislation
mr speaker this is a comprehensive pension reform bill that will protect workers retirement incomes give companies a longer window to make underfunded plans whole and will help protect us taxpayers from taking on the liability associated with future plan terminations
delta air lines employs thousands of men and women in my district who rely now or plan to rely in whole or in part on retirement benefits provided by delta
i wanted to get down to this well to kind of deal with some specifics as to why it is important that we move this bill on over into conference
it will give companies a longer window to make underfunded plans whole and it will help protect us taxpayers from taking on the liability associated with future plan terminations
as i mentioned before delta airlines employs thousands of men and women in my district and other airlines in many of your districts throughout this country rely now or plan to rely in whole or in part on retirement benefits provided by delta
i know that is not the main item on the agenda but this is the only vehicle we have that we can use in conference to fix the situation
and i think this is a great compromise that had hours and hours and days and days of work on this and it is an example of how democracy works not how it does not work
workers lose the money they were depending on for retirement and american taxpayers are expected to pick up the slack for companies irresponsibility
recent bankruptcies in the airline industry shed a bright light on exactly what big corporations are up to
i ve heard from hundreds of constituents on this issue
i urge all my colleagues to vote no on this bill
i would like to thank both you and chairman thomas for your work on this bill
we used to rely on pensions personal savings and of course social security
workers on the other hand have had decades of working for companies providing loyal service the bargain for which was that in the end they would have a guaranteed pension
unfortunately our colleagues on the republican majority saw fit not to allow a substitute amendment so that we could not debate this proposal
among the most troubling aspects of the bill is its potential effect on definedbenefit pension plans
and both the congressional budget office and pbgc have concluded that the bill would increase claims on the federal government by billions of dollars which would increase the likelihood of a massive taxpayer bailout as well as the loss of billions of dollars in employee and retiree benefits
according to the joint committee on taxation the revenue effects of the tax provisions primarily benefiting higherincome households would grow from 36 billion in 2012 the first full year affected to 56 billion a year by 2015
as the center on budget and policy priorities says to allow the severe erosion over time of the principal tax incentive for modestincome families to save for retirement does not make sense as retirement policy
and incorporating regressive tax policy of this nature into a bill that swells budget deficits and opens the door to still more deficitincreasing tax cuts in the future stands sound policy on its head i think they are right
in summary mr speaker while i recognize that there are good aspects to this bill and while i think congress does need to act on this subject i think that on balance the bill as it stands should be rejected so that a betterbalanced measure can be brought forward
the third amendment i offered essentially said that every last option whether it be from the perspective of the pbgc or the company be exhausted before that pension is assumed by the pension benefit guaranty corporation given the fact that on average at least 15 percent of the retirees who have their pensions assumed by the corporation are going to receive less than their full promised pension
all i asked the rules committee last night was that we ought to talk about that here on the house floor and we ought to have a debate
in a time when delphi will be awarding 500 executives bonuses of 30 percent to 250 perce nt of their base salaries workers are seeing their pensions frozen i find it very troubling that the majority refuses to have a full and open debate on an issue so critical to our nation s retirement security
my first amendment would have put employee representatives on the trustee board of single employer pension plans which would ensure that employees have a voice in how their investments are managed
pension funds represent deferred compensation and there is no reason why singleemployer pension plans still lack employee representation on their boards
fiscally unhealthy pensions have caused severe hardship on employees who have depended on their pensions as part of their retirement security
in order for pensioners to have a more complete understanding of the health of their pension fund it is necessary to provide full and accurate information on a timely basis
there is a disturbing trend of companies dumping their pension obligations not because the company is going out of business but because the company does not want to follow through on the financial commitment made to its employees
i am old enough to remember a time when everyone on my block in the glen park section of gary indiana had a pension
while the number of active workers covered by such plans has dropped from over 40 million to under 20 million an additional 20 million retirees depend on defined benefit plans for their retirement security
today s legislation would put additional pressure on an agency that is already picking up the slack because corporate america has used them as a dumping ground
no similar restriction is imposed on executives
i believe this is going to have ramifications for protecting our workers and making our companies more competitive in this global marketplace so we can increasing compete effectively and create jobs and protect jobs and defend the hardworking american people who are depending on these retirement plans to be there in their retirement years
the opposition s motives could not be more transparent on this issue
for those members on the other side of the aisle who demonstrate courage and reject their leadership s contemptuous call to oppose this legislation you will be rewarded by the gratitude of your constituents and all americans for doing the right thing
i urge all members to support retirement security reform and vote yes on hr 2830
madam speaker american workers know that a defined pension plan is a promise from their employer a promise that when they retire they will receive a benefit they can rely on
in fact they have planned their retirement future on that promise
actually earlier this year the republican majority tried but failed to destroy the social security system by going back on their promise to every american that at a certain age they would receive a defined benefit a benefit they could count on
americans overwhelmingly stood up to the republicans and said social security is ours you promised it we rely on it you can not have it
they earned those benefits and this congress can not allow companies to go back on their word
i also look forward to the discussion with the chairman of the committee during the debate on the bill itself and highlight the need for reform in the airline industry which in my area and across this nation is so drastically calling out for reform
they depend on the retirement benefits provided by the airline industry
finally i wish to thank my colleagues on the ways and means and education and workforce committees and their staff for the hard work that has brought us to this point today
workers and retirees must be provided with an annual update on the plan s assets liabilities financial condition and funding policies
madam speaker i urge colleagues to back this bill and take a very important opportunity to put employees pension plans on a solid foundation
this bill strengthens current law and requires more accountability on the part of employers in funding their workers benefit plans
it also insists on more accountability by prohibiting employers and unions from offering pension benefit increases when plans are already severely underfunded
unless we want all taxpayers to pony up and bail out the pbgc we must demand reforms to place the defined benefit system on more solid ground
mr speaker like the president s wishful staged declaration of mission accomplished on that aircraft carrier 2 12 years ago or the vice president s declaration that the insurgency was in its final throes this resolution proclaims the desire of congress for victory in iraq
they are so proud of the democratic choices made in iraq this week and so very fearful for there to be any democratic choices on the resolution of the gentleman from california mr lantos xz4002310 and others
we have passed 2 000 young brave men and women in the service of america and we are on the way to 3 000
mr speaker given the stated interest in democracy here in the house i would ask unanimous consent to amend the rule to permit for division of the question so that we could express our unanimous support for the various provisions of this resolution except for that on which we have disagreement as to the best way to achieve success in iraq
at this point so that we can have the kind of democracy that occurred this week in iraq of which the majority seems so proud and actually have it right here on the floor of the house i ask unanimous consent for a division of the question on the provisions of this resolution
shocking truly shocking that democracy can not exist here on the house floor
mr speaker by direction of the committee on rules i call up house resolution 619 and ask for its immediate consideration
on january 30 of this year there were many people who thought it could not happen there were many terrorist attacks and it actually was slow in coming
as you will recall the pictures that we saw of voting stations where early on no one voted but ultimately 85 million iraqis voted to put into place a coalition government that was charged with the task of fashioning a constitution a constitution that would work to bring together the very disparate factions that exist within iraq the three that we know of the shia the sunni and the kurdish populations and of course the other divisions that exist in the country
midsummer we saw the work on that constitution proceed
it is a resolution introduced by the very distinguished chairman of the committee on international relations
but in his absence i know that from the international relations committee our colleague from miami ms roslehtinen xz4003440 came before the rules committee last night and testified on behalf of this resolution and she was joined by the distinguished ranking member of the committee on international relations mr lantos xz4002310
i got as i know all my colleagues did this 35page document that was put forward by the president as he began his campaign in the past several weeks to enlighten the american people on what our strategy for victory in iraq is
we will remain in iraq as long as necessary and not a day more now that was stated by president bush on february 26 of 2003 and i commend this document to my colleagues in which it refers to the fact that we have seen extraordinary achievements take place since we began our effort in iraq
the impact that it is having on the region is underreported
the positive salutary effect of what the united states of america the iraqi security forces and our coalition forces have done has had i believe an extraordinarily positive impact on nations like egypt that for the first time in its history held as i was told by the defense minister of egypt because of what we have done in iraq they held multicandidate elections in lebanon where we have seen people because of what we have done in iraq standing up for the cause of freedom say that they will give their lives to ensure that the syrians do not control their country
we underscore the fact that the iraqi security forces the united states of america and our coalition played a critical role in finally bringing about the selfdetermination which the people of iraq are now enjoying and it makes it clear that the region is still a very dangerous spot on our globe and that any kind of artificial timetable that were put into effect calling for our withdrawal would undermine the tremendous successes that we have been able to see over the past nearly 3 years and i believe could jeopardize the future of these people who are just now getting a taste of the kind of freedom that we take for granted
mr speaker i think it is very important for us to note that there should be in fact complete bipartisanship in our goal to not have an artificial timetable complying with the request of our men and women on the ground there along with president talabani as well as making sure that we achieve victory in iraq
i am convinced mr speaker that at the end of the day an overwhelming majority of the house of representatives will support this because we want to do more than simply pat our men and women in uniform on the back and pat the iraqi people on the back
it recognizes the sense of the men and women in uniform who are on the ground there
i would like to share with my colleagues since we are talking about the process of democracy in iraq and the process of democracy here in the united states of america and in the people s house according to the congressional research service they state on simple resolutions simple resolutions express nonbinding opinions on policies or issues the sense of the house or senate or deal with the internal affairs or prerogatives of the house
people in iraq our men and women on the ground recognize that
and that was part of the initial strategy that was launched on his speech on the 26th of february 2003
mr speaker i yield myself 30 seconds and i do so to simply focus on the issue that is constantly raised here and that is the notion that we somehow impose closed rules on every piece of legislation
there have been 113 rules considered on the house floor in the first session of the 109th congress
mr speaker i have seen these buttons that my colleagues on the other side have been wearing although i do not see them wearing it this morning but they wore them last night that says debate iraq
we have just gone through a very rigorous debate on the defense appropriations process
we have gone through the defense authorization process and we have had a full debate on that
every single day on the house floor at least one member stands up to outline his or her position on the issue of iraq
it was the battle of fallujah and since he died i have gotten to know his family and his parents have repeatedly said to me personally have gone on television and said this that in the name of their courageous son who is a marine killed in the battle of fallujah it would be absolutely reprehensible for the united states of america to cut and run for us to leave iraq on some artificial timetable
i can not understand why anyone would believe mr speaker that we can not come together with a strong bipartisan vote making sure that the success that we enjoyed on january 30 and october 15 and just yesterday in iraq is sustained
the material previously referred to by mr mcgovern xz4002630 is as follows previous question for h res 619 the rule for h res 612 expressing the commitment of the house of representatives to achieving victory in iraq amendment in nature of substitute strike all after the resolved clause and insert resolved that upon the adoption of this resolution it shall be in order without intervention of any point of order to consider in the house the resolution h res 613 congratulating the people of iraq on the three national elections conducted in iraq in 2005

mr speaker i move the previous question on the resolution
i do not intend when the debate begins to have anything to say and quite frankly if i had the wherewithal i would ask my colleagues on the democratic side not to say anything as well
but i do know a little bit now having served on the rules committee for a little while about closed rules and i know when we have closed rules we restrict democracy
and is it not true that mr lantos resolution is also simple and there was nothing to preclude the committee on rules from hearing the lantos matter had you chosen
we need to focus their minds on making the compromises that are necessary if a real government is going to be followed
let me ask you this if there is a young unemployed man who is angry about foreign troops marching on his neighborhood what do you think will make him more angry and more likely to plant an ied the fact that we tell him we are going to leave in a year or so or tell him we are going to stay there as long as george bush says so
the third reason we ought to think about this is that in our briefings we have received we have been told that the iraqi military will be fully trained by next december 2006 and it is realistic it is commonsense it is a measure to focus the iraqi politicians on the necessity of seeking compromise to say that we should begin transitioning next year and substantially conclude by december 2006
mr speaker we all know that there is a spectrum of views on my side of the aisle on how to deal with the difficult situation in iraq in the weeks and months ahead
my resolution congratulates the iraqi people on three democratic national elections encourages all americans to support the iraqi people and commends our troops and those of our allies and the iraqi forces for protecting their people at election time
the text of my resolution is as follows h res 613 whereas the people of iraq have consistently and courageously demonstrated their commitment to democracy by participating in three elections in 2005 lt p gt amp nbsp amp nbsp amp nbsp whereas on january 30 2005 the people of iraq participated in an election for a transitional national assembly lt p gt amp nbsp amp nbsp amp nbsp whereas all segments of iraqi society actively participated in the approval of a new iraqi constitution through a referendum held on october 15 2005 lt p gt amp nbsp amp nbsp amp nbsp whereas reports indicate that the people of iraq voted in unprecedented and overwhelming numbers in the most recent election held on december 15 2005 for a new national parliament that will serve in accordance with the recentlyapproved iraqi constitution for a fouryear term and that represents the first fully sovereign elected democratic assembly in the history of iraq lt p gt amp nbsp amp nbsp amp nbsp whereas this remarkable level of participation by the people of iraq in the face of dire threats to their very lives has won the admiration of the world lt p gt amp nbsp amp nbsp amp nbsp whereas the iraqi elections could not have been conducted without the courage and dedication of the members of the united states armed forces and the armed forces of other nations in iraq including the members of the security forces of iraq and lt p gt amp nbsp amp nbsp amp nbsp whereas the december 15 2005 election in iraq inspires confidence that a robust pluralistic democracy that will bring stability to iraqi society is emerging now therefore be it lt p gt amp nbsp amp nbsp amp nbsp resolved that the house of representatives lt p gt amp nbsp amp nbsp amp nbsp 1 congratulates the people of iraq on the three national elections conducted in iraq in 2005 lt p gt amp nbsp amp nbsp amp nbsp 2 encourages all americans to express support for the people of iraq in their efforts to achieve a free open and democratic society and 3 expresses its thanks and admiration to the members of the united states armed forces and the armed forces of other nations in iraq including the members of the security forces of iraq whose heroism permitted the iraqi people to vote safely lt p gt there is nt a member in this body who could not subscribe to this
i would like to comment on your observation
i attempted at the end of this session to have this congress go home with a unanimous vote congratulating the iraqi people on what they have done congratulating our military our allies and the iraqi forces for making it possible for them to vote
there are divisions on policy and it is an ostrich policy to pretend that there are no divisions
the issue is that the last discussion of iraq in this body will show division bitterness and divisiveness and that could have been avoided with a little bit of flexibility and consideration on the part of the majority for the views of almost onehalf of this body
late last night the ranking member of the house international relations committee one of the most respected leaders in this house on human rights congressman tom lantos came before the rules committee with a resolution that focused on congratulating the people of iraq for three successful elections conducted in iraq this year
shame on the majority to treat one of the most respected members of this body in such a fashion
while the president continues to give speeches on the war the american people have become disenchanted with the administration s iraq policies and its failure to disclose a plan for withdrawal
how many more iraqi lives must be sacrificed before we decide that while most iraqis are confident in yesterday s parliamentary elections twothirds are opposed to the presence of us troops according to a poll released on december 12 by abc news and time magazine
the bush administration and the republican leadership of this house should be spending less time on spin and speeches and more time on preparing for bringing american troops home
mr speaker i yield 6 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from california mr lantos xz4002310 the ranking member on the international relations committee who was denied his request to offer his amendment here on the floor today
we do nt know a lot about democracy in this house because we are routinely shut out of being able to have debates and votes on important issues
mr speaker i yield 3 minutes to one of the authors of the amendment that was rejected last night in the rules committee the gentleman from florida mr hastings xz4001701 my colleague on the rules committee
the bottom line is on important issues on important matters like this one we are routinely shut out
i mean the chairman may be on board with what the president is doing in iraq but there are many of us who have great concerns
and the fact of the matter is the section that is controversial in this bill deserves debate not in the context of this resolution but we should be on this floor debating this for a period of time and let everybody have their chance to present their viewpoint on what our policy should be in iraq
we have spent hundreds of billions of dollars and we do not like to talk about it except in the context of these resolutions that kind of get dropped on us and brought to the floor and we are supposed to praise our troops which we all do
he has been wrong on everything
one of the complaints that many of us on this side of the aisle and i know some of the people on the republican side have as well is that we kind of skirt around the real issue which is what the policy is
he has given speeches that have been heavy on rhetoric but not particularly big on specifics
notwithstanding the fact that we have 160 000 troops over there that over 2 100 americans have died over there and 15 000 americans have been wounded tens of thousands of iraqis have been killed we have yet to have a real policy debate on this house floor about what course we should take in iraq
to bring a largely symbolic resolution to the floor and tuck in it this kind of policy statement give us an hour during the debate on the resolution to talk about everything that is not the way we should be doing business around here
let me also simply say my point was that on important matters we usually have closed rules as we did yesterday on the pension bill
mr speaker i will be asking for a no vote on the previous question so i could amend the rule and allow the house to consider house resolution 613 instead of house resolution 612
house resolution 613 was introduced last evening by international relations ranking member lantos the democratic leader pelosi democratic whip steny hoyer and the gentleman from florida mr hastings xz4001701 which expresses congratulations to the people of iraq on three national elections conducted in 2005
mr speaker i ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my amendment and the text of house resolution 613 immediately prior to the vote on the previous question
we all want to congratulate our troops but quite frankly there is language in this bill that some of us consider inflammatory that some of us strongly disagree with and i would urge my colleagues to vote no on the previous question so that we can have a unified message and not a divisive message here in the house
people can disagree with me on this but the fact of the matter is we should be debating this issue of how we deal with iraq not in an h res form but in a binding resolution here on the house floor
we owe these brave men and women more than just a pat on the back and a congratulations
we should do that and i would hope that my colleagues will vote no on the previous question so we can bring up a resolution that truly unites this body and not divides it
mr speaker on that i demand the yeas and nays
no this american hero wanted to talk to me about the progress being made on the ground in iraq and how well the new iraqi troops performed in the field and how committed the iraqis were to reclaiming their country from the terrorists
he watched thousands of iraqis singing and celebrating on their way to polling stations
we can not redeploy troops based on political concerns instead of needs on the ground to secure victory
we can not give our terrorist enemies a victory which they can not achieve on the battleground
vote yes on the rule and the underlying resolution
it is extraordinary day today mr speaker as a member of congress that has had the privilege to travel to operation iraqi freedom on three different occasions the news that 11 million iraqis with iraqis on point handling the security during these elections 70 percent of iraqis turned out
and it is my privilege and honor to rise this morning on this floor in support of the rule and the underlying resolution that confirms this great day in the history of freedom december 15 2005 when millions of iraqis defied terrorists to say yes to democracy
mr skelton had a son serve in afghanistan in the war on terrorism
mr taylor xz4003992 of north carolina mr akin xz4000050 of missouri mr kline xz4002240 of minnesota ms roslehtinen xz4003440 of florida and mr saxton xz4003590 of new jersey all of us have had family members who have participated in the global war on terror and we are so proud of their successes
even iraqi leaders sunni shiite and kurdish alike who agree on practically nothing have united around a call for the united states military to leave
