fewer and fewer of their families basic 
covered 492 percent of the basic food

is another example of the abuse of 
of the abuse of power by this 
not in favor of cafta until there 
the trade minister of costa rica 
and the rest of central america have 
for that process of consultations so we 
a full airing of cafta and of 
of cafta and of the china bill

the other side of the aisle can 
week debating naming of post offices but 
the ranking member of the committee on 
fact that many of us we want 
to have more of a policy debate 
i think one of the reasons why 
clear that one of the reasons why 
why so many of us voted against

it is part of a desperate effort 
three major pieces of legislation that have 
or alternative points of view 
to be part of the legislation 
the other side of the aisle supporting

under such cover of darkness should we 
wonder what kind of witchcraft is being 
in the dead of night 
policies including many of my neighbors my 
family and many of the good people 
one of the things i 
hear a lot of people say is 
they uplifted four of them and shipped 
that in some of these cafta countries 
the united states of america 
on both sides of the aisle will 
the united states of america on the 
on the path of growth 
deal down regardless of what time in

was a conglomeration of a number of 
of a number of bills brought together 
under the leadership of the gentleman from 
something coming out of the committee on

of the house of representatives 
any trade bill of this sort that 
is a violation of the world trade 
are in violation of the world trade 
under the rule of law 
bill addresses many of the problems if 
if not all of the problems that 
the other side of the aisle 
to the principles of the world trade 
as chairman of the trade subcommittee 
it wants out of this bill does 
not waive any of those rights in 
house under suspension of the house rules 
on the delivery of democracy by providing 
just 1 hour of debate on this 
by any member of congress from even 
all 435 members of the house to

all the rhetoric of congress got nothing 
so great out of congress on the 
all my criticism of china they have 
countries back out of our currency and 
the euro because of our support for 
all this type of stuff then add 
a currency manipulation of 20 to 80 
not a matter of putting tariffs up 
the department of commerce is required 
measure the size of the subsidy where 
practicable but use of chinese cost and 
restricted the ability of the commerce department 
to a barrage of complaints from us 
first of all this bill 
requires the department of commerce to ensure 
is no doublecounting of countervailing duties and 
be no doublecounting of export subsidies but 
are the words of the commerce department 
to the department of commerce this restriction 
questions the costs of which may far
