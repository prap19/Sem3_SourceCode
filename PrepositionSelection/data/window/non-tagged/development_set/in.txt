of the continuity in congress 
have full representation in this congress 
and in keeping with the 
language is incorporated in this bill 
in closing we face

up a vote in the way that 
in my view it

will respond similarly in this case 
consider this legislation in an open and

of the house in the event that 
the speaker decided in order to get 
this moving and in order to get 
to be included in a bill and 
it was put in this bill 
it was put in really to get

members to congregate in this house 
have a provision in the law that 
for a situation in the event that 
it was put in

are well trained in the use of 
there is value in that when elsewhere 
i rise today in opposition to this 
debating this issue in a more thoughtful 
the good intentions in the world but 
unfortunately we find in the real world 
the real world in practice it does 
men and women in uniform who are 
remind everyone that in the 6 weeks 
worse in the case of 
a recent change in house rules tried 
constitute a quorum in emergency circumstances 
it from meeting in one location 
for their contributions in putting this bill 
while small in size this is

included in the cvc is 
in this exhibit hall

facts are included in the cvc exhibits 
citizens be pursued in this venue so 
gentleman s interest in this matter 
we go forward in the months and

continuity of government in the event of 
there are differences in the approach that 
and very few in this house have 
i early on in this congress were 
forward their work in this process 
has been made in this century i 
the architect but in the meantime i 
our future history in the capitol complex 
happy to participate in this with my 
claim the time in opposition to the 
at one time in my life i 
in the meantime i 
language that is in the bill 
claim the time in opposition to the 
record is distributed in accordance with title 
balance of this in the record 
i am correct in that i would 
to stand back in this discussion if 
claim the time in opposition to the 
in addition we have 
in addition to the

take the seat in the event of 
100 existing vacancies in the house would 
have some expertise in 
in turn this would 
to the states in historic proportions quite 
that we built in michigan several years 
of voting systems in their precincts 
of election equipment in a state will 
do is fill in the names of 
citizens to participate in a special election 
in fact even now 
elections be held in much less time 
would do so in a time of 
is a step in showing the enemies 
over 300 votes in the last congress 
gentlewoman from michigan in joining our committee 
chairman i rise in opposition to hr 
to hr 841 in its current form 
the core problems in this legislation remain 
the same as in last year s 
inhibits public participation in the expedited special 
serious problems revealed in the aftermath of 
years as advertised in addressing problems of 
override state laws in order to hold 
than 100 vacancies in the chamber 
reconstituting the house in a truly democratic 
middle last april in the vote on 
voters to participate in elections and create 
and create confusion in the aftermath of 
of special elections in many states 
may not cope in the aftermath of 
for 75 days in which to conduct 
eliminates their flexibility in the scheduling of 
scheduling of elections in the format of 
the elections and in the costs of 
wishing to participate in an unscheduled sudden 
for the ballot in states which require 
have an infrastructure in place to negotiate 
extraordinarily difficult even in normal circumstances 
a head start in gaining seats in 
in gaining seats in the house

effectively block them in many states 
absentee ballots even in those states which 
its own provisions in the event the 
but becomes useless in the event of 
last year that in the circumstances that 
now right here in the legislation before 
the 45day provision in the bill allows 
even in elections under the 
a potential breakdown in communication systems and 
not enough time in many states to 
choices of values in a democracy 
chairman the continuity in representation act provides 
in addition it preserves 
in such a time 
have a voice in the critical decisions 
in fact a survey 
already have laws in place that require 
to be conducted in a shorter period 
the house acted in an overwhelmingly bipartisan 
approved the continuity in representation act by 
in fact hr 841 
of us here in this chamber 
it has been in the past 
able to respond in the face of 
congress should act in the interest of 
to join me in supporting hr 841 
chairman i rise in opposition to the 
the time limit in which to conduct 
limit provided for in hr 841 it 
power of congress in a significant way 
following an attack in which over 100 
congress from acting in this situation 
period of time in which to conduct 
in turn this would 
to the states in historic proportions dollars 
one we built in michigan several years 
but particularly so in this case for 
of election equipment in a state will 
is just fill in the name of 
elections be conducted in a period of 
not be represented in this body in 
in this body in the united states 
semblance of continuity in representation 
a driving force in bringing this legislation 
in this book we 
of government commission in that it outlined 
outlined an election in michigan michigan s 
the vacancy occurred in 1993 and the 
mr chairman in returning to the 
creates greater confidence in the process mr 
speaker i rise in opposition to the 
the language in the motion to 
to the language in the help america 
in fact the gentleman 
these issues including in the state of 
of these bills in due course 
can be debated in the proper context 
it was incorporated in the full committee 
some substantial problems in the future 
but that happens in a lot of 
from any place in the united states 
is no room in the actual capitol 
of them is in regard to smoking 
ban on smoking in all federal buildings 
is an exemption in place but we 
in the rayburn cafeteria 
serious health problems in terms of their 
has some suggestions in how we could 
could address it in a constructive way 
will pursue it in that manner rather 
in may of 2004 
that are involved in this come to 
so in more than 10 
the problem lies in the other chamber 
addressed this problem in recent years 
841 the continuity in representation act of 
and with legitimacy in the event of 
catastrophic terrorist attack in which a large 
make a difference in the quality of 
through special elections in as short a 
i rise in support of this 
of the funding in this bill goes 
provides 287 billion in new budget authority 
and 25 billion in new outlays for 
of 42 million in ba and 241

to hold elections in a timely fashion 
all it is in each state s 
adequate elected representation in washington 
members to serve in this body 
members to serve in the people s 
made this point in federalist 52 as 
that the government in general should have 
appointment is necessary in order to preserve 
our constitutional liberties in times of crisis 
overcentralization of power in the executive branch 
will be necessary in the event of 
body several times in our history 
example the british in the war of 
of a quorum in the house of 
while congress is in session was actively 
was actively involved in hostilities against the 
nonelected persons serve in the house 
of mass vacancies in the house without 
in fact as hamilton 
as hamilton explains in federalist 59 the 
in conclusion i urge 
841 the continuity in representation act which 
continue to operate in the event of 
natural gas prices in this country are 
chairman i rise in opposition to hr 
will leave us in limbo without leadership 
the time frame in this bill of 
house of representatives in a time of 
made immediately so in that 45 days 
be elected when in fact it will 
representative so that in times of crisis 
for every district in the country even 
dies or is in incapacitated 
address incapacity and in the case of 
cast a vote in the house of 
competent leaders were in a state of 
our colleagues joined in 
to think about in terms of party 
that will work in a time of 
the american people in the lurch leaves 
and without representation in the congress for 
competent leaders were in a state of 
we were all in confusion standing on 
at each other in our eyes and 
and were joined in by our colleagues 
will leave them in the lurch leave 
we do believe in god bless america 
let us join in now with the 
going to happen in the future if 
put this solution in place and there 
and leave them in the lurch 
chairman i rise in support of this 
we will debate in a few moments 
should not be in this appropriations bill 
going to do in case of a 
congress can act in a time of 
alternative which is in title iii of 
will put us in grave jeopardy for 
other alternative get in the way of 
a special election in order to deal 
another major bombing in this country and 
and it happens in this city 
put ourselves in a position of 
what will happen in a catastrophe 
elections as presented in this bill would 
chairman i rise in support of hr 
the house acted in an overwhelmingly bipartisan 
never brought up in the other body 
government is rooted in the principle of 
entirely the unelected in certain circumstances 
enact the continuity in representation act under 
to potential discontinuity in government in extraordinary 
discontinuity in government in extraordinary situations 
a significant stake in the operation of 
democracy prevails even in the most pressing 
of vacant seats in states that have 
to fill vacancies in its general assembly 
apply to vacancies in the house of 
virginia delegation sitting in this chamber or 
up the process in the slow states 
the one seat in the house of 
if no candidate in that election gets 
election such as in the case of 
and emphatically spoke in favor of maintaining 
that are proposed in this bill are 
a proper election in a time of 
to fill vacancies in the house of 
just as well in a time of 
election process particularly in those states like 
conduct special elections in many states 
want to participate in this unscheduled election 
choices of values in a democracy 
to be held in those states with 
or no delegation in the house but 
the amendment made in order under the 
an appeals process in the gentlewoman s 
house it is in the interest of 
an election call in the courts forever 
might not be in a proper position 
they will result in new representatives coming 
the fatal flaw in this amendment is 
time we spend in court the less 
get them back in time to be 
just too compact in order to run 
spent tied up in the courts is 
chairman i rise in opposition to the 
been very sincere in stating that there 
house of representatives in case of a 
debated that amendment in the last congress 
for that bill in february ought to 
in this 49day time 
wants to have in terms of selecting 
me to participate in this discussion 
placing a plaque in statuary hall 
i was interested in offering an amendment 
to be placed in statuary hall which 
services were held in the house chamber 
speaker s podium in the old house 
withdrew my proposal in light of ongoing 
to the exhibitry in the capitol visitors 
the exhibit hall in the soontobeopened capitol 
been religious activities in this capitol from 
of his predecessors in the 10th district 
i offer it in his stead 
would simply rein in the cost of 
that would rein in excessive spending 
can actually rein in that spending ourselves 
of the house in voting for this 
restrain our spending in the matter of 
of printing here in congress 
to eliminate jobs in this instance 
gentleman s interest in reducing excessive printing 
pay for it in a subsequent appropriation 
and the language in the amendment simply 
preprinted their amendments in the lt em 
to be raised in the course of 
deals with filibusters in the us senate 
of good government in our processes so 
budget discipline and in fact reflects the 
example an increase in six of the 
the department flexibility in these accounts to 
on public lands in the west which 
areas especially california in recent years 
am also pleased in particular that the 
has been diligent in funding the vital 
the vital payment in lieu of tax 
are truly significant in that prioritization and 
that prioritization and in this particular situation 
unique so far in today s debate 
that is actually in the bill and 
recognized long time in the bill are 
in fact 67 percent 
of this country in which education funding 
and local commitment in tax base is 
to be found in the 13 states 
happen to be in these particular states 
not do it in the west 
that no one in utah would ever 
come and raft in the area of 
had called payment in lieu of taxes 
money was placed in this program 
the federal lands in the west 
recommended a cut in this program and 
increasing the payment in lieu of taxes 
of expanding this in conference 
of the issues in this freeflowing open 
he has done in this bill and 
west the kids in the west the 
all of us in congress for over 
what we do in every appropriations issue 
also takes place in another area and 
it takes place in the committee process 
a good job in coming up with 
have of maintenance in our national parks 
minority party was in charge here and 
basically no increases in pilt funding it 
are some areas in which i think 
and move forward in those particular areas 
in closing mr speaker 
here and there in the appropriations bill 
for that matter in any other bill 
our way but in judging this bill 
did with education in utah 
the amendment printed in section 3 shall 
3 shall be in order without intervention 
of the question in the committee of 
the whole or in the house 
amendment referred to in section 2 is

white river junction in vamc was closed 
demand for care in the north florida 
as of april in gainesville florida there 
certainly in a state like

but keeping it in the legislation is 
i rise today in support of the

we did that in response to revelations 
surge of veterans in categories 1 through 
very same day in which the secretary 
the paper when in fact days later

our animated hearings in the house 3 
last several weeks in april they provide

most serious shortfalls in this bill 
urge my colleagues in the house to

from using funds in this bill to

in adopting my amendment 
report and those in support of the

address environmental justice in minority populations and 
results in brief epa has 
identified populations addressed in the executive order 
moreover in 2001 the agency 
to environmental justice in a manner that 
been actively involved in implementing executive order 
in the absence of

the epa region in which the person 
a wide disparity in protected populations

not be spent in any way that 
address environmental justice in minority populations and

meets all requirements in their clean water 
a 2year period in the clean water 
to the shortcomings in the budget that 
about these shortages in the appropriation bills 
do not denigrate in any way people 
i hope everybody in this country at 
at some point in their lives can 
the most blessed in our society ought 
is grossly negligent in dealing with the 
the first time in all the years 
i have been in congress there will 
not want it in his state but 
government to acquire in my state there 
most pristine land in this country and 
and dirtiest lakes in the country 
i certainly am in support of the 
i am certainly in support of the 
the need for in fact increasing rather 
fair and balanced in the way he 
this bill is in my view up 
agree with him in that assessment 
meet the targets in that resolution even 
many more dollars in the veterans health 
care funds than in fact they requested 
months for appointments in california 
have heard that in states like arkansas 
of 6month delays in emergency surgery in 
in emergency surgery in oregon 
from falling bricks in maine 
a medical center in vermont has major 
has major shortfalls in their prosthetics budget 
out routine procedures in illinois 
cover operating expenses in states like california 
yet in the face of 
stories like that in april va secretary 
later the problem in their eyes got 
the right thing in the interior bill 
out also that in my view some 
chaired the committee in charge of veterans 
been too insistent in agreeing with those 
to suggest that in fact the gentleman 
needed 25 billion in this account over 
this 15 billion in this motion now 
in that sense it 
of the administration in threatening to fire 
of people those in the uniformed services 
to be comfortable in their homes 
we have seen in the veterans health 
must be restored in the public lands 
in an effort to 
unadopted excess animals in contracted longterm holding 
this new tool in selling would only 
the range and in balance with the 
see the wisdom in turning back this 
in fact it would 
tourism our shellfish in coastal states around 
the front lines in their attempts to 
the funding levels in this bill reflect 
half billion dollars in cuts to the 
truly a champion in our quest for

road contracts are in effect to determine 
status of roads in the tongass would 
this amendment legislative in nature 
to be funded in fiscal year 2006 
the money remains in the bill but 
and unauthorized programs in a single number 
level such as in the case for 
for years and in some cases in 
in some cases in excess of a 
on appropriations gets in the position of 
but in this case what 
do our job in authorizing these programs 
things that are in this bill over 
rule the amendment in order because what 
rule the amendment in order

the same subsidies in china or vietnam 
by new shippers in antidumping cases with 
of goodpaying jobs in places like northwestern

it is important in itself and it 
we are having in our trade relations 
look particularly becoming in a fig leaf 
urge everyone who in this chamber is 
trade law protections in the current wto 
of currency manipulation in the context of 
that the minority in the committee on 
had much interest in issues like cvd 
when they were in the majority 
a bill dropped in the same day 
mr speaker today in the hill magazine

with no end in sight 
about how jobs in our home states 
to secure votes in favor of the 
number of constituents in my district who 
with the people in my district who 
this serious issue in a detailed fashion 
speaker i rise in strong support of

because labor costs in china are so 
the cheap labor in china 
us trade deficit in china will continue 
has been refreshing in this sense that 
in the last few 
dams and locks in return for a 
or if not in return that being 
process regarding sugar in order to try 
they are not in the agreement 
with the statements in almost every case 
majority regarding cafta in a way they 
and my colleagues in so many cases 
the economic data in perspective 
estimate is that in terms of gdp 
matter so much in terms of where 
talking about countries in a region that 
of any region in the world 
weak middle class in most of the 
the headline was in latin america richpoor 
ownership and wealth in a few hands 
to invest not in human capital or 
and so in recent years we 
labor no discrimination in the workplace and 
is not used in any other part 
on the ground in central america but 
in reality workers do 
in some cases all 
in a special order 
out one example in el salvador 
important that workers in central america have 
in these countries with 
with immense poverty in these countries with 
maldistribution of income in these countries with

the minimum pay in 2005 is only

of workers were in place so enforce

problems facing america in its trade with 
down the loopholes in the countervailing duties 
the countervailing duties in the thomas bill 
i have sat in this chamber and 
abuse of power in their lockstep rejection 
in fact when the 
continues to engage in unfair trade practices 
in fact if press 
not being made in order is because 
side believes that in fact these amendments 
have any teeth in it 
had some teeth in it that was 
let the majority in this house work 
substitute was offered in the committee on
