was overnight passed in the committee on 
a great deal in that bill that 
but very specifically in that bill and 
abuse of power in this house ignoring 
in our motion to 
you do that in what you say 
inside this congress in this congress or 
this congress or in the previous congress 
to the republicans in their evisceration of 
we have done in the ethics process 
been bipartisan bipartisan in writing the rules

of the house in this disgraceful manner 
and women serving in our military 
the house rules in this regard when 
an 18yearold private in the army than 
we who sit in this hallowed chamber 
was a time in the not too 
ourselves right here in this chamber 
remaining ethics provisions in today s legislation 
evenly divided committee in the house 
in practical terms the 
changes had been in place in the 
been in place in the last congress 
the ethical climate in washington has eroded 
what they learned in school about how 
in times past our 
rammed through congress in the dead of 
and have faith in the integrity of 
provisions are slipped in by committee staff 
egregious ethics changes in this package 
of the amendment in the record immediately 
a direct interest in the legislation referred 
a twothirds vote in the house to 
waive the requirement in our standing rules

campaign cell phone in this building 
12 i was in the chamber seeking 
for all people in this country 
chairman i rise in support of hr 
gold medal honor in 1776 to recognize 
his heroic service in the revolutionary war 
may be awarded in any given year 
the medal is in order 
medal was struck in 1776 in paris 
struck in 1776 in paris for america 
the continental army in driving the british 
in the next dozen 
for heroic action in the revolutionary war 
by comparison in the 108th congress 
in the 106th congress 
to recognize moments in history 
in response mr chairman 
reforms were enacted in the 104th congress 
in the last 100 
medals including 20 in the past decade 
note that proposals in the past have 
have been sponsored in about equal numbers 
in my view any 
should be awarded in true bipartisan fashion 
in practice however not 
to join me in maintaining the integrity 
that has happened in the more recent 
it was done in sort of an 
upon an individual in a very special 
trying to do in the legislation 
make that point in the history of 
is very telling in terms of what 
so in terms of the 
you use them in that criteria of 
in fact if anything 
always very confusing in terms of what 
more going on in the country and 
does something extraordinary in science or the 
been honored people in religion people who 
absolutely stood out in their circumstances 
the margins here in terms of what 
of learn techniques in this when we 
be a hero in my mind because 
judgment is four in total in the 
four in total in the course of 
like 45 medals in the first 120 
times that many in the last 10 
i do not in any way belittle 
it at least in the time most 
need both parties in order do this 
or a democrat in his history 
received medals here in the congress of 
in the history of 
of the sponsors in the senate have 
lot of politics in this i guess 
i do rise in opposition to this 
to yield further in a moment it 
i am interested in getting this done 
in fact i would 
can be done in out years 
work it out in advance 
always worked out in advance and agreed 
much more bipartisanship in this process than 
i know about in this congress 
bit of politics in these medals 
not do it in a partisan sense 
think it brings in an element of 
do not have in the legislation 
in fact the chairman 
and our rights in the minority on 
2005 while introduced in the previous congress 
was never debated in committee because no 
in my view we 
in the last several 
have been considered in the house under 
legislation is considered in committee a full 
it is considered in committee 
the house is in full support of 
especially key as in the 108th congress 
first black player in major league baseball 
pearson the leaders in our nation s 
their honorable actions in tandem with others 
in the last congress 
and levi pearson in recognition of their 
nation as pioneers in the effort to 
in previous congresses the 
and nancy reagan in honor of their 
offered an amendment in the previous congress 
world trade center in new york city 
and who perished in that attack on 
that were made in order i am 
was not made in order 
a serious oversight in the base of 
was not passed in the committee on 
have that provision in it 
in listening to the 
to the sponsor in terms of the 
were given out in a haphazard manner 
for its consideration in the committee on 
issued the medal in one provision 
received this medal in the past was 
height tony blair in the last congress 
in the 106th congress 
lies the flaw in this bill 
extraordinary provision made in the appropriations process 
receive this medal in the future if 
getting this medal in the future 
as a nation in size and in 
in size and in stature and that 
we have grown in size both in 
in size both in states from thirteen 
number of people in this country have 
have been awarded in the past decade 
i mentioned before in a willynilly manner 
understand the difficulties in that but i 
incredible incredible events in this country and 
that was accepted in the rules committee 
did not exist in the coin bill 
in terms of bipartisanship 
been very bipartisan in terms of coins 
of the fear in terms of changing 
as a congress in reducing our leverage 
from honoring groups in the form of 
why i stand in opposition to that 
that the bill in its current form 
bills until late in the first year 
recipients then late in the first year 
amendment is needed in the most practical 
in the last congress 
first black player in major league baseball 
pearson the leaders in our nation s 
granted six medals in the 106th congress 
congress and six in the 105th congress 
in the 106th congress 
and in the 105th congress 
in fact the existing 
of individuals who in the opinion of 
do not think in any way disrupts 
limiting the number in this amendment to 
i think in the most recent 
the founding fathers in their wisdom did 
to be voted in favor of 
second amendment made in order under the 
the process currently in place that has 
the two parties in the house have 
in fact this amendment 
with republican support in it than democrats 
than democrats as in the 108th congress 
four and we in the minority may 
we do work in a very bipartisan 
it was done in a very bipartisan 
commemorative coin legislation in 1999 out of 
and balanced way in which we can 
limiting it to in this case this 
medals that we in the minority may 
well find ourselves in a very difficult 
very difficult position in that we may 
the gold medal in that particular year 
it is done in this way 
is the spirit in which i think 
we can work in a bipartisan way 
it is done in a bipartisan way 
not approach this in any other fashion 
is not done in a very quick 
this is done in a bipartisan way 
think we can in the future find 
future find ourselves in a situation where 
creating more politics in this bill 
am trying to in a sense avoid 
to equally participate in this process 
i think that in the past there 
the columbia 107 in the last congress 
the last congress in the middle of 
not taken up in the committee and 
was not successful in getting that award 
individuals are successful in garnering a gold 
through as well in terms of working 
terms of working in a bipartisan way 
democrats are working in a bipartisan way 
to the bill in its current form 
the 109th congress in earnest and we 
a problem that in our view and 
our view and in the view of 
bill today not in the spirit of 
the democratic debate in the house but 
this bill passes in its current form 
from awarding medals in the future to 
responders that perished in the 911 terrorist 
that is bipartisan in nature and that 
process we have in place has allowed 
in the 108th congress 
of this house in 1995 20 gold 
we currently have in place 10 gold 
of gold medals in the past has 
debating this issue in any form 
floor may culminate in the passing of 
colleagues join me in voting in favor 
me in voting in favor of sending 
medals is truly in the interest of 
the public and in the interest of 
what lies ahead in terms of the 
thing to vote in favor of my 
civility and camaraderie in the halls of 
starts reality sets in 
normal legislative business in the 109th congress 
spent a week in a refresher course 
was first introduced in the 108th congress 
on the bill in the 108th congress 
acted on it in this year 
house is considering in the 109th congress 
rule does make in order two amendments 
them being made in order the committee 
failed to make in order a third 
can anyone in this body honestly 
at least me in knowing about them 
integrity of procedure in the house of 
the full committee in this session to 
joy and pleasure in honoring both president 
astronauts and heroes in space 
has represented america in the most honorable 
services has put in place a very 
for his insight in his amendments that 
should be restraint in judgment but i 
who are we in 2005 to predict 
what might happen in 2010 or 2015 
on rules involvement in an open rule 
the bipartisan spirit in which we honor 
crowley were made in order 
this legislation were in place president reagan 
thousands of lives in world war ii 
a commendable job in its oversight 
on the numbers in the last four 
were intimately involved in brown v board 
for equal education in america 
is a misstep in judgment and that 
puzzles me and in fact disturbs me 
that they were in fact heroes and 
of us come in our course of 
to meet people in our districts and 
mr chairman in support of the 
having an opportunity in their wisdom to 
would have been in respect to president 
us to work in a bipartisan manner 
chairman i rise in opposition to the 
passage will result in the preclusion of 
tribute to americans in the most respectful 
central high school in little rock arkansas 
wife nancy reagan in recognition of their 
today i rise in support of hr 
icons and leaders in science 
now find ourselves in a situation of 
by comparison in the first 123 
received the medal in the past were 
would point out in fact that the 
what i found in studying this perhaps 
medal was was in the 106th congress 
did not go in regular order 
me point out in the case of 
do we finish in this area 
quite rarely 45 in 123 years to 
with the change in the commemorative coin 
program that did in fact move the 
had this increase in the gold medal 
that the reforms in the past and 
is now propounding in this bill makes 
from delaware proposes in this legislation 
let me in closing mr chairman 
see a member in the dining room 
delaware was right in raising that bar 
be way back in 1776 
program will be in effect for the 
and not change in the middle of 
would place members in an awkward position 
york is really in many ways contrary 
and the reforms in the commemorative coin 
the reforms in that program have 
programs for issue in any year since 
the law passed in 1996 
one year in 2003 only one 
a natural progression in the reform process 
he did because in fact i do 
close and again in opposition i think 
to put republicandemocrat in the statute 
republican and democrat in the statute i 
certainly not be in the best interests 
speaker i rise in opposition to the 
in the first 123 
a tenfold increase in the next subsequent 
there is bipartisanship in the existing system 
opportunity to weigh in on the importance 
as he did in the commemorative coin 
founding fathers was in this gold medal 
amendment and makes in order only those 
those amendments printed in the committee on

sent to iraq in the first place 
i can not in good conscience vote 
down our troops in a responsible manner 
of my colleagues in very good conscience 
rather in my view to 
the same leadership in the white house 
the guerrilla war in iraq the presence 
we must remain in the current configuration 
the current configuration in iraq because the 
lives by voting in the national elections 
the national elections in january 
troops by arguing in favor of a 
promise of success in an area of 
of our troops in a bill that 
provides for success in this war 
declared mission accomplished in iraq 
and in those two years 
that the war in iraq is far 
troops now serving in iraq including 8 
have been killed in the iraq war 
have been wounded in action many with 
more than one in five iraqi war 
in addition to the 
who are fighting in iraq the dollar 
date 217 billion in american taxpayer dollars 
fund the war in iraq 
in fact today s 
risen 33 cents in just the last 
just 31 percent in the first quarter 
the slowest pace in 2 years and 
38percent pace logged in the final quarter 
of 6104 billion in february 
declared mission accomplished in iraq there is 
still no end in sight 
the first time in our country s 
in the past year 
the outofcontrol rise in our national debt 
and the rise in our debt envisioned 
our debt envisioned in this conference report 
terrible fiscal position in which we now 
in 2001 we had 
95 trillion reversal in our tenyear fiscal 
to work together in a bipartisan fashion 
we can see in this conference report 
alan greenspan mentioned in his recent testimony 
put that figure in perspective projected interest 
in addition to assuming 
weaken our position in the world and 
strongest middle class in history 
trillion both parties in congress need to 
in fact it continues 
the multiple references in the 911 commission 
oncard biometric technology in improving the integrity 
activity we engage in 
ought not engage in military activity that 
we are doing in terms of succeeding 
terms of succeeding in our mission in 
in our mission in iraq 
billions of dollars in reconstruction 
in terms of political 
mission at least in terms of the 
6week training course in human rights which 
they can engage in battle and can 
can show leadership in the face of 
our substantial force in iraq we want 
our enemies who in secretary rumsfeld s 
recruit insurgents greater in number than we 
it would remain in the bill that 
speaker i rise in support of this 
to be success in iraq 
evaluate the situation in iraq and provide 
our longterm presence in iraq will only 
give our enemies in the region a 
that is included in the report will 
part of it in particular 
tried to put in what the people 
what the people in the field asked 
12 people killed in my district and 
is no question in my mind for 
the most important in my estimation is 
and i sat in his office not 
not have confidence in the way the 
to lose confidence in the overall project 
we put language in the bill last 
we have read in the newspaper and 
things we put in this bill they 
problems we have in conference i am 
put 5 million in does not mean 
is no doubt in my mind this 
chairman i rise in opposition to the 
should not be in a supplemental it 
it should be in a regular bill 
amp m money in the national guard 
bases were short in o amp m 
they were short in almost every category 
take a look in the conference to 
mr speaker in regards to what 
we put money in for those kinds 
they are killed in action 
they are killed in action they are 
we put money in to take care 
had 12 killed in my district how 
people that were in the armed forces 
that the people in iraq have what 
lot of equipment in iraq 
put new trucks in that are encapsulated 
not get it in the bill 
could possibly squeeze in 
the industrial leaders in this country the 
this money now in the supplementals to 
see it out in the field 
we go out in the field talk 
to send defense in the right direction 
and those serving in iraq 
are talking about in any meeting the 
the embassy being in the supplemental is 
building an embassy in iraq 
need an embassy in iraq but we 
need an embassy in iraq and why 
we have spent in afghanistan already 
getting some discipline in this body in 
in this body in what we are 
what we did in 1997 was start 
not actual emergencies in a supplemental spending 
supplemental spending bill in my opinion is 
the other things in the supplemental are 
funding the embassy in a supplemental 
the asylum provisions in this bill completely 
but since 911 in fact since the 
most asylumseekers are in jail while resolution 
judged they are in jail 
fear of persecution in order to get 
of the points in the manager s 
amendment were not in the bill before 
amendment to be in order by me 
the bill and in order for it 
this section in my judgment would 
not be passed in its current form 
that might get in the way of 
waive all laws in his sole discretion 
if anybody gets in your way shoot 
a total dictator in contravention of the 
of the constitution in contravention of all 
anybody that gets in the way by 
boiler plate language in bills and here 
of this provision in general this is 
the asylum provisions in this bill make 
are jailed put in custody until a 
while they are in custody 
places the applicant in custody until he 
then be put in jail until they 
pass this bill in its current form 
the new provision in this bill would 
a particular motive in cases of mixed 
which they are in order to prove 
inconsistency or inaccuracy in a prior statement 
not be significant in her culture unlike 
her culture unlike in ours would later 
is mr chairman in the larger sense 
stand with me in voting for the 
chairman no person in our country should 
in order to expedite 
forced to put in 18hourdays without overtime 
without overtime pay in unsafe conditions and 
and be transported in trucks used for 
to investigate profiteering in iraq 
is to proceed in the manner he 
he has proceeded in the amendment he 
of taxpayer funds in iraq 
billion is spent in accordance with the 
and is spent in accordance with good 
is being conducted in such a manner 
to our effort in the country and 
the country and in the region 
something i did in committee i wish 
to the provision in the bill which 
persons who died in iraq and afghanistan 
but were not in iraq or afghanistan 
you are killed in a training accident 
just as much in need as would 
and then died in an accident 
dung hill politics in other words focusing 
a few toes in expanding benefits for 
they almost did in the committee on 
mischaracterized my amendment in committee 
limiting benefits when in fact it expanded 
add 95 million in costs 
provide 95 million in additional benefits to 
were not living in iraq and afghanistan 
gone too far in providing benefits to 
who was killed in a drunken driving 
that this occurred in the line of 
not been killed in iraq and afghanistan 
are classified will in fact be communicated 
article that appeared in the new yorker 
put competing agencies in competition 
everyone s priorities in the cia the 
get the country in trouble in the 
country in trouble in the first place 
what is happening in some of these 
in fact we need 
we have increased in this bill insurance 
in addition to what 
that still exists in the earning power 
spent 284 billion in iraq and afghanistan 
has been spent in afghanistan is certainly 
president first landed in his jumpsuit on 
now been involved in iraq longer than 
we were involved in world war i 
but to participate in cleaning up the 
the entire operation in iraq has been 
the civilian leadership in the pentagon and 
this bill understates in my view the 
the white house in adequately funding homeland 
variety of people in this congress in 
in this congress in order to overcome 
which many experts in the field feel 
be very harmful in terms of people 
efforts to engage in identity theft 
would be found in the authorization committees 
within my rights in offering whatever authorization 
we will see in the coming months 
to extend debate in this chamber 
the senate bill in 3 areas 
000 called for in the senate bill 
250 called for in the senate bill 
the levels contained in the senate bill 
been used successfully in a test in 
in a test in arizona to assist

this as was in the senate bill 
than 500 agents in arizona but those 
mr speaker in this form i 
last year in the fiscal year 
and they come in clusters from mexico 
when this happens in the meantime the 
going to come in

war on terror in afghanistan and iraq 
have been relentless in talking to so 
for his work in getting negotiators to 
with only 210 in his budget today 
through the loopholes in our border security 
fight and die in iraq and afghanistan 
and letting terrorists in our back door 
they head elsewhere in the us the 
cells already operating in the united states 
socalled security provisions in this bill mainly 
believes so greatly in freedom and the 
war we fund in this bill 
one step further in creating a national 
is a start in putting our money 
funding is included in the fiscal year 
there are people in this world who 
the us embassy in moscow some years 
did not include in this bill namely 
five months remaining in fiscal 2005 the 
to include funds in this bill or 
more officers included in the senate bill 
will be wasted in the continuing financing 
of the war in iraq 
the war in iraq is an

of security here in the homeland

they demonstrated that in the election in 
in the election in which they went 
works the same in any country that 
of the war in iraq 
speaker i rise in support of the

our papers because in this bill there 
in many ways i 
so i rise in strong objection to 
chairman i rise in strong opposition to

in essence in the eyes of 
that states participate in the drivers license

by whoever is in power at the 
including such information in the database as

proposed plaintiff classes in the prior case 
provision was included in the bill because 
really class actions in disguise 
they often result in the same abuses 
in fact sometimes the 
provision would work in tandem suppose 200 
a mass action in mississippi against a 
local occurrence exception in the provision 
which claims would in the mass action 
federal judge keep in federal court and 
in this regard i 
they are seeking in the complaint so 
they can stay in state court 
to turn around in a month and 
that this provision in no way is 
apply supplemental jurisdiction in the mass action 
would apply only in a situation where 
spill to remain in state court if 
the alleged injuries in such a case 
of the plaintiffs in a particular case 
an amended complaint in state court that 
for example changes in the amount of 
lawsuit from proceeding in a court of 
of competent jurisdiction in the united states

end up cashing in on a big 
bonanza to investors in altria the stock 
claim the time in opposition 
speaker i rise in opposition to the 
large bipartisan majorities in the other body 
left with change in their pockets if 
cases to be in federal court 
general to be in state court 
former will be in no way affected 
the pryor amendment in the other body 
the entire nation in large interstate cases 
labor law violations in state court despite 
class action settlements in recent years have 
years have been in the federal courts 
was also offered in the other body 
to the bill in the last congress 
amendment was defeated in this house by 
on senate amendments in the other body 
and defeated either in this house or 
substitute could not in any way be 
speaker the amendment in the nature of 
was rejected either in this house or 
the other body in this congress or 
congress is incorporated in this amendment 
the issue in this bill is 
is that judges in small outoftheway counties 
speaker i rise in support of s 
large national lawsuits in specific jurisdictions with 
interstate class actions in state courts mostly 
state courts mostly in what are known 
courts in these jurisdictions are 
routinely approve settlements in which attorneys receive 
this results in more and more 
to be heard in federal courts closing 
a local business in a nationwide liability 
member is small in comparison and banning 
and restores confidence in america s judicial 
of the lawsuits in which plaintiffs walk 
millions of dollars in fees 
the worst problems in class actions today 
not fixing inequities in our judicial system 
becomes law apparently in america today we 
considered similar legislation in 1999 2002 and 
subject but because in my judgment the 
about the proceedings in our courts 
is reluctant because in several ways this 
and in several other ways 
is less bad in my opinion it 
still concerned that in too many cases 
it be heard in state court because 
speaker i rise in opposition to s 
to be improvements in this bill from 
or undefined terms in this bill clogging 
also and worse in my judgment no 
to address here in the time that 
for this upheaval in our justice system 
of the judges in the system 
in some of our 
solve every problem in our society 
like to step in to take a 
there is nothing in this bill that 
is not anything in the bill actually 
in those cases those 
system actually worked in those cases 
ready to vote in favor of an 
some of them in this legislation which 
men and women in a community then 
that the system in those cases worked 
unwilling to engage in a debate on 
in every one of 
i rise today in strong opposition to 
the major problems in this legislation 
with nothing controversial in it 
class actions cases in state courts 
their rightful day in court at all 
to join me in opposing one of 
sham abusive cases in lawsuitfriendly counties 
after being named in 23 classaction lawsuits 
to provide consumers in the lawsuit with 
coupons and attorneys in this case received 
33 cents each in a settlement with 
stamp while attorneys in the case walked 
action settlement notices in our mail boxes 
class action lawsuits in this country 
have our priorities in the wrong place 
the wealthiest americans in this country 
never seen before in this country 
man and woman in this country 
alone the surplus in social security contributions 
169 billion coming in this year for

some 46 percent in benefit cuts if 
time for us in our budget documents

worked in one in helping low income 
to work hard in all of their 
reconciliation instructions found in this resolution are

are also serving in the very important 
a key role in fashioning this work 
be considered here in the house 
which is unusual in that as members 
when democrats were in the majority here 
majority here republicans in the majority we 
only made substitutes in order 
chosen to make in order an amendment 
proceeded with questions in the committee on 
i know in the eyes of 
it is counterintuitive in a sense that 
mentioned this yesterday in the committee on 
of the war in iraq with which 
a dramatic improvement in the budget and 
not the war in iraq as painful 
that we saw in early 2001 of 
not be reining in federal spending 
with responsibly reining in federal spending it 
had the debates in 2001 and then 
2001 and then in 2002 and 2003 
that reduction in the anticipated level 
reducing rates is in fact the best 
he argued this in the early part 
on capital gains in the early 1960s 
which will rein in the kind of 
we have seen in the past and 
easy to engage in regardless of political 
we are reining in that growth in 
in that growth in federal spending and 
last night in a speech the 
to have confidence in the social security 
we know in 13 very short 
when they were in the majority put 
what would be in private accounts 
a mammoth cut in benefits under social 
what was left in their private accounts 
what we believe in 
our priorities are in the right place 
expense of people in need 
the very wealthy in this country 
trillions of dollars in debt and decrease 
trillions of dollars in transition costs required 
to put it in a budget 
if you believe in privatizing social security 
willing to work in a bipartisan way 
destroy social security in the name of 
prepared to work in a bipartisan way 
about the increase in money for no 
cut 270 million in spending from section 
gentleman that only in washington would one 
cut a reduction in the rate of 
rate of increase in spending 
are specific directions in this budget that 
in fact it is 
amendment be printed in the record immediately 
want to discuss in the course of 
one in six north dakotans 
private accounts resulting in either massive additional 
that is coming in to pay benefits 
explaining to do in my opinion for 
security but not in ways that would 
stood so strongly in preserving surplus dollars 
a great day in our great nation 
this rule makes in order four amendments 
which are printed in the committee on 
the amendments printed in the report except 
of the amendment in the nature of 
to offer amendments in the house to 
before my time in this body the 
it allows us in a time of 
our government acts in a fiscally responsible 
nation remains strong in the face of 
counter unconventional threats in the future 
us economy is in a sustained expansion 
has been due in large part to 
budget that sets in motion a glidepath 
cut the deficit in half both in 
in half both in dollars and as 
gross domestic product in 5 years 
and mandatory spending in an effort to 
for a reduction in total nondefense nonhomeland 
ways and means in regard to the 
provision that originated in the committee on 
people my age in social security the 
that are embodied in our budget blueprint 
the second day in a row now 
care 189 billion in fiscal year 2000 
education numbers up in double digits 
slowing the growth in mandatory and discretionary 
those tough decisions in ways that have 
per pupil expenditure in 1994 and 1995 
not a conscience in the congress prior 
have been embodied in our budgets and 
and are embodied in this budget 
i will engage in a bit of 
are are almost in complete denial about 
are vast differences in the approach to 
bold brave exception in the gentleman from 
be a problem in either 2040 or 
have developed expertise in their areas to 
jurisdiction those savings in a variety of 
to are reductions in the rate of 
rate of growth in those programs with 
in fact it is 
to do often in this process but 
about priorities priorities in government priorities in 
in government priorities in households priorities in 
in households priorities in our individual lives 
to invest heavily in our nation s 
a percent reduction in nonsecurity discretionary spending 
to finding savings in our government such 
cut the deficit in half in 5 
deficit in half in 5 years so 
has been said in the context of 
of the manner in which we have 
insolvency point occurring in 2042 but its 
be truly visionary in the great ways 
continuing to invest in research and cures 
continues to invest in people and continues 
to find opportunity in a growing expanding 
continue to invest in their businesses to 
have more money in their own pocket 
any other provision in this resolution immediately 
i rise in opposition to the 
the 50 billion in because it is 
would put something in there to help 
by the house in this budget 
so in support of the 
are saying here in defeating the rule 
a better deal in whatever emerges as 
the table and in a bipartisan way 
and put incentives in the tax system 
veterans that suffered in the war that 
for 60 cities in 60 days will

to help us in resolving this problem 
the american people in black and white

that we should in fact be helping 
afford 106 billion in tax cuts for 
we give away in this budget s 
or an increase in the minimum wage 
get its priorities in order 
in 5 short years 
what is included in this budget is 
in a disingenuous attempt 
of the war in iraq spending only 
put 50 billion in there would have 
it at all in his budget 
while not detailed in this budget would 
in order to make 
of social security in its tracks

social security act in 1935 
please hang it in your office as

about their belief in social security and 
and their faith in that program and 
effective housing programs in this country

chairman i rise in opposition to this 
has been made in support of the 
incentives to drill in the central and 
the beaches in florida are a 
through deepwater drilling in the central and 
losing critical expertise in aeronautics research and 
chairman i rise in strong opposition to 
in that sense it 
for 18 trillion in tax cuts primarily 
rescue those living in poverty 
to the shortfall in social security this 
its growth in recent years is 
of its success in providing care for 
year the governor in my state of 
the president succeeds in cutting medicaid there 
the first time in my capacity as 
as we worked in full committee to 
with limited resources in this bill 
nearly 400 farms in my district ranging 
in fact the first 
first experiment station in the united states 
does cuttingedge research in new haven 
food supply something in which every american 
in addition urban areas 
predicted an increase in the use of 
of food stamps in 2006 
maintain current participation in the commodity supplemental 
are funded is in my opinion among 
think of it in those terms 
unfortunately in some of these 
bill makes headway in reversing cuts made 
to longterm deficiencies in rural infrastructure 
most important agencies in our entire government 
vioxx to hearings in which its drug 
that i offered in subcommittee to withhold 
in 2001 the drug 
origin labeling system in place 
only benefits those in dire need around 
were not included in the bill 
and nursery crops in this bill and 
the farmerconsumer relationship in many areas of 
to adequately invest in these programs will 
can take pride in the progress we 
we have made in significantly improving the 
of crises that in fact have been 
of our committee in not coming forward 
at directtoconsumer advertising in order to try 
should have made in order the amendments 
congress for authority in order to be 
the labeling that in fact ultimately protects 
from us authority in order to do 
develop some spine in order to be 
other accounts funded in the bill 
address several areas in the bill that 
consumers in this country need 
origin labeling provision in this bill 
bill even more in just a few 
drug administration that in fact we will 
would need changing in order to protect 
chairman i rise in support of this 
i think that in connecticut for instance 
back contaminated product in the event of 
in my opening comments 
of measures and in this case we 
allow legislation that in fact meets the 
made this amendment in order because it 
is not made in order then we 
committee and nothing in this amendment as 
surely in a country that 
125 medical schools in the united states 
not talking about in perpetuity 
am i right in my assessment of 
with the funding in this conference report 
doubling our investment in medical research 
professions are cut in half 
fails to invest in any of the 
congress spending trillions in tax cuts for 
resources to invest in things that impact 
makes a difference in their lives and 
been bipartisan support in the past because 
defeated this bill in november it cut 
additional 14 billion in cuts that the 
for elimination especially in the area of 
the richest country in the world 
as i said in november ask any 
makes a difference in their lives and 
their lives and in their family s 
budget resolution is in fact a modest 
take priority and in turn we must 
those tax dollars in the first place 
bust a hole in the deficit 
the deficit came in 109 billion smaller 
so in short mr chairman 
economic data coming in every month speaks 
the 671 billion in additional spending that 
raising 3924 billion in new taxes as 
have included me in the process of 
of the difference in the world in 
in the world in our national parks 
for including them in the bill and 
of uncontrollable costs in future budget submittals 
million increase contained in the budget will 
very healthy increases in the park service 
that i have in this bill is 
is the reduction in spending for clean 
the proposed funding in 2006 to the 
to the level in 2004 there is 
nearly 500 million in just 2 years 
not be retreating in this fashion from 
the commitment made in 2000 to increase 
and the neh in that this bill 
of my colleagues in support of an 
2004 and 2005 in emergency funding to 
that has occurred in past years when 
nonemergency spending level in fiscal year 2005 
than average threats in several areas of 
of the cuts in the budget to 
for their part in helping to put 
that we are in and i appreciate 
the bipartisan spirit in which this bill 
california chairman lewis in trying to help 
offset by reductions in various accounts 
a healthy majority in the house agrees 
grants is modest in size but it 
catalyst to draw in private contributions 
in fact we now 
in 1996 congress reduced 
chairman i rise in reluctant opposition to 
that pilt receives in this bill compared 
in a healthier budget 
230 million contained in this bill 
yes i am in opposition 
and i rise in opposition to this 
had no hearings in the committee about 
have to bring in the parties and 
the first time in the full committee 
the priorities in this budget are 
honestly look them in the eye and 
every child in america knows that 
fourth credit increase in four years to 
to be offset in other areas of 
and end up in this illfated fiscal 
billions of dollars in tax givebacks from 
practice we used in the 1990 s 
have been successful in our partnership with 
however in their spending schemes 
including the elderly in nursing homes individuals 
more lost jobs in our communities 
have acknowledged that in fy2003 there was 
a mouthful but in a little town 
in mcallen texas in 
in mcallen texas in austin texas it 
chance to share in rehabilitated housing some 
in many of these 
going to assist in a variety of 
the other challenges in this budget it 
like the folks in freer texas only 
one we have in office today that 
the highest level in american history and 
to poor people in freer texas to 
of shared sacrifice in time of war 
makes 1 million in dividend income this 
14 billion cut in veterans programs over 
american family value in those priorities 
back from iraq in fact a soldier 
for health care in our va hospitals 
so in effect every member 
a real cut in health care services 
reject the slap in the face of 
coddling the wealthiest in our society who 
this unfair slap in the face to 
fact number three in this same budget 
dollars a year in dividend income will 
it is unconscionable in its treatment of 
a substantial cut in funding and thus 
would unavoidably result in a reduction of 
in addition we understand 
killed every day in iraq 
increases and inflation in the health care 
medical care continues in the 109th congress 
total funding needed in va medical care 
these amendments are in the best interest 
in fact the dav 
wounded every day in iraq 
it locks in massive deficits for 
bury your children in a sea of 
deficits and underinvestment in education research and 
in my opinion this 
major religious faith in our society 
of this bill in their veterans day 
in my book that 
help troubled youth in my hometown in 
in my hometown in texas this budget 
sacrifice so those in the top onetenth 
percent of income in america can keep 
the largest deficits in american history for 
the third year in a row 
largest federal deficits in american history 
and under investing in education and health 
can be done in a positive way 
and businesses here in america 
that we have in my area in 
in my area in michigan not directly 
michigan not directly in my district but 
does not live in the area in 
in the area in which it is 
have land placed in trust for it 
trust for it in a community that 
but in fact it is 
impact on areas in my district and 
and this results in a good deal 
have land placed in trust and they 
is somebody new in town who is 
in that sense i 
am not rising in support of the 
have been involved in discussions with the 
deal with it in an appropriations bill 
chairman i rise in opposition to the 
budget resolution and in support of the 
in the last 3 
tax cuts resulting in the three largest 
three largest deficits in history all the 
will be forever in your debt 
are honestly reflected in this resolution 
facing rises costs in health care and 
approach to investing in america s future 
to 24 trillion in additional debt three 
the largest deficits in the history of 
health care investments in america cutting college 
the conference and in the dark of 
companies will come in and do their 
for reimportation and in the dark of 
watch what happens in the dark of 
going to make in the next hour 
this in my view is 
proposed remedy contained in this budget resolution 
need to move in the right direction 
more evident than in my district but 
we have been in the throes of 
run a surplus in wartime 
economy that occurred in the wake of 
the us dollar in global markets and 
strengthen investor confidence in the renascent economy 
what it does in a nutshell is 
cuts the deficit in half over a 
source of growth in the economy 
budget resolution does in a sound responsible 
have further remarks in support of this 
the forward movement in the economy growing 
to be made in response to the 
have been successful in helping the us 
with strong growth in the gross domestic 
strongest annual performance in 5 years one

the great depression in describing recent economic 
increase government intervention in the economy 
economic growth in europe is generally 
the unemployment rate in europe is much 
much higher than in the us in 
in the us in january of 2005 
moving the economy in the right direction 
prepared to put in place fiscal policies 
grow the economy in the right direction 
look at this in a purely static 
than it was in the early 1990s 
again we propose in our budget resolution 
cut the deficits in half relative to 
not enough room in this budget to 
budget put lays in place creates the 
we can put in place reforms that 
nothing in this budget resolution 
supposed monolithic government in the congress that 
the last election in which the senate 
the gridlock implicit in the rules that 
other side were in the majority we 
spend money on in the federal budget 
and put it in place so that 
the proposed reductions in medicaid under this 
14 20 billion in cuts from the 
at a record in our nation s 
in many states medicaid 
in california our medicaid 
with a dollar in state funding

many people in this chamber have 
the fourth time in the history of

and growing obligations in the social security 
to control spending in the united states 
have the mechanisms in place to ensure 
whereas in the chairman s 
the reconciliation savings in the nussle budget 
draw a line in the sand and 
than it has in the past 
decisions that we in congress can not 
draw a line in the sand and 
on budget enforcement in this congress 
we are drowning in a sea of 
the best job in a competitive market 
study committee believes in unlimited opportunity 
we have seen in quite some time 
with the equation in the deficit 
i was in jacksonville texas a 
a small town in my district not 
have been created in america five people 
that are paying in taxes as opposed 
was not bringing in new revenues to 
in understanding that it 
we have here in washington today and 
in other words the 
so they are in complete control of 
how we take in money and how 
had some increase in jobs 
government payrolls in fact have expanded 
because our colleagues in the republican party 
nearly 9 trillion in negative results 
in january for example 
was 583 billion in trade deficit just 
not showing up in their wages 
economic policies reflected in this and the 
deeper and deeper in debt to other

the interior subcommittee in a colloquy dealing 
with some language in the committee report 
hudson river area in new york state 
us who live in the region would 
the report language in no way is 
slated to begin in the summer of

this report will in no way delay 
but nevertheless in spite of that 
is the way in which the food 
administration is treated in this legislation and 
that it needs in order to protect 
of prescription drugs in ways that are 
youngsters teenagers people in their early 20s 
been to engender in them a deep 
of depression which in many cases has 
and i later in the debate on 
the american people in material and very 
of american citizens in the kind of 
health and death in large numbers of 
the pharmaceutical companies in the way that 
for example in the case of 
administration was not in a position to 
had to engage in an educational program 
the major deficiencies in this legislation that 
amendments later on in the debate and 
than other drugs in its class to 
enough data back in 2003 it first 
every week week in and week out 
years ago and in 2002 the agency 
thousands of lives in all probability 
have been made in order by the 
make this amendment in order 
across this country in dire jeopardy 
deal with them in an effective way 
by this congress in order to ensure 
used by people in a way that 
the ocular proof in front of us 
careful review and in addition to that 
young people people in their twenties began 
induced suicidal potential in those people and 
took their lives in direct relationship to 
clear strong case in point 
thousands of people in this country were 
by simply saying in a technical way 
you are living in a fantasy world 
to believe that in a country with 
and unbiased and in the interest of 
most tumultuous years in the fda s 
has been lost in the fda s 
against this amendment in a word incredible 
from the entities in our country in 
in our country in our economy that 
125 medical schools in this country 
who are conflicted in their interests who 
who are conflicted in their interests with 
who is conflicted in their interests 
is being regulated in the case of

that 111 million in state and local 
unfortunately in recent years funding 
in fact this program 
was zeroed out in the mid1990s 
in 1999 i joined 
joined representative mcgovern in restoring funding for 
to 91 million in fiscal year 2005 
that many programs in this bill receive 
a significant reduction in funding but i 
renewal projects costly in these regions 
quality of life in their communities 
and not impaired in value although the 
chairman i rise in support of the 
i rise today in strong support of 
to enhance communities in every state and 
in 2004 the challenge 
towns and cities in 99 of congressional 
additional funding contained in this amendment would 
power economic development in regions that are 
by this increase in funding help defend 
be economically competitive in the future 
the smallest increase in eight years 
to states which in turn make grants

for sweeping cuts in mandatory and nondefense 
perhaps in an effort to 
the president does in his budget so 
almost 69 billion in cuts to mandatory 
find 20 billion in savings over five 
the republican budget in fact neither adequately 
376 billion deficit in fy 2006 but 
in calculating the deficit 
republicans use surpluses in the social security

the most competitive in the world this 
the federal investment in education below current 
the first time in a decade 
we do nothing in this bill to 
in my state and 
i am sure in the chairman s 
but in my state costs 
the fourth year in a row that 
inappropriate funding levels in this conference report 
underfunding of priorities in this nation are 
funding levels contained in this conference report 
in fact this budget 
by the public in our history 
does not change in one way shape 
by the public in fact it has 
on november 17 in a bipartisan way 
for it today in my opinion 
i think investment in our future 
than 94 billion in additional tax cuts 
to the wealthiest in america 
doubles the cuts in this bill to 
the funding levels in this bill because 
have put them in a position where 
which put them in the straits they 
for draconian cuts in april and proclaim 
inappropriate funding levels in this conference report 
irresponsible fiscal policies in the history of

story we were in the committee on

did not succeed in supporting veterans those 
for leading us in this direction and 
of 44 billion in cuts because we

in addition the budget 
in fact mr chairman 
helped to reinvest in our local communities 
we believe in investing in america 
believe in investing in america

will like that in your pocket and 
your pocket and in your savings account 
closes the disparities in america s communities 
the republican leadership in congress will pay 
it demonstrates in writing that under 
is particularly strong in its support of 
to close disparities in our society 
and the majority in this congress promised 
in fact the president 
cbc alternative budget in stark contrast provides 
in addition the cbc 
disparities often witnessed in higher education 
in that regard the 
alternative invests heavily in this vital sector

the republicans in this house voted 
400 million cut in epa programs to 
40 percent cut in the clean water 
by 40 percent in this bill 
look at it in a broader context 
203 million people in this country 
108 million cars in america 
in the face of 
34 percent reduction in the funding for 
in the teeth of 
a slight increase in the national parks 
parks budget but in fact there are 
still 720 positions in the national park

5 billion backlog in maintenance for the 
the first time in the 36 years 
certain minimal actions in the environmental area 
environmental area especially in the area of 
a good game in terms of cleaning 
s parade but in a sense i 
in the first years 
the republicans were in control they wound 
very large cut in the arts program 
offered an amendment in the appropriations committee 
exercised its power in the rules committee 
exact same amendment in order with one 
mark 100 million in real terms after 
we wound up in conference with the 
stick to it in conference so that 
found to be in some cases a 
bill is inadequate in a number of 
probably more demand in my district for 
any other program in the federal budget 
when one lives in a community in 
in a community in which more than 
split the time in opposition to the

reconciliation bill and in this bill is 
most vulnerable people in this society 
of our responsibilities in meeting the growing 
i have priorities in this bill that 
say is not in any way designed 
shortchanging this country in terms of the 
should be making in america s working 
reason we are in this fix is 
the majority just in the last week 
almost 70 billion in tax cuts and 
percent of people in this country people 
amount of money in hopes of picking 
of an improvement in rural health care 
look at it in conjunction with the 
that means in the end this 
less for programs in this bill than 
in addition to that 
which will result in women in this 
result in women in this country over 
24 billion less in child support money 
your full entitlement in your first check 
2 months entitlement in that check the 
and poor families in this country by 
15 billion cut in resources provided over 
this time around in sort of scroogenomics 
the wealthiest people in this country

and the majority in this bill eliminates 
make the investments in health research in 
in health research in education in worker

the average family in this country what 
what they need in order to be

we have had in terms of its 
wonderful institution back in 1989 to show 
spending 513 billion in 1994 and we 
i was in my office watching 
i guess only in this institution is 
a little restraint in the amount that 
we are spending in addition to what 
we have spent in the past considered 
of the people in my district believe 
response we got in committee time and 
calculate the increase in taxes they suggested 
for any member in the house to 
even were effective in citing a quotation 
of the town in which i was 
and in response to that 
what we do in our daily lives

of my colleagues in this body can 
the line and in many cases borne 
out to veterans in my own district 
disregards the facts in favor of what 
point out that in the chart that 
total veterans spending in the 2006 budget 
these increases in this budget carry 
has been reflected in veterans spending since 
a democratic majority in this body and 
bush was elected in making sure that 
party the leadership in this congress who 
of the veterans in this united states 
control of congress in 1995 we have 
made tremendous strides in improving benefits for 
with new strides in technology reaching out 
country and served in harm s way 
for medical care in 1996 and 1999 
in the end this 
with the veterans in this congress who 
of ash trees in need of more 
continue to run in to the obstacle 
meant to suggest in strong terms that 
much needed here in washington dc 
our priorities here in washington dc like 
way to rein in government spending and 
compliment our chairman in that regard 
would further rein in government growth and 
budget is rein in government spending and 
all those notions in mind as we 
so many needs in this country that 
totals 419 billion in defense spending and 
of 23 percent in nonmilitary appropriated accounts 
showing our increase in veterans programs and 
we have increased in veterans programs 
a rapid increase in veterans spending especially 
veterans programs appropriately in this congress 
is a move in the right direction 
the rapid rise in veterans spending 
are finding savings in those programs that 
big dogs eat in this house 
the rapid increase in veterans spending per 
we are doing in health research as 
pressing medical issues in our country

make that decision in a manner that 
in reading the record 
state of florida in its wisdom provided 
as we move in this debate

in fact it does 
not even belong in the courts

tragedies people suffering in anguish political pawns 
that keep us in power 
able to live in a dignified safe 
authority to intervene in these very personal

my life changed in an instant and 
what we do in this chamber tonight 
we have done in defending our nation 
defending our nation in doing the things 
a federal judge in the middle of

always denounce right in the middle of 
to be trusted in electing their judges 
only this case in the federal courts 
ignore the evidence in the florida courts 
ignore the procedures in the florida courts 
ignore the testimony in the florida courts 
such a thing in the history of

of some orators in this chamber that 
by the court in his report to 
for his debates in the presidential debates 
the presidential debates in 1980 said on 
are given effect in our courts and 
our courts and in our hospitals every 
given due process in state court but 
process the difference in this bill is 
everything that happened in state court as

to join us in this fight by 
school of law in the catholic university 
be brought up in the house today 
passed earlier today in my capacity as 
capacity as cocounsel in the federal litigation 
and your colleagues in both the house 
that the situation in which the members 
a fair trial in the florida courts 
first incapacitated person in the history of 
have been involved in a substituted judgment 
is terri actually in a persistent vegetative 
s life hang in the balance so 
what to do in such a case 
by florida courts in terri s case 
was a situation in which terri herself

in a case in which her life 
her life hangs in the balance 
the only persons in the state of 
fact finding process in to question 
standards set out in both federal and 
right to selfdetermination in healthcare decisionmaking 
finality is essential in any case where 
an essential step in protecting her right 
we have argued in federal court that 
her continued custody in the guardianship violates 
can take place in only two ways 
understand that people in terri s situation 
not a person in custody entitled to 
the legislation proposed in the senate 
parents to argue in court on terri 
should we prevail in our claim that 
cases urge caution in framing private legislation

we have witnessed in the area of 
in 1997 thengovernor bush 
an effort in the texas legislature 
and ongoing programs in texas hospitals denying 
that finally resulted in the bill that 
not my desire in the beginning and 
everybody who is in an incapacitated state 
was a move in the other body

hr 1332 passed in the other body

in florida they have 
so in florida an animal

ordinary review process in the supreme court 
will probably die in the interim 
of her case in the lower federal

the mtbe provisions in this bill 
in this case hr 
in other words it 
it is found in 1 861 different 
about 2 billion in the lust fund 
to put mtbe in gasoline by the 
no mtbe mandate in that law

in the past when 
that were not in violation of the 
the speaker in his office looked 
the 108th congress in this regard and 
have found ourselves in this position particularly 
sort of agreement in how we get

that both sides in the old rules

cleanup of mtbe in south lake tahoe

their hard work in crafting a bill 
a significant investment in nuclear energy technology

been a leader in advancing fusion so 
first power produced in a laboratory from 
tough policy decisions in this bill 
for yucca mountain in anticipation of a

our federal investment in the new yorknew 
the third largest in the united states 
therefore i rise in support of the

many beneficial provisions in this bill such 
number of provisions in the bill such 
homeowners and manufacturers in our district are

of those living in proximity to petrochemical 
the first time in my 12 years 
my 12 years in congress 
have to produce in our own country 
oil reserves are in the middle east 
we allow production in anwr we will 
caribou will be in anwr just like 
like they are in prudhoe bay 
i reluctantly rise in opposition because the 
probably more refineries in the district i 
than anyone else in the country and 
are minority jobs in our district 
what is happening in our country 
keep those jobs in our country instead 
with at least in the committee on 
maybe not specifically in the clean air 
like i have in houston we have 
a reformulated gas in our gas to 
whatever we have in our gas tanks 
epa informed congress in 1990 that a 
in fact it was 
by the epa in 1979 to comply 
federal gasoline mandate in reducing lead 
has this provision in here is because 
mandated reformulated gas in certain areas including 
trouble with mtbe in groundwater or surface 
pollution at least in the houston area 
of it particularly in the houston area 
a case in point the city 
for its trouble in suing over mtbe 
the remarks earlier in the clean air 
probably the most in use because it 
the most efficient in reformulated gasoline 
record not only in our own country 
country but worldwide in liquefied natural gas 
in houston we are 
cool our homes in the summer 
very important role in this process 
what they have in interstate natural gas

again this year in this bill 
in part this is 
the first time in years we received 
a budget request in which many congressional 
the house passed in fiscal year 2005 
as we have in previous years 
harsh but fair in how we dealt 
done a lot in our bill to 
a big plume in all of this 
problem with is in the continuingcontract area 
inhibit our ability in future years to

need longer visions in these programs so 
end up with in the waterways in 
in the waterways in the future and 
s plans are in the future 
for yucca mountain in fiscal year 2006 
by the delays in getting the repository

the old warheads in preparation for a 
a significant increase in dismantlement rates to 
frankly in the long run 
these coming changes in the size and 
unexpended prioryear balances in that project caused 
in my opinion this 
this bill forward in such an expeditious

harsh but fair in how we dealt 
the allocations provided in annual appropriations 
in some cases the 
received no appropriation in fiscal year 2005

see the number in the window for 
what is printed in the window 
you had something in your car that 
a real difference in our fuel use 
had a system in your car that 
chairman i rise in opposition to the 
having served in this body for 
understand the difficulties in balancing competing interests 
some good points in this bill 
does authorize increases in research on efficiency 
and renewable energy in future years 
instead of investing in cleaner long term 
future energy needs in order to provide 
used to invest in our future by 
serious energy problem in this country 
that is stuck in the past that 
a little deeper in a few more 
that language included in this bill will

the army corps in this bill will 
complete such projects in the future and 
such unpleasant situations in the future 
an important step in reforming this agency 
research and development in the areas of 
on several programs in particular such as 
provisions are included in a product that 
drilling in the arctic national 
and in contrast the bill 
put a strategy in place that will 
that is stuck in the past 
in light of the 
appropriations committees somewhat in limbo as it 
to my friend in terms of what 
adopt a budget in light of the 
up bills sometime in midmay 
a 45minute commute in traffic and a 
in addition to that 
fashion a bill in a bipartisan way 
the ethics process in the house is 
so far both in committee and on 
restore public confidence in the ethics process 
for this house in coming together and 
we had that in place as the 
changed we believe in a partisan fashion 
some years ago in adopting the livingstoncardin 
in the alternative of 
institution not mired in ethical questions of 
we might proceed in either direction or 
party to join in the disposition of 
was not necessary in order to protect 
i know of in the ethics rules 
and apart perhaps in the rules package 
but agreed to in a bipartisan fashion 
to stop investigations in their tracks 
have done however in changing the rules 
which were adopted in a bipartisan fashion 
they would then in turn submit to 
have a disagreement in the perceptions as 
that resolving this in a way that 
it would be in the best interest 
resolve these matters in a bipartisan way 
livingstoncardin commission or in the alternative to 
the ethics component in the rules package 
it was reached in a bipartisan fashion 
was not reached in a bipartisan fashion 
when we were in charge and your 
was made not in a partisan sense 
would hope that in the coming days 
could move towards in a bipartisan fashion 
members were involved in this policy and 
director recently stated in a letter to 
in fact at a 
the tax incentives in this bill or 
the resources allotted in this bill 
other energy industries in tax breaks direct 
that that be in there and the 
jurassic park bill in that it is 
of dinosaurs and in a sense by 
if you drill in mt 
technology being developed in the late 1800s 
the late 1800s in 2005 
here rather than in japan 
the most profitable in american history one 
8 billion profit in the third quarter 
is going on in this bill 
most pristine areas in america 
you see starting in 1975 it went 
has dreamed up in their garage somewhere 
as we were in the 1980s on 
i would just in support of this 
our fuel efficiency in 1975 that when 
than it was in 1985 
we were successful in driving safe efficient 
can do it in america 
so by cutting in half the royalty 
quite high probably in the neighborhood of 
passed last year in the energy bill 
wind energy thankfully in this great land 
i know in many places we 
in washington state we 
largest wind farm in the north american 
have several projects in washington state in 
in washington state in fact on public 
on public land in washington state we 
has been reduced in price this decade 
to an amendment in the resources committee 
one small step in that direction 
and other renewables in 2025 
is not pie in the sky it 
those jobs here in america eventually have 
he handled this in committee in giving 
this in committee in giving both sides 
in recent years we 
people who live in a community for 
those days are in the past 
in 2002 the senate 
and are alarming in their prescience 
owners can compete in a fair market 
been conducted almost in a vacuum without 
every street corner in america 
i rise today in support of mr 
have been constructed in recent years and 
what this bill in its present form 
natural gas facilities in any location where 
in fact these concerns 
to be elevated in importance 
the many americans in predicaments like my 
with any legislation in regards to liquid 
discussing later on in the day that 
my standing today in general debate and 
farmers and ranchers in texas and all 
such an increase in gasoline prices why 
a getyou time in america 
i want jobs in my community 
in fact i had 
on the deposits in texas and louisiana 
more domestic drilling in a safe and 
in some sense yes 
much needed advances in energy efficiency renewable 
and demand balance in the global crude 
demand for oil in china and india 
a major role in driving up oil 
in addition the situation 
addition the situation in iraq has not 
be no end in sight to this 
administration eia prices in 2005 are projected 
235 per gallon in may 
as in 2004 the primary 
in the united states 
states additional changes in gasoline specifications and 
my constituents back in texas and for 
high gasoline prices in the united states 
united states and in collaboration with the 
of the interior in consultation with other 
as those engaged in renewable energy exploration 
touch or use in our daytoday lives 
our society is in the midst of 
of fossil fuel in not infinite but 
fuel sources are in the forms of 
the 47 billion in funding provided to 
very serious issue in my district 
funding for nonproliferation in nuclear weapons 
include more dollars in this area i 
to our port in houston a very 
are extremely efficient in job creation and 
the 47 billion in funding provided to 
very serious issue in my district and 
funding for nonproliferation in nuclear weapons 
include more dollars in this area i 
the administration but in general it seems 
are extremely efficient in job creation 
the nation and in my district which 
we march on in war and talk 
talk about peace in the middle east 
our own neighbors in cuba but ask 
but ask people in the occupied territories 
occupied territories or in korea or in 
in korea or in south asia to 
die from hivaids in africa 
box we are in i believe our 
am very disappointed in the support for 
is much opposition in nevada and the 
in a desire to 
for their efforts in the right direction 
the right direction in north texas but 
would give polluters in dirtyair areas extra 
needed antipollution measures in communities throughout this 
were not made in order 
over here live in and i live 
and i live in 
and i rise in strong support of 
the us consumes in a single year 
and subarctic ecosystems in north america 
damaged by drilling in the anwr make 
can be done in the refuge using 
did not melt in summer months the 
not enough water in the refuge to 
necessary to drill in the anwr refuge 
the refuge and in fact there is 
one oil field in alaska s north 
in fact the federal 
and others are in the process of 
million undeveloped acres in this region 
the levels seen in europe today just 
place on exploration in a lowyield area 
chairman i rise in opposition to this 
specifically was litigated in 1985 in the 
litigated in 1985 in the dc 
and the adjustment in information that the 
toward energy independence in the following way 
interior which has in that reserve about 
other alternative fuels in the strategic fuel 
of the ways in which america can 
become more selfsufficient in fuel production and 
it is projected in another 15 years 
easily drawndown reserves in the world will 
can not live in the 20th century 
fuels will result in significant economic benefits 
5 million gallons in 2001 to five 
the existing reserve in 2000 to include 
785 percent reduction in co 2 emissions 
not gone down in the last 30 
of oil pricing in the spot markets 
think we here in congress should respond 
and in fact when you 
america s future in the fields of 
interior to use in creating this reserve 
in fact the reserve 
actually be stored in the form of 
for other grains in our country and 
that we use in refining of alcoholbased 
to buy it in this form or 
or store it in a given form 
would be available in the country 
with this amendment in some form to 
find a manner in which it can 
union we write in strong support of 
store renewable fuels in case of possible 
for 30 communities in our country to 
alternatively fueled vehicles in their public fleets 
grants to be in the amount up 
when spot markets in oil are ringing 
oil are ringing in at over 50 
every family in america is feeling 
millions of vehicles in the public realm 
use our fleets in a wiser way 
make a difference in the pockets of 
000 retail locations in our country from 
off the lines in toledo today has 
the first time in us history a 
and the farms in ohio that surround 
of us live in are going to 
to be going in their pockets 
new fuelbased age in this nation 
and it is in ohio and it 
and it is in iowa and it 
and it is in nebraska 
it is definitely in texas 
use that fuel in a new way 
domestic energy independence in a manner that 
is a leader in the field of 
mbte i rise in support of the 
in my home state 
but the provision in this bill that 
requests of industry in this dangerous bill 
tell my colleagues in rhode island we 
our gas piped in from some other 
jobs of workers in flint bay city 
and other communities in my congressional district 
congressional district and in my home state 
billions of dollars in alternative fuels and 
increases called for in this amendment would 
chairman i rise in strong opposition to 
vehicles that consumers in america want and 
one in 10 jobs are 
so we rise in opposition to the 
be more advanced in our competition war 
the auto industry in america is fragile 
millions of dollars in their products to 
that the sticker in their window actually 
imposing an increase in the stringency of 
6 mpg increase in the stringency of 
very important point in this debate and 
dirty little secret in this place those 
place those involved in energy policy have 
provisions are loaded in this bill even 
we are facing in this century 
we are already in a race against 
chairman i rise in support of this 
during a time in which they are 
in fact an april 
in addition the oil 
in a time of 
chairman i rise in opposition to the 
refused to work in a bipartisan fashion 
in fact an april 
the 8 billion in tax incentives less 
in a recent interview 
gas infrastructure needed in our country ensuring 
for american taxpayers in hr 6 and 
and title 20 in particular much of

most significant change in the clean air

we address this in this bill 
our chairman said in the committee if

right to participate in this process and 
it has been in the past 
maximize our chances in producing a fair 
in discussing what we 
what we do in this particular bill 
report that is in front of us 
us it is in fact and i 
it flatly and in a negotiating position 
have renewable provisions in the tax package 
in that bill we 
in the american jobs 
a measure offered in that committee is 
since they include in their entirety the 
totally unacceptable is in the democrats bill 
an energy policy in this country 
most special places in our country without 
much real cost in terms of our 
in particular i m 
and the ugly in fact over the

chairman i rise in strong support of 
order 12898 remain in force until changed 
life of americans in minority and lowerincome 
chemical storage warehouses in these communities with 
would be taken in other locations 
fact is that in some eyes these 
by president clinton in 1994 
environmental justice considerations in their missions develop 
of these issues in a more longterm 
in addition just as 
in a nutshell what 
tells federal agencies in the past these 
be the case in the future i 
than 22 billion in taxpayer dollars to 
we re living in but this bill 
future energy needs in the 21st century 
suspect my constituents in new mexico who 
that allows drilling in the arctic national 
if drilling occurs in the area 
in addition there are 
address fuel efficiency in our vehicles 
two thousand dollars in some cases 
also be interested in the provision in 
in the provision in this bill shielding 
45 million americans in 29 states including 
of the constituents in their districts whose 
thousands of people in northwestern new mexico 
levels of uranium in the drinking water 
is a slap in the face of 
allowed a vote in the full house 
fix unnecessary inequities in the hydropower dam 
relicensing process proposed in hr 6 while 
chance to participate in decisions that affect 
include these stakeholders in the appeals process 
billions of dollars in giveaways to big 
to join me in voting against this 
comprehensive energy bill in the future 
i rise today in strong support of 
two thousand dollars in some cases 
in addition many of 
months was included in this bill 
in this bill we 
even go more in terms of incentives 
and i rise in strong support of 
this will result in is having automakers 
us we live in different states but 
i live in virginia it is 
minutes to get in today 
drive 7 miles in my town of 
when he is in the big city 
in kalamazoo which is 
in this bill the 
to have oxygenate in this bill in 
in this bill in the past and 
time of war in the middle east 
summer smog season in cities like washington 
the world leader in renewable energy and 
in that regard i 
long overdue increase in caf standards 
is polluting groundwater in many of our 
in my home state 
as i mentioned in subcommittee and full 
held undisputed leadership in the world 
in the house bill 
recommended an increase in funding to enable 
sustained this increase in 2005 
put us back in the lead 
of core research in this area that 
number of years in an area where 
aggregate funding level in fiscal year 2003 
in developing recommendations for 
fix many problems in energy research and 
as we state in the report the 
3 years is in the area of 
in particular coming into 
signaled a shift in nuclear weapons policy 
in 2004 the committee 
to 75 million in conference zeroed out 
most significantly in 2004 4 million 
in fiscal year 2005 
a constructive approach in trying to positively 
in this year s 
last year and in the previous year 
is again zero in the committee recommendation 
concept was included in the president s 
essentially in this bill as 
undertake 5year plans in programs 
members join me in supporting this bill 
in a few professions 
a few professions in our society seventh 
in the congress we 
this is resulting in some profound and 
held undisputed leadership in the world 
in the house bill 
sustained this increase in the president s 
united states back in the lead 
in the face of 
of core research in this area that 
it technological leadership in the area of 
aggregate funding level in fy 2003 of 
in developing its recommendations 
to 250 million in fy 2006 to 
fix many problems in energy research water 
in particular coming into 
to 75 million in conference zeroed funds 
in fy 2005 the 
in fy2006 the committee 
is again zero in the committee s 
concept was included in the president s 
in light of these 
support the efforts in this fy2006 energy 
principal agencies funded in this bill to 
have long underinvested in the water infrastructure 
can be supplied in the future 
of the subcommittee in the oversight of 
provisions already included in hr 6 by 
investment and innovation in renewable energy and 
in summary the amendment 
for those interested in the designation to 
president would then in consultation with the 
priority project designation in their advertising 
my time and in conclusion i would 
be heavily invested in energy conservation 
many important things in this bill 
program for investment in renewable energy 
has it all in there because no 
because no one in this house wants 
the subrogation provision in the price anderson 
discuss a provision in this bill that 
of energy sites in oak ridge tennessee 
contractors we have in oak ridge and 
with section 612 in the nuclear title 
for their actions in support of the 
variety of mechanisms in place to ensure 
in the 48year history 
to have engaged in willful misconduct are 
we want involved in this business to 
have sufficient mechanisms in place to hold 
of this provision in the final energy 
and then engage in some colloquy with 
at no time in my 9 years 
i may engage in a colloquy i 
in the subcommittee bill 
the subcommittee bill in the area of 
international fusion research in general and iter 
general and iter in particular the nation 
that strong statement in our report 
highlight one area in particular that we 
chairman i rise in opposition to hr 
in fact enactment of 
likely to result in higher prices at 
provides 75 billion in tax breaks and 
and billions more in royalty relief to 
also permits drilling in the artic refuge 
last pristine areas in the world simply 
and trucks sold in the united states 
the worst cities in america when it 
also very disappointed in the fact that 
energy companies succeeded in their efforts 
in the summer of 
in 2001 california paid 
makes real investments in renewable energy and 
republicans in congress say they 
the poor woman in florida 
high moral standards in government yet they 
the ethics process in the house 
and in this socalled energy 
highest corporate profits in the history of 
crisis costing consumers in california and western 
carves a loophole in the laws protecting 
clean air act in 15 years allowing 
courtesy to me in allowing me to 
legislation is lacking in that regard 
mandate an increase in the cafe standards 
plan to lead in an effort to 
now in this house even 
the only place in america where trying 
going to hear in a minute that 
it worked in california 
and the people in california pitched in 
in california pitched in and almost overnight 
have to bring in from the middle 
of the waste in oil that goes 
people to chip in a little and 
the greatest country in the world can 
achieve small reductions in the waste of 
us to bring in and use and 
and use and in fact overuse oil 
have to bring in from overseas 
promote oil savings in the industrial sector 
chairman i rise in support of the 
wants to speak in favor of the 
in closing i want 
the republican leadership in the house has 
this unfunded mandate in the bill and 
the republicans came in under the contract 
or participate even in key energy decisions 
and in this bill the 
centralization of power in washington is this 
may have known in advance that mbte 
can cause problems in our drinking water 
not allow anybody in this chamber to 
to strike be in order they denied 
today to speak in support of hr 
a tremendous step in the right direction 
have been working in central florida over 
cars to compete in the marketplace by 
meet these needs in the coming decades 
it will be in part due to 
to continued advances in energy efficiency and 
i stand in strong support of 
chairman i rise in strong support of 
earned bipartisan support in the house committee 
energy we consume in america onefifth of 
in fact the average 
500 a year in heating and cooling 
homeowners can use in their existing home 
energy efficient put in better windows better 
in fact it is 
in fact by promoting 
efforts to drill in anwr because this 
discussion because drilling in anwr will not 
drilling in anwr will do 
in fact if we 
have discussing drilling in anwr we would 
we would invest in alternative renewable clean 
standards are stuck in the past overestimating 
fuel economy information in the future 
to be found in this immoral legislation 
caused at least in part by high 
it is obvious in this energy bill 
claim that drilling in the arctic national 
national wildlife refuge in alaska will cure 
drilling in anwr will do 
may be there in the first place 
the poor people in these countries 
in this way us 
actually discourage democracy in the middle east 
in truth this failure 
labeled the war in iraq much like 
national security when in fact both contribute 
have been killed in this war not 
are going well in iraq demonstrated by 
american soldiers remain in the country 
to join me in this effort to 
a proper role in the siting of 
a large tanker in boston harbor 
or six communities in my congressional district 
continuing contracts contained in this bill will 
fully fund projects in a given fiscal 
however the constraints in this bill are 
took money from in previous reprogramming 
corps the restrictions in this bill are 
funds are provided in an appropriations act 
with current law in that it restricts 
his own risk in anticipation of fy 
104 is legislative in nature and i 
out congressionallyadded projects in this appropriation bill 
the funds provided in fy 06 may 
for the project in fy 07 
for a project in this bill for 
with its budget in february of 2006 
the project resulting in increased costs or 
in alaska there are 
these are not in the president s 
not be used in fy 06 and 
believe the restrictions in this bill will 
these important projects in alaska and make 
just the ones in the administration s 
in addition i believe 
concerns are addressed in conference 
starts our process in becoming independent providing 
pristine an area in fact that should 
have developed already in prudhoe bay and 
domestic fuel supply in this country and 
in fact the gentleman 
says dear friend in a few short 
last week in the committee on

the energy crisis in this country

the language in this amendment costs 
to have accuracy in a much more

in the 1980s and 
a great fluctuation in the price of

the teeming life in the gulf of

a significant drop in the number of 
number of jobs in the oil field 
come and gone in this industry 
example one community in my district kermit 
district kermit texas in 19981999 had some 
of the downturn in those years and 
the significant increases in the price of 
the energy department in consultation with the 
i speak in favor of this 
in 1981 there were 
million people employed in the oil and 
a dramatic decrease in the number of 
good solid jobs in this economy and 
economy and jobs in an industry that 
colleagues to vote in favor of the 
i rise in opposition to this 
in 1990 the oil

this majority report in that context is

establish functioning democracies in their countries 
and indian oceans in december of 2004 
provides important increases in coverage for the 
service personnel lost in action they can 
who are engaged in the battle 
keep this image in mind as we 
raise policy issues in this debate 
speaker i believe in this discussion we 
cause of freedom in iraq and afghanistan 
our full support in the battles they 
to place it in the lt em 
the descriptions contained in the original report 
for correcting problems in earlier committee reports 
to finance wars in this particular fashion 
was put back in during conference 
couple of things in here 
was very careful in crafting a bill 
make the commitment in iraq 
time who voted in favor of this 
under fire and in danger we owe 
when they are in the field in 
in the field in action 
in closing i would 
crafted and worked in a way to

mr speaker in accordance with my 
offered by members in a way that 
of every member in this body 
our amendments mischaracterized in a way that 
legislative work distorted in a way that 
is little doubt in my mind that 
amendment characterizations included in the committee report 
never happened before in my memory 
amendments were drafted in a careful and 
a senior member in the house 
not about anything in the debate that 
debated the bill in committee 
about the titles in the section that 
had been considered in previous congresses 
were properly entitled in other congresses 
for the war in iraq and why 
for this war in their sham budget 
if this were in place it would

speaker i rise in strong support of 
mr gingrey xz4001510 in just a few 
men and women in uniform as we 
as we are in the midst of 
12 mile gap in the border fence 
as is included in this measure that 
tried to include in the 911 conference 
because our colleagues in the other body 
real id act in this measure 
play a role in diminishing that magnet 
the border and in so doing we 
that are included in this supplemental appropriations 
of the aisle in implementation of this 
matter of fact in the state of 
amended our constitution in 2004 and overwhelmingly 
which i participated in considered several amendments 
there is nothing in the committee report 
uncles for nieces in any of the 
holders protection bill in the 1850s 
with the conscience in all of us 
then we are in the midst of 
greatest human holocaust in the history of 
somehow we collectively in our hearts understand 
the finer points in a committee report 
today i rise in support of the 
in addition to the 
and reconstruction efforts in the middle east 
ensures that funds in the bill will 
capability at risk in the near term 
in fact several weeks 
of severe fatigue in their wings including 
been flying missions in and out of 
planes were used in vietnam and we 
their wings off in the middle east 
air force faces in its tactical airlift 
immigration laws are in need of reform 
a positive step in the right direction 
of the descriptions in the committee report 
of the amendments in the committee report 
minority dissenting views in the committee report 
heard from earlier in her press release 
of the committee in describing offered amendments 
not what is in the mind of 
at this point in time if there 
of the letter in terms of the 
at some point in time 
is about those in power abusing power 
description that was in the final report 
in fact as the 
from the practice in house report 10951 
congress were engaging in criminal behavior 
course disparaging remarks in newspaper articles around 
now in the course of 
that we do in this body 
and put forward in the debate in 
in the debate in the judiciary committee 
the issue is in the report you 
can not imagine in the history of 
would simply ask in the sense of 
to room 2141 in rayburn and sit 
speaker i rise in strong support of 
in introducing this resolution 
resident commissioner individually in their representative capacity 
justifiably introduced because in this case the 
introduce this resolution in order to make 
in terms of the 
of achilles heels in this particular legislation 
cuts border security in half cuts the 
the ice officers in half 
no border security in this bill 
concerned about getting in front of the 
that was rendered in the committee on 
these amendments mischaracterized in the first place 
them were also in 2002 and never 
unfortunately the tragedy in iraq continues to 
160 people killed in the last 4 
of a solution in iraq 
oppose the rule in hr 1268 the 
we must include in the underlying conference 
and reconstruction activities in iraq and afghanistan 
in 1941 with the 
united states engaged in a major military 
of contractor mismanagement in military contracts 
from its creation in 1941 until it 
until it expired in 1948 the truman 
us government contracting in iraq 
of our involvement in iraq questions have 
american taxpayer dollars in iraqi contracting 
in one case the 
millions of dollars in iraq reconstruction funds 
are being spent in iraq and afghanistan 
the house is in addition to the 
or supporting operations in iraq and afghanistan 
what is in question is how 
on us contracting in both military and 
because i believe in the integrity of 
in the course of 
i know that in this congress we 
to privacy and in this instance the 
who are put in harm s way 
of some tragedy in her life has 
the debate in the committee on 
beyond the parent in this very troubling 
very troubling time in their life 
of transportation might in fact be held 
one offered that in particular the description 
report 10951 and in that report a 
amendments were described in particular to give 
and civil provisions in the bill again 
with it vigorously in terms of the 
help steer them in the right direction 
could be engaged in incest 
to discuss but in a responsible debate 
child to confide in that particular adult 
it was defeated in a roll call 
ultimately caught up in the legislation and 
committing the offense in the first degree 
from the penalties in the bill again 
problem the description in house report 10951 
accounting office so in essence mr speaker 
correcting the language in some form 
might i say in the prosecution of 
is no basis in the bill 
not it was in fact securing them 
babies killed just in the last 24 
case the cases in florida the cases 
florida the cases in texas 
nowhere in this gao study 
i would not in the least be 
of any member in this body and 
there are politics in this house games 
they could stand in place for example 
heel some failure in the parental structure 
solution to this in the committee on 
not do that in house report 10951 
address this question in the committee on 
reports are used in history 
sense of unity in this very fractured 
in the furor of 
passionate we believe in what we are 
we stand in debate with our 
and the words in god we trust 
but when sometimes in the heat of 
and in the course of 
hopefully an effort in a moment of 
take place anymore in the committees of 
to be thrown in the direction of 
jurisdictions every day in the backdrop of 
the freeway yesterday in texas because of 
that is in the annals of 
so in essence no one 
committee on rules in this instance republicans 
be resolved there in the committee on 
representations being made in the committee on 
vigorous the debate in opposition how be 
why we are in this place 
and vigorously disagree in a manner where 
in the emergency supplemental

of an embassy in iraq not because 
embassy is back in this bill another

could do that in korea 
in vietnam we had 
you may recall in the 1960s president

to be there in future years 
by the democrats in the committee on 
of the amendments in the committee report 
include dissenting views in the committee report 
have been gutted in the bill and 
rest of us in the majority 
and women serving in iraq but we 
and unnecessary war in iraq 
what is happening in our own country 
people out there in the street that 
bill is considered in committee 
in committee we argue 
vote and disagree in committee but when 
a committee markup in an accurate and 
five democratic amendments in an extremely disparaging 
of the amendment in the committee report 
daughter to profit in a lawsuit against 
of the bill in the committee report 
in prior congresses democratic 
these were described in neutral terms 
mr speaker in my 16 years 
my 16 years in office i have 
what occurred in this body last 
issues we consider in this institution but 
to fund operations in iraq and afghanistan 
our efforts in iraq and afghanistan 
they should be in this budget 
nearly 300 billion in just 2 years 
admit it everyone in this house knows 
kind of confidence in the future 
willing to invest in a secure and 
for the policy in iraq 
troops are serving in iraq and i 
and women are in iraq because of 
for the war in iraq without a 
this is not in question 
our policy in iraq mr speaker 
is what is in question and i 
number of issues in this bill that 
and reconstruction operations in iraq and afghanistan 
our efforts in iraq and afghanistan 
they should be in the budget 
nearly 300 billion in just two years 
admit it everyone in this house knows 
meet critical shortfalls in basic equipment for 
for our troops in afghanistan and iraq 
and i succeeded in doubling the death 
at that time in no uncertain terms 
failed to include in the final conference 
are now serving in iraq and afghanistan 
kind of confidence in the future 
willing to invest in a secure and 
the funding provided in this supplemental for 
international peacekeeping missions in haiti and darfur 
for the policy in iraq 
troops currently serve in iraq 
when i was in iraq during the 
and women are in iraq because of 
for the war in iraq without a 
this is not in question 
our policy in iraq mr speaker 
is what is in question 
we are engaged in a worldwide war 
the first time in its history 
to an ally in the war on 
in january we saw 
new democratic government in iraq just the 
movements break out in lebanon 
number three terrorist in that organization was 
organization was captured in pakistan 
is why we in congress must take 
men and women in uniform have the 
the ultimate sacrifice in the name of 
have been made in defense of this 
the fact is in the entire debate 
over that amendment in fact in the 
amendment in fact in the entire debate 
with sexual predators in the debate in 
in the debate in the committee over 
one no one in the majority no 
majority no one in the minority mentioned 
predators no one in the committee debate 
in respect to my 
in that eventuality this 
yes in that eventuality the 
i in fact offered a 
correct that defect in the bill but 
wanted sexual predators in the unlikely event 
the house or in the committee as 
no one did in the committee that 
fair comment in a debate 
between expressing views in a debate and 
characterize the amendment in a onesentence report 
do not appear in the bill number 
bills were similar in that both would 
and that was in the quote both 
opinions are fine in the views 
are not fine in the reports of 
and jacksonlee offered in good faith a 
votes were published in house report 10951 
and established practice in house reports to 
from this practice in house report 10951 
correct it both in the committee rules 
and inaccurate captions in house report 10951 
separate occasions and in each case these 
amendments were described in these earlier committee 
vote captions published in house report 10951 
the abovementioned votes in house report 10951 
concerns the manner in which amendments i 
2005 were characterized in the committee s 
specifically the report in the section required 
described my amendments in a manner that 
in my representative capacity 
the language in question appears on 
mischaracterizes my amendments in a manner that 
in fact it uses 
have never previously in my 12 years 
this house nor in my quarter century 
so terrible maligned in an official record 
any legislative body in which i have 
claim the floor in a question of 
and its reputation in the public domain 
what was said in its defense in 
in its defense in the committee on 
that is perhaps in the regrettably poisonous 
my colleagues offered in committee in good 
offered in committee in good faith and 
children and families in terrible situations 
those characterizations came in the section of 
are many places in committee reports where 
have the opportunity in the report to 
of the amendments in the section reserved 
language it used in context the last 
in no case have 
amendments been described in the inaccurate and 
fashion they were in this year s 
the same amendment in the following manner 
in fact neither the 
offensive terms used in the committee report 
described my amendments in this libelous manner 
nobody in the majority none 
of the republicans in opposing my amendments 
opposing my amendments in committee debate said 
the transcript contained in the committee s 
regrettable that even in filing the supplemental 
but this time in the section reserved 
express them is in debate and in 
in debate and in documents reserved for 
a similar right in debate and in 
in debate and in its dissenting views 
unfortunately in this system the 
who offered them in the section of 
resident commissioner individually in their representative capacity 
as it did in this case the 
an important step in that direction and 
to speak out in clear terms on 
fail the institution in which we are 
i hope that in our conduct we 
duty of rising in this house to 
the great members in the history of 
and established practice in the house for 
by any member in a nonpejorative nonargumentative 
truman committee back in world war ii 
to conduct activities in afghanistan and iraq 
of dollars missing in iraq after auditors 
nearly 100 million in reconstruction spending that 
out that stands in stark contrast to 
to what happened in 1941 when then 
committee was created in the congress to 
to the republic in the process 
the rule because in my mind this 
congress is derelict in its duty and 
its duty and in my mind any 
these sloppy operations in iraq they are 
to be stuck in iraq for another 
like a watchdog in this case 
that they have in protecting the civil 
by the republicans in this action that 
the republican majority in the congress of 
united states both in the house and 
the house and in the senate 
in both bodies and 
of curbing debate in this house the 
that we wrote in our amendments that 
the republican leadership in this house that 
at all times in a manner which 
in doing so the 
the house dictate in the house rules 
mischaracterized their amendments in a manner that 
made a difference in bringing this resolution 
what was contained in those amendments 
in short this should 
judiciary report flies in the face of 
you even see in this close on 
is an interest in stopping the conversation 
this is in my view an 
have held him in great esteem and 
view of everyone in this body and 
amendments that members in the minority are 
were but particularly in terms of the 
for her courage in bringing this personal 
in fact i would 
of a resolution in 1983 regarding the 
need to function in this body are 
the republican majority in both chambers of 
with the filibuster in the other body 
here in the house there 
american people place in us the republican 
the republican leadership in this house must 
i rise in strong support of 
and i commend in particular the new 
forged every day in iraq and afghanistan 
confident than ever in the justice and 
that we here in congress must do 
and women serving in our armed forces 
heister who fell in afghanistan along with 
the courage in her email inspired 
my vote today in favor of this 
emergency war supplemental in the memory of 
committee have succeeded in adding 635 million 
adding 635 million in budgetary resources for 
a critical advance in the war on 
we will invest in iraq and afghanistan 
prove lawful presence in the united states 
mr speaker in a country that 
while she was in washington meeting with 
longer be shrouded in secrecy and silence 
many major victories in congress 
my colleagues here in congress and with 
obtain an abortion in circumvention of a 
am hopeful that in this 109th session 
will be successful in securing the rights 
colleagues to vote in favor of this 
commission was constituted in order to tell 
i rise in support of this 
the body that in terms of the 
used these documents in order to rent 
used these documents in order to take 
to fly here in the united states 
6 years that in fact we were 
who had trained in afghanistan who had 
had trained there in jihad at the 
a 3mile gap in that triple barrier 
because it is in the interest of 
and include it in this bill 
i rise in support of the 
is not defined in the bill 
drivers and others in the business of 
woman who gets in a cab and 
civil liability provision in the bill which 
drivers or others in the business of 
however the report in the markup filed 
drivers or others in the business of 
me just say in any event whatever 
to character but in my view the 
view the descriptions in the committee report 
published this morning in the daily newspaper 
the daily newspaper in norfolk virginia the 
itself the mood in certain precincts of 
drivers or others in the business of 
because a girl in one of its 
drivers or others in the business of 
of professional transport in other words the 
arguably a crime in itself 
ordinarily are written in dry neutral language 
deep the divisions in congress have become 
in the end tuesday 
the criminal prohibitions in the legislation without 
were accurately described in the committee report 
drivers or others in the business of 
the people described in the amendments offered 
with a minor in a sexually abusive 
is reviewed extensively in the committee report 
the committee report in an entire section 
in the very same 
cabs or work in the business of 
do just that in just that way 
of statutory rape in this country is 
creating blanket exclusions in the bill for 
a huge loophole in the legislation that 
again accurately described in the committee report 
commit an offense in the first degree 
in sum the effect 
offered as described in the committee report 
of the amendments in the committee report 
of the amendments in the committee report 
were all phrased in the conditional that 
and inaccurate captions in house report 10951 
accurately set out in simple table form 
simple table form in the committee report 
were violated even in spirit because such 
the amendments offered in the sections of 
amendments would create in the bill 
include dissenting views in the committee report 
the minority views in the committee report 
to their owners in other states 
enabling one state in the south which 
to their children in their children s 
overwhelming bipartisan support in the 109th congress 
exploit a loophole in the bill directly 
the house passed in an overwhelmingly bipartisan 
however in order to do 
the majority staff in conflict obviously to 
soiling their reputation in the names of 
those of us in the house but 
see these again in the form of 
lack of civility in this house 
men and women in uniform is a 
going to war in iraq or opposed 
to be successful in the middle east 
our best intentions in mind 
our troops in uniform throughout afghanistan 
upon us here in the people s 
honor those sacrifices in the only real 
accountability and honesty in this government and 
i fear that in this body in 
in this body in this congress we 
waste and corruption in the american war 
they were successful in their noble endeavor 
and yet we in this congress do 
but the majority in the house defeated 
and no language in this conference report 
protect our troops in the line of 
men and women in uniform who pay 
the first lady in the state of 
acting oil minister in the provisional government 
the provisional government in iraq

men and women in uniform as the 
of hr 748 in committee on the 
amendments were included in the committee report

iraq reconstruction is in danger of becoming 
biggest corruption scandal in history

government officials involved in procurement and the 
in 1941 that truman 
about 15 billion in taxpayer money 432

mr chairman in conclusion i will 
the problem is in this country 
i am interested in doing anything i 
stop gang violence in this country 
i am interested in anything about that 
its constitutional limitations in the name of 
a serious issue in many parts of 
gangs are engaging in counterfeiting treason or 
in fact by creating 
federal crimes enumerated in the constitution the 
and enhanced penalties in this bill usurp 
have been handled in state courts 
congress s tendency in recent decades to 
a onesizefitsall formula in place of the 
powers to rein in the judiciary 
it up well in a letter to 
thus sometimes resulting in harsh and inappropriate 
however hr 1279 in no way reduces 
recognize that nothing in the constitution forbids 
i strongly believe in cooperation between federal

youths often results in a greater likelihood

largely law enforcement in nature 
bill that are in the present form 
the present form in this bill have 
the bipartisan bill in the senate sponsored 
is no longer in the business of

oppose it today in the hopes that 
i took office in the california state

the front end in timetested and true 
infinite sense both in terms of dollars 
dollars saved and in terms of lives 
from the senate in a form that 
that i offered in committee did not 
the sentencing enhancements in this bipartisan legislation 
the proactive funding in the bill that 
the prevention funding in committee 
hope however that in conference with the 
address this again in conference committee and 
a handicapped child in the park murder 
in most jurisdictions in 
in most jurisdictions in the country certainly 
the country certainly in the jurisdictions that 
tried as adults in state court would 
than they went in 
no amendments in this rule are 
the little money in the bill to 
problems that are in the bill 
of the money in the bill going 
for law enforcement in the bill to 
and you look in the bill and 
in fact you are 
if they get in trouble to begin 
is no money in here for prevention 
than the provisions in this bill and 
lead the world in incarceration already 
they are in gangs now because 
nothing to do in the afternoon 
chairman i rise in opposition to the 
this bill is in no way like 
they first get in trouble intervene early 
children whose roles in gang crimes are 
children who get in fist fights committing 
mandatory minimum numbers in this bill 
friends who get in fights 
above whatever is in second place way 
in fact whereas there 
to 29years old in jail today we 
8 africanamerican youth in jail today 
and is discriminatory in its application 
a person guilty in adult court his 
than they went in 
we have failed in the most important 
we are in fact cutting funding 
for these programs in our budget and 
and virtually nothing in the bill goes 
almost 400 million in the bill will 
have a choice in crime policy 
in fact a few 
monument high school in south boston massachusetts 
families to live in decent homes 
law enforcement officials in my district and 
are already illegal in every state 
will get time in jail 
in fact as i 
19yearold african americans in this country one 
eight are already in jail today 
increase the number in jail but will 
seek the time in opposition although i 
in fact since we 
about immigrants one in 27 hispanic males 
to 29 are in jail today already 
claim the time in opposition 
claim the time in opposition and i 
taken however misplaced in time 
the mandatory minimums in the bill apply 
25 to 29 in the africanamerican community 
8 are already in jail today 
are also applied in a racially discriminatory 
are less effective in reducing crime 
so carefully established in the sentencing reform 
also destroy honesty in sentencing by encouraging 
in fact the us 
from fostering certainty in punishment mandatory minimums 
mandatory minimums result in unwarranted sentencing disparity 
treat dissimilar offenders in a similar fashion

in 1994 the last 
additional 17 billion in these 24 hours 
domestic laws challenged in order to expand 
country to another in search of the

prefer to operate in countries such as 
in the 10 years 
what they did in south africa 
in 42 out of

in it iran admits 
more to express in some detail my 
but once in a while in 
in a while in the course of 
an initiative and in this case i 
partisan conflict but in reality it is 
any of them in fact i think 
they are compelling in their nature this 
in other words the 
the congress steps in usurps the executive 
formulating foreign policy in exercising its discretion 
appointee will do in the end without 
national interests and in direct violation of

to say that in effect his effort 
including an amendment in the nature of 
areas as designated in the text of 
the house today in strong support of

about so little in this case just 
been a stalwart in these halls for 
dedication to bipartisanship in the area of 
which is evident in many important aspects 
in fact madam speaker 
bill is unusual in the bipartisan unity 
necessity for reforms in the wake of 
unique bipartisan unity in supporting the need 
to put it in a nutshell madam 
to do both in the 1980s and 
its own act in the wake of 
oilforfood scandal irregularities in the accounting and 
resolve and consistency in the un 
am at home in my district some 
in conclusion madam speaker 
every single amendment in order all 28 
in short the only 
be somewhat parsimonious in its general debate 
we will provide in those 28 amendments 
in fact this is 
the kassebaumsolomon amendment in 1985 asked for 
in 1994 we insisted 
least 20 years in this body 
point out that in 1985 1994 and 
when i was in my classroom and 
will do those in the order that 
i would say in response that interestingly 
would be included in this bill

to put that in perspective a lot 
is no doubt in my mind that 
and financial scandal in recent months the 
appears to engage in antiamerican sentiment for 
a true slap in the face to 
nearly 39 billion in contributions to the

its immediate consideration in the house 
5 legislative days in which to revise 
problem we found in the osha law 
in 1970 when it 
to hold osha in check and ensure 
to put this in simpler terms 
argued by osha in efforts to expand 
of job growth in this country and 
workers and compete in our economy 
a specific problem in the osha law 
was a tragedy in her community with 
lost their lives in this accident 
of action that in fact may be 
i think assist in making the determination 
the greatest asset in my business were 
asset they had in their business were 
employers are interested in trying to protect 
congress in 1970 passed the 
osha act putting in statute a set 
made great progress in reducing workplace accidents 
many work sites in my own district 
to work cooperatively in order to have 
congress created osha in 1970 they believed 
it is clear in the legislative language 
legislative language and in their intent that 
all we do in this bill is 
that osha will in fact abide by 
rise today speak in opposition to hr 
by requiring judges in osha appeals cases 
labor department priority in interpreting osha regulations 
man and woman in the nation comes 
take great privilege in coming to the 
that is deepseated in the city of

for in fact if those 
protections had been in place the men 
would not be in mourning 
would not be in mourning 
of a citizen in our country that 
worst construction accident in the history of 
of ohio occurred in our city on 
the trades involved in this project and 
there were people in this city people 
this city people in our capital of 
of columbus people in that company who 
and no anchors in the footers while 
leg had shims in only one of 
them to death in the process 
people in the company knew 
as an accomplice in this willful manslaughter 
them was made in italy not the

a little stickler in the osha regulations 
simple report language in that bill which 
action or inaction in this i280 federal

went to work in 32 degrees below 
well in my opinion in 
in my opinion in cases of such 
that is made in the united states 
got their head in the sand 
those in charge are hiding 
charge are hiding in columbus somewhere under 
largest transportation project in ohio history with 
for five deaths in the last year 
these men lie in this house 
were always taught in school there are 
these men died in my view because 
their allies here in the congress who 
into this tragedy in ohio

my hope that in spite of the 
every single person in our community that 
that they put in us to protect 
or looked at in 34 years in 
in 34 years in any sense and 
a little tilted in one direction and 
exactly what happened in the seventies 
it is clear in the legislative language 
consider what we in congress did 
should not sit in judgment of their 
the congress in 1970 understood that 
to fix that in osha sometime very 
in my view this 
as i am in this town and

of the commission in accordance with the 
in the 108th congress 
majority of citizens in this country who 
country who are in small business 
of this body in relation to this

no health coverage in the first place 
in addition ahps can 
we in congress have a 
is very clear in the bill as 
the disagreement comes in terms of how

time to speak in support of this 
to live in a country as

reason i rise in opposition is because 
the inability especially in small businesses to

office has shown in their study that 
the gao in a study showed 
affecting every state in the union with 
responsibilities put it in the department of 
state attorneys general in a letter stated

a wrong way in taking action 
harm than good in passing legislation and 
had a discussion in regard to the 
have come out in opposition to it 
what it does in essence mr speaker 
extremely cost effective in not only extending 
the state legislatures in working with the 
legislature has felt in the past that 
onesizefitsall approach comes in and tries to 
and consumer protection in this health care 
bill would not in fact require a 
health insurance plans in order to administer 
as we have in our substitute bill 
of this bill in the past but 
anemic job growth in this country in 
in this country in recent years because 
we must address in order to deal 
have been frozen in effect in recent 
frozen in effect in recent years because 
be working on in a bipartisan fashion 
the verdict is in and that verdict 
of state legislatures in a bipartisan fashion 
wheels are stuck in the mud and 
because the senate in their analysis of 
be some deficiencies in what we are 
we are offering in our substitute just 
there are deficiencies in theirs 
both the gao in a study and 
health care regulation in this country is 
i rise today in opposition to hr 
uninsured has risen in almost every year 
continue its rise in the near term 
most people in the us who

have benefits that in fact are there 
that was done in 40 or 45 
they have done in the past 
replete with that in state after state

would end up in ahps under this

to keep people in decent health care 
at some point in their lives and 
in fact they expect 
fought hard for in almost every state 
almost every state in this union to 
just spoke about in support of this 
speaker i rise in support of the 
businesses and associations in my congressional district 
in fact 65 percent 
a first step in helping to lower 
i believe that in this bill that 
i read it in section 805 of 
sick you are in serious trouble because 
but in my opinion we 
sort of fly in the buttermilk of 
health care reform in the form of 
yet in plain english it 
small business owner in remission from cancer 
if he lives in a state that 
employees will be in the ahps

file a claim in which case we 
insurance first came in the marketplace 
you know that in our states there 
terrible rating scheme in this plan 
capping solvency stands in stark contrast to 
speaker i rise in opposition to hr 
fairness act but in strong support of 
for many businesses in my congressional district 
have otherwise invested in their businesses 
some small employers in the stateregulated market 
in fact the congressional 
legislation would result in higher premiums for 
grouping small companies in healthcare pools this 
large corporations have in trying to keep 
i rise today in support of the 
kindandrews substitute and in strong opposition to 
economies of scale in purchasing coverage 
a bipartisan basis in response to reallife 
to reallife problems in the insurance market 
in fact this illconceived 
no other protections in their place 
mercer consultants study in 2003 found that 
to stop abuses in the small group 
would be left in a regulatory blackhole 
in illinois we have 
hmos gagging doctors in their communications with 
who previously served in state legislatures fought 
that conditions developed in the mother s 
a tremendous stake in this debate 
speaker i rise in support of hr 
a popular response in many states to 
5 percent reduction in costs will result 
costs will result in a 10 to 
to 15percent increase in small businesses offering 
selfinsured plan is in existence before the 
are the engine in our economy provide 
i rise today in strong opposition to 
exact same legislation in as many years 
already have laws in place that allow 
in fact this bill 
in my state of 
those options are in the patient s 
and abuse problems in health care as 
that congress created in the 1970s 
than 123 million in unpaid health expenses 
in fact the respected 
in fact the 2003 
be an increase in the number of 
of uninsured workers in small firms an 
in fact that is 
protections that are in place for insurance 
as a person in small business for 
in fact mr speaker 
women in small businesses deserve 
50 states and in those 50 states 
by this congress in previous legislation and 
overwhelmingly agreed to in our states and 
vote on it in this house 
if you are in an ahp you 
have to wait in line before you 
she thinks is in your best medical 
mr speaker in every state and 
so often stated in this town that 
provide some help in a market that 
in fact the requirements 
to health insurance in the small group 
affordability and competition in these markets

that their counterparts in large corporations already 
in fact this bill 
offered an amendment in the committee on 
see the value in protecting women from

but fortunately in california we require 
even one woman in this nation foregoing 
than my constituents in marin county california

large insurance pools in order to give 
in truth our biggest 
biggest bipartisan failure in this congress has 
these people work in small businesses or 
are a step in the right direction 
the antidiscrimination language in the bill 
the backward thinking in our health care 
in fact the american 
by making changes in their diet and 
advice and recommendations in order to improve 
people who work in small businesses and 
as a physician in congress when i 
purchase health insurance in the individual market 
is a step in the right direction 
that will be in that insurance policy

human resources officers in large companies 
is a step in the right direction 
of all adults in louisiana lack health 
all working adults in louisiana lack insurance 
the last four in louisiana went to 
the preemption language in the bill only

last night in the committee on 
that we faced in california earthquakes fire 
of those challenges in his 8 years 
that we faced in those instances 
that were faced in california there were 
terrible california floods in january of 1997 
1997 that resulted in eight deaths the 
that in 1997 
the northridge earthquake in 1994 and it 
and it resulted in 51 deaths and 
that they pale in comparison to the 
forward and is in many ways doing 
that the government in no way could 
had to step in 
then bring them in 
to governor blanco in louisiana state that 
right here is in the 1994 northridge 
most traversed interstate in the country 
earthquake took place in january of 1994 
has been sitting in my living room 
living room out in california for a 
day before yesterday in the wall street

for other committees in the house will 
sticking our head in the sand ignoring 
katrina he should in fact be able 
able to participate in determining who testifies 
so we are in this together madam

what happened today in the new york

to people living in mississippi and the 
by natural disasters in the past and 
challenged by disasters in the future 
democrats working together in a bipartisan fashion 
speaker i rise in strong opposition to 
can be trusted in this case to 
the only outrage in the katrina tragedy 
the one proposed in this legislation 
in fact 71 percent 
get bogged down in politics rather than 
many in washington dc prefer 
the worst disaster in a nation s 
truth so that in the future such 
an oversight meaningful in depth honest searching 
was so inept in its response and 
when democrats were in the majority why 
keep your members in line 
in fact a washington 
is no doubt in my mind that 
to 100 000plus in houston in my 
000plus in houston in my congressional district 
other congressional districts in the area 
things i did in visiting those survivors 
visiting those survivors in the astrodome was 
ability to deploy in advance of hurricane 
of lives or in fact providing the 
board is not in fact a solution 
911 commission working in a bipartisan fashion 
fashion equal numbered in population if you 
elements of failure in 911 was the

would say tonight in another 20 minutes 
the people affected in the south what 
we call here in washington dc the 
allow this house in a vote that 
i am not in solidarity of the 
of what happened in hurricane katrina but 
to do something in the congress to 
regular business here in the congress 
i must add in the history of 
the federal commitment in the end 
will be working in the rebuilding process 
individuals that are in the affected area 
let politicians stand in judgment of politicians 
majority party stand in judgment of the 
of the majority in the executive branch 
that have mold in their homes and 
that are lost in the hundreds and 
over in the other body 
the leadership here in this congress is 
who are living in shelters right now 
those folks had in 911 
would be represented in this house so 
would be represented in this house and 
to keep it in the forefront but 
has some teeth in it 
just say this in order to clarify 
in section 5 it 
we are not in the majority to 
and that is in section 5 of 
able to move in for it to 
did not do in mississippi or louisiana 
did not do in the town wherever 
it preventing lives in the future from 
if we were in the majority 
to people stuck in the superdome and 
the superdome and in shelters 
and in mississippi where i 
where i went in hancock county they 
watched this come in knowing what the 
of my district in miami and met 
but i stayed in a holiday inn 
class or wealthy in this country that 
folks getting excited in the select committee 
if you believe in making sure that 
the same congress in the majority that 
were major mistakes in our intelligence major 
has happened down in the south is 
they are still in the recovery process 
that are affected in affected areas 
allow the people in the recovery process

that we tie in with that they 
what we saw in new orleans what 
what we saw in louisiana what we 
what we saw in mississippi the individuals 
check to come in or did not 
help these individuals in the south 
instead they sat in their homes for 
like in the charity hospital 
that are professionals in this field to 
got to do in their district that 
if one is in power to be 
the people out in the streets making 
and black people in the north saying

that we have in operation today 148

the only thing in the bill before 
we put it in the bill 
day of oil in this country 
the world market in the next year 
every state puc in the country already

new refining capacity in the united states 
its immediate consideration in the house

324 operating refineries in the boundaries of 
an existing refinery in the state that 
that i live in the state of

build new refineries in the united states 
for every american in this country 
in the days right 
than it was in the morning 
and damaged refineries in louisiana and texas 
every driver in america has endured 
we leave in place state measures 
this to get in the way of 
have a vote in the future on

act of 2005 in recognition of the 
other provisions contained in the legislation is 
no provisions contained in hr 3893 that

of refinery capacity in hurricaneprone areas if 
a new refinery in so many years 
for their leadership in offering this substitute 
i rise in strong support of 
some good provisions in the first energy 
that still exist in the energy market 
in contrast this substitute

representatives to rein in gas prices once 
this energy bill in its current form 
in that spirit we 
investing new authority in the ftc to 
violation will result in new civil penalties 
teeth by reining in scrupulous practices of 
executives interested more in padding their bottom 
that we are in their corner 
our provisions are in effect at every

what is not in it namely the 
my gas prices in my district are 
among the highest in the nation 
once again realized in this bill 
more than ever in the wake of 
s the rise in gas prices at 
amp d efforts in renewable sources of 
gouging took place in the wake of 
big oil working in collusion with opec 
in the last 4 
exxonmobil in the quarter before 
katrina 14 billion in onequarter 
to 250 percent in one year 70 
thing enron did in california to stick 
up 263 percent in one year you 
take on opec in the world trade 
be put up in their backyards with 
the provisions in this bill are 
i have been in congress we need 
an amendment both in committee and at 
of renewable energy in this country 
the major changes in language in the 
changes in language in the bill were 
whether the provisions in the energy bill 
have great difficulty in explaining today 
have found ourselves in now and it 
and anticipated increases in natural gas and 
coming upon us in the fall 
whenever it occurs in the industry not 
plane to catch in about 1 hour 
i rise today in strong opposition to 
in order to challenge 
local communities lose in court they have 
speaker i rise in strong support of 
absolutely phenomenal job in fashioning this very 
we see prices in excess of 315 
a big role in exacerbating the cost 
number of refineries in the united states 
of america cut in half 
why would anyone in the industry consider 
partisan bill when in fact the gentleman 
which will be in fact passed when 
and i rise in strong opposition to 
just today in the newspaper it 
hurricane katrina looters in new orleans but 
facilities are placed in individual communities 
but was neither in the energy policy 
into law nor in this bill is 
of our citizens in doing so 
speaker i rise in opposition to the

to place language in the bill that 
a new refinery in chincoteague virginia the 
great bay refuge in new hampshire or 
new hampshire or in arkansas s cache

the bill and in support of the 
a great champion in the congress on 
happening to consumers in our country for 
in california prices climbed

consumers in other parts of 
increased 255 percent in one year from 
gougers were raking in their profits during 
to the shortfall in capacity 
i rise today in opposition to hr 
and should be in operation by august 
the new plant in production the american 
across the country in what one energy 
for the country in times of a 
environmental safeguards put in place by the 
speaker i rise in strong support of 
stupak substitute and in strong opposition to 
can puts it in your back yard 
that may be in the closed base 
an oil refinery in the middle of 
most beautiful areas in the whole united 
my question is in the current uncertainty 
prices to stabilize in the future and 
a lot here in the us but 
gas production offshore in the ocs 
in the refining business 
no one invested in expansion until recently 
given price spikes in atlanta that topped 
need to survive in the modern world 
review reform provisions in the committeepassed version 
improve air quality in houston 
with air pollution in our district and 
it is in the national interest 
but the language in the gentleman from 
stronger than those in the original bill 
like we saw in atlanta after the 
the consumer protections in the overall bill 
this congress maybe in the last 10 
important to us in congress that we 
they are today in school juniors or

to be critical in the wake of 
about the way in which the national 
for them brought in the energy companies 
attitude is reflected in this bill as 
than 25 billion in profits in 2004 
billion in profits in 2004 
their profits in 2005 are even 
of the way in which the national 
in order to justify 
national republican party in the white house 
white house and in this congress as 
seeing here today in the context of 
refinery is stalled in litigation or must 
not being built in this country because 
having any input in the process 
technologies can play in using energy more 
and generating it in new ways 
will do nothing in this area

organizations that participate in nonpartisan activities as 
has no place in our democracy 
an incredible job in housing will be 
that took place in both of those 
looking back in the past when 
a lone voice in trying to get 
to get changes in the regulatory structure 
and their role in the housing market 
including receivership language in it so in 
in it so in case one or 
actually put them in receivership essentially became 
progress we made in the committee 
home loan banks in this case to 
always i think in the back of 
we set up in the legislation again 
for affordable housing in those heavily struck 
essentially be first in line for those 
developed down there in terms of housing

chairman i rise in opposition to the 
houses and participate in democracy too 
chairman i rise in opposition to the 
funds to engage in nonpartisan voter registration 
their primary purpose in order to receive 
removed language contained in the current manager 
with proven experience in mobilizing community support 
in addition the manager 
that are proposed in the underlying bill 
the nugatory provisions in the manager s 
to full participation in federal programs and 
free to engage in the same voter 
existing limits in hr 1461 on 
of which operate in my district of

groups to participate in the new affordable

not previously debated in committee which have 
balance we crafted in committee to create

in closing mr chairman 
it moves on in the process 
manager s amendment in the motion to 
we will add in the terms that 
and voter registration in a nonpartisan way 
the powers involved in this bill allow 
risk would occur in these particular organizations 
systemic risk when in fact these organizations 
most thoughtful individual in the world to 
housing market and in effect causing further 
independent public voice in the corporate governance 
had bipartisan support in the committee on 
a dramatic change in the board structures 
additionally in order to represent 
in my view requiring 
a needed voice in ensuring the viability 
continued public trust in these very important 
include providing flexibility in the size of 
a successor is in place 
in a recent letter 
is well balanced in knowledge and expertise 
knowledge and expertise in the full range 
informed sound judgments in fulfilling their duties 
the gses executives in sum this amendment 
i rise now in opposition to hr 
in its amended form 
funds to engage in nonpartisan voter registration 
that between passage in the committee and 
at this point in time even though 
could become acute in a matter of 
restate 108 billion in previously reported earnings 
about 5 billion in earnings 
about 15 trillion in debt 
they hold mortgages in their portfolios they 
portfolios they are in effect simply another 
amp l crisis in one sense for 
more problematic because in the housing industry 
extraordinary things happen in the economy something 
in the 1980s without 
before their collapse in the 1980s 
in a letter dated 
a free hand in determining 
regulator greater discretion in this critical area 
have an advantage in cost of money 
also have advantage in leverage ratio provided 
presence of gses in our markets and 
enormous housing crisis in our country 
have found ourselves in a situation where 
engagement and participation in our most fundamental 
housing from engaging in nonpartisan voter registration 
nonprofits from engaging in nonpartisan getouttovote efforts 
nonprofits from engaging in nonpartisan election activities 
mosques from engaging in civic participation activity 
right to participate in the democratic process 
the democratic process in our country is 
of being involved in efforts to get 
to become participants in a democratic process 
organizations from engaging in their civic responsibilities 
groups are engaging in lawful nonpartisan civic 
not believe that in 2005 this is 
telling the people in iraq they can 
are saying here in america that our 
can not engage in nonpartisan voter registration 
people for engaging in them 
in my estimation it 
about two provisions in this bill raising 
citizens to engage in our democratic process 
process currently contained in the manager s 
mr chairman in my district the 
for a home in santa clara county 
in today s market 
that this administration in testimony before the 
services committee spoke in favor of raising 
organizations from engaging in nonpartisan i repeat 
the vote drives in the 12month period 
from subsequently engaging in these important activities 
right to participate in their government 
chairman i rise in opposition to the 
specifically i stand in this house to 
condemn the language in this bill which 
thousands of families in this country who 
either homeless or in shelters or forced 
forced to live in substandard housing 
groups that engage in voter participation activities 
in this day and 
always taken pride in and that is 
church and state in matters of worship 
has always been in this country a 
proselytize they are in the business of 
recognized the goodness in that 
have a departure in this country from 
congress has taken in support of housing 
support of housing in this administration 
in this bill we 
we put in place safeguards to 
along for housing in a very long 
i can not in good conscience vote 
with this provision in it 
chairman i rise in opposition to the 
median home price in high cost areas 
that home prices in some parts of 
are higher than in most of the 
in these areas middle 
middle class families in these areas the 
loan as those in other areas enjoy 
the loan limit in high cost areas 
to join me in voting against it 
shocked and disappointed in the result of 
we in this committee this 
in fact just yesterday 
purpose or engage in nonpartisan voter registration 
it clearly states in its language that 
forprofits can engage in whatever they want 
able to participate in these fundings but 
be doing everything in our power to 
programs would vote in favor of the 
chairman i rise in strong opposition to 
new jersey and in highcost areas throughout 
this means that in the highcost areas 
such as those in new jersey where 
least 200 000 in counties like bergen 
those who live in highercost areas do 
owning a home in the area they 
want to live in not shutting them 
chairman i rise in strong opposition to 
new jersey and in high cost areas 
is home prices in highcost areas are 
current limit families in high cost areas 
such as those in new jersey where 
families that live in higher cost areas 
a family living in bergen or passaic 
because they live in an area where 
owning a home in the area they 
we find liquidity in the secondary marketplace 
marketplace so people in this country have 
liquidity we have in the marketplace the 
stability we have in the marketplace the 
tried to do in this bill and 
adequately provide loans in the markets throughout 
happen to live in certain areas that 
gses can lend in 
if people live in hawaii guam and 
fannie loan yet in california they can 
i rise in strong support of 
in my district for 
officers to live in the communities they 
affordable housing initiatives in anaheim california 
convert the equity in their homes into 
all of this in partnership with lenders 
have addressed deficiencies in gse supervision we 
congress original goal in chartering gses 
credit and homeownership in the united states 
are also unwavering in our commitment to 
is about homeownership in this country 
that their investments in america s housing 
chartered to operate in every district across 
country their effectiveness in certain areas has 
those who live in highcost areas of 
able to participate in federal efforts to 
to increase homeownership in america but they 
the language in the bill increases 
increases loan limits in high cost areas 
all loans made in highcost areas must 
conforming loan limits in highcost areas we 
market ultimately resulting in a negative impact 
the mortgage market in the following ways 
sustain the market in time of crises 
stability and affordability in the residential mortgage 
would reduce liquidity in the mortgage market 
in the second quarter 
yet in new york new 
for example in the north new 
loan limit provision in this bill will 
in highcost areas a 
loan limits language in hr 1461 will 
in fact in the 
in fact in the gentleman from 
are three parts in section 123 
deletes all three in this section 
increases or decreases in a housing price 
median home price in the area 
it eliminates flexibility in loan limits to 
bill was worked in a fashion to 
out and compete in the jumbo marketplace 
allowing more individuals in the firsttime marketplace 
pull into them in a heavier fashion 
out there floating in the marketplace 
chairman i rise in opposition to this 
the provision in question would disqualify 
group that engages in voter participation activities 
can the republicans in good faith claim 
free to engage in lobbying and nonpartisan 
is a slap in the face to 
to join me in opposing this bill 
i rise today in support of the 
a keen interest in the strength of 
the secondarymortgage markets in maintaining a stable

mr baker xz4000120 in strengthening oversight

claim the time in opposition although i 
am very much in favor of the 
been very interested in this entire issue 
that i support in terms of independence 
in fact it failed 
a tie vote in the committee 
speaker i rise in opposition to the 
well with us in committee on this 
of building houses in the various states 
mr frank xz4001400 in his motion talks 
is no definition in the campaign laws 
to keep that in mind 
into the areas in particularly the first 
first 2 years in the hurricanerelated areas 
amount of oversight in this area 
in addition to establishing 
the greatest difficulty in finding housing that 
encouraging full participation in the american dream 
critical housing needs in recent years spending 
rent or living in substandard housing 
in 2003 fannie mae 
in several highcost housing 
in my area a 
in my own district

colleagues join me in protecting taxpayers from 
risk of investing in fannie mae and 
created as sovereign in its sphere and 
enforce the laws in the same way 
this flies in the face of

a shortterm boom in housing 
bubbles the boom in housing prices can 
actively encouraged overinvestment in housing 
the inevitable drop in the housing market 
in fact postponing the 
people are invested in the market the 
regulations are justified in part by the 
one bad intervention in the market the 
in conclusion hr 1461 
foolish government interference in the market 
they also guarantee in addition 24 trillion 
credit that is in the system and 
also in this bill of 
another billion dollars in the next 2 
want the money in the market to

having a voice in the election of 
right to participate in their government 
use the opportunity in this bill to 
about specific provisions in the manager s

more so than in the case of 
of ellington field in houston texas 
exemplary not just in their efforts before 
to iraq but in iraq itself 
were absolutely exemplary in their efforts and 
their efforts and in their service 
we appreciate them in everything that they 
to anyone as in need of more 
to my mind in many ways more 
the only region in the entire united 
to save ellington in their frustration 
round of recommendations in my view does 
today i rise in support of h 
the criteria outlined in the brac legislation 
realignment of installations in the 17th congressional 
rated number one in military value but 
not only bases in illinois but throughout 
an outstanding job in fighting this battle 
i rise today in opposition to h 
much military infrastructure in this country whose 
at maxwellgunter afb in montgomery alabama 
decision was due in large part to 
to be moved in order to continue 
support software applications in an operational environment 
resource and belongs in montgomery 
seeing the logic in overturning dod s 
aviation training center in the united a 
to include this in its final list 
in addition when colin 
in the mid90s there 
began to investigate in an effort to 
amendment was included in the house version 
not be duplicated in huntsville 
the recommendations included in the commission s 
realigned or closed in order to achieve 
explore all avenues in order to find 
in conclusion i would 
most thankless jobs in government 
ellington is in his district but 
illadvised illtimed round in base closure history 
and women fighting in two countries and 
the fourth likely in the next few 
we are in the process of 
fourth largest city in our nation 
houston ship channel in the port of 
most vulnerable targets in the area is 
plant could result in a hazardous release 
provides air security in the area and 
and illtimed round in the history of 
and women fighting in two countries we 
largest supplemental requests in our nation s 
a fourth likely in the next several 
and we are in the process of 
largest metropolitan areas in the country less 
fourth largest city in the nation and 
most vulnerable targets in the area and 
we have seen in the aftermath of 
caused by disruptions in our oil supply 
largest petrochemical complex in the world and 
and the largest in the western hemisphere 
plant could result in a hazardous release 
provides air security in the area and 
at the port in minutes because of 
on multiple targets in the area 
squadron would be in san antonio and 
in addition to providing 
the savings estimated in the dod s 
to join me in supporting this resolution 
ranking member skelton in opposing house joint 
offer an amendment in the armed services 
would pass overwhelmingly in committee it would 
would pass overwhelmingly in this house and 
be shot down in the conference committee 
in doing so they 
meet future crises in times of war 
in balance mr chairman 
we have had in all of the 
of base closures in the very near 
round of brac in the near future 
a major base in this country from 
be back here in this room a 
will be back in this room dealing 
i rise reluctantly in support of this 
came out okay in a lot of 
lot of ways in this because four 
of five facilities in my area did 
army did well in this brac 
read something here in a minute about 
what troubles me in this one because 
and they destroyed in my opinion much 
soldiers that were in the dome shortly 
were flown there in 130s out of 
soldiers that were in mississippi from ohio 
soldiers that were in texas from ohio 
ohio were flown in by 130s from 
wait to come in and pick those 
shows the support in the hurricane by 
the active duty in response to these 
we put in over 85 million 
we put in a 10 million 
possibly put it in another place someplace 
by the numbers in the past 
they were going in the right direction 
think this happened in more instances than 
people will vote in support of the 
i can not in good conscience accept 
and very unfair in the decisions made 
testified at hearings in buffalo and washington 
visits to dscc in columbus and to 
also worked together in reviewing the numbers 
by the pentagon in making their brac 
that our efforts in getting information from 
formal training unit in the air national 
the air force in this effort 
than 75 million in federal funding has 
has been invested in the springfield base 
we have put in a new ramp 
in fact the commission 
commission actually concluded in its report that 
pilot production unit in the guard 
leave the base in 2007 while there 
scheduled for training in 2008 
the national guard in responding to emergency 
as we saw in the days following 
the recent hurricanes in the gulf coast 
a critical resource in transporting troops supplies 
over 50 missions in support of hurricane 
was very disappointed in the process by 
particularly the flaws in the air force 
demonstrated the flaws in the pentagon s 
finally in early september i 
men and women in the guard and 
in columbus the defense 
i think that in the years to 
reserve are set in motion people will 
time to speak in support of the 
and improve efficiency in the military 
had not factored in the impact of 
the united states in its brac recommendations 
capabilities we need in order to meet 
of the specifics in here 
at fort monmouth in central new jersey 
taken the lead in developing countermeasures to 
disarm roadside bombs in iraq 
in the end however 
in the resolution before 
in the case of 
monmouth for example in their recommendations they 
support our troops in the field and 
actually said that in their recommendations 
with military installations in our districts the 
in addition by a 
to join me in doing so 
hearings and participated in hundreds of meetings 
another tough one in chairing this brac 
is a commission in which you get 
as senior statesmen in again what amounted 
i stand here in opposition to that 
assists the department in maximizing joint utilization 
to be evaluated in a clear and 
finance accounting service in cleveland ohio but 
and women serving in afghanistan iraq and 
on the ground in iraq and worldwide 
in addition i would 
work they did in supporting dfas as 
the various discrepancies in the initial recommendation 
in the city of 
i vehemently argue in opposition to h 
chairman i rise in opposition to this 
and accounting services in cleveland which was 
strong community effort in cleveland that was 
be quite successful in helping to strengthen 
service at dfas in cleveland should be 
adding 475 jobs in addition to saving 
a rare feat in washington dc 
us why independence in our government s 
highest poverty rates in the nation to 
ranked much lower in poverty 
so in all i believe 
the 1 hour in support of the 
that we are in a position in 
in a position in the house to 
the hard work in iraq those who 
the hard work in afghanistan and those 
have been doing in the work that 
has taken place in afghanistan 
has taken place in iraq 
and women working in the state department 
bring about democracy in iraq 
such great success in afghanistan and in 
in afghanistan and in iraq 
have a say in what bases are 
say to those in the house that 
could have been in some of their 
adopt this resolution in support of those 
the hard work in support of those 
up a democracy in iraq and we 
we in congress spend quite 
unfortunately we live in a different world 
nt even imagine in the late 1980s 
very difficult task in a very uncertain 
brac commission noted in its report to 
in its report to 
be now left in serious financial straits 
air national guard in my district and 
roles they play in our nation s 
fighting against terrorism in iraq and afghanistan 
of the states in which those units 
have filed lawsuits in federal court demanding 
secretary of defense in a letter dated 
air guard moves in violation of federal 
of 35 billion in savings over 20 
to be popular in the media 
of their states in violation of federal 
wanted to speak in favor of the 
folks are still in the military and 
and in the case of 
of their report in fact the commission 
largest military installations in our state 
to a slap in the face to 
what you did in iraq oh by 
point earlier on in my opening statement 
the hard work in iraq the people 
the hard work in afghanistan this is 
a great job in standing up for 
up for democracy in afghanistan and doing 
the hard work in iraq 
people now serving in iraq the citizen 
is our opportunity in the house to 
mine from illinois in everything they have 
wanted to do in afghanistan and iraq

in other words this 
have to be in the workforce and 
in this case the 
their children are in the school system 
the private sector in a new york 
is this in the national interest 
think it is in the national interest 
people that were in facilities that were 
to surplus facilities in other parts of

think this is in the national interest 
have to do in a metropolitan area 
just as important in florida and texas 
but in northern virginia they 
in fact i question 
preclude a location in a metropolitan area 
metropolitan area anyplace in the country and 
activity to be in those buildings 
a brain drain in terms of many 
urge my colleagues in this body to 
ways they can in fact save money 
ways they can in fact improve the

many of us in congress including me

brac commission members in their deliberations and 
round took place in the context of 
all relevant sources in evaluating our air 
at no time in the pentagon s 
just since 911 in support of homeland 
hurricane relief missions in florida and other 
vital defense operations in iraq saudi arabia

in its final deliberations 
air guard infrastructure in view of our 
in short the air 
manufacturing center located in lima in my 
located in lima in my congressional district 
the plant resulting in a higher cost 
in just the last 
has been invested in the 179th s 
do not believe in the brac 
have been here in congress 18 years 
do not believe in brac was somewhat 
want to say in this particular round 
this particular round in 2005 i strongly 
more so than in the past because 
because we are in a war in 
in a war in iraq 
not shut down in my opinion military 
think this brac in particular is poorly 
was done hastily in my opinion with 
being shut down in the name of 
in the case of 
employed there live in my district 
the brac commission in my opinion that 
warfighter and how in the days of 
open by voting in support of a 
a strong case in their defense at 
continue to play in coordinating the deployment 
eliminate excess infrastructure in the department of 
that was used in this round of 
in the last three 
in this round however 
the brac commission in my opinion has 
gentleman that we in congress did pass 
regional hearings and in person and with 
many of us in these very difficult 
i rise in opposition to my 
in the state of 
get wiped out in the state of 
one recruiting states in the united states 
my hometown in fort wayne indiana 
of defense electronics in the united states 
highest congressional districts in america in military 
districts in america in military recruiting for

air guard unit in the united states 
from the people in the capital region 
and the people in the terre haute 
in fact they were 
were all high in recruitment and they 
were all high in national awards 
aging and declining in quality and disappearing 
it leave us in homeland security 
through the courts in this process that 
one court ruling in pennsylvania that said 
of defense systems in homeland security that 
will be located in terre haute and 
will be located in springfield illinois very 
structure we have in the united states 
we can find in addition to the 
that are located in fort wayne and 
armed forces system in the united states 
very simple question in the three previous 
what people miss in all of this 
and in every instance congress 
in my frantic calls 
calls to them in the aftermath of 
put those people in the event weather 
is a tsunami in the pacific a 
pacific a hurricane in mississippi a flood

unparalleled airspace is in the process of

not understand why in a time that 
defense has suggested in fact recommended that 
has moved ahead in this brac round 
borders my district in pennsylvania 
can be distributed in the event of 
a vital role in our nation s 
ramming through legislation in the middle of 
planning to speak in opposition to the 
i rise in opposition to the 
close huge loopholes in campaign spending including 
they would vote in an election 
in the absence of 
passes we will in effect have an 
today i rise in support of hr 
campaign finance reform in 2002 the legislation 
but in april a federal 
legislation will protect in its infancy what 
us that were in washington dc during 
of the internet in just the last 
put the power in the hands of 
i rise today in strong opposition to 
for soft money in our federal campaign 
powerful political tool in recent elections but 
never be disclosed in campaign finance records 
the contrary that in this instance in 
in this instance in political speech congress 
the appearance thereof in campaign activities 
before you engage in the internet communication 
in other words it 
intolerable filed suit in federal court and 
in the absence of 
you are engaging in speech over the 
opportunity to engage in free speech over 
free debate except in the congress of 
forehead of zeus in perfect form and 
they will fall in line 
shutting it down in the congress of 
other s arms in private rather than 
destroy the village in order to save 
has become inapplicable in this bill 
all we get in defense of this 
whom i disagree in this case 
her imprimatur is in itself a substantive 
reduction of democracy in the house 
shutting it down in the house 
i rise in strong support of 
stifle political speech in cyberspace

this identical language in the other body 
200 years ago in this house of 
a huge loophole in the campaign finance 
have been bulldogs in moving us toward 
the largest microphone in a federal campaign

fec the agency in charge of regulating 
election laws was in error when it 
rights thrown out in the name of 
constituents i represent in this house is 
have to invest in tv or radio 
from a gatekeeper in the mainstream media 
felt so powerful in the minority as 
do believe that in coming from silicon

the prohibitions found in 441 b any 
to say that in this case the 
i rise today in opposition to house 
corrupting soft money in federal elections 
i also rise in opposition to this 
times editorialized yesterday in opposition to hr 
pass that bill in the middle of

bill that flies in the face of 
a minor blip in the 1980s and 
a huge cyberloophole in the soft money

lump of coal in their stocking 
are talking about in 2006 in 2007 
about in 2006 in 2007 and in 
in 2007 and in 2008 
driving us deeper in debt today cutting 
something that happens in 2009 and 2010 
well in looking at who 
of the people in this country 55 
so in this christmas season 
the wealthiest few in this country 
talking about remain in place 
they are in existing law for 
and in this environment the 
environment the majority in bringing this bill 
passing 87 billion in additional tax cuts 
he was quoted in november saying we 
earlier in the month of 
in the end the 
dirty little secret in this budget reconciliation 
mr speaker in april congress passed 
in 2001 2003 and 
put more money in the hands of 
of real growth in our economy above 
and raise families in states with no 
important to those in my home state 
set to expire in 3 weeks 
in an effort to 
a federal match in the form of 
215 000 jobs in november after adding 
adding 44 000 in october and 17 
and 17 000 in september in the 
000 in september in the wake of 
of 43 percent in the third quarter 
november s increase in payroll the largest

to americans investing in america 
hiring and buying in this economy 
increased federal revenues in the process 
they quantifiably aided in shortening and curtailing 
bill would result in higher taxes on 
relief is not in our package because 
it passed yesterday in the house by 
it is not in this package because 
we do here in washington as it 
goes down bringing in food and fiber 
and every day in our manufacturing facilities 
and working hard in an expanding and 
in fact a record 
and our role in that is to 
opportunity to put in place policies that 
that keep inflation in check keep interest 
the tax burden in their lives 
in fact there has 
69 percent increase in s amp p 
the corresponding increase in companies paying dividends 
in fact it typically 
they have invested in their whole lives 
since the change in the tax that 
we did here in that small policy 
policy changed behavior in the business world 
in fact disproportionately seniors 
to put policies in place that do 
individuals own stock in america 
this bill puts in place a policy 
americans to invest in america 
and the gentleman in reference to his 
over 100 billion in the last year 
choose the winners in american society and 
winners and losers in economic policy and 
of their opportunities in this country 
at paying less in taxes on capital 
at paying less in taxes on dividends 
incentives that are in there for higher 
economic ripple effect in the community 
can to trade in an increasingly complex 
trying to invest in america who understand 
americans who participate in our capital market 
jobs and opportunity in otherwise blighted areas 
moved through here in an expeditious manner 
have this expires in 3 weeks unless 
several important components in this tax relief 
doing the bill in the committee from 
not being included in the reconciliation bill 
we passed yesterday in the suspension calendar 
into this trap in getting the alternative 
would be placed in the reconciliation bill 
next year rather in their tax burden 
and much smaller in number 
really think that in this holiday season 
had your priorities in terms of protecting 
to at least in this holiday season 
a substantial reduction in capital gains and 
effective until sometime in 2009 and 2010 
that has happened in iraq and if 
get better here in the united states 
revenue loss and in the last few 
and in this holiday season 
to join them in letting people know 
least among us in order to do 
or 3 billion in terms of expenses 
terms of expenses in iraq which if 
that victory is in sight and we 
to lose confidence in all of government 
of the people in the united states 
have some trust in the republicans because 
to have victory in war we have 
to include it in reconciliation 
it is in our bill 
so my friends in this holiday season 
and the republicans in this house because 
to have victory in the middle east 
tomorrow then sometime in the future 
minimum tax is in the other body 
today are not in the other body 
but is protected in the other body 
which is protected in our bill but 
but is not in their bill 
the 20 billion in capital gains and 
that not expire in 2009 
degree of urgency in this and unless 
is no urgency in this 
and acknowledged expert in this on the 
he will be in the majority in 
in the majority in the next few 
worthwhile that are in the majority s 
have an opportunity in the substitute to 
that we have in our country and 
and do it in this christmas season 
of the wealthy in years ahead since 
give them relief in a decade 
care of them in the bill that 
that are important in our substitute 
in this holiday season 
the poorest people in this country 
that you should in order to pay 
to really consider in this holiday season 
that have kids in foster care these 
any equity involved in this 
people who died in hurricane katrina did 
really is not in sharp conflict with 
and did suggest in the brief time 
as we do in our substitute but 
the suspension calendar in the house is 
not include right in this bill that 
not do it in this season nor 
is a difference in what we believe 
what we believe in 
we could find in this bill not 
we have it in the back if 
are other people in this country that 
so in order to have 
want to do in this substitute 
3 card molly in new york 
they got caught in the alternative minimum 
because you believe in it and put 
and put it in the reconciliation bill 
in 3 card molly 
that they said in the civil rights 
did come up in the house 
enough to put in the reconciliation bill 
i rise today in strong support of 
of 2005 and in opposition to the 
prevent massive increases in the alternative minimum 
scheduled to expire in just a matter 
so many jobs in our community 
supported amt relief in the house for 
with less money in their wallets on 
mr speaker earlier in this debate a 
winning the house in 1994 
the aisle that in 1999 the republican 
unfortunately no democrats in the house supported 
remind members that in 1993 as an 
i rise today in strong opposition to 
instead of investing in american families this 
emergency first responders in the case of 
a costly war in iraq unprecedented spending 
for hurricane relief in the gulf and 
middleclass americans first in line for tax 
a nice step in the right direction 
we are proposing in the budget is 
we cut taxes in 2003 we would 
reversed the decline in jobs and we 
the deficit projection in 2004 was 521 
that would expire in 2008 on dividends 
that the reduction in capital gains does 
my folks in florida want to 
people in new york they 
sharp and competitive in the world market 
and find one in five will benefit 
dividends was reduced in may of 2003 
to a situation in 2008 where the 
the 50 billion in the budget tax 
add 56 billion in tax giveaways we 
in fact we end 
the largest deficit in our country s 
the purse strings in our hands reveals 
proposed 56 billion in cuts 50 percent 
000 or less in other words those 
of 9 billion in iraq is what 
not a court in this country which 
of enforcing accountability in government 
sadly in the face of 
their food stamps in the budget cuts 
constituents have invested in their elected representatives 
which was investment in the middle class 
middle class investment in society investment in 
in society investment in education investment in 
in education investment in opportunity investment in 
in opportunity investment in the future not 
future not investment in the rich 
the only way in the world they 
by burying them in other bills not 
hard to see in the aggregate how 
6 months bearing in mind that every 
is a provision in this bill a

aisle to vote in favor of this 
any single entity in the house of 
aspects of oceans21 in your bill that 
in 6 months june 
democrats and republicans in the house which 
little expertise with in any way 
it brings people in democrats republicans 
people who work in all the various 
evaluate to analyze in a very clinical 
colleagues to vote in favor of the 
it will put in place a mechanism 
speaker i rise in opposition to this 
almost 100 million in public moneys that 
have the expertise in the committees 
have done that in other cases 
is not interested in doing that 
mr speaker in 2003 the pew 
our oceans were in serious trouble 
our oceans are in peril from degraded 
that are mentioned in the commission s 
now today in the face of 
mean real progress in dealing with the 
already quite prescriptive in its instructions to 
another 400 000 in taxpayers money on 
no legislative jurisdiction in this task force 
lot of legislation in the rules committee 
seen bills written in the rules committee 
they have put in legislative form and 
coastal business owners in my district they 
and what is in our oceans 
from maryland was in fact wrong on 
ocean policy study in the commerce committee 
again it says in the resolution this 
times written them in the rules committee 
of its kind in over thirty years 
professionals with expertise in policy economics science 
a better job in six months time 
the commission did in three years is 
to those made in the 2003 report 
sleeves and working in a bipartisan fashion 
councils can perform in a more transparent 
i rise today in support of the 
have been here in the congress i 
but as highlighted in the more than 
200 recommendations contained in the us commission 
that has existed in the committee system 
a chief sponsor in the house of 
true sea change in the way we 
we recognize that in order to make 
committed to help in this effort in 
in this effort in a very direct 
deal of time in working with leadership 
process problem here in that the oceans21 
see passed is in the jurisdiction of 
that this bill in this term is 
staff already have in place 
in fact no action 
in that circumstance there 
to coordinate efforts in an efficient manner 
however in this case the 
in fact there is 
very serious flaws in the bill can 
was not made in order under this 
bias or favoritism in favor of highly 
be worked out in the conference 
that places them in our highest income 
must be put in place to ensure 
over 3 billion in earned pension benefits 
is a crisis in america when it 
legislation that will in fact protect american 
workers and retirees in the pensions that 
of the aisle in order to develop 
possible taxpayer bailout in the future 
it will in fact ensure that 
corporation that is in fact facing a 
percent we will in fact reduce the 
major labor group in america as well 
finely tuned balance in this bill and 
and i do in fact believe that 
the gentleman knows in the rules committee 
last night and in a letter to 
make a substitute in order 
contain tax issues in there that were 
is no one in this house who 
i have been in the minority 
i have been in your position 
we stymie debate in the house we 
tax issues involved in what you were 
worker pension laws in more than a 
during my years in the house 
it is comprehensive in nature and it 
in short our bill 
is inherently comprehensive in nature 
no longer kept in the dark about 
terminated their plans in which executives enjoy 
worker pensions is in dire financial condition 
some 450 billion in pension plan underfunding 
the bill back in june i was 
and employer groups in support of these 
purposely skewed modeling in an effort to 
pension protection act in a negative manner 
pension systems currently in place 
with these concerns in mind i would 
with the senate in this effort and 
that are interested in this both on 
involved are addressed in a bipartisan fashion 
on comprehensive reforms in an expeditious manner 
for 20 years in your father s 
technically retirement benefits in the true sense 
have an interest in this as well 
virtually every employer in america who has 
if they are in the 8090 percent 
has a bump in the road it 
under 60 and in deep trouble 
create real havoc in the marketplace 
credit balances will in fact strengthen these 
you find traditionally in the trucking industry 
about much today in this debate and 
multiemployer pension system in this plan that 
on both sides in the multiemployer sector 
to put rules in place so that 
glad they are in the bill 
many in the management sector 
the management sector in every large business 
be on board in support of this 
is everything perfect in the bill 
deal with this in conference 
do not put in jeopardy the 7 
speaker i rise in opposition to the 
the massive underfunding in worker pensions and 
90 percent or in some cases only 
that we have in the underlying bill 
any funding shortfall in their plan 
rules that are in place today are 
rules to stay in place again does 
modified yield curve in the underlying bill 
have and should in fact stay in 
in fact stay in the bill 
i rise today in strong support of 
for his inclusion in the pension protection 
they will vest in their regular pension 
if they participate in one of the 
for example in houston the average 
is fully vested in the regular pension 
firefighter can participate in the deferred plan 
age 53 and in general will not 
the effort began in 2002 when my 
mr speaker in closing i want 
including section 905 in the house bill 
in fact the pension 
the right balance in ensuring the plans 
pension plans are in danger of having 
their pension funding in order 
in addition the ways 
included in hr 2830 are 
men and women in combat and provides 
pension improvements established in 2001 
this pension bill in the ways and 
being lower only in the short term 
but actually starting in 2010 contributions to 
the funding reforms in the bill are 
bill are phased in over 5 years 
issue and step in and fix rules 
congress to step in and reform singleemployer 
98 working people in the united states 
pension funding rules in place which ends 
the funding rules in the underlying bill 
billion surtax contained in it on small 
of this bill in my view will
