that they have on the country and 
will be chiseling on some of the 
month cut back on what we are 
we are doing on job training or 
but if persons on the majority side

years of progress on protecting the quality 
this basic assault on the health of 
to the vote on the ground that 
is an attack on our public health 
washington bill drafted on k street by 
is an attack on our public health 
even those not on federal land

to triple damage on all excess profits 
all excess profits on companies that have 
to crack down on those who are

two cents worth on what we feel 
want to dwell on a word or 
if you look on page 18 on 
on page 18 on how it would 
it is starting on line 9 we 
that sets us on a forwardlooking course 
is overly dependent on a single energy 
to designate sites on federal lands including 
in a letter on behalf of the 
an oil refinery on a military base

and commerce committee on this bill and 
more debate especially on the issue of 
reduce its dependence on imported oil we 
have tough penalties on price gouging 
a complete debate on the availability of 
a debate on gasoline needs to 
a discrete debate on fuel economy just 
during the debate on past energy bills 
and open debate on the single measure 
can not open on time or they 
watching this debate on tv i hope 
and put us on the right track 
it relies exclusively on the federal trade 
mr speaker relying on a sorry bunch 
for his leadership on this issue of 
s overall dependence on gasoline and oil 
to crack down on those trying to 
reduce our reliance on foreign oil 
that comes on top of doubledigit 
they will pay on average an additional 
and putting food on their table 
present for debate on rollcall vote no

the emphasis is on the cost of

mr gingrey xz4001510 on this he certainly 
gentleman can comment on some of the 
focus so much on helping to change

fellow who was on his hands and 
talk that continues on spending too much 
are spending it on 
continuing to spend on wasteful or fraudulent 
need to work on those disparities of 
those children early on and that is

and not emotionbased on this

wants to comment on them they can 
not from putting on too many calories 
the legal system on the one hand 
have been working on pending legislation 
that may be on the horizon in 
see many people on the floor 
costs and fees on the food industry 
impose its will on the states and 
the last time on the floor 
be so intent on getting a particular 
enough facts here on each and every 
that the argument on the other side 
we have heard on the other side 
for their work on this legislation and 
legislative days left on the calendar and 
appreciate a debate on any of those 
554 my colleagues on the other side 
care system is on an unsustainable path 
and its impact on the american health 
i have voted on it a number 
that we voted on before and the 
one we voted on before that it 
we may later on this week restaurants 
afford to settle on cases that they 
never ever settle on under any other 
it comes up on the floor 
and the infringement on our second amendment 
we must focus on the perpetrators of 
legal teams bent on destroying the firearms 
these lawsuits rest on the misguided notion 
of action based on negligence defective product 
industry from liability on any drug that 
and a ban on armorpiercing bullets 
must vote no on the overall bill 
a direct assault on our civil justice 
from being heard on the floor today 
expanded the ban on armorpiercing bullets also 
strong no vote on this bill 
of the committee on rules i call 
of the committee on the judiciary 
we open debate on the rule for 
puts more stress on firearm manufacturers their 
consume before calling on the gentlewoman from 
in the committee on the judiciary 
think the vote on that particular bill 
of the committee on the judiciary 
successful in court on these grounds 
that this bill on the house side 
do the math on the other side 
of the committee on energy and commerce 
the previous question on the resolution 
reconsider was laid on the table 
firearms industry based on the criminal behavior 
in arms act on several occasions 
are often based on the dubious premise 
from lawsuits based on the criminal or 
a terrible burden on parties 
and public money on a losing lawsuit 
why not go on and sue the 
that are currently on the books 
who will speak on this issue later 
expands existing prohibitions on armorpiercing bullets to 
hear suits based on the sale of

have to sit on this body to 
sell those guns on the street that 
a shameful attack on the legal rights 
enacted this ban on machine guns semiautomatic 
the general ban on lawsuits against gun 
measure is based on my belief that 
to vote no on s 397 and 
issues that come on to this floor 
that was operated on because once the 
want to have on our streets 
come on 
hearing this debate on the second amendment 
that are already on the books 
enforce the laws on the books then 
that are already on the books 
spent every year on health care loss 
a wonderful job on handling this issue 
put extraordinary pressure on members and certainly 
they keep statistics on this

serial numbers stamped on them and were 
general background checks on its employees 
to vote no on the rule and 
our understanding based on my conversations with 
to vote no on this bill 
standing on the street danny

are having today on this issue 
impact not only on our freedoms but 
our freedoms but on our national security

the tax burden on american workers to 
for this bill on final passage

hoping to vote on an amendment protecting 
of the committee on education and the 
now on the other hand 
of the committee on education and the 
shame on you for depriving 
majority seems intent on giving them quite 
deeper deficit going on top of 8

days of work on this and it 
they were depending on for retirement and 
a bright light on exactly what big

its potential effect on definedbenefit pension plans 
would increase claims on the federal government

as the center on budget and policy 
stands sound policy on its head i 
need to act on this subject i 
i think that on balance the bill 
the fact that on average at least 
about that here on the house floor 
and open debate on an issue so 
put employee representatives on the trustee board 
lack employee representation on their boards 
caused severe hardship on employees who have 
who have depended on their pensions as 
and accurate information on a timely basis 
to follow through on the financial commitment 
time when everyone on my block in 
million retirees depend on defined benefit plans 
put additional pressure on an agency that 
restriction is imposed on executives 
who are depending on these retirement plans 
be more transparent on this issue 
for those members on the other side 
and vote yes on hr 2830 
they can rely on 
their retirement future on that promise 
by going back on their promise to 
they could count on 
it we rely on it you can 
to go back on their word 
during the debate on the bill itself 
they depend on the retirement benefits
