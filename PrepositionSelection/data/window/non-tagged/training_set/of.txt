checked the history of this 
to the best of my knowledge and 
more recent couple of decades perhaps a 
perhaps a couple of times 
not suggesting any of them are not 
some problems because of the volume of 
of the volume of the medals and 
done in sort of an unusual procedure 
are the veterans of the civil war 
are all kinds of groups out there 
congressional gold medal of honor has always 
what the history of it is 
a great recognition of what we consider 
a limited number of individuals which was 
what the intent of it was 
a whole lot of ways of recognizing 
lot of ways of recognizing groups 
is the intent of what we are 
in the history of it 
at the history of these congressional gold 
telling in terms of what we are 
so in terms of the groups i 
is not disrespectful of any group that 
in that criteria of measurement 
is how many of these should we 
first of all the history 
all the history of the gold medal 
at the history of this 
the total history of it has been 
confusing in terms of what we are 
and that kind of thing but we 
official or somebody of that nature usually 
medals much more of a distinction than 
do so many of these 
first of all this is 
very reasonable member of congress and we 
here in terms of what we are 
this a medal of true distinction for 
for true heroes of the united states 
the united states of america 
we sort of learn techniques in 
or big gatherings of people and pass 
got a lot of signatures when i 
in the course of 2 years is 
made a couple of these points before 
not i sort of doubt it at 
the time most of us are around 
know the politics of people like george 
countries a number of individuals who received 
in the congress of the united states 
in the history of the gold medals 
on the business of the commemorative coins 
coins a number of the sponsors in 
noticed a lot of politics in this 
it is sort of a necessary strain 
edison or somebody of that ilk of 
of that ilk of that nature and 
to the chairman of the committee and 
you generally sort of preclear it and 
had a surplus of these 
do not know of any time where 
a political point of view 
frankly most of these bills while 
seen a bit of politics in these 
think the limiting of the numbers is 
in an element of politics that frankly 
fact the chairman of the full committee 
medal enhancement act of 2005 while introduced 
order for consideration of gold medals involves 
under the rules of the committee on 
gain the cosponsorship of twothirds of the 
cosponsorship of twothirds of the house before

address the root of the problem here 
under the guise of national security 
instead of debating hr 418

the successful enactment of the intelligence reform 
terrorism prevention act of 2004 and working 
orderly and reflective of the needs of 
of the needs of american families businesses 
a total repeal of all of those 
repeal of all of those laws or 
or a waiver of all those laws 
myself the balance of my time 
heard a lot of talk here today 
not a recommendation of the 911 commission

analyzes section 102 of hr 418 the 
102 captioned waiver of laws necessary for 
necessary for improvement of barriers at borders 
provides the secretary of homeland security with 
the expeditious construction of the barriers authorized 
constructed by 102 of the illegal immigration 
immigration responsibility act of 1996 iirira pl 
comparable to 102 of hr 418 and 
and outlines some of the legal issues 
102 section 102 of hr 418 would 
amend 102 c of iirira to read 
any other provision of law the secretary 
law the secretary of homeland security shall 
ensure expeditious construction of the barriers and 
any other provision of law statutory or 
by the secretary of homeland security pursuant 
provide the secretary of homeland security with 
the expeditious construction of the barriers and 
roads under 102 of iirira but the 
in 102 c of iirira 
include a waiver of protections established in 
ensure expeditious construction of the barriers and 
and the number of laws waived vary 
is the use of the phrase notwithstanding 
any other provision of law while the 
while the use of a broad notwithstanding 
any other provision of law infrequently governs 
preempt the application of other laws 
the preemptive effect of a statute 
after a review of federal law primarily 
identical to that of 102 of hr 
that of 102 of hr 418 ie 
provides a secretary of an executive agency 
waive a grouping of similar laws

any procedural requirements of law or regulation

similar to that of 102 but contain 
to waive provisions of federal law he 
construction or operation of crude oil transportation 
demonstrate the breadth of waiver authority granted 
granted by 102 of hr 418 does 
102 c 2 of hr 418 appears 
preclude judicial review of a secretary s

shortages not all of them but it 
is taking care of as many as 
is taking care of reset

describe a couple of differences 
a discretionary savings of a little less

chairman this budget of course is a

over the course of the last several 
first of all the economy 
you consider all of those the unemployment

as a result of these budgets and 
one consequence of the low national

as a result of these budgets is 
as a result of the economic policies 
the previous budgets of the republican party 
by an average of 39 percent per 
wages and benefits of the workers producing 
from the rest of the world to

very difficult set of circumstances and those 
those difficult set of circumstances are particularly 
but that of course is universally 
all of these subcommittees have 
nevertheless in spite of that i think 
is one aspect of this bill however 
is an aspect of the bill that 
deficient but because of these deficiencies the 
a large number of american citizens 
fda the kinds of authority that it 
against the marketing of prescription drugs in 
to large numbers of the american people 
a lot of the people who 
the effect of these antidepressants on 
a deep sense of depression which in 
as a result of the use of 
of the use of vioxx have fallen 
as a result of the use of 
of the use of this prescription drug 
as a result of the failure of 
of the failure of this congress to 
fda the kind of authority it needs 
draw the attention of the members of 
of the members of this house to 
health and safety of the american people 
the unnecessary death of large numbers of 
of large numbers of americans and it 
placing so many of american citizens in 
in the kind of dangerous desperate circumstances 
in large numbers of people 
in the case of vioxx once that 
as a result of exposure to it 
the offlabel marketing of that drug particularly 
these are some of the major issues 
are facing one of the major deficiencies 
that the members of this congress will 
conduct postmarketing studies of fdaapproved drugs and 
to the labels of fdaapproved drugs 
doing to millions of people 
through the headlines of the last few 
of the two most 
significant drug failures of the last year 
an increased rate of suicide among users 
about these reports of suicide 
increased the risk of heart attacks and 
as a result of vioxx 
of these 30 to 
compared the number of heart attacks and 
are the equivalent of two to four 
about the dangers of vioxx more than 
the increased risk of heart disease 
causes increased risk of heart attacks and 
the fda learned of other studies indicating

proof in front of us every single 
ago the situation of antidepressants 
result large numbers of teenagers young people 
and the usage of those antidepressants induced 
people and many of them carried it 
to the use of those antidepressant drugs 
people this kind of experience has been

save the lives of tens of thousands 
lives of tens of thousands of people 
tens of thousands of people

hundreds of thousands of people in this 
that and all of that began to 
get the attention of the press and 
as a result of that 
by any stretch of the imagination 
get the kind of attention that it 
deserves on behalf of the safety and

who have conflicts of interest to fda

critically important nature of these committees there 
routinely waived conflict of interest prohibitions and

to be ashamed of that 
tell our grandchildren of which i have 
the entire debt of the united states 
the united states of america from 1789

all of the spending is 
so all of the spending but 
is very little of the pain 
fiscal sound management of the federal government 
last 4 years of the clinton administration 
the other side of the aisle including 
and the underfunding of priorities in this 
the inevitable consequence of the fiscal policies 
the fiscal policies of the republican majority 
the direct consequence of the republican party 
the proximate cause of this woefully underfunded 
nussle republican leader of the budget committee

the other side of the aisle can 
fund the priorities of this nation 
one of my republican predecessors 
reason a number of years ago 
within the context of the budget that 
the inevitable consequence of the most irresponsible 
in the history of our nation that 
we are pursuing of policies that have 
on that side of the aisle i 
tell my friends of policies that this 
deprive our government of the resources that 
at a time of record heating costs 
confusing that millions of seniors need and

drought but because of our own making 
for education and of course we do 
supporting veterans those of us who supported 
on the floor of the house and 
this direction and of course the gentleman

60 billion out of medicaid 
is a net of 44 billion in 
say the intent of the administration was 
60 billion out of medicaid 
the very heart of health care for 
with that kind of insult if you 
to the needs of americans around this 
for studying instances of waste but at 
most important element of this budget process 
purchasing power billions of constant dollars we 
will take care of social security 
is a mention of a social security 
medicaid the needs of our troops investment 
budget for all of us to support 
the needs of average americans are 
the interests of a wealthy few 
outweigh the needs of an entire nation 
this not out of partisanship but from 
from a statement of the facts 
to be proud of 
to address areas of critical need with 
about the greatness of our armed forces 
need some form of health care some 
for the rest of their lives because 
their lives because of the sacrifice they 
the current level of health care programs 
the entire department of veterans affairs is

bill falls short of achieving those goals 
despite the addition of modest funding increases 
and urge all of my colleagues to 
this bill full of misguided priorities 
during the course of the budget committee 
it is one of these moments today 
submit that one of the reasons i 
5year budget instead of a 10year budget 
budget is because of the complete breakdown 
what the costs of their budget will 
and the explosion of budget deficits in 
during the course of these next couple 
these next couple of days during the 
the longterm solvency of the social security 
is the result of budget decisions over 
4 consecutive years of budget surpluses is 
show the plummeting of the surpluses into 
rules as part of budget discipline and 
us 4 years of budget surpluses 2 
at the end of the 1990s 
ninety percent of the new debt 
number one holder of our debt 
it is kind of tough to engage 
he is fond of 
runs a deficit of 37 trillion over 
is probably one of the reasons why 
a great deal of respect for the 
for the chairman of the committee on 
is a friend of mine 
comes to support of the education programs 
improve the condition of education or access 
43 billion worth of education programs in 
also get rid of trio and gear 
with the lack of funding to back 
how the lack of education commitment at 
only 186 percent of the 40 percent 
to 4 years of budget surpluses while 
as a member of the committee on 
in a couple of days in order 
in the future of their countries 
and their lack of commitment for education 
a sure way of getting us there 
ignoring the issues of the day merely 
recognizing the importance of the milk income 
including an extension of the program in 
the longterm cost of iraq which already 
the full costs of the tax cuts 
very small amount of the overall budget 
projected budget deficit of 427 billion for 
the worst aspect of this budget is 
s the height of fiscal irresponsibility occurring 
could nt think of doing anything more 
as the father of two little boys 
leave a legacy of debt for them 
to climb out of 
a realistic cost of the iraq operation 
provide more supply of energy whether it 
not renewed all of those things add

reserve the balance of my time 
the contingency portion of the program has 
in the teeth of huge energy increases 
myself the balance of my time 
in the teeth of the fact that 
hear a lot of talk on this 
falls far short of our responsibilities in

the majority side of the aisle said 
they are fond of pointing to the 
top 1 percent of earners and they 
done virtually all of it by borrowing 
also the actions of the last week 
what the priorities of the majority party 
because of the incredibly confusing 
on both sides of the aisle for 
a good number of good people to 
bad product because of the allocation but 
will reconsider some of the mistakes in

on both sides of the aisle there 
been a lot of expression of concern 
lot of expression of concern about the 
the deficit and of course i am 
with the philosophy of government rather than 
endorse the type of government that we 
a small group of people on many 
not even conceive of the idea of 
of the idea of having a strict 
a strict interpretation of the constitution and 
interview with one of our members and 
in the minds of many members of 
of many members of congress if there 
just absolutely opposite of what was intended 
by the authors of the constitution that 
understanding and following of the constitution has 
country a crisis of our personal liberties 
simply the ignoring of the constitution that 
accepted the notion of faith in government 
by the name of randolph bourne wrote 
is the health of the state and 
our liberties and of course we spend 
is the foundation of liberty because that 
what the goal of all government should 
be the preservation of liberty 
gentlewoman that one of the reasons why 
is the philosophy of government and our 
lose them out of the chemical industry

balanced in terms of our priorities and 
conducted the process of creating a budget 
for all points of view 
the great leadership of the gentleman from 
deficit my colleagues of 114 billion for 
for the month of february a deficit 
february a deficit of 114 billion is 
a record deficit of nearly 4 trillion 
the direct result of republican policies huge 
for a war of choice in iraq 
red ink because of republican budget irresponsibility 
the realistic cost of the war the 
war the cost of expiring tax provisions 
the true cost of fixing the alternative 
and the cost of any changes to 
honor the value of accountability including eliminating 
it heaps tons of debt onto our 
lower our standard of living 
and on top of all of that 
top of all of that the republican 
undermines the solvency of social security 
the real crisis of ballooning budget deficits 
until a high of 83 trillion in 
onto a trajectory of reckless budgeting that 
would be plenty of money to deal 
instead of doing that we 
had 3 years of surpluses 
surpluses imagine think of it

a whole host of things to help 
increase a number of programs while at 
well one of the ways that 
in the way of increases was to

put back some of those but we 
think the results of that are reflected

this unprecedented act of intrusion into a

section 9 of this bill includes 
includes a sense of congress that the

for the life of me i can 
all snatched out of our houses of 
of our houses of worship to run 
violate the trial of the judicial the 
right now because of the policy we 
sure a lot of people have heard 
it is none of our business 
the most personal of reasons a year 
this same kind of decision where my 
think the opponents of this measure have 
have discussed separation of powers and they 
discussed the importance of the legislative process 
all of those are important 
about the conditions of that life 
the appropriate course of action where terri 
and her quality of life 
there are issues of conflict of interest 
issues of conflict of interest and motivation

agree the impact of this legislation extends 
overturn the separation of powers by disregarding 
disregarding the laws of florida and the

ask one question of themselves 
tragic situation one of the most tragic 
about the will of the united states 
sadly regardless of what this congress

would allow either of terri s parents 
for the violation of any right under 
constitution or laws of the united states 
withholding or withdrawal of food fluids or 
have the effect of ending ms schiavo

heard a disparagement of the supreme court 
the supreme court of florida 
this is confirmation of what the writers 
what the writers of the constitution did 
they said separation of powers 
judges with cases of lawyers and presentations 
none of that has happened 
based on most of us knowing very 
have a separation of powers 
on a number of occasions with lawyers

the express desires of the patients are 
on the wishes of the patient these 
beyond the comprehension of those who have 
in the middle of this case after 
to the satisfaction of the courts all 
exhausted the writ of certiary denied by 
the supreme court of the united states 
to put one of those unelected federal 
in the middle of this and say 
with those kinds of procedures 
like the judgments of the florida courts 
in the history of this country and 
the constitution of the united states 
the same kind of legislation 
is a bill of attainder in effect

this heightened level of process the difference 
is a review of state court but 
about the rights of a disabled person

help her because of a judge s

this great nation of ours and for 
with the rest of the world 
is going on of whether or not 
with the leadership of our chairman the 
to come out of the committee with 
another strategic part of our valueadded energy 
one of the reasons i 
one of the other reasons 
800 000 barrels of refined fuel a 
so for twothirds of our consumption we 
relying for twothirds of the strategic element 
part of this bill we 
one of the reasons nobody 
that a lot of people in the 
permit 100 percent of the plant s 
for this country of ours 
for all of the good that 
to review some of the facts and 
is the amount of jobs of course 
amount of jobs of course that would 
the construction phase of building a new 
millions and millions of dollars but certainly 
a higher degree of professionalism 
as a result of that we are 
talking about some of these jobs that 
so one of the things that 
with the construction of the refinery along 
the potential operation of the refinery is 
been forthcoming because of the lack of 
of the lack of appreciation if you 
a lot of these highpaying jobs 
for the construction of the plants but 
the potential operations of them 
got tremendous possibilities of what it can 
today in support of the energy bill

instead of a positive plan

and the specialness of my colleagues 
discussing legislation that of its very name 
in the course of that legislation hr 
had our differences of opinion as it 
to the question of choice the ninth 
instance the question of parental consent 
note that those of us who may 
on the position of choice and the 
without counsel because of some tragedy in 
the vigorousness of the debate centered 
around the idea of the enormous range 
the enormous range of differences of opinion 
range of differences of opinion expressed by 
on my side of the aisle really 
on the structure of the legislation that 
provide a mode of transportation might in 
were a number of amendments being offered 
about this question of abortion and even 
under the age of majority 
were a number of amendments offered by 
particular the description of the amendment simply 
report a series of amendments were described 
an additional layer of federal court review 
on the floor of the house albeit 
vigorously in terms of the restraints it 
may be out of the pipeline and 
and be out of the child s 
all of these are terrible 
take their mode of transportation a taxicab 
or other mode of transportation not knowing 
a greater latitude of who to seek 
or first cousins of a minor then 
not the confusion of the states with 
with different bases of determining parental consent 
or first cousins of a minor and 
complete misconstruing of the amendment and 
the amendment and of the intent 
for a study of sexual predators who 
first of all might i 
in the prosecution of this particular entity 
very underlying crux of the bill parental 
follow that line of reasoning 
detailing the impact of the number of 
of the number of unsafe and illegal 
and the idea of course was to 
about the impact of this legislation 
a gao study of sexual predators 
on the floor of the house because 
seen the rash of attacks on our 
decapitated a couple of years ago as 
ago as cochair of the congressional children 
promote the extending of any criminal exemptions 
for the likes of those who prey 
a frivolous desire of any of us 
desire of any of us to stand 
to stand alongside of any member in 
know full well of their undying commitment 
why a number of members took to 
to the floor of the house to 
on the question of choice parental consent 
simple the prohibitions of this section do 
to go outside of the family home 
should be part of the rules of 
of the rules of this house that 
make really part of our institutional fabric

tell the story of america 
to the floor of the house and 
say the pledge of allegiance and the 
offers a word of prayer 
is for all of america to reflect 
find any sense of unity in this 
to the rules of this body and 
the simple reporting of the work we 
hope the correction of last week will 
simply the correction of that time but 
befitting or becoming of the debate albeit 
protect the integrity of this record 
in the furor of debate sometimes we 
on the flag of the united states 
in the heat of debate words flare 
in the course of the debate and 
about the integrity of this process and 
owed that kind of respect 
in a moment of evenhandedness to suggest 
that this kind of mischaracterization not take 
in the committees of the house the 
conciseness and integrity of the process which 
nonargumentative objective reporting of the work of 
of the work of an individual member 
in the direction of members who leave 
in the backdrop of some heinous criminal 
in texas because of the amber alert

the negative impact of this legislation if 
procedures might occur of this legislation where 
they were fearful of getting parental consent

muddies the water of the good intentions

first of all under ahps 
see skyscrapers full of these folks all 
are the backbone of our economy and 
coverage is one of the biggest problems

on our side of the aisle 
that as one of the health bills 
that in light of the fact you 
is a lot of discussion on this 
on this side of the aisle about 
to the close of business on monday 
have some notice of that in time 
gentleman inform us of the status of

these positive aspects of the bill i 
the larger goal of the legislation which 
substitute the department of labor will establish 
completed 3 months of service 
one of the most important 
health fairness act of 2005 
a large part of that burden because

the clear course of action here is 
to use economies of scale to their 
the administrative cost of state mandates 
speaker the cost of providing health care 
my home state of texas one in 
a small number of people 
is a lack of competition in the 
so instead of one individual company 
the us chamber of commerce to the 
50 different sets of mandated benefits in 
some of the mandates that 
up the cost of premiums 
lets these sort of selfinsured plans use 
use one set of federal rules not 
years before enactment of the law in 
moreover the department of labor would be 
with the oversight of these plans and 
the department of labor has testified 
is the point of the legislation 
one uniform set of benefits lowers administrative

back the balance of my time 
mr speaker first of all i want 
in the city of cleveland 
organization representing many of our smaller enterprises 
for a piece of legislation that will 
the same kind of coverage that everybody 
what is also of particular concern to 
that the people of america and the 
the skyrocketing cost of health insurance 
a big part of the solution 
in my hometown of orlando florida and 
here is why of the 45 million 
care for millions of americans now without 
the happy privilege of flying down to 
on march 18 of this year 
small business bill of rights that passed 
for the passage of association health plans 
pay in terms of premium is another 
their bottom line of profit 
that is out of any control that 
of course they do 
but the fact of the matter is 
the fact of the matter is 
the way out of this problem is 
of course it is 
surprise to any of us 
the insurance pool of federal employees we 
our share irrespective of whether someone is 
all of us should be 
for the grace of god go you 
the fact of the matter is 
for the grace of god go you 
and i all of us have an 
be any one of us that is 
think any one of us would be 
same coverage all of us as federal 
as federal members of congress receive 
speak in support of this substitute the 
solution for many of the fortyfive million 
to have millions of hard working employed 
relieve the burden of increased health care 
the unique needs of small businesses but 
businesses the courtesy of providing a plan

the rising cost of health care and 
associations including 41 of the states attorneys 
the national association of insurance commissioners the 
the national conference of state legislatures all 
state legislatures all of whom recognize this 
debating any type of health care policy 
today does plenty of harm 
indicates that adoption of this ahp legislation 
raise the ranks of the uninsured by 
increase the number of uninsured which is 
are not part of an association who 
shows that adoption of this bill would 
leave 20 million of the workers with 
a study out of georgetown university that 
shows that adoption of this bill and 
increase the likelihood of greater fraud and 
in the department of labor with insufficient 
because of that the state 
stated the elimination of the state role 
are a lot of reasons why the 
that is one of the reasons it 
that so many of our small businesses 
one of the reasons we 
the chairman of the full committee 
93 percent approval of ahps 
for any type of legislative proposal that 
the rising cost of health care that 
there is plenty of places where this 
the true deficiencies of this legislation but 
is an organization of some of the 
organization of some of the largest chambers 
the largest chambers of commerce and some 
commerce and some of the biggest local 
the country all of which see this 
from the passage of ahps would be 
worsen the state of health care for 
cbo found most of the enrollment in 
more concentrated group of people 
to address one of the most pressing 
most pressing issues of the day and 
in the nature of a substitute 
the successful takeoff of the latest space 
at the conclusion of that mission 
the rising cost of health care the 
through a number of years and there 
in desperate need of emergency medical attention 
today one of the major factors 
to the multitude of small business owners 
the high costs of health care and 
the growing ranks of the uninsured which 
the vast majority of them are working 
and the shortfalls of the underlying associated 
coverage to millions of americans while keeping 
with the competition of the marketplace and 
coverage to millions of federal employees but 
it is one of the more amazing 
more amazing aspects of this debate that 
take political advantage of saying listen states 
a minimum guarantee of coverage one that 
offering this type of coverage and that 
certain minimal safeguards of health care coverage 
again an analysis of our bill would 
increase the coverage of the uninsured help 
is for all of these reasons and 
reserve the balance of my time 
appreciates the role of states and consumer 
clarify a couple of facts 
i have all of the respect and 
for the chair of our committee but 
a closer reading of the substitute bill 
rather the department of labor would contract 
coauthor and codrafter of this substitute amendment 
rather take millions of people off the 
off the ranks of the uninsured rather 
understands the importance of maintaining consumer protections 
to the amount of money set aside 
been a part of this bill in 
myself the balance of my time 
it is one of the main reasons 
recent years because of the hesitancy of 
of the hesitancy of so many businesses 
additional workers because of the associated rising 
holding so many of our workers back 
recent years because of the additional costs 
costs coming out of their pockets to 
why so many of the governors and 
and so many of the attorneys general 
and the commissioners of insurance the association 
insurance the association of state legislatures in 
in their analysis of the underlying bill 
one of the issues that 
again the fact of the federal preemption 
to the department of labor would lead 
to an explosion of fraud and abuse 
with these types of plans throughout the 
is a history of fraud and abuse 
been the history of health care regulation 
upon the concept of a purchasing pool

the other side of the aisle 
increase their level of participation they want 
to the bottom of this and yet 
1 section 8 of the constitution that 
very important part of the reason the 
have that sense of solidarity and so 
saying on behalf of the gentleman from 
the other side of the aisle appointed 
with our quest of trying to ensure 
i urge support of this very important 
back the balance of my time 
make the point of order that a 
a bipartisan commission of experts to investigate 
failures and flaws of the system just 
led to enactment of legislation that helped 
the purpose of a 911like independent 
from this point of origin 
and the beginnings of this commission or 
or the beginnings of this select committee 
a whitewash because of the long list 
the long list of items that my 
the true cost of the prescription drug 
the former head of fema talked about 
trend has emerged of awarding nobid contracts 
points out many of these companies have 
been fined millions of dollars for overbilling 
guiding the awarding of contracts to the 
to the rebuilding of new orleans 
has the integrity of this body and 
not the best of america in the 
in the sense of government s response 
saw the best of america from the 
or other type of disaster hits this 
today in support of house resolution 437 
madam speaker some of my colleagues on 
the other side of the aisle oppose 
oppose the idea of a bipartisan congressional 
that an investigation of what happened begin 
devastation the magnitude of which becomes more 
madam speaker one of america s greatest 
our longstanding tradition of pulling together in 
together in times of need 
my home state of washington which is 
have contributed truckloads of worldclass apples to 
the best interests of our nation prevail 
the primary focus of this bipartisan investigative 
a proven history of lax oversight of 
of lax oversight of the administration and 
welcomed the resignation of fema director michael 
the important job of fema chief the 
failure and that of the entire bush 
realized the gravity of the situation days 
preempted untold numbers of deaths did the 
from the vigors of ranch life and 
dipping the wing of air force one 
a full account of the political and 
fact 71 percent of the public said 
the republican majority of this congress consistently 
ask tough questions of the administration or 
iraq unlawful disclosure of a cia agent 
that 76 percent of americans support the 
support the creation of an independent commission 
examine the conduct of the federal government 
help the victims of katrina first secondly 
spending a lot of money and thirdly 
and the women of the national guard 
and other elements of the federal government 
that the majority of this house will 
having meaningful oversight of keeping it inhouse 
keeping it inhouse of not having independence 
that 76 percent of americans support an 
republican senator vitter of louisiana whose constituents 
the other side of the aisle regarding 
regarding the creation of real oversight 
investigating the actions of a democratic administration 
foremost as members of the bush team 
addressing the question of hurricane katrina without 
without thanking all of the enormous outpouring 
outpouring from americans of charity and concern 
into the state of texas and now 
one of the first things 
apologize on behalf of the federal government 
hear their story of pain i again 
collapse and ineffectiveness of our ability to 
deploy in advance of hurricane katrina to 
to the saving of lives or in 
a pathway out of mississippi or alabama 
and the acceptance of responsibility by the 
the idea of a commission similar 
us that one of the key elements 
the key elements of failure in 911 
was the lack of interoperability 
as a member of the homeland security 
homeland security committee of the congress i 
the citizens of louisiana mississippi and 
than the citizens of new york and 
the citizens of those states the 
states the residents of the city of 
of the city of new orleans deserve 
the great city of new york 
the spouses of so many of 
of so many of our members who 
the citizens of louisiana and mississippi 
the great city of new orleans deserve 
an independent investigation of why the response 
fell so short of expectations 
a full accounting of what went wrong 
at all levels of government so such 
support the appointment of a nonpartisan independent 
to the bottom of this 
into every aspect of the preparation and 
that 76 percent of the public supports 
supports the creation of an independent commission 
the leadership of the house badly 
the clear wishes of the american people 
the leadership of the house will 
and a measure of public accountability not 
before the house of representatives and also 
chair and all of the hardworking members 
the hardworking members of this congress 
alabama and some of the other surrounding 
at the contrast of what exactly the 
been a lot of words a lot 
words a lot of federal jet fuel 
jet fuel burned of the president and 
been a lack of organized congressional visits 
through on some of these statements that 
make a bucket of money on the 
on the back of tragedy and cut 
not in solidarity of the reason why 
a select committee of the oversight of 
of the oversight of what happened in 
that the people of the south are 
i know many of the 30 something 
in the history of the congress and 
this country outside of a war supplemental 
that are victims of this hurricane will 
a national day of prayer over at 
act on behalf of those individuals that 
stand in judgment of politicians 
stand in judgment of the majority in 
to the bottom of this even if 
the state one of the affected states 
rise on behalf of these individuals who 
folks and all of those folks had 
are better because of it 
the first idea of the congress or 
members on behalf of their families who 
to be one of those things like 
of course 
in section 5 of the joint operations 
to the bottom of it 
if a member of congress wanted to 
take money out of your own pocket 
race katrina lessons of a national shame 
not an issue of being partisan 
is an issue of telling the truth 
with the council of ranking members said 
fema was out of money 
have a lot of law and order 
miami just south of my district in 
with the director of the hurricane center 
called the mayor of new orleans on 
is an act of god 
to the bottom of what happened 
have a lot of show and a 
and a lot of folks getting excited 
american people members of congress no matter 
on this side of the aisle it 
finding stuff because of the 911 commission 
state agencies because of their work 
it is one of the best pieces 
the best pieces of legislation that has 
talking about members of congress giving them 
votes on behalf of what we know 
for the members of this house on 
on both sides of the aisle and 
are taking care of the evacuees taking 
evacuees taking care of these americans but 
sure that members of this congress feel 
is a picture of i may say 
talking to one of the fema parttime 
is a row of people actually behind 
many of these individuals some 
these individuals some of them returned back 
to the evacuation of poor people there 
the democratic side of the aisle that 
call the leader of the free world 
are a lot of people who did 
are a lot of people that are 
many of them did not 
on both sides of the aisle that 
not run out of oxygen because the 
memory on behalf of them make sure 
all of this could have 
all of this could have 
and white people of goodwill saying that 
get the attention of the government that 
have the kind of representation they deserve 
the last day of a work week 
get the attention of the majority of 
of the majority of the house 
on both sides of the aisle 
the other side of the congress and 
just another piece of legislation 
people ran out of oxygen 
folks ran out of insulin 
on the side of the road and 
maybe all of us have made 
a 911 kind of a commission i 
to the bottom of it and to 
horror the horror of people dying and 
floating not because of katrina but because 
katrina but because of lack of response 
because of lack of response because the 
broke and because of a lack of 
of a lack of administrative duties and 
a 911 kind of commission for the 
is due some of them had an 
some 70 percent of them say they 
praying on behalf of these individuals but

as a representative of a state in 
every other member of congress if i 
many lost constituents of the 700some that 
lost and some of those people were 
with a lot of the other pieces 
the other pieces of legislation that either

five of the top eight 
had this kind of tragedy 
with the number of electoral votes in 
there with billions of dollars prior to 
have this kind of cronyism going on 
make a lot of donations to posts 
ago 70 percent of the american people 
is 70 percent of the american people 
people 70 percent of those responding 
that with all of the challenges that 
wee little bit of their tax cut 
giving millionaires hundreds of thousands of dollars 
hundreds of thousands of dollars back and 
are already hundreds of billions of dollars 
hundreds of billions of dollars into the 
to take all of them back 
billions and billions of dollars for bp 
and a lot of these so i 
to take care of fema and fix 
weeks a component of that is what 
have a lot of disposable income are 
of course they are 
call for all of us in public 
that five out of eight of the 
out of eight of the top appointments 
weapons of mass destruction go 
two republican members of congress who passed 
the prevailing wage of that area for 
send them billions of dollars 
are wasting all of their time all 
the wall instead of overlooking and seeing 
with the reconstruction of katrina as we 
which wasted billions of dollars no oversight 
dollars no oversight of halliburton no oversight 
halliburton no oversight of all of these 
oversight of all of these people who 
one more component of that 
to get rid of the unions they 
to get rid of prevailing wage 
along the lines of it is a 
is a waste of money because the 
seventy percent of the people in 
have an ounce of power on this 
that 70 percent of them who want 
get the kind of commission that the 
little over half of it was under 
you the ratio of this committee we 
getting 9 out of the 20 spots 
during that period of time 
that any member of this house or 
or any member of either party would

or the destruction of property because it 
a whole lot of sense 
the way one of the recommendations that 
that came out of the independent body 
an awful lot of money to be 
for all kinds of things and that 
actually taken out of the disaster relief 
oversight committee independent of the congress not 
spent 200 billion of american taxpayers money

in their hour of need 
side that one of our constitutional duties 
duties as representatives of the will of 
of the will of the people is 
represent the will of the people of 
of the people of the united states

leadership the will of the american people

of the citizens of our nation want 
over 60 percent of republicans want an 
apparently the people of the united states 
fact that thousands of men women and 
fact that hundreds of thousands more have 
orleans by tens of millions of dollars 
tens of millions of dollars only so 
that later thousands of lives would be 
needlessly lost tens of billions of dollars 
tens of billions of dollars would have 
really a case of being penny wise 
the political survival of the leadership than 
the actual survival of the people 
and the scope of the investigation will 
be the whim of the leadership of 
of the leadership of the majority 
the idea of having a truly 
would joint control of the committee s 
instead of this platitudes promising 
better the creation of an independent commission 
all of this is obvious 
we the members of the minority are 
in the wake of disaster comes hypocrisy 
with its assurances of a fair and 
and honest investigation of the failures of 
of the failures of the federal response 
are the product of wishful thinking as 
a sincere review of recent history the 
arguments in favor of this bill 
created the department of homeland security and 
publicize their lack of vision and errors 
morning that none of this matters 
that any member of this body would 
to the bottom of the failures 
cases destroy investigations of government failings when 
would any of them like to 
reject the findings of that body 
that the creation of the 911 commission 
abdication and denial of our constitutional responsibility

that concerns all of us on both 
on both sides of the aisle 
while the rhetoric of the house often 
the only part of the discussion that 
made in terms of what is needed 
hear is discussions of who is paying 
be an issue of who is paying 
important really much of this comes down 
an open discussion of what we are 
the national center of health statistics 83 
statistics 83 percent of children in this 
under 18 years of age have excellent 
now 17 percent of america s children 
the american academy of pediatrics 63 million 
children over twothirds of all uninsured children 
know the state of pennsylvania where i 
insurance for children of a low income 
beyond the level of medicaid there are 
cutting money out of medicaid or other 
to the growth of medicaid 
about half of americans are covered 
by some level of federal insurance or 
is growing out of control 
we take care of so many needs 
without finding ways of eliminating waste and 
about an amount of some 44 billion 
just a matter of that 
one of the things that 
that says one of the definitions of 
of the definitions of insanity is doing 
from the center of health transformation they 
patients on pieces of paper 
talking to one of our colleagues today 
sonogram was done of his wife who 
down and collapses of its own expense 
a lot of what people think 
all the elements of diet and medications 
about 10 percent of the cases that 
percent or more of patients who show 
was given ahead of time whether it 
save massive amounts of money 
actually save billions of dollars in the 
a lot of this can be 
like 14 percent of the charts reviewed 
in the majority of these cases the 
not a matter of just saying we 
a critical component of health care of 
of health care of having the physician 
is a matter of having productive interaction 
is a system of interaction between the 
a lot of this is done 
done in areas of low income levels 
low income levels of high risk populations 
is a matter of doing more effective 
is going out of control they do 
to change some of your habits and 
demanding some answers of changing some of 
of changing some of that system 
in the area of prenatal care 
one of the critical areas 
about these aspects of prenatal care and 
us about some of the elements of 
of the elements of saving money by 
to be aware of not only head 
a great example of success 
at the center of the child s 
into the role of parent and not 
in the role of parent and that 
is the area of childhood obesity 
a bill out of the house that 
eats too much of or unhealthy snacks 
be the state of illinois that still 
or in front of the television less 
here the proportion of obese children has 
and increased incidences of disease associated with 
estimated annual cost of obesityrelated diseases in 
billion annual cost of obesityrelated diseases

to 17 years of age increased from 
is a lack of physical exercise 386 
exercise 386 percent of united states adults 
looking at ways of managing this we 
cover the costs of the outcome at 
at the end of the line 
on these issues of teaching their children 
we as members of congress are talking 
working on prevention of obesity rather than 
at the end of the line for 
for so much of the increases in 
as a matter of fact 
this on top of their other physical 
kids the butt of jokes a sad 
condition and many of these children also 
in the area of mental health is 
from a couple of different angles 
are some sign of softness that perhaps 
from the days of the salem witch 
crazy loony out of control retarded in 
as a sign of weakness instead of 
of weakness instead of a real disease 
in the area of children s mental 
that the myth of psychological disorders and 
just like some of us may be 
the flu some of us may eat 
them as part of their own biological 
means a combination of the biological and 
we take care of these environmental causes 
that causes some of these difficulties with 
at all lines of children 
as the outcome of the hurricanes in 
reach the level of posttraumatic stress disorder 
is also matters of counseling and therapy 
just a matter of talking to someone 
is a matter of very strategic scientifically 
well to some of the talk therapy 
more severe levels of depression medication it 
fund in areas of medicaid and everywhere 
and followup assessment of these 
you a couple of examples 
was a lot of discussion about some 
are a couple of important factors 
one 75 percent of psychiatric medications are 
system and brain of how they process 
to the debilitation of depression but it 
interestingly enough one of the things we 
better with symptoms of depression the risk 
more effective ways of spending money the 
anxiety disorders all of these with a 
is the crux of this 
is a matter of having accurate diagnosis 
in both areas of the conservative far 
is a matter of making sure the 
together with people of various professions and 
in the area of children s health 
to a couple of things here and 
on a couple of questions 
but one of the things to 
which is one of the most common 
a higher incidence of depression stroke 
25 percent chance of having depression 
than the rest of the population 
as 70 percent of patients with chronic 
to 65 percent of them will have 
well as some of the psychological ones 
looking at some of these more comprehensive 
chronic care models of how we need 
a modern system of health care and 
more advanced forms of bringing technology and 
smoking being one of the risk factors 
region has some of the highest maternal 
is a lot of complications can come 
an important part of prenatal care for 
understanding the importance of helping a mother 
comment on some of the complications that 
indirect medical cost of smoking in this 
of course another reason 
is the state of california for example 
overall cost savings of 84 billion in 
colleagues are aware of this we never 
an accurate measure of what it actually 
actually saved because of the way the 
cost x number of dollars the cbo 
that frustrates all of us because the 
a recent review of health promotion and 
months reduced some of the claims by 
their community instead of showing up in 
it is onefifth of the cost of 
of the cost of going there rather 
than the cost of going to the 
it is one of those things you 
it is of fundamental importance to 
i am reminded of the story of 
of the story of the fellow who 
at the end of that dark ally 
at the end of that dark ally 
medical issues instead of looking at the 
president s plan of a community health 
fourfifths the cost of the emergency visits 
an incredible amount of savings but not 
it is one of those things where 
do not know of anybody who has 
not taking care of the disparity of 
of the disparity of outcomes between for 
on those disparities of outcomes and make 
we take care of those children early 
why the issue of community health centers 
now some of the public that 
it is one of those things in 
a massive amount of cost savings 
only that aspect of the cost of 
of the cost of that medication instead 
that medication instead of all the other 
in this area of health care 
mention a couple of final comments here 
certainly the stewards of the people s 
take the place of the family we 
in the areas of such things as 
and integrated care of all of those 
care of all of those things together 
is a matter of doing what is 
is a matter of pooling our resources 
in the context of the child and 
by the hundreds of thousands and to 
by the hundreds of billions of dollars

on both sides of that issue let 
feel the pain of the losers 
the short end of the recommendation one 
hear out those of us who had 
competent professional staff of brac was even 
soandso a lot of people want to 
and every one of them 
but the fact of the matter is 
all be proud of

make the best of a bad situation

the overall scheme of the air force 
maybe a gain of 15 to 25 
make a heck of a lot of

instead of going from 26

chairman this round of brac is illadvised 
not a fan of us doing this 
before the approval of this round we 
brac for many of the reasons that 
crises in times of war and peace 
raise a number of questions about the 
any future use of the existing brac 
had in all of the brac processes 
to those of my colleagues who 
out that disapproval of the brac 2005 
yet another round of base closures in 
be at risk of closure or realignment 
hope that all of my colleagues will 
is another round of brac in the 
any of us who represent

for all of these reasons i

we would all of our communities that 
the same kinds of results as we 
would ask each of my colleagues to 
possibly can out of this for the 
for the defense of this country 
back the balance of my time 
reluctantly in support of this motion 
here through three of these and i 
by the standards of win lose or 
in a lot of ways in this 
because four out of five facilities in 
my opinion much of what one of 
of what one of their components does 
in 130s out of mansfield 
have closed much of our flight training 
i was chairman of the milcon if 
that the department of defense recommendation to 
a cost instead of a savings to 
vote in support of the resolution 
support this resolution of disapproval on the 
benefit the state of ohio and the

understand the importance of community leaders and 
ohio had some of the most hardworking 
working on behalf of our state s

history is full of valuable lessons 
use the benefits of hindsight and the 
and the facts of history to support 
undeniably to opportunities of growth and prosperity 
staggering debt load of our children and 
neglect the ramifications of the budget priorities 
the budget priorities of the majority party 
to the detriment of the country 
deficits the number of uninsured americans is 
and the cost of health care and 
in the wake of the house cutting 
in the name of deficit reduction 
at the reality of our fiscal situation 
can be part of a reasonable approach 
as robert bixby of the nonpartisan concord 
on the floor of the house 
from that side of the aisle 
rewards the benefactors of the republican party 
look at one of the elements of 
of the elements of the not raising 
have a lot of people coming to 
have a lot of dividend paying stocks 
about the sea of red ink they 
so a couple of weeks ago we 
on this side of the aisle by 
an extension of the dividend tax 
on the sea of red ink that 
is up eighttenths of a percent over 
sector job growth of any administration since 
the grand success of trickle down 
their corrupt coterie of cronies 
the white flag of surrender 
at a time of war republicans demand 
is over half of the people of 
of the people of the united states 
get an average of 30 maybe enough 
a full tank of gas 
in the form of endless national debt 
for the rest of us 
in strong support of this rule and 
a hardworking member of the rules committee 
at the end of the day will 
all know that of that proverbial saying 
nearly 60 percent of american families are 
families are members of the investor class 
have some kind of investment 
percent 30 percent of the members of 
of the members of the investor class 
these important things of course we all 
well the fact of the matter is 
certainly a left of center government 
with a number of people in new 
them the prospect of establishing a capital 
the mere establishment of a capital gains 
to the economy of new zealand 
for another couple of years to plan 
the other side of the aisle regularly 
we had sort of beaten that one 
seen the creation of 4 12 million 
had a reduction of 94 billion in 
deficit simply because of economic growth simply 
growth simply because of the enhanced flow 
the enhanced flow of revenues to come 
next year because of hurricane katrina and 
can so many of us to try 
but the fact of the matter is 
with the challenges of investing in all 
i can think of nothing nothing worse 
potential future growth of our economy than 
already record level of minority home ownership 
tired old arguments of the past are 
in strong support of this very modest 
especially in support of the deduction for 
my home state of tennessee and many 
and many millions of people throughout this 
teachers pay out of their own pockets 
the wealthy and of course i am 
important to millions of people throughout this 
i urge passage of this bill 
on the heels of a deficit reduction 
what kind of congress calls this 
republican congress but of course 
coupled on top of skyrocketing health care 
fiftythree percent of the benefits of 
of the benefits of this tax cut 
and 62 percent of the benefits go

speaker 54 percent of those families receiving 
income had incomes of less than 75 
received an average of 1 400 in 
their taxes because of the existing tax 
the productive sector of the american economy 
would the lapse of the reduced rates 
the seed corn of our economy and 
in strong support of the rangel substitute 
the latest installment of the failed republican 
finances and much of our economy 
to the values of balanced budgets to 
in a period of robust broadbased economic 
bill represents more of the same 
raises the taxes of nearly 17 million 
to the families of our soldiers in 
basically a reflection of what our inflation 
for the percentage of which our economy 
on the accumulation of capital what we 
be paying upwards of 20 percent more 
which penalizes upwards of 80 percent of 
of 80 percent of the people i 
speak on behalf of this rule and 
and every member of this house is 
are the engine of a jobcreating economy 
speaker the opponents of this tax relief 
reduction with claims of and i have 
package includes extensions of tax incentives that 
includes mostly extensions of current tax cuts

the opponents of this bill would 
all of these people will 
and every member of this house has 
for the sake of economic growth and 
for the sake of the american taxpayer 
rise in support of hr 4297 because 
the other side of the aisle you

most of them have children 
to be out of the house all 
to the passage of this legislation we 
just 12 percent of growth never exceeded 
averaged 33 percent of growth and have 
that happens because of the capital gains 
the other side of the aisle apparently 
the last couple of years including terrorist 
seen an increase of job creation 
at the end of august and the 
and the beginning of september expected that 
to use more of their money instead 
their money instead of sending it to 
creation in some of our older towns

previous tax cuts of over a trillion 
upward the quality of our democracy is 
for the least of the brethren you 
is a transfer of wealth to the 
the great mass of americans to a

it is all of the spending that 
is the beginning of a plutocracy by 
continuing the acceleration of wealth upwards 
stock and assessment of what these tax 
in this country of what these tax 
class to survive of what these tax 
ignoring in terms of trying to protect 
to take stock of this 
and the arc of our moral fiber 
in strong support of the rangel substitute 
instead of stopping a tax 
what kind of priorities favor the

a projected deficit of more than 300 
in the wake of hurricanes katrina rita 
not afford all of these emergency expenses 
more than half of all families with 
at the end of the year 
the taxfree status of combat pay 
best of all the substitute 
tax policies instead of the reverse robin 
rise in support of the democratic alternative 
bill is more of the same more 
president s policy of stay the course 
more of the same is 
for the families of those serving in 
fully offset instead of pushing the country 
more than onehalf of all taxpayers would 
average tax break of 32 000 
supporters of the capital gains 
would receive 87 of the benefit of

excess profits some of the bad things 
with the costs of keeping their businesses 
usually the champions of the environment cleaning 
out an extension of the active finance 
active finance section of subpart f that 
is a lot of big words 
they leave out of their bill 
the most glee of course by leaving 
fiftyeight percent of those who claim 
four 25 percent of americans who have 
nearly 60 percent of americans who claim 
income have incomes of 100 000 or 
they leave out of this bill mr

a lump of coal 
save that lump of coal because there 
is the lump of coal that the

at the top of the scale who 
one single penny of tax 
the united states of america should pay

the other side of the aisle that 
for the life of me i can 
on that side of the aisle to 
the distinguished chairman of the education committee 
millions and millions of americans a bill 
adversely impacts millions of americans and we 
totally shut out of this 
is not because of lack of time 
because of lack of time 
we have plenty of time today

this important kind of legislation should not

you bring most of the bills that

worse yet many of these women have 
put in years of hard work and 
already lost upwards of 75 percent of 
of 75 percent of their pensions

we as members of congress tell these 
all these years of paying into a

and a sense of celebration as iraqis 
run the gauntlet of violence to go 
in the house of representatives close down 
republicans a number of them stood up 
it affects millions of americans livelihoods and 
is the death of democracy in the 
gradual glacial process of destroying debate on

that amendment because of the autocratic nature 
the autocratic nature of the republican leadership 
middle class standard of living in the 
in the history of congress because this 
by which millions of american workers will 
lose the security of their golden years 
you will because of the accounts that 
is about millions of americans who do 
have the benefit of a union who 
have the benefit of collective bargaining because 
in a survey of the major employers 
association 60 percent of those people say 
make it billions of dollars worse over 
is the solvency of the pension guaranty 
is anticipating hundreds of billions of dollars 
hundreds of billions of dollars of potential 
billions of dollars of potential liabilities in

and a couple of hundred executives are 
this absolute problem of corruption of the 
problem of corruption of the rights of

to protect some of the retiree benefits 
the retiree benefits of people if pension 
to 100 billion of liabilities possibly coming 
maybe some of them will not 
not come because of this bill but 
bill but many of them will come

despite the testimony of a government hired 
nothing for thousands of pilots whose benefits 
a heavy penalty of those who retire 
the hardearned pensions of airline employees across 
into a heap of broken promises like 
chairman the sponsors of hr 2830 have 
hastens the unraveling of the pbgc and 
calling the offices of members of congress 
offices of members of congress in droves 
just like thousands of ibm employees who

is a question of whether the automobile 
about a decision of a business plan

at the end of the day there 
to exhaust all of their attempts to

by the laws of this nation to 
being punished because of the federal law

that the chairman of the committee on 
with the chairman of the ways and 
the majority leadership of this body worked 
out the consideration of other views to 
an ultimate resolution of this issue 
but the core of the bill is 
for depriving us of our alternative
