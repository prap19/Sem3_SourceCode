for the tenor of the debate today

skewing the outcome of experiments 
to explore all of the possibilities scientists 
all three kinds of stem cells adult 
for the sake of the millions suffering 
this is one of those great debates 
it is full of passion 
and the substance of this debate is 
in this form of research would require 
for the purpose of experimentation 
not think any of us want to 
humanity our sense of ethics for the 
that this form of research would someday 
brain cells instead of embryos there is 
at the substance of the debate 
gentleman s courtesy of yielding me this 
the same type of leadership that we 
in other areas of research technology and 
for the sake of life for the 
for the sake of health for the 
for the sake of our families i 
and the leadership of others on this 
by the conscience of each member and 
their own view of this and their 
deeply founded view of this 
on both sides of this aisle apparently 
is a matter of real conscience 
the very definition of life itself 
because of that i am 
on the side of those who believe 
this particular kind of research 
like the state of california recently decided 
the ethics of this issue as 
ownership and use of this research is 
the first principle of bioethics should be 
say that all of those concerns that 
the tax money of millions and millions 
millions and millions of taxpayers who believe 
in the history of mankind has been

of people many of whom are suffering 
these millions of patients as well 
opponents of this bill have

both sides of this debate owe 
that hold regardless of what we believe

thousands of people around the 
passage of this bill today

strict ethical guidelines of the national institutes 
the national institutes of health 
voluntarily by patients of invitro fertilization clinics

an important piece of legislation because it 
are a type of adult stem cells 
as a source of anything else but 
support all forms of stem cell research 
the greatest chance of discovering treatments and 
than a third of them have some 
have some kind of a disease that 
that is true of the figures in

vast almost all of them actually go 
be able instead of having it put 
for the benefit of all mankind 
today in support of hr 810 the 
just like all of you have had 
in the state of delaware are a 
reminder to me of this responsibility 
in the congress of the united states 
some of you may be 
that about onehalf of all visits to

that the practice of testing her blood

there are issues of such critical social 
that the congress of the united states 
thoughts perhaps some of the things i 
the united states of america out of 
of america out of 290 million who 
have some sort of illness that potentially 
by the use of embryonic stem cells 
most of those will never 
by the use of adult stem cells 
just the use of adult stem cells 
are a lot of lives that are

the national institutes of health said human 
in all tissues of the embryo except 
to specific subpopulations of cell types as 
there are discussions of dollars 
in the destruction of embryos at an 
not a lot of options 
one of them is to 
will be one of two decisions if 
about 400 000 of these embryos 
is an estimate of about 3 years 
a lot of people now if 
for research instead of hospital waste and 
get the kind of work that we 
that 14 out of the 15 diseases 
hope to tens of millions of americans 
tens of millions of americans and many 
sadly passage of this bill will 
in the position of sanctioning and funding 
funding the destruction of that human life 
combat the myriad of diseases that prematurely 
take the lives of our friends and 
am so supportive of the rapid progress 
in the fields of adult and umbilical 
become any kind of cell similar to 
that many proponents of this bill offer 
and research act of 2005 
as many of my colleagues have 
individuals in need of a cord blood 
the largest listing of cord blood units 
am particularly proud of the work of 
of the work of the nmdp especially 
blood and because of its partnership with 
is the cornerstone of an active clinical 
partners with 14 of the 20 us 
in the process of becoming partners 
the national inventory of cord blood available 
work helps thousands of americans with lifethreatening 
testing and delivery of units 
that the results of their searches allow 
to ensure consistency of the information that 
that is part of the registry 
with this type of support

in strong support of hr 810 
improving the lives of countless numbers of 
of countless numbers of people in this 
preventing the diseases of tomorrow today 
conducting the level of research that they 
some of those embryos cryogenically 
is an issue of life to me 
for the quality of life but i 
mr speaker most of my colleagues that 
a lot of times i disagree 
is that many of these stem cells 
look at some of the blood diseases 
the various members of this institution who 
urge the passage of both of these 
passage of both of these bills 
the particular passion of the gentlewoman from 
for the house of representatives 
for countless numbers of americans who need 
for 2 years of working with the 
to the power of this bill 
for a group of people who otherwise 
about the concept of principled difference because 
has it both of these approaches are 
we have all of our genius and 
genius and all of our brilliance as 
hopeful that all of the technological advances 
all the members of this institution i 
vote for both of these bills but 
as an example of what happens when 
be saved because of these two bills 
lead democratic sponsor of the cord blood 
in the absence of the federal government 
at the forefront of establishing a robust 
in the process of doing so 
to the vagaries of state electoral politics 
we are assured of good ethical guidelines 
is the product of a utilitarian world 
held the promise of life but are 
i urge passage of hr 810 
be a source of hematopoietic stem cells 
instead of proliferating they quickly 
useful in some of the early studies 
now the opponents of hr 810 say 
promising early stages of that research 
or the multitude of other diseases that 
now some of the opponents of 
of the opponents of hr 810 say 
were some indications of that were not 
in the eye of our colleague the 
hopkins university school of medicine and a

to a couple of comments 
first of all there is 
issued in august of 2001 has not

and of those lines all 
those lines all of them were contaminated 
cells and many of them were not 
1995 two members of congress mr dickey 
the other side of this debate say 
admission the majority of americans support this 
embryos as part of the process 
can decide one of two things number 
order in august of 2001 allowed stem 
are allowing more of those lines 
the other side of this issue would 
reserve the rest of my time for 
for the purpose of making a unanimous

the 201 cosponsors of this bill and 
from the bottom of their hearts 
the chief worth of civilization is just

intellectual efforts instead of simple uncoordinated ones 
ones the truth of justice holmes words 
in the state of scientific research 
on the verge of breakthroughs that will

tens of millions of americans 
understand the complexity of this issue 
slowing the process of ethical science and

speak in favor of the stem cell 
hope to millions of people suffering from 
the discovery of embryonic stem cells 
s various forms of brain and spinal 
and many types of cancer 
for the advancement of medical research there 
in the way of science 
with public oversight of these activities is 
research will be of the highest quality 
in the way of that progress 
change the lives of millions and i

the very core of politics 
nature and value of human life

proponents of medical research on 
the potential ends of medical breakthroughs down 
the deliberate destruction of unique living selfintegrated 
some incidental tangent of embryonic stem cell 
is the essence of the experiment 
some in hopes of saving others 
a utilitarian view of human life that 
the only kind of stem cell research 
and exciting avenues of inquiry all without

pushes the envelope of medical knowledge need 
or force people of goodwill to devalue 
is the opposite of such a choice 
dignity and value of every human person

could i inquire of the gentlewoman from 
for the culture of life his entire 
myself the balance of my time 
both sides of this debate wish 
against the authorization of federal taxpayer dollars 
on the destruction of human embryos is 
essence a question of the level of 
of the level of respect and dignity 
like the rest of us 
so was jesus of nazareth and shakespeare 
what level of respect and dignity 
for the destruction of that embryo through 
through the harvesting of the stem cells 
of course it is

embryos any shred of respect and dignity

a wide range of diseases while simultaneously 
rise in support of hr 810 the 
improved the quality of life for people 
to 47 years of age 
however because of important discoveries and 
over 76 years of age 
as a result of visionary leadership in 
as a result of political will and 
they occurred because of the private sector 
health and quality of life for millions 
life for millions of people 
the national institutes of health have proposed 
run the risk of missing an historic 
improve the lives of millions of i 
lives of millions of i understand that 
understand that many of the opponents of 
of the opponents of this legislation have 
discarded so defeat of this legislation would 
difficulties surrounding destruction of embryos 
and defeat of this legislation would 
deny innocent victims of terrible diseases the 
diseases the opportunity of relief from their 
suffering and healing of their afflictions 
this research because of the bright promise 
and well being of our families neighbors 
rise in support of hr 810 because 
studying every kind of stem cell from 
i am one of them 
me every day of my life 
are among some of the most talented 
a wider majority of americans support ethical 
the majority of bush supporters for 
will hear some of our colleagues talk 
the empty promise of embryonic stem cell 
requires the destruction of human life but 
the continuing advancement of adult stem cell 
has benefited thousands of americans already 
in the advancement of cordblood stem cells 
a rich source of stem cells umbilical 
to treat thousands of patients and more 
increase the number of cordblood units available 
on the recommendations of the institute of 
of the institute of medicine providing a 
xz4000180 the chairman of the committee yes 
delaware the sponsor of this bill you 
is a member of the human family 
is a member of the species homo 
just a bit of tissue 
suggested a couple of cells in a 
research a type of stem cell research 
a tiny member of the human family 
with the morals of our taxpayers 
president and ceo of the juvenile diabetes 
a strong supporter of destroying human embryos 
representing the values of the taxpayer 
first of all the gentleman 
is the subject of embryology 
a 4year period of time 6 months 
6 months worth of embryology and of 
of embryology and of course to hear 
process it sort of takes me back 
but i realize of course how difficult 
understand for members of the body 
there are 435 of us of course 
435 of us of course and just 
than a lot of our colleagues and 
and the chances of a natural conception 
injection and all of a sudden an 
and the miracle of birth can occur 
the national institutes of health 
in my community of marietta georgia by 
doing those kinds of things and it 
analogy that explanation of twinning and how 
away 50 percent of the cells and 
develop this technique of obtaining these stem 
which is destruction of life 
the other side of this argument say 
about the definition of preembryo but i 
my 30 years of experience in the 
at the moment of conception when that 
until the birth of the child 
my knowledge definition of a preembryo 
to just kind of follow on the 
can cure some of these dreaded diseases 
restore the function of his limbs and 
and even some of our colleagues need 
involves the destruction of human life a 
a little bit of luck and ingenuity 
be a member of this body some 
of course we were 
that the harvesting of these stem cells 
said that most of the private funding 
in strong support of the gentleman from 
and research act of 2005 and commend 
for the sanctity of life 
from the use of umbilical cord stem 
in the treatment of 67 diseases including 
in the destruction of innocent life embryonic 
gathered without knowledge of blood cell type 
already successful use of umbilical cord stem 
in the sanctity of life 
to every word of the debate as 
debate as part of my job as 
as a member of the rebuttal team 
my legal pad of notes and rebuts 
most of those rebuts are 
on my side of the aisle because 
have got plenty of rebuttals that i 
one of the gentlemen on 
on my side of the aisle said 
and the funding of that to provide 
to my state of georgia i ask 
in the sanctity of life and i 
are hundreds today of these snowflake children 
at the beginning of life 
an original cosponsor of the gentleman from 
the importance of this issue really 
the fact that of the socalled throwaway 
were 400 000 of them and that 
had no intention of having reimplanted 
but those of us who feel 
about the sanctity of life truly believe 
very oldest many of whom i would 
the final stages of their lives but 
lives but all of these lives are 
a lot more of those little lives 
hey maybe one of those would be 
an einstein one of these days the 
some of my colleagues say 
just 100 out of 400 000 that 
is a fourth of this body madam 
almost a fourth of 435 members of 
of 435 members of the house of 
of the house of representatives 
more importantly of course it could 
avoids this issue of destroying human life 
for the purpose of obtaining embryonic stem 
from maryland is of the same mindset 
the same mindset of wanting to do 
on both sides of the aisle this 
be a meeting of the minds 
strong family history of inheritable diseases something 
50 percent chance of having one of 
of having one of these lifethreatening eventually 
talking about one of the brightest members 
the brightest members of this body a 
physiologist a doctor of physiology who has 
physiology the functioning of the human body 
any organ system of the body 
is the study of physiology 
he knows of what he speaks 
understanding his depth of knowledge is far 
the physician members of this body have 
a deep amount of respect for him 
am fully supportive of it 
address this issue of trying to find 
and a lot of these diseases that 
to the best of our ability to 
are probably lots of complications false starts 
will be lots of money federal dollars 
president in august of 2001 was absolutely 
on the harvesting of stem cells embryonic 
in the destruction of human life 
unique full complement of dna that have 
that have all of their genetic material 
are the tiniest of human life little 
they want out of their reproductive life 
life and all of a sudden as 
are stones all of a sudden we 
a tragic loss of a child or 
child and all of a sudden maybe 
and the author of this bill the 
but a number of others who have 
is very supportive of this 
a companion piece of legislation as i 
on both sides of the aisle madam 
an obgyn physician of course i have 
experience with some of the processes that 
it is because of male infertility there 
in a lot of these infertility clinics 
in my state of georgia 
embryo he knows of what he speaks 
undoubtedly each of us on this 
between the effects of these two bills 
i support both of them 
is this element of embryonic cell research 
the diverse set of diseases that plague 
lost 4 years of robust research that 
opponents of this bill will 
the true promise of embryonic stem cells 
more in each of our communities know 
watched the progression of that terrible disease 
next generation instead of sticking our heads 
for the millions of americans suffering from 
a whole host of debilitating diseases is 
allow the use of surplus embryos from 
throughout is respectful of the value of 
of the value of life 
on both sides of the aisle in 
promise and potential of stem cell research 
it to generations of suffering americans and 
rise in support of the legislation to 
encompass a number of different kinds 
a number of them have already 
from this kind of research 
fact the university of pittsburgh in my 
regarding the use of bone marrow stem 
fund the destruction of embryos in order 
are a number of reasons that i 
though is one of the statements we 
were wonderful evidence of that 
is the list of success with embryonic 
the false promise of embryonic stem cell 
and hopeful research of embryonic stem cells 
in past years of blood transfusions and 
at the expense of supporting embryonic stem

acknowledging the limitations of adult stem cell

to all types of stem cells both 
president s policy of stopping this work 
the national institutes of health 
as a leader of research is now 
for the sake of those who are

very important part of this debate that 
the vast majority of those embryos are 
down the road of creating human embryos 
to need tens of thousands of women 
tens of thousands of women to donate 
down the path of cloning 
the same kind of arguments that have

ethically acceptable alternatives of adult stem research 
i am cochairman of the congressional diabetes 
very good friends of mine 
eliminating any type of research because that 
with all four of my friends who 
on the side of life 
affected the legality of this research 
is a matter of conscience for millions

protection from members of congress who value 
crass political use of the flag to 
question the patriotism of those who value 
in the service of our nation than 
is the burning of the flag 
invoking the sacrifice of our troops in 
a shameful exploitation of the patriotism and 
patriotism and courage of these fine and 
the civic equivalent of violating the commandment 
honor the sacrifice of our troops protect 
protect the rights of veterans

beyond the capability of any idiot with 
way to dispose of a tattered flag 
the same act of burning the flag

reflecting the war of 1812 in which 
of course not

the act of burning the flag

of jail except of course that probably 
for that violation of the law because 
is the danger of this amendment 
on the bill of rights is not 
up the bill of rights without even 
toward the bill of rights is offensive 
about the rights of a few malcontents 
whom even opponents of this amendment have 
none of us think that

shown a photograph of some americans protesting 
are not afraid of freedom even if 
tool the picture of the burning flag 
they are afraid of freedom 
a subversive idea of freedom 
not be afraid of freedom it is 
speaker the fact of the matter is 
have been thousands of amendments introduced thousands 
amendments introduced thousands of proposed amendments introduced 
to the constitution of the united states 
after the bill of rights 
every unpopular decision of the supreme court 
because the framers of the constitution were 
constitution were afraid of transient majorities 
they were afraid of emotion and they 
flag to dispose of it which is 
the approved method of disposing of it 
method of disposing of it 
the real essence of the crime 
and we dispose of this or this 
at the heart of free speech 
see any epidemic of people burning flags 
easier at times of emotion in the

in fact most of the amendments they 
this means some of the most controversial 
most controversial provisions of the bill would 
only two of the most controversial 
most alarming part of this bill is

the serious nature of the threat required 
i support most of the 166 provisions 
the 166 provisions of the patriot act 
the vast majority of these provisions which 
the permanent law of the land 
the 16 provisions of the patriot act 
the fundamental liberties of innocent americans if 
involve the power of the government to 
most basic liberties of citizens we included 
provisions for 14 of these sensitive provisions 
many of us voted for 
for much of the past four 
the experience of the last four 
blocked a number of important amendments democrats 
believe that many of these amendments would

that contains many of the improvements that 
that the leadership of the house has 
particular the lack of sunsets of key 
lack of sunsets of key provisions sunsets 
therefore oppose passage of this legislation today

without the approval of a judge and 
meaningful judicial review of the national security 
vote against passage of this legislation today 
a threemonth extension of the current patriot 
on the drafting of the patriot act 
know that most of what is in 
to the arrest of american citizens and 
and the holding of american citizens without 
example section 505 of the act grants 
for all sorts of personal records about 
more but all of this is without 
is without oversight of a court 
that the subject of the record was 
was an agent of a foreign power 
that the subject of the record is

to get some of these records and 
down this section of the act as 
act as violative of the constitution 
been used hundreds of times 
six pages back of redacted records but 
mention section 215 of the act 
to an agent of a foreign power 
some other section of the law perhaps 
americans are aware of this issue and 
rights in terms of reading and speaking 
it falls short of what is necessary 
not make some of the changes recommended 
for the requirement of oversight which i 
one of the things that 
i think any of us would agree 
and a couple of hundred million on 
are well aware of how deficient our 
is the crux of this problem not 
mr chairman many of us when we 
way the proponent of the amendment does

not a member of all well and 
the reduced number of jurors that is

many of these provisions should 
applaud the efforts of the conferees to 
reduce the extension of two key provisions 
phones and computers of a suspect and 
the library records of innocent people 
the senate version of this bill 
that this expansion of the secret service 
about the lack of independent judicial oversight 
commit horrific acts of violence against innocent 
most glaring example of the lack of 
of the lack of diligence that this 
legislation the leadership of this house has 
discuss the topic of civil liberties the 
1 year anniversary of the signing of

as a member of the homeland security 
understand the importance of providing our nation 
as cochairman of the congressional privacy 
the private lives of innocent americans which 
undermine the principles of liberty freedom of

rights and liberties of all americans more 
sacrifices too much of our liberty

changing our way of life 
from all types of people that 911

rights and liberties of our own citizens 
its vital function of oversight is one 
oversight is one of government s most 
many of the provisions in 
history that abuses of law enforcement powers 
some of the powers granted

removing the majority of these dangerous provisions 
to sunset all of these provisions again 
a short period of time 
when the department of justice fbi and 
in the constitution of the united states

of our tree of liberty will die 
the original intent of the patriot act 
a necessary responsibility of congress it can 
unlike the proponents of hr 3199 the 
a certain period of time because of 
of time because of their controversial nature 
were drafted 14 of these 16 provisions 
and while three of the most contentious 
even the names of the suspected person 
for the agent of foreign power 
severe substantive flaws of these sections and 
address the deficiencies of the 14 other 
instead of opting to apply 
is wrong regardless of whether we give 
most notable of the deficient provisions 
by highranking department of justice officials which 
a wide range of personal records 
secret warrantless searches of any records they 
the eventual relevancy of the retrieved records 
since the enactment of the patriot act 
only a handful of nsl investigations have 
information on tens of thousands of americans 
tens of thousands of americans 
and instead of deleting information on 
onto personal information of americans who have 
never been accused of any crime 
require the department of justice to report 
report the number of national security letters 
address the abuse of power and the 
and the unconstitutionality of the provision

a wide variety of special powers to 
rights and freedoms of our people in 
this a time of war and then 
be the rule of our country once 
on the idea of limited government and 
all but two of the sunset provisions 
against this expansion of government at the 
at the expense of the individual even 
the civil liberties of our people 
expand the power of government over our 
people in time of war because it 
furthering the cause of freedom in this 
rise in support of this motion 
a wide variety of special powers to 
terrorism an expansion of powers that we 
break into homes of american citizens without 
this dramatic expansion of federal power because 
in times of emergency it is 
increase the power of our government yet 
act had 16 of its sections sunsetted 
that the powers of government should be 
passed during times of war and crisis 
emergency powers of investigation should not 
about the use of emergency conditions to 
now the members of this body have 
on the issue of sunsets 
now each of us will have 
the other side of the aisle 
am asking all of my friends on 
on both sides of the aisle let 
limiting the power of government 
and the protection of civil liberties 
an honest discussion of this very significant 
for the purpose of making a unanimous 
in strong support of this motion to 
i am one of several if not 
not many members of congress who feel 
was an act of bad faith on 
on the part of those in this 
temporary sunsetted provisions of the patriot act 
the united states of america 
changes the balance of power in the 
and the limitations of power of the 
limitations of power of the policing authorities 
the policing authorities of the federal government 
tolerated by those of us who love 
to the protection of freedom 
second of all let me 
in a time of war and then 
for a time of peace is asking 
the major expansion of the police and 
and investigative powers of our government 
a necessary expansion of police powers in 
placed in all of these expanded police 
in this time of war 
about in terms of eliminating these sunsets 
support the expansion of those powers until 
so our way of life is changed 
the special grants of police power that 
for the duration of the war and 
a forced reexamination of these provisions to 
a permanent change of our way of 
of our way of life 
of course we are 
senate s version of the bill which 
the rest of the expansion of 
of the expansion of the police powers 
seizures the lowering of standards for logging 
the most questionable of the lot 
specifically section 206 of the house version 
the house version of the patriot act 
have the name of a specific suspect 
and financial records of any person in 
on one side of the aisle say 
an unconscionable invasion of privacy never justified 
and financial records of our citizens is 
in a time of war to secure 
granting the expansion of this police power 
as the expansion of a shorter term 
a shorter term of years to ensure 
have that kind of power in the 
in the hands of the federal police 
hate the openness of our society 
law the right of those of other 
right of those of other faiths to 
and the right of us to express 
is the enemy of freedom thus they 
the traditional limitations of our government here 
changed our way of life 
the police powers of the federal government 
a new standard of government would exist 
such an expansion of federal power and 
the american way of life 
reserve the balance of my time 
myself the balance of my time 
for that expansion of the police power 
just as most of my colleagues on 
the other side of the aisle and 
aisle and all of my colleagues on 
on this side of the aisle did 
did almost all of my colleagues on 
on this side of the aisle voted 
a certain number of years 4 years 
that the issues of those expanded authorities 
in this time of crisis 
during a moment of crisis 
the other side of the aisle 
is a guarantee of freedom 
rise in support of this rule but 
on the inclusion of 4year sunsets in 
in those sections of the patriot act 
and investigative powers of the federal government 
permanent the expansion of police powers which 
of the 16 sunset 
on only two of those 16

drastic permanent expansion of these powers being 
for the use of eavesdropping devices 
forever the balance of personal liberty and 
after the threat of islamic extremism is 
review by congress of all those dramatic 
those dramatic expansions of police power that 
passed during times of war and crisis 
emergency powers of investigation should not

a few members of congress who has 
add that none of us did anything 
come from many of the tools in

a grade instead of an f on 
most at risk of terrorist attack 
can meet some of the concerns expressed 
is a lot of individual information somewhere 
the relevant pieces of information and helping 
all those pieces of information together without 
address the concerns of the chairman of

were any violations of civil liberties during 
by the end of this year 
have no violations of civil liberties under 
of those 7 000 
under other parts of the law but 
bill is sort of splitting hairs 
require a certification of relevance before they 
and prevent acts of violence against american 
in other parts of the law like 
balance the security of our nation and 
and the liberties of our citizens 
the gravity of the situation is 
me or any of my colleagues in 
a justified sense of urgency resulted in 
put in place of another bill that 
or an extension of it 
met with hundreds of constituents in my 
found that americans of all stripes share 
house floor debate of this bill has 
many of my colleagues and 
is just more of the same 
all but two of the expiring provisions 
oversight and review of this legislation were 
rules committee both of which were rejected 
order the search of library and bookstore 
about a section of the bill that 
represents the will of the people or 
example a majority of members would probably 
both the needs of law enforcement to 
a strong supporter of law enforcement 
a strong supporter of civil liberties and 
in the name of security 
a justified sense of urgency resulted in 
many of us had little 
in the middle of the night 
have received thousands of letters from americans 
report is more of the same 
4 years two of the most controversial 
most controversial provisions of the bill including 
permanent 14 provisions of the patriot act 
letters are out of control with no 
that the needs of law enforcement can 
against this version of the patriot act 
some of the provisions that 
the privacy rights of innocent citizens are 
in the aftermath of september 11 2001 
potentially abusive invasions of privacy 
at the end of the day we 
develop a bill of which we can 
some of the provisions that 
the privacy rights of innocent citizens are 
the privacy rights of americans 
in the aftermath of september 11 2001 
potentially abusive invasions of privacy 
many of these concerns were 
conference abandoned many of the safeguards in 
in a number of areas 
focus on 2 of these issues the 
no judicial review of a national security 
allows the recipient of such a letter 
a mere showing of relevance thereby striking 
permit the recipient of a section 215 
the first amendment of the constitution 
version included many of the necessary safeguards 
unfortunately many of those provisions were 
voted in favor of mr conyers motion 
to the consideration of the senate passed 
against the passage of the conference report 
spread like moonshine of 50 years ago 
one of the innocent results 
results here though of fighting meth and 
and the production of meth are the 
that come out of these meth homes 
2003 came out of these meth homes 
and became wards of the state 
far are wards of the state 
with the aftermath of this deadly plague 
to the testimony of the attorneys general

in the interest of what has become 
in the belly of the airplanes of 
of the airplanes of all of our 
airplanes of all of our airlines 
violate the privacy of our citizens with 
security letters section of the patriot act 
ever being suspected of a crime without 
are the subject of an investigation 
on the recipient of a national security 
in one section of the law 215 
a clear violation of the fourth amendment 
government s collection of sensitive customer records 
the government seizure of these records constituted 
provided the recipients of national security letters 
the real meaning of section 505 
for the recipients of national security letters 
respect and protection of individual rights and 
about a provision of law both in 
is the target of an investigation or 
this amendment of mine is a 
through no fault of their own place 
themselves in danger of being harmed or 
this gag order of what happens when 
through no fault of their own that 
in one section of the law 215 
in the scheme of things perhaps it 
extend two sections of the patriot act 
14 other sections of the patriot act 
and the people of america should be 
worried about all of this all of 
of this all of what is being 
in the name of fighting terrorism 
undermine the constitution of the united states 
the united states of america 
in the scheme of things is not 
the best interest of americans 
the other side of the aisle who 
not the children of this nation the 
nation the children of the future it

in the congress of the united states 
questioning the wisdom of my colleagues on 
be a part of this charade of 
of this charade of the government doing

the other side of the aisle and 
on this side of the aisle 
guarantees us freedom of speech freedom of 
of speech freedom of movement freedom of 
of movement freedom of religion and freedom 
religion and freedom of privacy 
with every ounce of energy that we 
teaching the constitution of the united states 
and the history of this constitution about 
the original framing of it by way 
it by way of amendment 
on the floor of the congress of 
of the congress of the united states 
in the face of the constitution 
to be aware of it because when 
for the constitution of the united states 
with this kind of act 
back the balance of my time 
much the process of legislating is about 
when the events of 911 occurred we 
a tremendous job of doing that in 
between the rights of government on one 
and the rights of individuals on the 
and a number of my colleagues have 
by law enforcement of the powers that 
but the truth of the matter is 
the opposite direction of against government and 
reacting in favor of law enforcement now 
are a couple of statistics that you 
xz4003641 the department of justice said on 
153 times as of january 2005 
only 18 of those times were 
estimation an abuse of this provision because 
for the events of 911 and the 
accepted as residents of this country 
a shorter period of time and i 
there are plenty of myths about the 
put a few of them to rest 
one of them is the 
under the supervision of a federal judge 
be as part of a foreign terrorist 
the intention of the patriot act 
terrorist attack instead of just letting the 
some important strengthening of the act so 
authorize invasive violations of our medical records 
restricts freedom instead of expanding it 
in defense of freedom we are 
i believe many of my colleagues voted 
patriot act because of the sunset provisions 
all but two of the sunsets have 
as a matter of fact it is 
for a withdrawal of troops or questioning 
in the face of our own honesty 
and civil liberties of every american 
in this country of ours 
today in support of the usa patriot

16 important provisions of the law

the other side of the aisle know 
the creation of an outside independent

fully in support of that 
the distinguished chairman of the committee on 
did the house of representatives do in 
to the tragedy of 911 
every one of us is mindful 
us is mindful of our constitutional duty 
my home state of florida and some 
florida and some of the gulf coast 
three of them literally destroyed 
literally destroyed parts of the district that 
in the department of homeland security 
begged the committees of jurisdiction to hold 
a whole lot of lip service nothing 
and complete accounting of the 2001 terrorist 
xz4002720 and 156 of our colleagues yesterday 
part 76 percent of the american people 
controls the levers of government 
beneath a bunch of rocks to try 
with this type of political candor 
about the committees of jurisdiction already in 
about the failures of this congress and 
us represents more of the same 
at the end of this process is 
the purpose of the commission established 
the guiding principles of our national response 
both in terms of personnel and resources 
did a heck of a job 
be made up of members of congress 
up of members of congress and there 
and third some of the problems we 
the job of this congress is 
seventysix percent of the public want 
have a pattern of sweeping problems under 
under the rug of turning everything into 
on this side of the aisle have 
bipartisan in terms of its authority nor 
bipartisan in terms of its power nor 
bipartisan in terms of its subpoena power 
cronies in charge of the agency that 
is in charge of the safety of 
of the safety of the people of 
of the people of the united states 
congress powerful members of the senate and 
take resources out of and divert them 
on appropriations chairmen of both houses the 
the republican leadership of both houses are 
question 75 percent of the american people 
that the citizens of this country were 
to be asked of a republican president 
as the president of the united states 
protect the people of this country 
commend the members of the committee on 
is the author of the legislation along 
xz4002720 the chairman of our caucus on 
following the tragedy of 911 the american 
people of new york and 
us a tradition of transparency and finding 
prevents future loss of life 
so on behalf of the people in 
the federal response of fema fell so 
from every walk of life did not 
in the time of the immediate recovery 
questions and instead of having a sham 
have heard all of this discussion over 
help the people of the region rebuild 
to rid themselves of the toxic literally 
that is unworthy of this tragedy and 
the congressional role of oversight 
at the pump of gasoline for america 
by the committees of jurisdiction 
so the idea of this congress having 
role in terms of oversight in a 
this congress afraid of the truth 
this congress afraid of the truth 
down in favor of the people to 
in the manner of the 911 commission 
gave some level of truth to the 
gulf states many of them affected are 
perhaps as some of the people stricken 
at the time of 911 and in 
these people are of a different economic 
to the congress of the united states 
her beloved state of louisiana 
told us firsthand of what he has 
with the victims of katrina in the 
great grannies all of them not the 
warmth the generosity of the people of 
of the people of houston 
do not know of any city in 
eckels the commissioner of harris county representative 
help the victims of katrina 
still with all of the respect that 
and feeding still of course there is 
with the people of the region 
the recent failure of the federal government 
its ultimate duty of saving the lives 
saving the lives of its own people 
its own definition of responsibility 
the appalling aftermath of hurricane katrina which 
was the product of a combination of 
of a combination of failures failures of 
of failures failures of planning failures of 
of planning failures of execution failures of 
of execution failures of accountability 
is the responsibility of this body to 
behind so many of those failures 
to the tragedy of september 11 2001 
by the members of our government 
interests besides those of its own integrity 
and the good of the country 
to the tragedy of september 11 puts 
in the wake of hurricane katrina 
with a failure of leadership and openness 
the republican leadership of the house and 
for the creation of an overtly partisan 
give republicans control of every aspect of 
of every aspect of the proceedings and 
control the scope of the investigation 
controls the levers of government and as 
and the department of homeland security and 
the conflicts of interest that are 
but the members of the majority do 
that the structure of the committee is 
affair as evidence of this 
been the hallmark of this republican leadership 
concealed the department of health and human 
services real estimate of how much the 
investigate the role of top bush campaign 
and shameful treatment of detainees at guantanamo 
a handpicked group of witnesses to be 
support the creation of an independent commission 
are you afraid of 
by the politicians of one party charged 
is the creation of an independent commission 
commission an abdication of our responsibility 
be an abdication of our responsibilities 
supports the creation of such an independent 
over 160 members of this body representing 
than 100 million of our nation s 
supported the creation of such a commission 
in the eyes of the public 
fully 57 percent of the general population 
real independent investigation of katrina has taken 
but the findings of the congressional commission 
we have plenty of evidence to believe 
reserve the balance of my time 
xz4002630 a member of the committee on 
is an abdication of our authority why 
xz4006631 a member of the committee on 
myself the balance of my time 
the house instead of h res 437 
that 76 percent of americans in a 
that a commission of outside experts similar 
sixtyfour percent of republicans in that 
partisan politics instead of a republicancontrolled committee 
investigating the failings of a republicancontrolled administration 
upside down because of the failure of 
of the failure of governmental officials to 
to the impact of hurricane katrina 
that the text of the amendment be 
back the balance of my time 
make the point of order that a 
committee in charge of the investigation 
an original cosponsor of that amendment 
the government failures of hurricane katrina is 
an independent assessment of what happened 
as ranking member of the committee on 
together a timeline of events 
that the staff of the committee has 
shows the complexity of the issues and 
an independent assessment of what happened 
the other side of the aisle against 
indeed the type of commission proposed by 
view the devastation of the world trade 
console the families of the victims 
to my area of the country 
to take charge of this investigation 
for the good of the nation let 
the result of the vote was 
in their support of those in need 
to the tragedy of hundreds of thousands 
tragedy of hundreds of thousands of people 
hundreds of thousands of people who had 
escaped the wrath of the terrible storm 
in the way of food water or 
with the passage of time our outrage 
to the heart of the disaster yet 
was little sign of our federal relief 
aid the victims of katrina so too 
congress as part of the federal government 
therefore an element of the relief response 
following the tragedy of september 11 and 
my hometown of sacramento lies in 
at the confluence of two great rivers 
the constant threat of floods 
in identifying areas of weakness and making

than 1 percent of species listed have 
the entire history of the act 
error yet because of flaws in the 
mr chairman one of those species is 
the economic cost of its listing has 
and the rest of the alabama delegation 
i encourage all of my colleagues to 
with the section of the manager s 
a single type of activity dockbuilding from 
a key provision of the marine mammal 
by the state of florida and the 
by way of background this section 
the continued existence of endangered and threatened 
standard for protection of this wellloved species 
a whole succession of docks is likely 
idea what kind of precedent or implications 
to incidental take of marine mammals and 
bill just part of the manager s 
that the state of florida and the 
passed a version of the marine mammal 
protection act out of the committee on 
in the face of that process 
rise in support of hr 3824 the 
than 1 percent of endangered species have 
only helped 10 of 1 300 species 
thirtynine percent of the species are 
allowing the use of sound science 
blighted in portions of our communities 
flowerloving fly and of course the other 
on the flow of goods and others 
in the cities of colton and fontana 
california a handful of flies yes flies 
the city of fontana alone has 
50 million worth of land that has 
generate the kind of revenue that we 
think of the farmers not 
support the passage of this 
that both sides of the aisle have 
recognized the need of some modifications in 
by the name of john gochnauer 
to be broken of committing 98 errors 
which means out of every five times 
to preserve 12 of them giving that 
a batting average of 010 if you 
the john gochnauer of federal programs 
a good steward of the land your 
produce an attitude of distrust and hatred 
which is one of the reasons why 
from the fear of the federal government 
is probably one of the reasons why 
bill is one of those unique bills 
which a majority of both parties in 
is indeed one of modifications 
was in need of repair 
were not part of the endangered species 
though the directors of the levee said 
speaker the record of the endangered species 
has been one of jobs lost of 
of jobs lost of property restricted of 
of property restricted of homes destroyed and 
destroyed and sadly of human lives lost 
does that type of modification 
i have one of my good constituents 
bought 500 acres of land and found 
at the rate of 50 000 for 
to get rid of the endangered species 
that 90 percent of the habitat for 
preserve endangered species of all kinds is 
same old process of trying to threaten 
for actual recovery of species 
rise in support of this bipartisan substitute 
endangered species act of 2005 which does 
the special interests of private industry and 
and fiscal health of our great nation 
chosen by many of america s leaders 
endangered species act of 1973 tesra is 
furthering the degradation of species and compounding 
the early stages of rebuilding the gulf 
hundreds upon hundreds of billions of taxpayer 
hundreds of billions of taxpayer dollars 
rather the interests of private landowners 
the fiscal irresponsibility of this congress 
the high costs of fuel into their 
includes true protection of our endangered species 
and the development of fuel sources that 
how the proponents of the bill classify 
less about reform of the esa and 
for the exploitation of the environment 
in a state of stalemate for a 
for a number of years because the 
batting average analogy of my friend from 
through the heart of my congressional district 
many troubling aspects of this legislation 
in this administration of political appointees really 
in the name of science these are 
most troubling part of the legislation is 
compensating for loss of customary use 
providing a form of environmental blackmail and 
this radical rollback of the endangered species 
most egregious parts of the underlying bill 
the other side of the aisle that 
project that none of the changes are 
flood control act of 1965 
construct a series of control structures concrete 
on the equivalent of what is now 
since the beginning of the project the 
opposition to portions of the project 
none of the changes made 
the same level of protection 
current estimated cost of construction for the 
458 million as of the enactment of 
of the enactment of the fiscal year 
represents 87 percent of the federal government 
government s responsibility of 528 million with 
given the state of completion of the 
state of completion of the project the 
in reluctant support of this amendment 
critical habitat provisions of the esa which 
to the recovery of species 
against final passage of any legislation that 
most egregious parts of hr 3824 which 
make a mockery of science and conservation 
in the middle of a pennant race 
in strong support of the rule and 
a product worthy of the support of 
of the support of the entire house 
the current version of the bill was 
inside and outside of government has been 
service a bunch of outside groups that 
most fundamental rewrite of an environmental statute 
so many areas of agreement that we 
correct a couple of things 
first of all this is 
the list of areas of disagreement 
list of areas of disagreement are very 
bill embrace many of the provisions in 
the stated purpose of the bill to 
beyond the descriptions of the bill and 
most advertised feature of the bill is 
it gets rid of the current critical 
critical habitat provisions of the law and 
a full description of what the bill 
to get rid of the current critical 
of course there is 
all the provisions of current law that 
about every feature of law designed to 
example the review of federal actions to 
in fact many of its provisions the 
for so many of the bill s 
is one provision of hr 3824 that 
urge my colleagues of defeat hr 3824 
waves the banner of reform to distract 
in strong support of the substitute 
to thank all of our cosponsors for 
pretty good sampling of congressional centrists because 
require greater involvement of states in decisionmaking 
to 90 percent of the language in 
substitute every word of hr 3824 that 
and most of all what we 
reserve the balance of my time 
and valued member of the committee on 
reserve the balance of my time 
are a number of differences but a 
buy a parcel of land knowing that 
knowing that part of it could not 
be used because of the presence of 
of the presence of endangered species 
on the back of an envelope 
on other portions of the property make 
the steady stream of payments coming from 
in the statement of administration policy which 
is otherwise supportive of the bill in 
in part because of the provisions that 
the statement of administration policy warns 
put a lot of hard work into 
a whole lot of very good reasons 
to the taxpayers of america because boy 
emphasizes the need of small property owners 
back the balance of my time 
but the truth of the matter is 
for the sake of this bird due 
and unsubstantiated burdens of the endangered species 
rid their properties of liability 
learned a lot of lessons over time 
and other members of the house committee 
with a piece of legislation that protects 
an original cosponsor of this legislation 
mr chairman one of the most important 
most important aspects of hr 3824 deals 
the take prohibitions of section 9 it 
for foregone use of their property where 
that the use of that property would 
at the expense of our private landowners

the final passage of hr 3824 
one of the most effective 
is through development of habitat conservation plans 
ultimately improve conservation of species habitat by 
1 million acres of land 
plan cost tens of millions of dollars 
tens of millions of dollars to develop 
will cost upward of 1 billion to 
to its part of the agreement 
put a lot of time in to 
spent large amounts of money to put 
thank the chairman of the full committee 
and in support of the underlying bill 
many many years of hard work on 
count the number of democrats who voted 
than the number of democrats who voted 
have some kind of a compensatory process 
done a lot of litigation and have 
a great deal of pain in america 
get 70 percent of his costs back 
i urge support of the underlying bill 
feel that some of the statements by 
casinos as one of my colleagues said 
species act most of the provisions of 
of the provisions of the act as 
a longstanding right of this country to 
on this floor of over 400 members 
that in one of the eminent domain 
longstanding tradition here of protecting personal property 
47 million acres of california had to 
those in support of the substitute have 
about 90 percent of this bill was 
according to some of my colleagues of 
of my colleagues of putting the onus 
putting the onus of this bill mainly 
reality is most of the endangered species 
fact 90 percent of the endangered species 
as landmark use of environmental legislation for 
protection and conservation of threatened and endangered 
the ultimate goal of the act was 
support the goal of species protection and 
and ultimately delisting of species should be 
in full support of the threatened and 
offered by many of my colleagues eliminates 
currently the system of critical habitat designations 
almost onethird of the entire acreage 
the entire acreage of merced county where 
to enable recovery of endangered species without 
tied the development of a recovery plan 
to the designation of critical habitat 
by a number of my colleagues and 
i think many of my colleagues would 
and some members of the environmental community 
i am proud of this bill and 
i am proud of the work that

job as members of congress to do 
voting in favor of this bill

many of the opponents of

the fundamental goals of america s flagship 
recovery since enactment of the 32yearold endangered

taste in many of our mouths because 
with the cost of the wars in 
why a rewrite of the endangered species

millions of acres of land around the 
the critical habitat of endangered species and 
requires a review of all scientific and 
by a panel of outside scientists 
a central tenet of sound scientific research 
allow the secretary of the interior to 
at the expense of the taxpayer 
is a statement of our priorities as 
is an affirmation of our belief that 
simply the continuation of a decadelong assault 
has saved hundreds of species from extinction 
the annual review of ecological semantics calculated 
service 99 percent of the species ever 
and wildlife service of the listed species 
effort in terms of collaboration and i 
from the state of washington 
no part of the country has 
than the state of washington with the 
embodies those kinds of practical reforms which 
us the kind of potent tools necessary 
to prevent extinction of species and to 
are some aspects of this bill that 
time many supporters of the esa have 
for the conservation of species and then 
another provision of this bill is 
year die because of pesticides and if 
i can think of for birds and 
take it out of the interior appropriations 
to come out of somebody else s 
on the matter of endangered species and 
nature and conservation of natural resources 
friend the chairman of the committee 
him to know of my appreciation and 
very important piece of legislation that has 
large numbers of species which would 
that the success of the act i 
by the adoption of the manager s 
the legislative pronouncements of the congress and 
56 percent of the top prescription 
the wild many of which come from 
saved large numbers of animals who might 
is the core of esa and should 
creates new layers of bureaucracy 
important in terms of the recovery plan 
not in terms of whether the animal 
become a part of the decisionmaking rather 
in the creation of the recovery plan 
making the problem of recovery still more 
the real needs of small farmers landowners 
an intelligent review of this matter something 
in his statement of the administrative policy 
to the area of the legislation but 
address the concerns of all while at 
in strong support of the substitute 
supported by members of congress from every 
from every part of the country 
valuable bipartisan piece of legislation but it 
a strong definition of what is meant 
jeopardize continued existence of the species 
the core principle of esa and we 
an overwhelming vote of support in the 
in the interests of the landowners and 
the landowners and of the species that 
to cost billions of dollars potentially and 
and grover norquist of americans for tax

they get word of a threatened or 
the bill of the gentleman from 
many many thousands of dollars and a 
a great deal of worry 
this vital piece of legislation 
chairman for all of the effort that 
that 90 percent of this legislation was 
will be supportive of it 
that is demonstration of the fact that 
bring about reform of the endangered species 
back to one of the challenges that 
this represents part of riverside county and 
face the threat of fire 
the county of riverside said to 
followed the directive of the fire department 
were saved and of course those who 
their homes because of fire 
that the kind of reform that is 
diminish the kind of threat that does 
a big part of what this effort 
had a lot of impact as he 
in strong support of the threatened and 
want to first of all commend the

only one half of 1 percent of 
of 1 percent of the critical patients 
to get off of the endangered species 
only one half of 1 percent of 
of 1 percent of the species have 
to the mercy of the courts

99 cases out of 100 is nt

been removed because of poor data 
thought the intent of the esa was 
in section 10 of the bill creates 
resulting in recovery of more species 
intact the spirit of the esa 
as part of the farming community 
have heard stories of farmers afraid to 
their land because of the implication it 
esa was more of a burden on 
without the cooperation of landowners species recovery 
debate is because of the implication this 
on the management of the missouri river 
flood control act of 1944 authorized the 
the army corps of engineers to maintain 
the harmful effects of ddt and other 
and the passage of the original endangered 
for the registration of pesticides which harm

property owners regardless of what all the
