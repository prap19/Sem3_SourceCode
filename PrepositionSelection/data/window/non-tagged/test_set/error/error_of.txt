about 400 000 of these embryos   ------- PREDICTED: in
is an estimate of about 3 years   ------- PREDICTED: in

am so supportive of the rapid progress   ------- PREDICTED: in

that many proponents of this bill offer   ------- PREDICTED: in
and research act of 2005   ------- PREDICTED: in

conducting the level of research that they   ------- PREDICTED: in
is an issue of life to me   ------- PREDICTED: in
for the quality of life but i   ------- PREDICTED: in
mr speaker most of my colleagues that   ------- PREDICTED: in
is that many of these stem cells   ------- PREDICTED: in
look at some of the blood diseases   ------- PREDICTED: in
the various members of this institution who   ------- PREDICTED: in

we are assured of good ethical guidelines   ------- PREDICTED: in

held the promise of life but are   ------- PREDICTED: in
i urge passage of hr 810   ------- PREDICTED: in
be a source of hematopoietic stem cells   ------- PREDICTED: in
now the opponents of hr 810 say   ------- PREDICTED: in
promising early stages of that research   ------- PREDICTED: in

the other side of this debate say   ------- PREDICTED: in
admission the majority of americans support this   ------- PREDICTED: in
embryos as part of the process   ------- PREDICTED: in
can decide one of two things number   ------- PREDICTED: in
are allowing more of those lines   ------- PREDICTED: in
the other side of this issue would   ------- PREDICTED: in
reserve the rest of my time for   ------- PREDICTED: in

from the bottom of their hearts   ------- PREDICTED: in
the chief worth of civilization is just   ------- PREDICTED: in

intellectual efforts instead of simple uncoordinated ones   ------- PREDICTED: in
ones the truth of justice holmes words   ------- PREDICTED: in
that affect tens of millions of americans   ------- PREDICTED: in
understand the complexity of this issue   ------- PREDICTED: in
slowing the process of ethical science and   ------- PREDICTED: in
resources and coordination of the national institutes   ------- PREDICTED: in
the national institutes of health and without   ------- PREDICTED: in

diabetes and both of them have been   ------- PREDICTED: in

measures under suspension of the rules   ------- PREDICTED: in
a final list of those bills will   ------- PREDICTED: in

the military quality of life appropriations bill   ------- PREDICTED: in

knows and most of the members know   ------- PREDICTED: in
appropriations bills out of the house before   ------- PREDICTED: in
and the fourth of july to do   ------- PREDICTED: in
consider some type of shortterm extension next   ------- PREDICTED: in
working out any of our differences so   ------- PREDICTED: in
the right amount of money to do   ------- PREDICTED: in
speaker the issue of human cloning and   ------- PREDICTED: in
the very core of politics   ------- PREDICTED: in
nature and value of human life   ------- PREDICTED: in
because the proponents of embryo destruction in   ------- PREDICTED: in
for federal funding of research using adult   ------- PREDICTED: in
the overwhelming support of both sides of   ------- PREDICTED: in
for the development of a national stem   ------- PREDICTED: in

the potential benefits of killing human beings   ------- PREDICTED: in
the potential ends of medical breakthroughs down   ------- PREDICTED: in
the deliberate destruction of unique living selfintegrated   ------- PREDICTED: in
some incidental tangent of embryonic stem cell   ------- PREDICTED: in
is the essence of the experiment   ------- PREDICTED: in
a utilitarian view of human life that   ------- PREDICTED: in
the only kind of stem cell research   ------- PREDICTED: in
and exciting avenues of inquiry all without   ------- PREDICTED: in
and harmful methods of embryonic stem cell   ------- PREDICTED: in
pushes the envelope of medical knowledge need   ------- PREDICTED: in
or force people of goodwill to devalue   ------- PREDICTED: in
is the opposite of such a choice   ------- PREDICTED: in
dignity and value of every human person   ------- PREDICTED: in
and a member of the faculty at   ------- PREDICTED: in
is a stage of development   ------- PREDICTED: in
to allow funding of embryonic stem cell   ------- PREDICTED: in
the whole notion of what is going   ------- PREDICTED: in
funding for destruction of embryos   ------- PREDICTED: in
only 28 percent of the parents that   ------- PREDICTED: in
and chief resident of thoracic and cardiovascular   ------- PREDICTED: in

could i inquire of the gentlewoman from   ------- PREDICTED: in
for the culture of life his entire   ------- PREDICTED: in
myself the balance of my time   ------- PREDICTED: in
against the authorization of federal taxpayer dollars   ------- PREDICTED: in
essence a question of the level of   ------- PREDICTED: in
like the rest of us   ------- PREDICTED: in
so was jesus of nazareth and shakespeare   ------- PREDICTED: in
for the destruction of that embryo through   ------- PREDICTED: in
through the harvesting of the stem cells   ------- PREDICTED: in
the hopedfor end of the castle bill   ------- PREDICTED: in
instead the entitlement of those destructive means   ------- PREDICTED: in
discouraging track record of the kind of   ------- PREDICTED: in
none not one of the countless and   ------- PREDICTED: in
as a byproduct of that rejection   ------- PREDICTED: in
the grizzly means of the castle bill   ------- PREDICTED: in

the bone marrow of fully grown adults   ------- PREDICTED: in
led to treatments of no fewer than   ------- PREDICTED: in
the stubborn advocacy of embryonic harvesting in   ------- PREDICTED: in
overwhelming clinical evidence of its futility might   ------- PREDICTED: in
a genuine case of ideology trumping science   ------- PREDICTED: in

the mere aspiration of ends justify the   ------- PREDICTED: in
first ethical challenge of the biotechnology age   ------- PREDICTED: in
the irreducible question of this debate what   ------- PREDICTED: in
debate what level of respect and dignity   ------- PREDICTED: in
the biological fact of a human embryo   ------- PREDICTED: in
the technological necessity of embryonic destruction as   ------- PREDICTED: in
as a precondition of embryonic stem cell   ------- PREDICTED: in
the medical reality of embryonic stem cell   ------- PREDICTED: in
the moral catastrophe of meansjustifyingtheends morality and   ------- PREDICTED: in
considering the destruction of defenseless human life   ------- PREDICTED: in
answer a proponent of taxpayerfunded embryonic stem   ------- PREDICTED: in
embryos any shred of respect and dignity   ------- PREDICTED: in
as a matter of ideology or even   ------- PREDICTED: in
as a matter of respect and dignity   ------- PREDICTED: in
recognize the rights of human embryos but   ------- PREDICTED: in
but the wrongs of human adults   ------- PREDICTED: in
and our rejection of the treacherous notion   ------- PREDICTED: in
are asked out of good and pure   ------- PREDICTED: in

understand that many of the opponents of   ------- PREDICTED: in
discarded so defeat of this legislation would   ------- PREDICTED: in
difficulties surrounding destruction of embryos   ------- PREDICTED: in
deny innocent victims of terrible diseases the   ------- PREDICTED: in
diseases the opportunity of relief from their   ------- PREDICTED: in

me every day of my life   ------- PREDICTED: in
are among some of the most talented   ------- PREDICTED: in
a wider majority of americans support ethical   ------- PREDICTED: in

the empty promise of embryonic stem cell   ------- PREDICTED: in

president and ceo of the juvenile diabetes   ------- PREDICTED: in
a strong supporter of destroying human embryos   ------- PREDICTED: in
representing the values of the taxpayer   ------- PREDICTED: in
is the subject of embryology   ------- PREDICTED: in
a 4year period of time 6 months   ------- PREDICTED: in
6 months worth of embryology and of   ------- PREDICTED: in
process it sort of takes me back   ------- PREDICTED: in
but i realize of course how difficult   ------- PREDICTED: in
understand for members of the body   ------- PREDICTED: in
there are 435 of us of course   ------- PREDICTED: in
than a lot of our colleagues and   ------- PREDICTED: in
and the chances of a natural conception   ------- PREDICTED: in
injection and all of a sudden an   ------- PREDICTED: in
and the miracle of birth can occur   ------- PREDICTED: in
the national institutes of health   ------- PREDICTED: in
doing those kinds of things and it   ------- PREDICTED: in
analogy that explanation of twinning and how   ------- PREDICTED: in
away 50 percent of the cells and   ------- PREDICTED: in
develop this technique of obtaining these stem   ------- PREDICTED: in
which is destruction of life   ------- PREDICTED: in
the other side of this argument say   ------- PREDICTED: in
about the definition of preembryo but i   ------- PREDICTED: in
my 30 years of experience in the   ------- PREDICTED: in
at the moment of conception when that   ------- PREDICTED: in
until the birth of the child   ------- PREDICTED: in
my knowledge definition of a preembryo   ------- PREDICTED: in
to just kind of follow on the   ------- PREDICTED: in
can cure some of these dreaded diseases   ------- PREDICTED: in
restore the function of his limbs and   ------- PREDICTED: in
and even some of our colleagues need   ------- PREDICTED: in
involves the destruction of human life a   ------- PREDICTED: in
a little bit of luck and ingenuity   ------- PREDICTED: in
be a member of this body some   ------- PREDICTED: in
that the harvesting of these stem cells   ------- PREDICTED: in
said that most of the private funding   ------- PREDICTED: in
and research act of 2005 and commend   ------- PREDICTED: in
for the sanctity of life   ------- PREDICTED: in
from the use of umbilical cord stem   ------- PREDICTED: in
gathered without knowledge of blood cell type   ------- PREDICTED: in
already successful use of umbilical cord stem   ------- PREDICTED: in
to every word of the debate as   ------- PREDICTED: in
debate as part of my job as   ------- PREDICTED: in
as a member of the rebuttal team   ------- PREDICTED: in
my legal pad of notes and rebuts   ------- PREDICTED: in
have got plenty of rebuttals that i   ------- PREDICTED: in
and the funding of that to provide   ------- PREDICTED: in
to my state of georgia i ask   ------- PREDICTED: in
are hundreds today of these snowflake children   ------- PREDICTED: in
at the beginning of life   ------- PREDICTED: in
an original cosponsor of the gentleman from   ------- PREDICTED: in
the fact that of the socalled throwaway   ------- PREDICTED: in
were 400 000 of them and that   ------- PREDICTED: in
had no intention of having reimplanted   ------- PREDICTED: in
about the sanctity of life truly believe   ------- PREDICTED: in
very oldest many of whom i would   ------- PREDICTED: in
the final stages of their lives but   ------- PREDICTED: in
lives but all of these lives are   ------- PREDICTED: in
a lot more of those little lives   ------- PREDICTED: in
hey maybe one of those would be   ------- PREDICTED: in
an einstein one of these days the   ------- PREDICTED: in
just 100 out of 400 000 that   ------- PREDICTED: in
is a fourth of this body madam   ------- PREDICTED: in
almost a fourth of 435 members of   ------- PREDICTED: in
avoids this issue of destroying human life   ------- PREDICTED: in
for the purpose of obtaining embryonic stem   ------- PREDICTED: in
from maryland is of the same mindset   ------- PREDICTED: in
the same mindset of wanting to do   ------- PREDICTED: in
be a meeting of the minds   ------- PREDICTED: in
strong family history of inheritable diseases something   ------- PREDICTED: in
50 percent chance of having one of   ------- PREDICTED: in
talking about one of the brightest members   ------- PREDICTED: in
the brightest members of this body a   ------- PREDICTED: in
physiologist a doctor of physiology who has   ------- PREDICTED: in
physiology the functioning of the human body   ------- PREDICTED: in
any organ system of the body   ------- PREDICTED: in
is the study of physiology   ------- PREDICTED: in
understanding his depth of knowledge is far   ------- PREDICTED: in
the physician members of this body have   ------- PREDICTED: in
a deep amount of respect for him   ------- PREDICTED: in
am fully supportive of it   ------- PREDICTED: in
address this issue of trying to find   ------- PREDICTED: in
and a lot of these diseases that   ------- PREDICTED: in
to the best of our ability to   ------- PREDICTED: in
are probably lots of complications false starts   ------- PREDICTED: in
will be lots of money federal dollars   ------- PREDICTED: in
unique full complement of dna that have   ------- PREDICTED: in
that have all of their genetic material   ------- PREDICTED: in
are the tiniest of human life little   ------- PREDICTED: in
they want out of their reproductive life   ------- PREDICTED: in
life and all of a sudden as   ------- PREDICTED: in
are stones all of a sudden we   ------- PREDICTED: in
a tragic loss of a child or   ------- PREDICTED: in
child and all of a sudden maybe   ------- PREDICTED: in
and the author of this bill the   ------- PREDICTED: in
but a number of others who have   ------- PREDICTED: in
is very supportive of this   ------- PREDICTED: in
a companion piece of legislation as i   ------- PREDICTED: in
an obgyn physician of course i have   ------- PREDICTED: in
experience with some of the processes that   ------- PREDICTED: in
it is because of male infertility there   ------- PREDICTED: in
embryo he knows of what he speaks   ------- PREDICTED: in
between the effects of these two bills   ------- PREDICTED: in
i support both of them   ------- PREDICTED: in
is this element of embryonic cell research   ------- PREDICTED: in
the diverse set of diseases that plague   ------- PREDICTED: in
lost 4 years of robust research that   ------- PREDICTED: in

to the faiths of others   ------- PREDICTED: in
denigrate the faith of others   ------- PREDICTED: in
when the teachings of a faith are   ------- PREDICTED: in

the other side of the argument as   ------- PREDICTED: in
thing that is of concern to me   ------- PREDICTED: in
many cases most of us would say   ------- PREDICTED: in
lies the horns of the dilemma   ------- PREDICTED: in
a certain sanctity of life   ------- PREDICTED: in
effectively here some of that has to   ------- PREDICTED: in
with the length of time of research   ------- PREDICTED: in
have some type of a cure for   ------- PREDICTED: in
do this type of research   ------- PREDICTED: in
is the prospect of using embryonic stem   ------- PREDICTED: in
i understand most of what is in   ------- PREDICTED: in
thawed out many of them die as   ------- PREDICTED: in
mentioned and some of those apparently will   ------- PREDICTED: in
speaker the issue of government funding of   ------- PREDICTED: in
research is one of the most divisive   ------- PREDICTED: in
fund any form of stem cell research   ------- PREDICTED: in
unfortunately many opponents of embryonic stem cell   ------- PREDICTED: in
guarantees the politicization of decisions about what   ------- PREDICTED: in
about what types of research for what   ------- PREDICTED: in
ironically an example of this process may   ------- PREDICTED: in
fact the supporters of embryonic stem cell   ------- PREDICTED: in

the 166 provisions of the patriot act   ------- PREDICTED: in
the vast majority of these provisions which   ------- PREDICTED: in

the fundamental liberties of innocent americans if   ------- PREDICTED: in
involve the power of the government to   ------- PREDICTED: in
most basic liberties of citizens we included   ------- PREDICTED: in
provisions for 14 of these sensitive provisions   ------- PREDICTED: in
blocked a number of important amendments democrats   ------- PREDICTED: in
believe that many of these amendments would   ------- PREDICTED: in

that contains many of the improvements that   ------- PREDICTED: in
that the leadership of the house has   ------- PREDICTED: in
particular the lack of sunsets of key   ------- PREDICTED: in
therefore oppose passage of this legislation today   ------- PREDICTED: in
the serious nature of the threat required   ------- PREDICTED: in
indeed nearly all of the 166 provisions   ------- PREDICTED: in
the 166 provisions of the patriot act   ------- PREDICTED: in

some other section of the law perhaps   ------- PREDICTED: in
americans are aware of this issue and   ------- PREDICTED: in
it falls short of what is necessary   ------- PREDICTED: in
not make some of the changes recommended   ------- PREDICTED: in
for the requirement of oversight which i   ------- PREDICTED: in
i think any of us would agree   ------- PREDICTED: in

part 76 percent of the american people   ------- PREDICTED: in
controls the levers of government   ------- PREDICTED: in
beneath a bunch of rocks to try   ------- PREDICTED: in
with this type of political candor   ------- PREDICTED: in
about the committees of jurisdiction already in   ------- PREDICTED: in
about the failures of this congress and   ------- PREDICTED: in
us represents more of the same   ------- PREDICTED: in
at the end of this process is   ------- PREDICTED: in
the guiding principles of our national response   ------- PREDICTED: in
did a heck of a job   ------- PREDICTED: in
be made up of members of congress   ------- PREDICTED: in
and third some of the problems we   ------- PREDICTED: in
have a pattern of sweeping problems under   ------- PREDICTED: in
under the rug of turning everything into   ------- PREDICTED: in
congress powerful members of the senate and   ------- PREDICTED: in

the republican leadership of both houses are   ------- PREDICTED: in
question 75 percent of the american people   ------- PREDICTED: in
that the citizens of this country were   ------- PREDICTED: in

prevents future loss of life   ------- PREDICTED: in
the federal response of fema fell so   ------- PREDICTED: in
from every walk of life did not   ------- PREDICTED: in

have heard all of this discussion over   ------- PREDICTED: in
help the people of the region rebuild   ------- PREDICTED: in
to rid themselves of the toxic literally   ------- PREDICTED: in
that is unworthy of this tragedy and   ------- PREDICTED: in
the congressional role of oversight   ------- PREDICTED: in
at the pump of gasoline for america   ------- PREDICTED: in

so the idea of this congress having   ------- PREDICTED: in
this congress afraid of the truth   ------- PREDICTED: in
this congress afraid of the truth   ------- PREDICTED: in
gave some level of truth to the   ------- PREDICTED: in

by the members of our government   ------- PREDICTED: in
interests besides those of its own integrity   ------- PREDICTED: in
and the good of the country   ------- PREDICTED: in
to the tragedy of september 11 puts   ------- PREDICTED: in
with a failure of leadership and openness   ------- PREDICTED: in
the republican leadership of the house and   ------- PREDICTED: in
for the creation of an overtly partisan   ------- PREDICTED: in
give republicans control of every aspect of   ------- PREDICTED: in
control the scope of the investigation   ------- PREDICTED: in
controls the levers of government and as   ------- PREDICTED: in

but the members of the majority do   ------- PREDICTED: in
that the structure of the committee is   ------- PREDICTED: in

are you afraid of   ------- PREDICTED: in
by the politicians of one party charged   ------- PREDICTED: in
is the creation of an independent commission   ------- PREDICTED: in
commission an abdication of our responsibility   ------- PREDICTED: in
be an abdication of our responsibilities   ------- PREDICTED: in
supports the creation of such an independent   ------- PREDICTED: in
over 160 members of this body representing   ------- PREDICTED: in
than 100 million of our nation s   ------- PREDICTED: in
supported the creation of such a commission   ------- PREDICTED: in
fully 57 percent of the general population   ------- PREDICTED: in
real independent investigation of katrina has taken   ------- PREDICTED: in
but the findings of the congressional commission   ------- PREDICTED: in
we have plenty of evidence to believe   ------- PREDICTED: in
reserve the balance of my time   ------- PREDICTED: in
xz4002630 a member of the committee on   ------- PREDICTED: in
is an abdication of our authority why   ------- PREDICTED: in

that 76 percent of americans in a   ------- PREDICTED: in
that a commission of outside experts similar   ------- PREDICTED: in
partisan politics instead of a republicancontrolled committee   ------- PREDICTED: in
investigating the failings of a republicancontrolled administration   ------- PREDICTED: in
upside down because of the failure of   ------- PREDICTED: in
to the impact of hurricane katrina   ------- PREDICTED: in
that the text of the amendment be   ------- PREDICTED: in
back the balance of my time   ------- PREDICTED: in
make the point of order that a   ------- PREDICTED: in
an original cosponsor of that amendment   ------- PREDICTED: in
the government failures of hurricane katrina is   ------- PREDICTED: in
an independent assessment of what happened   ------- PREDICTED: in
as ranking member of the committee on   ------- PREDICTED: in
together a timeline of events   ------- PREDICTED: in
that the staff of the committee has   ------- PREDICTED: in
shows the complexity of the issues and   ------- PREDICTED: in
an independent assessment of what happened   ------- PREDICTED: in
the other side of the aisle against   ------- PREDICTED: in
indeed the type of commission proposed by   ------- PREDICTED: in
view the devastation of the world trade   ------- PREDICTED: in
console the families of the victims   ------- PREDICTED: in
to my area of the country   ------- PREDICTED: in
to take charge of this investigation   ------- PREDICTED: in
for the good of the nation let   ------- PREDICTED: in
to the tragedy of hundreds of thousands   ------- PREDICTED: in
escaped the wrath of the terrible storm   ------- PREDICTED: in
with the passage of time our outrage   ------- PREDICTED: in
to the heart of the disaster yet   ------- PREDICTED: in
was little sign of our federal relief   ------- PREDICTED: in
aid the victims of katrina so too   ------- PREDICTED: in
congress as part of the federal government   ------- PREDICTED: in
therefore an element of the relief response   ------- PREDICTED: in
following the tragedy of september 11 and   ------- PREDICTED: in
at the confluence of two great rivers   ------- PREDICTED: in
the constant threat of floods   ------- PREDICTED: in
does its job of protecting the american   ------- PREDICTED: in
than 1 percent of species listed have   ------- PREDICTED: in
the entire history of the act   ------- PREDICTED: in
error yet because of flaws in the   ------- PREDICTED: in

the economic cost of its listing has   ------- PREDICTED: in

i encourage all of my colleagues to   ------- PREDICTED: in
with the section of the manager s   ------- PREDICTED: in
a single type of activity dockbuilding from   ------- PREDICTED: in
a key provision of the marine mammal   ------- PREDICTED: in
by the state of florida and the   ------- PREDICTED: in
the continued existence of endangered and threatened   ------- PREDICTED: in
standard for protection of this wellloved species   ------- PREDICTED: in
a whole succession of docks is likely   ------- PREDICTED: in
idea what kind of precedent or implications   ------- PREDICTED: in
to incidental take of marine mammals and   ------- PREDICTED: in
bill just part of the manager s   ------- PREDICTED: in
that the state of florida and the   ------- PREDICTED: in
passed a version of the marine mammal   ------- PREDICTED: in
protection act out of the committee on   ------- PREDICTED: in
than 1 percent of endangered species have   ------- PREDICTED: in
only helped 10 of 1 300 species   ------- PREDICTED: in
allowing the use of sound science   ------- PREDICTED: in
flowerloving fly and of course the other   ------- PREDICTED: in
california a handful of flies yes flies   ------- PREDICTED: in
50 million worth of land that has   ------- PREDICTED: in
generate the kind of revenue that we   ------- PREDICTED: in
support the passage of this   ------- PREDICTED: in
that both sides of the aisle have   ------- PREDICTED: in
recognized the need of some modifications in   ------- PREDICTED: in
by the name of john gochnauer   ------- PREDICTED: in
to be broken of committing 98 errors   ------- PREDICTED: in
which means out of every five times   ------- PREDICTED: in
to preserve 12 of them giving that   ------- PREDICTED: in
a batting average of 010 if you   ------- PREDICTED: in
the john gochnauer of federal programs   ------- PREDICTED: in
a good steward of the land your   ------- PREDICTED: in
produce an attitude of distrust and hatred   ------- PREDICTED: in
which is one of the reasons why   ------- PREDICTED: in
from the fear of the federal government   ------- PREDICTED: in
is probably one of the reasons why   ------- PREDICTED: in
bill is one of those unique bills   ------- PREDICTED: in
which a majority of both parties in   ------- PREDICTED: in
is indeed one of modifications   ------- PREDICTED: in
were not part of the endangered species   ------- PREDICTED: in
though the directors of the levee said   ------- PREDICTED: in
speaker the record of the endangered species   ------- PREDICTED: in
has been one of jobs lost of   ------- PREDICTED: in
destroyed and sadly of human lives lost   ------- PREDICTED: in
does that type of modification   ------- PREDICTED: in
i have one of my good constituents   ------- PREDICTED: in
bought 500 acres of land and found   ------- PREDICTED: in
at the rate of 50 000 for   ------- PREDICTED: in
to get rid of the endangered species   ------- PREDICTED: in
that 90 percent of the habitat for   ------- PREDICTED: in
preserve endangered species of all kinds is   ------- PREDICTED: in
same old process of trying to threaten   ------- PREDICTED: in
for actual recovery of species   ------- PREDICTED: in
endangered species act of 2005 which does   ------- PREDICTED: in
the special interests of private industry and   ------- PREDICTED: in
and fiscal health of our great nation   ------- PREDICTED: in
chosen by many of america s leaders   ------- PREDICTED: in
endangered species act of 1973 tesra is   ------- PREDICTED: in
furthering the degradation of species and compounding   ------- PREDICTED: in
the early stages of rebuilding the gulf   ------- PREDICTED: in
hundreds upon hundreds of billions of taxpayer   ------- PREDICTED: in
rather the interests of private landowners   ------- PREDICTED: in
the fiscal irresponsibility of this congress   ------- PREDICTED: in
the high costs of fuel into their   ------- PREDICTED: in
includes true protection of our endangered species   ------- PREDICTED: in
and the development of fuel sources that   ------- PREDICTED: in
how the proponents of the bill classify   ------- PREDICTED: in
less about reform of the esa and   ------- PREDICTED: in
for the exploitation of the environment   ------- PREDICTED: in
for a number of years because the   ------- PREDICTED: in
batting average analogy of my friend from   ------- PREDICTED: in
through the heart of my congressional district   ------- PREDICTED: in
many troubling aspects of this legislation   ------- PREDICTED: in
most troubling part of the legislation is   ------- PREDICTED: in
compensating for loss of customary use   ------- PREDICTED: in
providing a form of environmental blackmail and   ------- PREDICTED: in
this radical rollback of the endangered species   ------- PREDICTED: in
most egregious parts of the underlying bill   ------- PREDICTED: in
the other side of the aisle that   ------- PREDICTED: in
project that none of the changes are   ------- PREDICTED: in
