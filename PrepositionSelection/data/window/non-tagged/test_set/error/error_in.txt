to join me in supporting this important   ------- PREDICTED: of
we deal with in this chamber than   ------- PREDICTED: of
i stand here in this chamber today   ------- PREDICTED: of
at some point in our history every   ------- PREDICTED: of
stem cell research in which a tiny   ------- PREDICTED: of
are no therapies in humans that have   ------- PREDICTED: of
paying for it in a way that   ------- PREDICTED: of
more promising results in adult stem cells   ------- PREDICTED: of
there have been in embryonic stem cells   ------- PREDICTED: of
taught years ago in medical school and   ------- PREDICTED: of

very little prescription in our respective states   ------- PREDICTED: of
mr speaker tomorrow in this chamber about   ------- PREDICTED: of
has been made in these various diseases   ------- PREDICTED: of
very pertinent remarks in regard to where   ------- PREDICTED: of
never learned that in embryology or any   ------- PREDICTED: of
i took or in my obstetric and   ------- PREDICTED: of
to understand that in getting those embryonic   ------- PREDICTED: of
get these cells in hopes that they   ------- PREDICTED: of
at some point in the future a   ------- PREDICTED: of
this slippery slope in regard to what   ------- PREDICTED: of
been very good in the embryonic stem   ------- PREDICTED: of
these 400 000 in these fertility clinics   ------- PREDICTED: of
is running short in these cloned embryos   ------- PREDICTED: of
i rise today in strong support of   ------- PREDICTED: on
cord stem cells in the treatment of   ------- PREDICTED: of
is great promise in this research   ------- PREDICTED: of
ethnicity that results in fewer tissue rejections   ------- PREDICTED: of
stem cells results in the destruction of   ------- PREDICTED: of
rise this evening in opposition strong opposition   ------- PREDICTED: on
who firmly believes in the sanctity of   ------- PREDICTED: of
democrats who are in opposition to the   ------- PREDICTED: on

i firmly believe in the sanctity of   ------- PREDICTED: of
me just say in conclusion the gentleman   ------- PREDICTED: on
and going backwards in his life   ------- PREDICTED: of
direction and say in 20 years i   ------- PREDICTED: of
i may be in a nursing home   ------- PREDICTED: of
we see it in these in vitro   ------- PREDICTED: of
them and that in some instances couples   ------- PREDICTED: of

a certain point in time had no   ------- PREDICTED: of
who might be in a nursing home   ------- PREDICTED: of
is so right in pointing out that   ------- PREDICTED: of
to the point in this chamber as   ------- PREDICTED: of
to do things in a bipartisan fashion   ------- PREDICTED: of
with his posters in regard to the   ------- PREDICTED: of
already been done in genetic counseling studies   ------- PREDICTED: of
been no harm in those instances   ------- PREDICTED: of
who has taught in medical school   ------- PREDICTED: of
when i was in medical school it   ------- PREDICTED: of
the human body in a healthy situation   ------- PREDICTED: of
had great success in adult stem cells   ------- PREDICTED: of
do not think in this body in   ------- PREDICTED: of
is the president in august of 2001   ------- PREDICTED: on
was absolutely right in my humble opinion   ------- PREDICTED: of
my humble opinion in regard to his   ------- PREDICTED: of
that would result in the destruction of   ------- PREDICTED: of
cell lines already in existence that our   ------- PREDICTED: of
already been destroyed in obtaining those stem   ------- PREDICTED: of
first president that in fact allowed federal   ------- PREDICTED: on
have ever had in regard to this   ------- PREDICTED: of
for his efforts in this regard   ------- PREDICTED: of
he is steadfast in his determination not   ------- PREDICTED: of

doctors who specialize in infertility can literally   ------- PREDICTED: of
the nih but in a lot of   ------- PREDICTED: of
this great country in my state of   ------- PREDICTED: of
is talking about in this poster presentation   ------- PREDICTED: of
this poster presentation in regard to waiting   ------- PREDICTED: of
any cell type in the body   ------- PREDICTED: of
as countless more in each of our   ------- PREDICTED: on
slams the door in their faces   ------- PREDICTED: of
with alzheimer s in the mid1990s   ------- PREDICTED: of
sticking our heads in the sand   ------- PREDICTED: of
surplus embryos from in vitro fertilization treatments   ------- PREDICTED: of
ailments may lie in stem cell research   ------- PREDICTED: of
speaker i rise in support of the   ------- PREDICTED: of
have continued success in the funding for   ------- PREDICTED: of
and additional people in the future who   ------- PREDICTED: of
who was involved in the research and   ------- PREDICTED: of
already been done in south america that   ------- PREDICTED: of
i am rising in opposition to the   ------- PREDICTED: on
who are here in washington   ------- PREDICTED: of
been discarded embryos in fertilization clinics   ------- PREDICTED: of
similar to advances in past years of   ------- PREDICTED: of
to take part in blood transfusions and   ------- PREDICTED: of
us look at in vitro fertilization   ------- PREDICTED: of

strengthen our efforts in that bill   ------- PREDICTED: of
that would be in the best interests   ------- PREDICTED: of
going to come in early tuesday   ------- PREDICTED: of
with leader pelosi in determining that because   ------- PREDICTED: of
that time frame in which it will   ------- PREDICTED: of
2 years overdue in terms of reauthorization   ------- PREDICTED: on
hopefully we can in fact move on   ------- PREDICTED: on
a little bit in between that   ------- PREDICTED: of
at that point in time   ------- PREDICTED: of
when they were in charge had a   ------- PREDICTED: on
believed to be in the best interests   ------- PREDICTED: of
was a bill in which he said   ------- PREDICTED: of
spend enough money in 1983   ------- PREDICTED: on

applications as limited in what they can   ------- PREDICTED: of
we are headed in the right direction   ------- PREDICTED: of
i rise today in support of hr   ------- PREDICTED: of
can be used in federally funded research   ------- PREDICTED: of
federally funded research in order to accelerate   ------- PREDICTED: of
for federal funding in 2001 only about   ------- PREDICTED: of
that researchers need in order to create   ------- PREDICTED: of
or other inducement in exchange for their   ------- PREDICTED: of

behind other countries in this promising area   ------- PREDICTED: of
are moving ahead in stem cell research   ------- PREDICTED: of
highly significant change in current policy that   ------- PREDICTED: of
that would result in making many more   ------- PREDICTED: of
research is conducted in a safe and   ------- PREDICTED: of

treatment but were in excess of the   ------- PREDICTED: on
after enactment hhs in consultation with the   ------- PREDICTED: of
