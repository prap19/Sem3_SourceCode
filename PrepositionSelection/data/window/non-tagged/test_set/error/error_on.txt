is the argument on the other side   ------- PREDICTED: of
president s council on bioethics in its   ------- PREDICTED: of
and applied research on derivation and use   ------- PREDICTED: of
we are carrying on a dialogue and   ------- PREDICTED: of

president s council on bioethics thinks it   ------- PREDICTED: of
a moment council on bioethics think that   ------- PREDICTED: of
we are carrying on these discussions with   ------- PREDICTED: of
president s council on bioethics submits a   ------- PREDICTED: of
factors which turn on and turn off   ------- PREDICTED: of
the research particularly on two of these   ------- PREDICTED: of
very good article on stem cells there   ------- PREDICTED: of
shares your enthusiasm on the therapeutic potentials   ------- PREDICTED: of

president s council on bioethics pcb on   ------- PREDICTED: of
bush s council on bioethics which studied   ------- PREDICTED: of
stem cell research on animal embryos according   ------- PREDICTED: of
he is working on would be consistent   ------- PREDICTED: of
see fewer restrictions on taxpayer funding for   ------- PREDICTED: of

the ranking democrat on the committee the   ------- PREDICTED: of
here to speak on the bill and   ------- PREDICTED: of
who have labored on this bill   ------- PREDICTED: of
thank cheryl jaeger on my left of   ------- PREDICTED: of
several months working on this bill   ------- PREDICTED: of
consent that debate on this motion be   ------- PREDICTED: of
more thoughtful members on this subject and   ------- PREDICTED: of
now and more on the way   ------- PREDICTED: of
will have is on the cord blood   ------- PREDICTED: of
will have is on the castledegette bill   ------- PREDICTED: of
more controversial but on its own merit   ------- PREDICTED: of
and then go on to the next   ------- PREDICTED: of
the debate time on the pending bill   ------- PREDICTED: of
insert extraneous material on the pending bill   ------- PREDICTED: of
into the record on this bill hr   ------- PREDICTED: of
an automatic position on   ------- PREDICTED: of
debated and decided on its own merit   ------- PREDICTED: of
so strongly about on either side that   ------- PREDICTED: of
lifetime voting member on prolife issues minus   ------- PREDICTED: of
the wrong way on one issue so   ------- PREDICTED: of
the first time on then existing stem   ------- PREDICTED: of
ideologically pure position on this issue   ------- PREDICTED: of
to be spent on embryonic stem cell   ------- PREDICTED: of
to my decision on this vote because   ------- PREDICTED: of

let us err on the side of   ------- PREDICTED: of
drop the limit on current stem cell   ------- PREDICTED: of
that we have on this floor   ------- PREDICTED: of
is a fact on this also i   ------- PREDICTED: of
all vote no on hr 810   ------- PREDICTED: of
uniquely is based on their own view   ------- PREDICTED: of
think my friends on the other side   ------- PREDICTED: of
have a vote on a bill like   ------- PREDICTED: of
this that based on the debate is   ------- PREDICTED: of
i am firmly on the side of   ------- PREDICTED: of
a no vote on this bill mr   ------- PREDICTED: of
allowing a vote on this important legislation   ------- PREDICTED: of
needs to be on the quality of   ------- PREDICTED: of

whose futures depend on new answers to   ------- PREDICTED: of
like my friends on the other side   ------- PREDICTED: of
than my friends on the other side   ------- PREDICTED: of
believe that research on embryonic stem cells   ------- PREDICTED: of
hear my friends on the other side   ------- PREDICTED: of
hear my friends on the other side   ------- PREDICTED: of
flatlined spending budgeting on the national institutes   ------- PREDICTED: of
should increase spending on medical research all   ------- PREDICTED: of
my friends talk on this i do   ------- PREDICTED: of
time cutting spending on what we should   ------- PREDICTED: of
put a face on a couple that   ------- PREDICTED: of
turn their backs on us or would   ------- PREDICTED: of
legislation a vote on the house floor   ------- PREDICTED: of
my congressional district on the gulf coast   ------- PREDICTED: of
let the research on stem cells continue   ------- PREDICTED: of
these organizations listed on this posterboard such   ------- PREDICTED: of
to vote yes on the bill   ------- PREDICTED: of
we put that on a timeline of   ------- PREDICTED: of
see a heartbeat on a sonogram   ------- PREDICTED: of
california is already on the way   ------- PREDICTED: of
lines that existed on that date but   ------- PREDICTED: of
allow a vote on this important bill   ------- PREDICTED: of
to conduct research on unapproved stem cell   ------- PREDICTED: of

continue to flourish on the principles it   ------- PREDICTED: of
number one topic on these groups minds   ------- PREDICTED: of
are fighting for on the floor today   ------- PREDICTED: of
funding for research on embryonic stem cells   ------- PREDICTED: of
going to vote on today hr 810   ------- PREDICTED: of
has to say on this topic human   ------- PREDICTED: of

research has been on the forefront   ------- PREDICTED: of
this bill being on the floor and   ------- PREDICTED: of
not done it on humans   ------- PREDICTED: of
mr smith xz4003801 on this bill and   ------- PREDICTED: of
a democratic sponsor on it and i   ------- PREDICTED: of
that we saw on the cannon terrace   ------- PREDICTED: of
should vote yes on this bill and   ------- PREDICTED: of
a wonderful help on this bill   ------- PREDICTED: of

with your side on a unanimousconsent request   ------- PREDICTED: of
and open debate on this very important   ------- PREDICTED: of
debate to start on that bill somewhere   ------- PREDICTED: of
for taxpayerfunded research on welldeveloped stem cells   ------- PREDICTED: of
what is going on here   ------- PREDICTED: of
much time remains on all sides   ------- PREDICTED: of
to the time on all sides   ------- PREDICTED: of
medical research predicated on the destruction of   ------- PREDICTED: of

both certainly agree on this procedure that   ------- PREDICTED: of

does begin and on that issue your   ------- PREDICTED: of
issue your vote on this bill rests   ------- PREDICTED: of
as they embark on the ethical expert   ------- PREDICTED: of
to permitting research on 78 then the   ------- PREDICTED: of
