the ranking democrat on the committee the   ------- PREDICTED: in
here to speak on the bill and   ------- PREDICTED: in
who have labored on this bill   ------- PREDICTED: in
thank cheryl jaeger on my left of   ------- PREDICTED: in
several months working on this bill   ------- PREDICTED: in
consent that debate on this motion be   ------- PREDICTED: in
more thoughtful members on this subject and   ------- PREDICTED: in
now and more on the way   ------- PREDICTED: in
will have is on the cord blood   ------- PREDICTED: in
all the members on both sides of   ------- PREDICTED: in
will have is on the castledegette bill   ------- PREDICTED: in
more controversial but on its own merit   ------- PREDICTED: in
and then go on to the next   ------- PREDICTED: in
the debate time on the pending bill   ------- PREDICTED: in
insert extraneous material on the pending bill   ------- PREDICTED: in
into the record on this bill hr   ------- PREDICTED: in
an automatic position on   ------- PREDICTED: in
debated and decided on its own merit   ------- PREDICTED: in
so strongly about on either side that   ------- PREDICTED: in
lifetime voting member on prolife issues minus   ------- PREDICTED: in
the wrong way on one issue so   ------- PREDICTED: in
the first time on then existing stem   ------- PREDICTED: in
ideologically pure position on this issue   ------- PREDICTED: in
bush recognized this on august 9 2001   ------- PREDICTED: in
to be spent on embryonic stem cell   ------- PREDICTED: in
to my decision on this vote because   ------- PREDICTED: in
without setting out on an extraordinary and   ------- PREDICTED: in
forward with debate on this bill my   ------- PREDICTED: in
deeply held beliefs on both sides of   ------- PREDICTED: in
a distinguished doctor on the committee on   ------- PREDICTED: in
have been heard on this important issue   ------- PREDICTED: in
i respect members on both sides of   ------- PREDICTED: in
chair the committee on energy and commerce   ------- PREDICTED: in
put their comments on the record   ------- PREDICTED: in
let us err on the side of   ------- PREDICTED: in
drop the limit on current stem cell   ------- PREDICTED: in
that we have on this floor   ------- PREDICTED: in
is a fact on this also i   ------- PREDICTED: in
all vote no on hr 810   ------- PREDICTED: in
uniquely is based on their own view   ------- PREDICTED: in
think my friends on the other side   ------- PREDICTED: in
have a vote on a bill like   ------- PREDICTED: in
this that based on the debate is   ------- PREDICTED: in
because we feel on both sides of   ------- PREDICTED: in
i am firmly on the side of   ------- PREDICTED: in
a no vote on this bill mr   ------- PREDICTED: in
allowing a vote on this important legislation   ------- PREDICTED: in
needs to be on the quality of   ------- PREDICTED: in
turn our backs on this   ------- PREDICTED: in
for more research on alzheimer s including   ------- PREDICTED: in
have significant bearing on the future of   ------- PREDICTED: in
for their work on the first of   ------- PREDICTED: in
have significant bearing on the future of   ------- PREDICTED: in
two bills takes on the greatest significance   ------- PREDICTED: in
bill it focuses on embryonic stem cell   ------- PREDICTED: in
embryonic stem cell on the other hand   ------- PREDICTED: in
whose futures depend on new answers to   ------- PREDICTED: in
like my friends on the other side   ------- PREDICTED: in
than my friends on the other side   ------- PREDICTED: in
believe that research on embryonic stem cells   ------- PREDICTED: in
hear my friends on the other side   ------- PREDICTED: in
hear my friends on the other side   ------- PREDICTED: in
flatlined spending budgeting on the national institutes   ------- PREDICTED: in
should increase spending on medical research all   ------- PREDICTED: in
my friends talk on this i do   ------- PREDICTED: in
time cutting spending on what we should   ------- PREDICTED: in
put a face on a couple that   ------- PREDICTED: in
turn their backs on us or would   ------- PREDICTED: in
their tireless efforts on behalf of the   ------- PREDICTED: in
legislation a vote on the house floor   ------- PREDICTED: in
my congressional district on the gulf coast   ------- PREDICTED: in
let the research on stem cells continue   ------- PREDICTED: in
these organizations listed on this posterboard such   ------- PREDICTED: in
to vote yes on the bill   ------- PREDICTED: in
we put that on a timeline of   ------- PREDICTED: in
see a heartbeat on a sonogram   ------- PREDICTED: in
california is already on the way   ------- PREDICTED: in
by president bush on august 9 2001   ------- PREDICTED: in
lines that existed on that date but   ------- PREDICTED: in
allow a vote on this important bill   ------- PREDICTED: in
to conduct research on unapproved stem cell   ------- PREDICTED: in
turn its back on this opportunity   ------- PREDICTED: in
continue to flourish on the principles it   ------- PREDICTED: in
number one topic on these groups minds   ------- PREDICTED: in
are fighting for on the floor today   ------- PREDICTED: in
president bush made on august 9 2001   ------- PREDICTED: in
funding for research on embryonic stem cells   ------- PREDICTED: in
going to vote on today hr 810   ------- PREDICTED: in
has to say on this topic human   ------- PREDICTED: in
must explore research on all types of   ------- PREDICTED: in
research is going on at the private   ------- PREDICTED: in
is also going on at the state   ------- PREDICTED: in
is even going on to a degree   ------- PREDICTED: in
over 3 years on this research at   ------- PREDICTED: in
has been spent on adult stem cells   ------- PREDICTED: in
research is going on at the time   ------- PREDICTED: in
any extensive reading on this that is   ------- PREDICTED: in
for her leadership on this issue   ------- PREDICTED: in
a congressional roundtable on stem cells and   ------- PREDICTED: in
stem cells and on the biotech industry   ------- PREDICTED: in
s strict limits on stem cell research   ------- PREDICTED: in
research has been on the forefront   ------- PREDICTED: in
this bill being on the floor and   ------- PREDICTED: in
not done it on humans   ------- PREDICTED: in
mr smith xz4003801 on this bill and   ------- PREDICTED: in
a democratic sponsor on it and i   ------- PREDICTED: in
that we saw on the cannon terrace   ------- PREDICTED: in
should vote yes on this bill and   ------- PREDICTED: in
a wonderful help on this bill   ------- PREDICTED: in
embryos now those on the other side   ------- PREDICTED: in
assume no one on the other side   ------- PREDICTED: in
policy has failed on both counts   ------- PREDICTED: in
sets explicit controls on how stem cell   ------- PREDICTED: in
created the decision on how they will   ------- PREDICTED: in
proud to stand on the house floor   ------- PREDICTED: in
house will convene on monday at 12   ------- PREDICTED: in
any votes called on these measures will   ------- PREDICTED: in
stem cell bill on tuesday followed on   ------- PREDICTED: in
dod authorization bill on wednesday and thursday   ------- PREDICTED: in
tradition around here on the dod authorization   ------- PREDICTED: in
with your side on a unanimousconsent request   ------- PREDICTED: in
and open debate on this very important   ------- PREDICTED: in
your side probably on monday   ------- PREDICTED: in
debate to start on that bill somewhere   ------- PREDICTED: in
for taxpayerfunded research on welldeveloped stem cells   ------- PREDICTED: in
definable and based on fact rather than   ------- PREDICTED: in
what is going on here   ------- PREDICTED: in
much time remains on all sides   ------- PREDICTED: in
to the time on all sides   ------- PREDICTED: in
medical research predicated on the destruction of   ------- PREDICTED: in
necessarily among some on this side of   ------- PREDICTED: in
turn the corner on these debilitating diseases   ------- PREDICTED: in
to move forward on our moral imperative   ------- PREDICTED: in
follow my heart on this and cast   ------- PREDICTED: in
we are now on the threshold we   ------- PREDICTED: in
we are now on the threshold of   ------- PREDICTED: in
to vote yes on hr 810   ------- PREDICTED: in
the federal government on the sidelines scientists   ------- PREDICTED: in
economic growth depends on productivity productivity depends   ------- PREDICTED: in
productivity productivity depends on technology and technology   ------- PREDICTED: in
technology ultimately depends on basic science which   ------- PREDICTED: in
stronger ethical requirements on stem cell lines   ------- PREDICTED: in
a cure is on the horizon within   ------- PREDICTED: in
just simply sit on the bench   ------- PREDICTED: in
focuses government efforts on research with real   ------- PREDICTED: in
bill also takes on the recommendations of   ------- PREDICTED: in
spend our money on things that work   ------- PREDICTED: in
be spending more on adult cells research   ------- PREDICTED: in
their research dollars on what works adult   ------- PREDICTED: in
its money efficiently on what works while   ------- PREDICTED: in
a no vote on federal funding for   ------- PREDICTED: in
has been going on for 10 12   ------- PREDICTED: in
put a man on the moon in   ------- PREDICTED: in
it is really on point and very   ------- PREDICTED: in
have heard people on the other side   ------- PREDICTED: in
are against people on my side of   ------- PREDICTED: in
that are still on ice if you   ------- PREDICTED: in
smart ones remaining on ice that possibly   ------- PREDICTED: in
with our colleagues on both sides of   ------- PREDICTED: in
nih for research on nonhuman primates to   ------- PREDICTED: in
genetic counseling studies on couples who have   ------- PREDICTED: in
already doing testing on those embryos to   ------- PREDICTED: in
i have signed on to this bill   ------- PREDICTED: in
probably being spent on research   ------- PREDICTED: in
put a moratorium on the harvesting of   ------- PREDICTED: in
funding for research on embryonic stem cells   ------- PREDICTED: in
who have signed on to this bill   ------- PREDICTED: in
enlighten my colleagues on both sides of   ------- PREDICTED: in
a colloquy later on but i thank   ------- PREDICTED: in
the smith legislation on umbilical cord stem   ------- PREDICTED: in
will expand research on embryonic stem cells   ------- PREDICTED: in
shutting the door on federal research on   ------- PREDICTED: in
slamming the door on stem cell research   ------- PREDICTED: in

to have that on a particular day   ------- PREDICTED: in

indicate will be on tuesday   ------- PREDICTED: in
office are working on that unanimous consent   ------- PREDICTED: in
available to be on the floor or   ------- PREDICTED: in
both certainly agree on this procedure that   ------- PREDICTED: in
are strong views on either side of   ------- PREDICTED: in
would simply observe on our side and   ------- PREDICTED: in
side and frankly on your side that   ------- PREDICTED: in
committee almost unanimously on voice vote passed   ------- PREDICTED: in
disagreed with us on   ------- PREDICTED: in
and his leadership on this bill   ------- PREDICTED: in
funding for research on stem cell lines   ------- PREDICTED: in
to support research on human embryo stem   ------- PREDICTED: in
made a judgment on   ------- PREDICTED: in
much about life on this floor   ------- PREDICTED: in
this bill tramples on the moral convictions   ------- PREDICTED: in
into a movie on a amp e   ------- PREDICTED: in
that brooke wrote on the issue in   ------- PREDICTED: in
everyone here knows on august 9 2001   ------- PREDICTED: in

the work done on stem cells just   ------- PREDICTED: in
and vote unanimously on these two outstanding   ------- PREDICTED: in

annually to congress on the activities carried   ------- PREDICTED: in
rules governing research on human tissues be   ------- PREDICTED: in
issue and one on which we disagree   ------- PREDICTED: in
does begin and on that issue your   ------- PREDICTED: in
issue your vote on this bill rests   ------- PREDICTED: in
as they embark on the ethical expert   ------- PREDICTED: in
to permitting research on 78 then the   ------- PREDICTED: in
hospital have embarked on a monumental and   ------- PREDICTED: in
scientific research community on regenerative medicine   ------- PREDICTED: in
is basically focused on adult stem cell   ------- PREDICTED: in
seems to be on a very fast   ------- PREDICTED: in
procedures we depend on to make informed   ------- PREDICTED: in

researchers who depend on federal funds lack   ------- PREDICTED: in
changing federal policy on human embryonic stem   ------- PREDICTED: in
know a vote on legislation that would   ------- PREDICTED: in
by voting yes on hr 810 to   ------- PREDICTED: in
i also sit on the committee that   ------- PREDICTED: in
as i sit on that committee and   ------- PREDICTED: in
ones who are on the verge of   ------- PREDICTED: in
the current restrictions on creating human embryos   ------- PREDICTED: in
remarkable discoveries and on the brink of   ------- PREDICTED: in

research places humanity on the frontier of   ------- PREDICTED: in
this extraordinary research on the frontier of   ------- PREDICTED: in
like to reflect on the dilemma that   ------- PREDICTED: in
as we decide on this particular vote   ------- PREDICTED: in
disease and so on   ------- PREDICTED: in
discarded anyway and on and on and   ------- PREDICTED: in
would not experiment on that child   ------- PREDICTED: in
is no restriction on private funding on   ------- PREDICTED: in
so many people on both sides of   ------- PREDICTED: in

rather than allocated on the basis of   ------- PREDICTED: in
years probably 10 on the laborhhs subcommittee   ------- PREDICTED: in
not to be on high moral ground   ------- PREDICTED: in
should not depend on the local initiative   ------- PREDICTED: in
