discarded discarded because in most cases those 
speaker i rise in strong support of 
in order to explore 
two are not in opposition they are 
that everybody engaged in this debate today 
know that engaging in this form of 
and in my opinion we 
to take place in the united states 
will remain frozen in place or whether 
we have exerted in other areas of 
its appropriate role in making sure that 
debate is defined in so many ways 
in fact the whip 
would fund this in a significant way 
at the point in this issue where 
for this research in that way 
every technical advance in the history of 
new paradigms but in the final analysis 
in this instance we 
to our obligation in this critical matter 
never be implanted in a womb but 
will be enhanced in a measured way 
speaker i rise in strong support of 
of his work in bringing this bill 
representatives we are in the unique position 
must be ethically in accordance with the 
has laid out in his policy 
and medical research in our country 
several therapeutic uses in common first and 
in addition to the 
clearly therapeutic potential in the use of 
most important research in this area is 
is taking place in ohio in northeast

in every tissue in the body 
cells for example in the pancreas the 
type of cell in the body making 
form of research in order to stifle 
we in this congress have 
brilliant research conducted in this country 
if we invest in all three types 
researchers in other nations researchers 
other nations researchers in private institutions in 
in private institutions in this country are 
accomplish this research in an ethical manner 
that are destroyed in vain 
members to vote in favor of both 
we in no way want 
potential to develop in all of the 
of the tissues in the body i 
has been shown in culture to be

across the board in all kinds of 
yes in order to make 
to the wealthiest in our country we 
nation do overall in medical research 
and seniors live in florida but i 
very successful with in vitro fertilization 
a result of in vitro fertilization 
i rise today in strong support of 
respected research organizations in support of this 
in my congressional district 
was born through in vitro fertilization 
as with most in vitro fertilization procedures 
was conceived without in vitro fertilization the 
put the batteries in a flashlight will 
embryo is implanted in a uterus to 
embryos sitting frozen in a clinic help 
does not grow in the frozen state 
in addition when the 
important to linger in a frozen test 
yet to hear in this entire debate 
go to waste in a cryogenic freezer 
i do rise in opposition to this 
there is nothing in the laboratory and 
is certainly nothing in the clinics available 
of research back in 2001 
an embryo developed in an ivf clinic 
the reality is in a poll of 
follow the money in this debate 
thing we learned in the last presidential 
many of us in this nation the 
and treatments not in time for my 
in each of these 
pin are created in the process of 
the process of in vitro fertilization 
speaker i rise in support of hr 
led the world in medical advancements and 
a world leader in this burgeoning new 
are stored at in vitro fertilization clinics 
in fact only 22 
in addition the 22 
congress has provided in past years particularly 
centers are located in baltimore the university 
originally created for in vitro fertilization and 
fertilization and are in excess of clinical 
research will result in cures but it 
in 2001 two months 
to visit me in my office 
back in june of 2001 
mr speaker in closing i must 
the brilliant scientists in our research institutions 
the wishes of in vitro fertilization donors 
to join me in supporting hr 810 
been very useful in treating some cancers 
type of cell in the body 
and right here in america 
about american leadership in this world 
led the world in scientific advances 
lead the world in this vitally important 
the cells used in this research will 
not block advances in lifesaving and ethically 
i rise today in support of hr 
members perhaps back in the offices listening 
820 000 constituents in delaware and probably 
of the figures in the country 
not a person in this room who 
only blood diseases in terms of what 
body of research in the united states 
has ever happened in medicine in the 
happened in medicine in the history of 
through the whole in vitro fertilization process 
we create embryos in that particular process 
having it put in a bag for 
i rise today in support of hr 
i have been in public office for 
people i represent in the state of 
am their voice in the congress of 
interested and involved in embryonic stem cell 
groups would grow in number and soon 
in the early years 
but in the past few 
girl stands out in mind 
an event back in delaware 
president s policy in an ethical manner 
to the nation in 2001 
he laid out in his speech as 
purposes and are in excess of clinical 
not be implanted in a woman and 
they are created in a petri dish 
000 frozen embryos in in vitro fertilization 
frozen embryos in in vitro fertilization clinics 
for organ transplantation in order to save 
type of cell in the body they 
to cells found in all tissues of 
in 2003 16 million 
were only isolated in 1998 
the premier leader in biomedical research in 
in biomedical research in our country and 
a small role in making that happen 
states do this in the open and 
million people just in the united states 
adult stem cells in blood tissues has 
are being foreshortened in the united states 
our ethic standards in this bill and 
to cells found in all tissues of 
dollars used directly in the destruction of 
embryos at an in vitro fertilization clinic 
are dollars used in the research ultimately 
they are doing in in vitro fertilization 
are doing in in vitro fertilization clinics 
to kill people in the world are 
government and taxpayers in the position of 
progress being made in the fields of 
with good intentions in this case we 
established in 1986 the national 
nmdp today individuals in need of a 
cord blood units in the united states 
in addition the nmdp 
another 3 are in the process of 
is a step in the right direction 
colleagues to vote in favor of hr 
speaker i rise in strong support of 
numbers of people in this country 
care and researchers in the best position 
polio to advances in diabetes american research 
i also support in this bill 
take a look in animals they have 
saved spinal cords in animals in heart 
cords in animals in heart in alzheimer 
animals in heart in alzheimer s but 
not done it in humans 
had a 6yearold in the committee that 
look a child in the eye when 
because i think in some cases they 
literally throw them in the toilet 
we have hope in the future 
cord blood bill in particular 
health care disparities in this country but 
the floor is in large measure because 
rather than digging in in opposition to 
than digging in in opposition to stem 
rather than digging in in opposition the 
than digging in in opposition the gentleman 
rather than digging in and deciding how 
that have happened in the last several 
in the absence of 
other states are in the process of 
the federal government in general and nih 
general and nih in particular must be 
the members will in which life is 
life is taken in order to give 
embryos not used in fertility clinics embryos 
to be useful in some of the

they can look in the eye of 
in conclusion curt civin 
s policy issued in august of 2001 
to researchers here in country 
in 1995 two members 
xz4004320 inserted language in the appropriations bill 
i have been in congress and it 
who go to in vitro fertilization clinics 
to store them in a freezer 
s executive order in august of 2001 
we are living in an increasingly complex 
justice holmes words in today s complex 
is best seen in the state of 
in 2001 the president 
cell research policy in an attempt to 
in the last 4 
has been stymied in this country going 
embryos created for in vitro fertilization embryos 
fertilization embryos created in petri dishes that 
noah had convulsions in the middle of 
as the leader in ethical basic research 
today to speak in favor of the 
suffering from disease in this nation 
their tireless work in bringing this bill 
any cell type in the human body 
voted against it in the past 
going to stand in the way of 
president bush announced in august 2001 has 
must not stand in the way of 
in addition mr speaker 
2006 sometime later in the week 
about filing amendments in a timely fashion 
in working with the 
this debate early in the afternoon instead 
instead of early in the morning 
bill somewhere early in the afternoon and 
member to participate in the debate 
the highway bill in their chamber 
a major player in this process 
work this out in the conference committee 
the gentleman that in the good old 
days have changed in that the president 
house has concurred in that many times 
and have voted in the house 
of embryo destruction in the name of 
proven medical benefits in treating more than 
expand federal funding in bone marrow stem 
kill some in hopes of saving 
progress in fact is the 
for 25 years in georgia and a 
is a physician in internal medicine and 
also has degrees in biochemistry 
destroying an embryo in order to have 
cell research and in order to do 
in fact if the 
does not happen in her bill i 
university of rochester in rochester new york 
human embryos is in essence a question 
grant human life in its earliest stage 
adulthood to become in a sense what 
have been destroyed in a petri dish 
and minds know in fact are us 
serves both sides in this debate 
research every day in this country 
castle bill has in mind 
the embryos have in fact proven to 
in truth then it 
in other words mr 
of embryonic harvesting in the face of 
well in that case mr 
oppose it because in the life of 
the means here in our first ethical 
embryo s membership in the human family 
life by scientists in lab coats given 
we can not in good faith use 
is a test in which we are 
in this test in 
in this test in this vote then 
only america can in the name of 
mr speaker in 1999 young tessa 
in a week and 
the united states in this effort 
2005 i rise in strong support of 
embryonic stem cells in research and we 
the process of in vitro fertilization many 
we move forward in this area 
all other cells in the human body 
do nt invest in stem cell research 
in addition if we 
invest federal resources in embryonic stem cell 
its competitive advantage in this essential area 
area of science in which the us 
of us jobs in science or technology 
from 25 percent in 1990 
and south korea in the percentage of 
a college degree in a science or 
down from third in the world 25 
stem cell research in an ethically responsible 
and abiding belief in the right to 
bader peach orchard in campbell 
happens to live in a wheelchair because 
cast a vote in favor of hr 
and i rise in support of hr 
in their words given 
speaker i rise in support of this 
the professional scientists in our country not 
so many diseases in between 
an ethical standard in this debate 
have a responsibility in terms of our 
of our compassion in terms of the 
speaker i rise in support of this

current stemcell projects in the united states

in 2001 president bush 
purposes and are in excess of clinical 
embryos for use in federallyfunded stem cell 
stem cell projects in the united states 
unwilling to invest in the field 
next big thing in biotechnology after the 
information technology was in the late 1980s 
for our leadership in science and technological 
he may succeed in stifling stem cell 
stem cell research in our country but 
only slow progress in treating disease and 
government should be in the business of 
all my colleagues in the house to 
speaker i rise in support of hr 
advances in medicine have made 
discoveries and advances in medicine and medical 
the advances in medicine that resulted 
medicine that resulted in this dramatic increase 
this dramatic increase in life expectancy did 
of visionary leadership in both the public 
we have made in medicine in the 
made in medicine in the last century 
too many people in our society suffer 
speaker i rise in support of hr 
when i was in my mid40s and 
that the advances in parkinson s research 
hold enormous potential in order to treat 
and wellrespected doctors in this country 
what we in congress should be 
more evident than in the advancement of 
cordblood banks participating in an inventory program 
real promise grounded in proven science and 
to join me in supporting this important 
we deal with in this chamber than 
i stand here in this chamber today 
at some point in our history every 
couple of cells in a petri dish 
stem cell research in which a tiny 
are no therapies in humans that have 
paying for it in a way that 
more promising results in adult stem cells 
there have been in embryonic stem cells 
taught years ago in medical school and 
i was there in medical school 
students get maybe in a 4year period 
mr bartlett xz4000170 in the body so 
by a biopsy in someone who has 
after several days in cell multiplication as 
that is implanted in the mom s 
being done right in my community of 
doctors who specialize in infertility and doing 
on the moon in 1969 
the cells and in most instances if 
very little prescription in our respective states 
mr speaker tomorrow in this chamber about 
has been made in these various diseases 
very pertinent remarks in regard to where 
never learned that in embryology or any 
i took or in my obstetric and 
years of experience in the field 
to understand that in getting those embryonic 
get these cells in hopes that they 
at some point in the future a 
this slippery slope in regard to what 
been very good in the embryonic stem 
these 400 000 in these fertility clinics 
is running short in these cloned embryos 
i rise today in strong support of 
cord stem cells in the treatment of 
is great promise in this research 
ethnicity that results in fewer tissue rejections 
stem cells results in the destruction of 
rise this evening in opposition strong opposition 
who firmly believes in the sanctity of 
democrats who are in opposition to the 
federal government involved in embryonic stem cell 
government is involved in a program where 
i firmly believe in the sanctity of 
me just say in conclusion the gentleman 
and going backwards in his life 
he stood in this well and 
direction and say in 20 years i 
i may be in a nursing home 
we see it in these in vitro 
it in these in vitro fertilization clinics 
them and that in some instances couples 
had gone through in vitro fertilization and 
a certain point in time had no 
who might be in a nursing home 
is so right in pointing out that 
to the point in this chamber as 
to do things in a bipartisan fashion 
with his posters in regard to the 
already been done in genetic counseling studies 
been no harm in those instances 
who has taught in medical school 
when i was in medical school it 
the human body in a healthy situation 
had great success in adult stem cells 
do not think in this body in 
in this body in a partisan way 
is the president in august of 2001 
was absolutely right in my humble opinion 
my humble opinion in regard to his 
that would result in the destruction of 
cell lines already in existence that our 
already been destroyed in obtaining those stem 
first president that in fact allowed federal 
have ever had in regard to this 
for his efforts in this regard 
he is steadfast in his determination not 
tragedies every day in the news this 
murdered the situation in aruba the situation 
aruba the situation in nebraska 
understand it originating in the other body 
that can occur in reproductive endocrine laboratories 
but in a situation where 
low sperm count in the male and 
fertilize an egg in the natural way 
in fact the normal 
normal sperm count in a male is 
pregnancy can occur in the normal natural 
this is not in the military 
doctors who specialize in infertility can literally 
the nih but in a lot of 
this great country in my state of 
is talking about in this poster presentation 
this poster presentation in regard to waiting 
any cell type in the body 
as countless more in each of our 
slams the door in their faces 
with alzheimer s in the mid1990s 
sticking our heads in the sand 
surplus embryos from in vitro fertilization treatments 
of the aisle in the house and 
ailments may lie in stem cell research 
many in this body like 
speaker i rise in support of the 
have continued success in the funding for 
and additional people in the future who 
in fact the university 
university of pittsburgh in my hometown just 
who was involved in the research and 
already been done in south america that 
i am rising in opposition to the 
destruction of embryos in order to take 
who are here in washington 
been discarded embryos in fertilization clinics 
and in fact the children 
and in fact there is 
similar to advances in past years of 
to take part in blood transfusions and 
us look at in vitro fertilization 
the products of in vitro fertilization and 
vitro fertilization and in every case there 
i rise today in strong support of 
yet been identified in all vital organs 
president george bush in 2001 are currently 
at this point in time to have 
amendments be made in order 
are confronting terrorists in iraq and around 
and women are in harm s way 
strengthen our efforts in that bill 
that would be in the best interests 
going to come in early tuesday 
with leader pelosi in determining that because 
that time frame in which it will 
2 years overdue in terms of reauthorization 
hopefully we can in fact move on 
a little bit in between that 
at that point in time 
when they were in charge had a 
believed to be in the best interests 
was a bill in which he said 
spend enough money in 1983 
people not only in this country but 
will we stand in the way 
but in fact this legislation 
we do so in a thoughtful and 
everyone in this room was

joseph delee wrote in that yearbook something

that there be in this chaotic world 
that we in the medical profession 
put this discussion in perspective when i 
a controversial issue in this country 
his wife had in fact had an 
fact had an in vitro fertilization 
i rise today in strong support of 
in 1990 when she 
from harvard university in 2000 harvard s 
school of government in 2004 and she 
candidate in political science at 
on the issue in the congressional record 
the case and in fact those making

potential being lost in the future 
of those most in need is bad 
in the context of

respect for life in america and throughout 
is now left in the hands of 
support research conducted in the state 
joins new jersey in leading the charge 
human lives waiting in the wings for

only be kept in freezers at fertility 
to devalue life in another otherwise avoidable

united states stands in real danger of 
behind other countries in this promising area 
research is conducted in a safe and 
rise this morning in support of the 
in addition the bill 
tissues and organs in patients 
unspecialized cells found in specialized tissue such 
applications as limited in what they can 
we are headed in the right direction 
i rise today in support of hr

federally funded research in order to accelerate 
for federal funding in 2001 only about 
that researchers need in order to create 
or other inducement in exchange for their 
united states stands in real danger of 
behind other countries in this promising area 
are moving ahead in stem cell research 
highly significant change in current policy that 
that would result in making many more 
research is conducted in a safe and 
were donated from in vitro fertilization clinics 
treatment but were in excess of the 
in addition the bill 
after enactment hhs in consultation with the 
were carried out in accordance with the 
in closing i urge 
their traditional role in setting ethical rules 
for ethical behavior in both the public 
research is conducted in an ethical way 
i rise in strong support of 
and their conscience in donating embryos that 
egg is implanted in the mother s 
life begins later in the process then 
to think carefully in conscience when life 
another step forward in our battle against

in my district case 
forward with research in a responsible compassionate 
today we in the congress are 
carefully thoughtfully and in an informed manner 
made a difference in treating 58 different

to be made in this new field 
koreans doing research in this arena announced 
would fall behind in the world research 
in my opinion the 
will be destroyed in the hope that 
stem cell research in my own district 
institute world renowned in our community and 
our community and in michigan and part 
is a leader in research 
in many instances 90 
so i rise in support of hr 
in our community we 
country is first in medical science and 
speaker i rise in strong support of 
or destroyed from in vitro fertilization clinics 
i rise in support of this 
get more involved in embryonic stem cell 
of the world in this research in 
in this research in light of south 
i rise today in strong support of

excess embryos created in the invitro fertilization 
no longer watch in agony as a 
are few moments in medical history when 
giant step forward in improving countless lives 
make a difference in the lives of 
colleagues to vote in favor of hr 
i rise today in support of hr 
to those most in need it should 
have no role in any party s 
in 2001 president bush 
can be used in federally funded research 
to the nih in the united states 
s disease one in every four deaths

join me today in advancing science and 
the greatest breakthrough in the history of 
how in heaven s name 
at this time in this body and 
this body and in the research community 
not play god in attempting to clone

shown little interest in making them available 
behind their counterparts in other countries and 
furthermore delay in effectively resolving this

policy is expected in the coming weeks 
as lines derived in the future 
be discarded from in vitro fertilization clinics 
this expansion in policy will further 
the research conducted in our state 
went into effect in 2001 the notion 
and i rise in strong support of 
and i rise in strong support of 
in my judgment we 
guidelines must be in place with vigorous 
the purpose of in vitro fertilization could 
the appropriate guidelines in place we are 
i rise today in support of hr 
scientists and researchers in my district s

in 2003 over 900 
sure that many in this chamber have 
in fact it is 
important fourletter word in the language 
leads to falls in the night 
into a crisis in the next generation 
are moving forward in an effort to 
there was no in vitro fertilization or 
and woman come in to a physician 
they put them in a jar or 
they put them in a petri plate 
they put it in the mother 
watch somebody drown in their own secretions 
and then come in here and say 
critical first step in expanding the number 
preeminent world leader in the field of 
made extraordinary advancements in the treatment management 
to our investments in scientific research 
in fact just last 
last week scientists in south korea successfully 
a major step in the effort to 
and in my home state 
made notable progress in their research on 
a pivotal point in our nation s 
millions of lives in this country 
to join me in supporting hr 810 
will move forward in the search for 
cases were diagnosed in the united states 
hr 810 and in doing so choose 
tissue and cell in the body 
speaker i rise in support of hr 
lead to breakthroughs in a number of 
hospital recently wrote in the new england 
stem cells is in its infancy restricting 
in vitro fertilization is 
couples to share in the joy of 
it results in the creation of 
much at stake in the stem cell 
keeping us competitive in the global economy 
leading the world in using our compassion 
speaker i rise in very strong support 
research is necessary in discovering the causes

the purposes of in vitro fertilization in 
in vitro fertilization in excess of clinical 
in february 2005 the 
their professional judgment in extending and enhancing 
colleagues to vote in favor of the 
can be used in multiple ways 
in the area of 
the cases because in my practice i 
which ends up in severe developmental delays 
has been discarded in the normal process 
of any life in the process 
their convictions because in the end a 
of human life in 1999 the council 
by this congress in the past when 
still no alternative in the sense that 
the funding go in the direction where 
are other things in medical research and 
use lethal methods in our research to 
and i was in love with her 
we treat people in whatever form of 
appreciate the doctors in our presence we 
i rise today in opposition to hr 
i believe in the transforming and 
a big difference in the lives of 
the first step in an effort to 
to join me in opposing this bill 
has been achieved in the laboratory in 
in the laboratory in animal studies and 
animal studies and in human application 
an editorial in america magazine said 
cell fertilized egg in vitro 
cryogenic embryos conceived in the laboratory 
life is created in creating an embryo 
an embryo whether in vitro or whether 
vitro or whether in utero 
resolve any uncertainty in favor of life 
will be placed in tomorrow as we 
those who are in favor of embryonic 
probably in many cases most 
are more productive in research 
use public funds in doing research that 
have more unanimity in using public funds 
before us because in this legislation is 
though it is in its early stages 
of what is in there 
yield stem cells in the early stages 
may be found in hr 2520 some 
in fact the supporters 
day for us in congress 
leadership and courage in bringing this legislation 
because every family in america every family 
america every family in america is just 
of health and in other institutes of 
institutes of excellence in research throughout our 
these embryos are in excess of the 
the needs of in vitro fertilization rather 
very much against in vitro fertilization 
they were against in vitro fertilization and 
in order for our 
to be preeminent in science we must 
we all know in science as in 
in science as in business talent attracts 
and those labs in turn attract the 
makes us first in the world preeminent 
the world preeminent in science 
people of california in a bipartisan way 
resources to invest in embryonic stem cell 
we in california will become 
have ethical standards in california 
least one thing in common both are

the episcopal church in its letter in 
in its letter in support of this 
renew the world in many ways 
and much more in support of this 
i am deeply in their debt

their promise lies in the ability to 
it was only in 1998 that the 
the cells develop in the ways that 
significant head way in making the promise 
moreover as report in journal of neuroscience

all this in less than 4

served 5 years in the military and 
of flag desecration in 2004 and there 
desecration thus far in 2005 and the 
this is in many ways patriotism 
to 10 years in prison 
assumed that many in the military support 
this amendment but in fact there are 
been great heroes in war on both 
and ideals expressed in the constitution and 
protected our banner in battle have not 
amending the constitution in this manner i 
against red china in the argument that 
of our religion in other people s 
in any case those 
must be interested in the spirit of 
must be interested in the principles of

interested because yesterday in my district the 
freedom of speech in the nation and 
the nation and in the world actually 
the aclu yesterday in the second congressional 
seen it compromised in our schools 
about certain religions in schools but we 
about christian religions in school and we 
me with tears in their eyes knowing 
knowing they are in the last year 
not see things in the complex legal 
this house or in the supreme court 
debate right now in guantanamo bay 
congress to speak in the way that 
to our nation in uniform but for 
to our country in bringing this important 
land and sea in foxholes and on 
flag began flapping in the wind 
to find traitors in our midst mr 
put this debate in context because it

of our forces in iraq and studies 
in reality the only 
flag burned is in compliance with the 
in fact the only 
about prohibiting expression in violation of the 
in fact the amendment

their own flag in private 
the amendment is in fact redundant but

the united states in times of peace 
died for it in times of war 
to join me in supporting this important 
april 9 1998 in the case of 
the supreme court in the johnson and 
wilcox said but in the end to 
must take solace in the fact that 
are not justified in writing our private 
of the people in this country to 
united states constitution in order to protect 
a decision early in the country s 
that has resulted in consequences that the 
states was wrong in its decision and 
justice black said in the case of

belief that anything in the federal constitution 
mr watt xz4004240 in support of his

number of barriers in terms of regulatory 
ruining the situation in the chinese economy 
of the whereases in this very interesting

this bill fails in the house or 
a small step in the right direction 
constitutional rights violated in the next 4

during the time in question 
seriously damaged and in all likelihood he 
are numerous provisions in both the expiring 
americans not involved in terrorism in any

going to leave in place for our 
in addition hr 1526 
of domestic terrorism in far more narrow 
there is anybody in this body on 
like to see in particular a sunset 
states is behind in its security for 
the patriot act in my opinion would 
they were outspoken in support of osama

that was training in arizona the pilots 
and that crashed in pennsylvania 
on 911 and in london today and 
bill of rights in order to fight

of the provisions in the bill that 
that were put in place in the 
put in place in the postwatergate era 
property without notice in violation of the 
against brandon mayfield in portland who was

number of provisions in the bill 
is not required in debate on the 
at 10 oclock in the morning with 
in the past that 
is one person in america who might 
had one terrorist in hand musawi and 
had an agent in arizona pointing at

how they perform in finding terrorists in 
in finding terrorists in america 
that passed separately in this house of 
of this legislation in a cynical ploy 
have come up in the past 
it passed congress in 2001 because it 
went too far in creating the potential 
the provisions enacted in 2001 
weak threshold adopted in the original patriot 
the broad standard in current law makes 
this gag order in court 
change the delay in notice allowed from 
limitations on instances in which delayed notice 
that this morning in the senate committee 
allowed and made in order this debate 
have been cut in half in terms 
cut in half in terms of the 
further suggest that in terms of if 
that was made in order have to 
was not made in order by myself 
him not just in terms of the 
of the fbi in the boston office 
oversight are framed in that context 
at this point in time that records 
in addition it added 
of any involvement in terrorism whatsoever where 
federal district court in new york has 
national security letters in intelligence investigations so 
letter his day in court 
could be treated in such a way 
on the judiciary in october of 2001 
gentleman from arizona in helping draft this 
what is happening in the federal government 
has worked well in some respects but 
but less so in others and in 
in others and in some cases with 
and in the case of 
be revisited again in 10 years almost 
of internet records in emergencies the use 
16 expiring provisions in this bill be 
chairman i rise in strong support of 
five terrorist cells in buffalo detroit seattle 
and the war in being won 
43 proposed amendments in committee 8 of 
the patriot act in action and in 
in action and in the 4 years 
chairman i rise in strong opposition to 
substituted in the dark of 
the 16 provisions in the patriot act 
americans civil liberties in a time of 
lowered the bar in protecting their civil 
speaker i rise in strong opposition to 
objectionable provisions remain in this conference report 
but two issues in particular were ignored 
challenge these letters in court and sets 
my colleagues said in a letter to 
there is nothing in this standard to 
this to remain in the final conference 
as i asked in june of this 
lowered the bar in protecting their civil 
chairman i rise in support of the 
act is reflected in its deceptive title 
declared our independence in 1776 were true 
risked their lives in order to secure 
sacrifice our democracy in a misguided attempt 
is a step in the wrong direction 
direction a step in the direction of 
rejecting the measure in its current form 
are unpatriots as in unpatriotic this is 
to preserve torture in order to enthusiastically 
intrusive invasive powers in the hands of 
that has acted in authoritarian ways 
it is conceived in small injustices which 
speaker i rise in strong support of 
a critical juncture in our nation s 
weeks ago today in london made a 
at this moment in london brought about 
that we are in the midst of 
in fact i remember 
something that people in law enforcement can 
submitted to us in the committee on 
raised last night in the committee on 
that are made in order under this 
that are made in order are offered 
on sunsetting provisions in the usa patriot 
against the provisions in the usa patriot 
to do everything in my power to 
measures that are in there are designed 
that we are in the midst of 
when we are in the midst of 
every large increase in intelligence homeland security 
most prudent things in my view that 
that congress did in passing the original 
allowing the sunsets in the future i 
address the issues in section 206 which 
or the phone in question 
offered an amendment in the intelligence committee 
in conclusion the american 
speaker i rise in opposition to this 
the government agencies in national security investigations 
standard has resulted in an all time 
all time high in the number of 
chairman i rise in strong opposition to 
bill of rights in the name of 
all patriots today in the finest sense 
one of us in the chamber takes 
liberties will not in and of itself 
was hastily passed in october 2001 
in this case they 
in my district the 
speaker i rise in strong opposition to 
original patriot act in 2001 and the 
in 1775 one of 
would be rolling in their graves to 
republican leadership make in the name of 
be considered intelligence in an investigative report 
legislation that flies in the face of 
and 13 hearings in the committee on 
to go back in the secure intelligence 
for our friends in britain as we 
the 911 attacks in part we all 
is a bookstore in london in the 
bookstore in london in the leeds section 
only affect nonamericans in the first place 
safe harbors either in bookstores or libraries 
over 12 hours in which we considered 
my democrat colleagues in attaching a few 
i in fact voted for 
addressed it sufficiently in this bill in 
in this bill in the amendments that 
215 we did in committee that clarifies 
i have offered in the committee on 
with another section in committee 
not even mentioned in it 
that person is in charge and there 
we already have in law which is 
witnesses from experts in the field and 
that we need in place and i 
national security letters in court 
the nondisclosure requirement in the national security 
security letter request in order to comply 
and his staff in helping to write 
then it is in my view proper 
we are offering in this amendment additional 
and we have in other amendments as 
also to challenge in court 
we have done in this amendment is 
of the amendments in place to put 
to ensure that in cases where it 
want to say in closing this has 
in the committee with 
would be imposed in that case however 
people from engaging in lawful protest 
problem sometimes and in this case it 
cause of delay in each instance 
socalled sneakandpeak searches in the future by 
point out that in committee we considered 
but actually put in some false stops 
many other amendments in committee and here 
pretty good product in the end and 
or the leadership in general 
the process here in the committee on 
hearing 12 just in the last several 
several months 2 in the last congress 
amendment after amendment in committee 
sunsets we had in the bill initially 
as my hero in politics said once 
politics said once in one book barry 
reform increases accountability in using nsls and 
in addition to these 
add significant safeguards in a number of 
will codify these in the bill 
chairman i rise in strong support of 
crime and security in us seaports concluded 
us seaports concluded in their report that 
loophole or shortcoming in the law that 
it provides that in lieu of the 
intelligence now printed in the bill the 
bill the amendment in the nature of 
a substitute printed in part a of 
against the amendment in the nature of 
a substitute printed in part a of 
it makes in order only those 
those amendments printed in part b of 
be offered only in the order printed 
the order printed in the report may 
a member designated in the report shall 
the time specified in the report equally 
of the question in the house or 
the house or in the committee of 
the amendments printed in part b of 
this somber day in support of both 
i remain confident in not only the 
not perfect and in an ideal world 
kill innocent people in the name of 
usa patriot act in 2001 it did 
so of course in response to the 
congress included in this legislation many 
people back home in the 11th district 
nation s liberty in the face of 
also assured me in a private conversation 
this act aided in recovering a 13yearold 
also concerned and in all honesty extremely 
believe that we in this congress will 
jeopardized or diminished in the fight to 
in reference to a 
was not made in order i want 
that was made in order and that 
bipartisan amendments made in order under this 
i rise again in support of this 
this rule and in recognition of the 
in 2001 the house 
house joined together in a bipartisan way 
i rise today in support of house 
of their work in shepherding hr 3199 
hr 3199 initially in the committee and 
find common ground in order to move 
commitment to oversight in order to better 
this legislation back in july mr speaker 
in an ideal world 
who cowardly operate in the darkness of 
kill innocent people in the name of 
in regard to section 
the gentleman that in the original bill 
sunset provisions not in two but in 
in two but in three sections that 
in their motion to 
are bringing back in the conference report 
usa patriot act in 2001 we had 
us to keep in mind 
the federal government in regard to crime 
chairman i rise in support of the 
it is controversial in the least and 
must not waver in our message to 
run through it in detail 
who is thwarted in their attempt to 
watching events unfold in london this morning 
can strike twice in the heart of 
try to do in any city in 
in any city in america 
government to engage in unnecessarily broad searches 
of our amendments in order 
the key provisions in the act in 
in the act in another 4 years 
8 months ago in 2010 finally to 
out his amendment in the base bill 
improving critical tools in this era of 
uncover terror cells in the us we 
license to engage in fishing expeditions for 
intelligence will describe in a moment amendments 
which we offered in committee and before 
as the model in conference committee 
in conclusion protecting america 
his language adopted in the bill before 
chairman i rise in support of this 
it moves us in the right direction 
any other section in the patriot act 
more of it in connection with this 
and i rise in support of his 
but sadly others in this body did 
do data mining in an efficient way 
not other departments in the government 
has all been in favor of support 
earlier today hotels in amman jordan were 
i think everyone in this chamber is 
will be vigilant in supervising these authorities 
today not just in the oversight hearings 
that is why in the intelligence committee 
did not survive in the final house 
strong bipartisan support in this chamber that 
a remedy designed in the 1970s 
a tool not in the patriot act 
so in conclusion madam speaker 
imagine a world in which terrorists make 
with recruits online in cabs hotel lobbies 
more recent bombings in bali britain jordan 
of internet sites in libraries and to 
in reauthorizing the patriot 
many of us in both bodies worked 
in the end we 
been received even in a case where 
challenge an nsl in a federal court 
an important flaw in the bill and 
another flaw in the report is 
chairman i rise in support of the 
in order to thwart 
financing president bush in september of 2001 
an informal exchange in which payments are 
in addition terrorists engage 
addition terrorists engage in criminal activities such 
of the shortfalls in our laws that 
what we do in the amendment is 
that are suspect in order for this 
speaker i rise in support of hr 
terrorism financing language in the conference report 
in addition the bill 
the language in the conference report 
the language in the conference report 
find the holes in our laws and 
and our allies in the war on 
of alleged terrorism in london today should 
do the same in the united states 
bombers to gather in a rail station 
in the united states 
in the london investigation 
in the united states 
in the united states 
our counterterrorism investigators in the intelligence community 
the intelligence community in its effort to 
claim the time in opposition to the 
community s ability in the current form 
mr hyde xz4001920 in opposing this amendment 
to go but in the way this 
this time and in this bill 
speaker i rise in strong support of 
for his leadership in this conference and 
clarifications and improvements in many areas where 
in addition the congress 
the specific manner in which these authorities 
chairman i rise in opposition to the 
worked on this in the permanent select 
those improvements made in the permanent select 
is no time in which they have 
somebody has been in your house 
now the fbi in that case apologized 
i rise today in opposition to the 
act was passed in the aftermath of 
the country was in being drafted briefly 
hand of authorities in other countries to 
on the door in the middle of 
of the provisions in the patriot act 
to literally go in to your home 
are not engaged in terrorist actions they 
in other words most 
might be somewhere in the batch they 
get swept up in the search 
the terrorist bombings in madrid spain last 
this to happen in america 
in 2001 i voted 
2001 i voted in favor of the 
i said that in the anxious aftermath 
of the bill in four years 
james madison speaking in 1788 before the 
encroachments of those in power than by 
the barricade but in the library and 
i rise in opposition to the 
the terrorist bombings in madrid spain 
i rise today in strong opposition to 
or physical searches in foreign intelligence investigations 
to support it in its current form 
the house floor in july i expressed 
and peek searches in anyone s home 
american feel secure in their persons houses 
weak protection that in effect allows the 
american feel secure in their persons houses 
american feel secure in their persons houses 
or business and in effect fill in 
in effect fill in the names and 
this bill passes in its current form 
for a change in the formula and 
economic infrastructure targets in new jersey and 
and other targets in new jersey 
i rise today in opposition to hr 
a muslim student in idaho for posting 
plenty of concerns in my mind 
making the provisions in question permanent we 
206 roving wiretaps in national security cases 
the executive branch in a calmer atmosphere 
the front line in the fight against 
i rise today in opposition to the 
congress to achieve in defending their rights 
drops key protections in the senatepassed bill 
letters nsls are in effect a form 
be kept forever in government databases shared 
came to us in 2001 and i 
speaker i rise in opposition to this 
to our friends in great britain one 
our strongest allies in the fight against 
we are in this fight against 
aisle are united in that commitment 
see no division in our willingness to 
patriot act is in law right now 
the democratic process in this the people 
open democratic process in adopting one of 
and protect americans in our country but 
in fact when we 
the patriot act in july the republican 
the hundredfold increase in the issuance of 
to be serious in our response 
in fact it was 
the leadership is in the justice department 
most controversial provisions in the patriot act 
this motion in my opinion is 
is a step in the right direction 
but in the process we 
committee on intelligence in opposing this amendment 
hearing on afghanistan in which our wellinformed 
in colombia the revolutionary 
act to engage in drug trafficking that 
as provided in my amendment it 
who are engaging in this deadly trade 
law enforcement personnel in their ongoing global 
already been instrumental in warding off further 
in addition the bill 
in this measure my 
in afghanistan most of 
on the ground in places like afghanistan 
are dealing with in terrorism is that 
the recent bombings in london could have 
harm us here in america 
will not be in the future 
judicial oversight not in the current bill 
against possible abuses in the future while 
the fact that in an era of 
with the gentlewoman in california on many 
forward to both in judiciary and quite 
and quite candidly in other committees of 
of jurisdiction here in the congress to 
just close quickly in thanking the chairman 
will work together in conference to reconcile 
a bipartisan basis in the house has 
of my colleagues in strongly opposing the 
as you know in light of the 
world we live in now this is 
were not ruled in order and i 
to be detrimental in the end 
was not ruled in order 
have been allowed in 
what took place in london 2 weeks 
was not ruled in order 
amendment was ruled in order 
that has engaged in planning or perpetrating 
in 2000 the party

characterize this debate in the manner that 
as we rise in the backdrop of 
time for debate in committee i want 
voter rights act in 1965 which goes 
a policeman comes in late at night 
it is involved in an investigation and 
yet be vigorous in our fight for 
as well that in the amendment that 
and religious profiling in opposing this legislation 
are numerous provisions in both the expiring 
our nation prevail in the war against

who has engaged in fraud or misrepresentation 
or her day in court to prove 
in addition the current 
liberties for noncitizens in the united states 
liberties for noncitizens in the us enhance 
of immigrant communities in the fairness of

that was made in order by the 
for damages caused in connection with the

they were rebuffed in their efforts to 
a muslim student in idaho for posting 
to fighting terrorism in our country who 
and timely vehicle in which to address 
claim the time in opposition although i 
for his cooperation in working to have 
amendment be included in the final legislation 
but not necessarily in circumstances when we 
for damages caused in connection with the 
that is engaged in planning or perpetrating 
the opportunity to in fact allow victims 
who were harmed in the libyansponsored bombing 
la belle disco in germany 
in addition a group 
american prisoners tortured in iraq during the

bring about relief in special claims for 
particular individual constituents in their particular jurisdictions 
fortunately in the opportunity we 
sense of congress in the patriot act 
in their claim against

in closing mr chairman 
terrorism and including in that protection of 
give them relief in our courts 
should join us in supporting this motion 
and frame it in the context of 
the patriot act in some minds has 
we can begin in 4 years to

instruct and sunset in 4 years so 
and religious profiling in opposing this legislation 
are numerous provisions in both the expiring

i rise today in opposition to this 
and i rise in opposition to the 
lot of anguish in the house today 
will not succeed in changing our way 
key and congress in its vital function 
of the provisions in the patriot act 
were sunsetted back in 2001 so that 
surveillance on leaders in the civil rights 
the executive branch in this bill are 
and liberties provided in the constitution of 
in my opinion this 
i rise today in strong opposition to 
major deficiencies and in many ways it 
mr speaker back in 2001 when the 
the hurried manner in which they were 
john doe wiretaps in which they do 
are the rate in which they are 
the patriot act in its current form 
entitled going down in history with usa

civil rights leaders in this country people 
raised their voices in dissent or who 
over 150 provisions in this bill that 
with that possibility in mind that the 
the congress included in the patriot act 
act is inadequate in its protection of 
and other issues in an attempt to 
dozens of amendments in an attempt to 
least require reauthorization in the next 4

it fails in my opinion in 
in my opinion in that second provision 
certification was made in bad faith 
a considerable distance in the right direction 
go far enough in my opinion to 
go several steps in the right direction 
speaker i rise in support of the 
judge have resulted in the collection of 
this personal information in government databases even 
at least one in four years and 
we are engaged in a serious war 
and now in this war this 
to going back in some respects to

invades our liberties in ways that are

one time said in certain occasions there 
momentary discouragement or in a fit of 
founding fathers efforts in order to provide 
mr chairman in my rush to 
worked very hard in committee to make 
first passed it in 2001 
chairman i rise in support of this 
as we engage in one of the 
warrants and reins in the farreaching power 
the federal government in the frightening and 
upheld their use in limited and extraordinary 
disturbs me that in codifying this practice 
practice due caution in an effort to 
framers and embodied in our constitution 
list of situations in which the power 
destruction of evidence in which notification of 
to any investigation in which it would 
this serious flaw in the original patriot 
in addition it includes 
so that we in congress know when 
is requested and in what circumstances it 
in the fourth amendment 
speaker i rise in support of the 
it could do in the future 
congress to examine in a light much 
objective than that in which we passed 
usa patrlot act in hr 3199 changes 
am perplexed that in the same bill 
in doing so hr 
am glad that in respect to sections 
to join me in supporting this motion 
who was serving in congress on september 
we watched television in horror as the 
antiterrorist financing provisions in the act 
than 147 million in assets have been 
networks including one in my home state 
reform act approved in the wake of 
just as vital in the defense of 
rounds of bombings in london the reality 
to prevent them in the first place 
simply common sense in this era of 
that our trust in them is incomplete 
my congressional district in response to myths 
i feel confident in saying that terrorists 
chairman i rise in opposition to the 
from law enforcement in order to comply 
has extensive experience in the financial services 
this amendment in my judgment falls 
millions of dollars in terrorist assets have 
networks including one in my home state 
financing tools included in the act were 
reform legislation approved in the wake of 
just as vital in assisting law enforcement 
that our trust in them is incomplete 
will not expire in 7 years 
simply common sense in this era of 
citizen s membership in a nonviolent political 
citizen was engaging in other lawful political 
has been abuse in this area 
in the 1960s we 
in the 1970s we 
watergate and also in the 1990s we 
that should be in our minds and 
our minds and in our law but 
do recognize that in the patriot act 
be protected and in this case i 
have been reports in the paper of 
bill bothers me in the fact that 
and ironically in many ways we 
of the provisions in this bill 
act hr 3199 in no way brings 
to the government in the act will 
one useful service in that they force 
be issued will in no way hamper 
amendment protections would in no way interfere 
of a warrant in the event of 
in fact a requirement 
concentration of power in a few hands 
should also keep in mind that patriot 
already been used in nonterrorism related cases 
cases most notably in a bribery investigation 
a bribery investigation in nevada 
it still leaves in place large chunks 
of our colleagues in expressing our admiration 
in doing so we 
of any negligence in terms of protecting 
the american people in terms of homeland 
our founding fathers in their great wisdom 
they knew that in order to have 
of it is in the law 
they were controversial in a bipartisan way 
they would be in effect 
has not happened in an effective way 
when he described in detail the serious 
mr boucher xz4000430 in opposing this legislation 
will be improved in conference and then 
in fact the attorney 
forthcoming to congress in a timely manner 
usa today said in an editorial congress 
honor their legacy in however we vote 
bill do so in the hope that 
who have participated in this very important 
an outstanding leader in protecting our civil 
the patriot act in general 
in doing so we 
liberty without security in a democracy 
will be held in perpetuity by law 
letter who is in possession of your 
have been delinquent in the oversight of 
we are sworn in to protect and 
the american people in developing this reauthorizing 
today in london we have 
the explosions in that city today 
and the anguish in london is a 
can not relent in taking the steps 
our enemies written in the smoke rising 
do such violence in our homeland and 
our homeland and in the homeland of 
our continued success in the war on

learned that mixed in with these friendly 
hijackers took place in las vegas 
world we live in as well as 
this morning again in london 
has only been in effect for 7 
months which is in my opinion an 
include sunset provisions in the patriot act 
to civil liberties in this country without 
pretty bad folks in the city of 
city of chicago in working organized crime 
who are involved in murder and racketeering 
to put somebody in jail 
no safe haven in america 
all we do in the patriot act 
child molesters sitting in the library and 
me that somebody in america and in 
in america and in england and around 
is getting up in the morning thinking 
to kill somebody in an act of 
some emergency powers in here you are 
you should put in bills to remove

handed to us in a permanent form 
of our people in an extraordinary time 
once we live in peacetime 
we have peace in this country 
are going to in some way expand 
over our people in time of war 
cause of freedom in this country 
speaker i rise in support of this 
have never approved in peacetime 
prior cause and in general we lowered 
in times of emergency 
required to live in peacetime under the 
are doing here in this motion to 
faith with us in having an honest 
speaker i rise in strong support of 
part of those in this body who 
balance of power in the united states 
law and whether in the future there 
the federal government in a time of 
held so far in this conflict are 
of police powers in order to prosecute 
as i said in the original bill 
provisions were placed in all of these 
protect our people in this time of 
are talking about in terms of eliminating 
eliminating these sunsets in the current bill 
we do business in the united states 
does not result in a permanent change 
which would sunset in 4 years the 
bill would sunset in 10 years 
been made permanent in us law 
working for us in the war on 
out to achieve in this war 
sunsets the clause in 4 years that 
also be sunsetted in 2015 in the 
sunsetted in 2015 in the house version 
version rather than in the 5 years 
the 5 years in the senate bill 
of any person in connection with a 
the most controversial in the entire bill 
never justified even in wartime 
may be needed in a time of 
kind of power in the hands of 
tolerances our belief in the equality before 
in short radical islam 
our government here in america the terrorists 
during no war in the past whether 
expansions we put in a sunset clause 
question at hand in the debate today 
for wartime expansion in the war against 
permanent even now in this time of 
that still does in no way justify 
mr sensenbrenner xz4003650 in overseeing those expanded 
speaker i rise in support of this 
this rule but in opposition to the 
of 4year sunsets in those sections of 
what was included in the original patriot 
provisions sections sunsetted in the original 2001 
is no excuse in peacetime to give 
a few improvements in the bill but 
our government now in order to win 
should not live in peacetime under the 
speaker i rise in opposition to this 
bill and sunsetted in that bill 
have faith that in the future that 
oversight so far in determining whether or 
that were put in the original patriot 
that the people in the prolife movement 
antiillegal immigration group in california the fbi 
went after them in the last administration 
founding fathers had in mind 
increase those powers in an emergency 
chairman i rise in opposition to hr 
the safeguards currently in place to protect 
in fact i supported 
original bill passed in 2001 because it 
by law enforcement in order to better 
our nation prevail in the war against 
these 16 provisions in the patriot act 
rights of people in our country for 
sunset provisions originally in the patriot act 
even though some in our government may 
must be compromised in order to protect 
are giving up in the name of 
civil liberties especially in times of fear 
the constitution and in a manner that 
what is happening in london and with 
speaker i rise in strong opposition to 
i rise in opposition not just 
is not included in the bill and 
have more confidence in our law enforcement 
us remember that in the 1940s innocent

filling this hole in our defense against

those are not in the patriot act 
the patriot act in that context

have an impact in the last year 
most career officials in 10 years most 
able to get in the last year 
and i rise in strong support of 
of our freedom in a failed effort 
in the wake of 
broad bipartisan majorities in both houses of 
sharing provisions contained in the patriot act 
ago innocent citizens in london were murdered 
london were murdered in a series of 
the patriot act in october 2001 i 
in my words and 
my words and in my actions as

legislation that was in place prior to 
patriot act did in both national security 
as well as in delayed notification warrants 
been found constitutional in investigations such as 
with that not in the context of

marijuana were found in these bags when 
pounds of marijuana in they can bring

in this bill we 
it centralizes responsibility in the hands of 
of the fbi in signing off on

committee has done in the last 3 
an important consolidation in the criminal law 
as someone would in a similar attack 
put a bomb in the station than

extending the sunset in the last congress 
that were passed in 2001 that were 
or roving wiretaps in section 206 
in both section 215

constitutional and not in violation of the 
civil liberties protection in the area of

connecting the dots in time to avert 
broad bipartisan majorities in both houses passed 
and comprehensive negotiations in which all conferees

some to engage in political hyperbole and 
antiterrorism provisions contained in the patriot act

americans being gagged in a very very 
i stand here in the congress of

of doing that in the judiciary committee 
that was struck in that bill was 
we have struck in this bill is 
will react back in the opposite direction 
and law enforcement in unreasonable ways just 
we are reacting in favor of law 
in section 213 it 
in a letter to 
80 percent is in my estimation an 
is being used in ways that but 
a long time in criminal cases but 
have those authorities in foreign intelligence and 
a court order in order to get 
across that wall in order to protect 
act so that in the future it 
speaker i rise in strong opposition to

we are standing in has tried every 
tried every trick in the book to 
filter the debate in our very own 
our constitutional freedoms in our very own 
to ignore facts in order to manipulate 
policies that fly in the face of 
we live under in this country of

in the end i 
we will be in investigating the clandestine 
terrorist organizations and in preventing catastrophic events 
preventing catastrophic events in the future
