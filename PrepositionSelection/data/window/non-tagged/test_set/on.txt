the ranking democrat on the committee the 
here to speak on the bill and 
who have labored on this bill 
thank cheryl jaeger on my left of 
several months working on this bill 
consent that debate on this motion be 
of the committee on energy and commerce 
more thoughtful members on this subject and 
now and more on the way 
will have is on the cord blood 
all the members on both sides of 
will have is on the castledegette bill 
more controversial but on its own merit 
and then go on to the next 
the debate time on the pending bill 
insert extraneous material on the pending bill 
into the record on this bill hr 
an automatic position on 
debated and decided on its own merit 
so strongly about on either side that 
lifetime voting member on prolife issues minus 
on all the votes 
the wrong way on one issue so 
time of debate on hr 810 legislation 
the first time on then existing stem 
ideologically pure position on this issue 
bush recognized this on august 9 2001 
on recognizing the profound 
to be spent on embryonic stem cell 
today on this difficult issue 
to my decision on this vote because 
without setting out on an extraordinary and 
forward with debate on this bill my 
deeply held beliefs on both sides of 
of the committee on energy and commerce 
of the committee on rules 
of the committee on energy and commerce 
of the committee on energy and commerce 
a distinguished doctor on the committee on 
on the committee on energy and commerce 
have been heard on this important issue 
i respect members on both sides of 
chair the committee on energy and commerce 
put their comments on the record 
let us err on the side of 
drop the limit on current stem cell 
that we have on this floor 
is a fact on this also i 
all vote no on hr 810 
leadership of others on this debate today 
uniquely is based on their own view 
think my friends on the other side 
have a vote on a bill like 
this that based on the debate is 
because we feel on both sides of 
i am firmly on the side of 
a no vote on this bill mr 
allowing a vote on this important legislation 
needs to be on the quality of 
turn our backs on this 
for more research on alzheimer s including 
have significant bearing on the future of 
for their work on the first of 
have significant bearing on the future of 
two bills takes on the greatest significance 
smithbarton focuses on cordblood and adult 
bill it focuses on embryonic stem cell 
embryonic stem cell on the other hand 
whose futures depend on new answers to 
like my friends on the other side 
than my friends on the other side 
believe that research on embryonic stem cells 
hear my friends on the other side 
hear my friends on the other side 
flatlined spending budgeting on the national institutes 
should increase spending on medical research all 
my friends talk on this i do 
time cutting spending on what we should 
put a face on a couple that 
turn their backs on us or would 
their tireless efforts on behalf of the 
legislation a vote on the house floor 
my congressional district on the gulf coast 
let the research on stem cells continue 
these organizations listed on this posterboard such 
to vote yes on the bill 
we put that on a timeline of 
see a heartbeat on a sonogram 
california is already on the way 
by president bush on august 9 2001 
lines that existed on that date but 
it touches on questions of human 
allow a vote on this important bill 
to conduct research on unapproved stem cell 
states of america on this subject by 
turn its back on this opportunity 
continue to flourish on the principles it 
number one topic on these groups minds 
are fighting for on the floor today 
president bush made on august 9 2001 
funding for research on embryonic stem cells 
going to vote on today hr 810 
on the other hand 
has to say on this topic human 
must explore research on all types of 
of the committee on science 
research is going on at the private 
is also going on at the state 
is even going on to a degree 
over 3 years on this research at 
has been spent on adult stem cells 
research is going on at the time 
any extensive reading on this that is 
mr speaker on that i demand 
for her leadership on this issue 
a congressional roundtable on stem cells and 
stem cells and on the biotech industry 
s strict limits on stem cell research 
research has been on the forefront 
this bill being on the floor and 
not done it on humans 
mr smith xz4003801 on this bill and 
a democratic sponsor on it and i 
that we saw on the cannon terrace 
should vote yes on this bill and 
a wonderful help on this bill 
embryos now those on the other side 
assume no one on the other side 
we are on the verge of 
policy has failed on both counts 
sets explicit controls on how stem cell 
created the decision on how they will 
proud to stand on the house floor 
house will convene on monday at 12 
any votes called on these measures will 
on tuesday and the 
stem cell bill on tuesday followed on 
on tuesday followed on tuesday by the 
dod authorization bill on wednesday and thursday 
tradition around here on the dod authorization 
with your side on a unanimousconsent request 
and open debate on this very important 
your side probably on monday 
debate to start on that bill somewhere 
for taxpayerfunded research on welldeveloped stem cells 
definable and based on fact rather than 
of medical research on destroyed human embryos 
what is going on here 
much time remains on all sides 
to the time on all sides 
medical research predicated on the destruction of 
necessarily among some on this side of 
on the other hand 
based on this successful track 
turn the corner on these debilitating diseases 
to move forward on our moral imperative 
follow my heart on this and cast 
we are now on the threshold we 
we are now on the threshold of 
to vote yes on hr 810 
the federal government on the sidelines scientists 
economic growth depends on productivity productivity depends 
productivity productivity depends on technology and technology 
technology ultimately depends on basic science which 
stronger ethical requirements on stem cell lines 
a cure is on the horizon within 
just simply sit on the bench 
focuses government efforts on research with real 
bill also takes on the recommendations of 
spend our money on things that work 
be spending more on adult cells research 
their research dollars on what works adult 
its money efficiently on what works while 
a no vote on federal funding for 
has been going on for 10 12 
put a man on the moon in 
it is really on point and very 
have heard people on the other side 
kind of follow on the gentleman from 
are against people on my side of 
of the gentlemen on my side of 
that are still on ice if you 
smart ones remaining on ice that possibly 
with our colleagues on both sides of 
nih for research on nonhuman primates to 
genetic counseling studies on couples who have 
already doing testing on those embryos to 
i have signed on to this bill 
probably being spent on research 
put a moratorium on the harvesting of 
funding for research on embryonic stem cells 
who have signed on to this bill 
we are on to something here 
enlighten my colleagues on both sides of 
a colloquy later on but i thank 
each of us on this floor today 
the smith legislation on umbilical cord stem 
will expand research on embryonic stem cells 
shutting the door on federal research on 
on federal research on embryonic stem cells 
slamming the door on stem cell research 
opportunity to capitalize on breakthrough scientific research 
courage and leadership on both sides of 
the research supported on this bill on 
on this bill on adult stem cells 
this list on the left on 
on the left on this chart shows 
on the right is 
place ethical burdens on the children who 
place ethical burdens on the millions of 
the additional research on adult stem cells 
and its emphasis on embryonic stem cell 
scientists tremendous insights on the replacement of 
adult stem cells on the other hand 
undertake cuttingedge research on the most pressing 
an unwarranted restriction on stem cell research 
to have that on a particular day 
have our ideas on how we can 
indicate will be on tuesday 
office are working on that unanimous consent 
points of view on the legislation 
available to be on the floor or 
both certainly agree on this procedure that 
are strong views on either side of 
in fact move on that 
would simply observe on our side and 
side and frankly on your side that 
committee almost unanimously on voice vote passed 
disagreed with us on 
and his leadership on this bill 
funding for research on stem cell lines 
recall that on that date president 
to support research on human embryo stem 
made a judgment on 
much about life on this floor 
this bill tramples on the moral convictions 
on the contrary it 
into a movie on a amp e 
that brooke wrote on the issue in 
everyone here knows on august 9 2001 
would expand research on embryonic stem cells 
should not infringe on states or private 
several voices speaking on behalf of many 
down and dependent on a ventilator for 
they will act on behalf of our 
interest and not on an isolated viewpoint 
freed from the on august 9th 2001 
fund research conducted on to stem cell 
could be done on no more than 
make substantive progress on the issue passing 
are not regenerating on their own is 
the work done on stem cells just 
and vote unanimously on these two outstanding 
would promote research on a type of 
a yes vote on hr 810 simply 
annually to congress on the activities carried 
acting on behalf of scientists 
of federal guidelines on human embryonic stem 
rules governing research on human tissues be 
it builds on the president s 
lot of discussion on the floor today 
issue and one on which we disagree 
does begin and on that issue your 
issue your vote on this bill rests 
as they embark on the ethical expert 
to permitting research on 78 then the 
hospital have embarked on a monumental and 
scientific research community on regenerative medicine 
is basically focused on adult stem cell 
seems to be on a very fast 
procedures we depend on to make informed 
questions than answers on this bill 
know one thing on a matter of 
dialogue to develop on a matter of 
committee process subverted on a matter of 
views of scientists on the potentiality of 
of members not on the committee the 
on a matter of 
to vote no on the degettecastle bill 
people remain existent on this earth 
s 2001 ban on the use of 
provide important leadership on the ethical parameters 
current federal policy on embryonic stem cell 
federally funded research on stem cell lines 
with this debate on embryonic stem cell 
a google search on permissible medical experiments 
permissible medical experiments on human beings 
but it insists on caution as well 
permitting research only on excess embryos created 
support limited research on human embryonic stem 
about coming down on the wrong side 
will make research on them useless 
strong ethical requirements on stem cell lines 
bush 2001 limitations on stem cell research 
researchers who depend on federal funds lack 
changing federal policy on human embryonic stem 
know a vote on legislation that would 
by voting yes on hr 810 to 
i also sit on the committee that 
as i sit on that committee and 
ones who are on the verge of 
the current restrictions on creating human embryos 
remarkable discoveries and on the brink of 
to vote yes on hr 810 
i rise today on behalf of my 
also rise today on behalf of the 
congressional working group on parkinson s disease 
white house policy on stem cells 
will wreak havoc on the daily lives 
when jesus walked on the earth 
make the decision on our own 
good values judgment on which everybody should 
in their research on spinal cord injuries 
and tangible impact on millions of lives 
must not continue on this dangerous course 
allows for research on embryonic stem cell 
turn our backs on this 
turn our backs on this important research 
funding of research on stem cells that 
of higher learning on the cutting edge 
the current ban on stem cell research 
innovation and progress on the sidelines 
therapies more efficiently on laboratory tissue instead 
bush s policy on stem cell research 
lines currently available on the national institutes 
the current policy on the use of 
the federal research on stem cell lines 
of both sides on this issue but 
of development depends on how we perceive 
is no ban on research for the 
of ivf embryos on which such research 
should be spent on the destruction of 
conduct scientific research on federal death row 
conduct destructive experiments on them because it 
will be sold on the floor today 
money not only on the destruction but 
the destruction but on the creation of 
speaker the debate on stem cell research 
value we place on human life 
and impose them on others 
research places humanity on the frontier of 
on the side of 
this extraordinary research on the frontier of 
like to reflect on the dilemma that 
as we decide on this particular vote 
disease and so on 
discarded anyway and on and on and 
and on and on and on 
and on and on 
yet on the other side 
would not experiment on that child 
is no restriction on private funding on 
on private funding on embryonic stem cell 
so many people on both sides of 
removes the dilemma on both sides 
rather than allocated on the basis of 
years probably 10 on the laborhhs subcommittee 
not to be on high moral ground 
should not depend on the local initiative

for his stand on this issue and 
want to use on numerous occasions and 
we did it on the marriage issue

as many democrats on the bill itself 
an endangered species on it 
the snail was on it 
endangered species is on private property 
while putting food on their tables and 
were developed based on the equivalent of

a bad idea on philosophical and legal 
and rely instead on recovery plans to

written and coordinated on 
10 percent disagreement on this bill and 
this bill mainly on to public lands 
endangered species are on private lands

enforcing conservation actions on private land 
can be found on 4 million acres 
truly endangered or on the flip side 
battling it out on the floor against 
could not agree on these last few 
the regulatory landscape on property owners regulated 
based on that premise i 
offering of working on this piece of 
recovery plans based on biology 
recovery habitat based on those recovery plans 
needed to take on the service 
the evolving circumstances on the ground that 
was currently doing on the property and 
for a restriction on his property it 
an aye vote on the underlying bill 
his tremendous work on this legislation 
recovery less demanding on some landowners and 
urge my colleagues on both sides of 
of the committee on resources agree to 
based not only on species that are 
endangered but also on species that are 
requiring special stipulations on federal leases 
intent to be on the record 
some fair consensus on that 
through the committee on resources and further 
of the area on which you can 
right now purchasing on a speculative basis 
or getting options on property that in 
a destination resort on that tree farm

very important work on this vital piece 
a bipartisan compromise on this 
long and hard on this represents part 
in the committee on rules yesterday the

placing emphasis instead on functional recovery plans 
time to speak on an issue that
