embassy is back of this bill another
my distinguished committee of the judiciary colleagues
have been gutted of the bill and
and women serving of iraq but we
and unnecessary war of iraq
we sign off of another billion check
this is of top on the
a committee markup of an accurate and
on the bill of the committee report
what occurred of this body last
issues we consider of this institution but
urge my colleagues of both sides on
troops are serving of iraq and i
and women are of iraq because in
provision focused solely of federal employees which
kind in confidence of the future

the ultimate sacrifice of the name in
have been made of defense in this
amendment on fact of the entire debate
on the debate of the committee over
one no one of the majority no
majority no one of the minority mentioned
predators no one of the committee debate
wanted to say of the floor in
the house or of the committee as
do not appear of the bill number
bills were similar of that both would
are not fine of the reports in
whereas the committee of the judiciary conducted
the bill reported of that same day
whereas the committee of the judiciary subsequently
in which failed of partyline votes whereas
from this practice of house report by
correct it both of the committee rules
committee rules and of the house floor
and inaccurate captions of house report whereas
by the committee of the judiciary of
of the judiciary of three separate occasions
separate occasions and of each case these
amendments were described of these earlier committee
in the committee of the judiciary whereas
opportunity to comment of or characterize the
vote captions published of house report appear
the abovementioned votes of house report and
i seek recognition of a question on
concerns the manner of which amendments i
during the committee of the judiciary s
committee s report of that legislation house
the language of question appears of
of question appears of pages and in
mischaracterizes my amendments of a manner that
have never previously of my years as
this house nor of my quarter century
need to rise of a personal privilege
so terrible maligned of an official record
any legislative body of which i have
on the committee of rules and in
that is perhaps of the regrettably poisonous
involves the committee of the judiciary s
my colleagues offered of committee of good
offered of committee of good faith and
have the opportunity of the report to
this house sits of committees every member
language it used of context the last
time the committee of the judiciary reported
in the judiciary of three prior occasions
of no case have
amendments been described of the inaccurate and
fashion they were of this year s
nobody of the majority none
on the republicans of opposing my amendments
opposing my amendments of committee debate said
who offered them of the section in
fail the institution of which we are
i hope that of our conduct we
the great members of the history in
said and did of this house floor
and established practice of the house for
truman committee back of world war ii
to conduct activities of afghanistan and iraq
on dollars missing of iraq after auditors
out that stands of stark contrast to
the rule because of my mind this
its duty and of my mind any
these sloppy operations of iraq they are
on the committee of the judiciary have
that they have of protecting the civil
freedom in speech of this floor and
judiciary leadership did of this bill as
that we wrote of our amendments that
the republican leadership of this house that
shall reflect credibly of the house in
of doing so the
mischaracterized their amendments of a manner that
that the majority of a regular and
with the committee of the judiciary report
refused to apologize of his own accord
leadership will reflect of their obligations to
in the committee of the judiciary
view on everyone of this body and
on the committee of the judiciary once
were but particularly of terms in the
to a discussion of the merits on
need to function of this body are
