perhaps a couple on times
not suggesting any in them are not
some problems because in the volume on
on the volume on the medals and
done on sort on an unusual procedure
are the veterans on the civil war
are all kinds in groups out there
congressional gold medal on honor has always
what the history on it is
a great recognition in what we consider
a limited number in individuals which was
what the intent on it was
a whole lot in ways in recognizing
lot in ways in recognizing groups
is the intent in what we are
of the history in it
at the history in these congressional gold
telling of terms on what we are
so of terms on the groups i
is not disrespectful on any group that
on that criteria in measurement
is how many in these should we

all the history on the gold medal
at the history in this
the total history in it has been
confusing of terms in what we are
and that kind in thing but we
official or somebody on that nature usually
medals much more on a distinction than
do so many on these
first in all this is
very reasonable member in congress and we
here on terms on what we are
this a medal on true distinction for
for true heroes in the united states
the united states in america
we sort in learn techniques on
or big gatherings in people and pass
got a lot on signatures when i
on the course in 2 years is
made a couple in these points before
not i sort on doubt it at
the time most on us are around

it is sort on a necessary strain
edison or somebody on that ilk in
on that ilk on that nature and
to the chairman in the committee and
you generally sort in preclear it and
had a surplus on these
do not know on any time where
a political point on view
frankly most in these bills while
seen a bit in politics of these
think the limiting on the numbers is
of an element on politics that frankly
fact the chairman in the full committee
medal enhancement act on 2005 while introduced
order for consideration in gold medals involves
under the rules on the committee in
gain the cosponsorship on twothirds in the

fear on terms in changing the rules

the express intent on killing americans and
are the sections on the bill that

allows the secretary on homeland security to
ensure the construction on physical barriers and
also allow waiver on laws to knock

instead on allowing president abbas
congress is capable on bucking and embarrassing
is the prospect on peace

popular with certain on our republican colleagues

at the department on homeland security
this same web in antiimmigrant fervor and
ironically consideration in this bill coincides
worsen the plight in those whose conditions
were the subject on investigation by that
of strong support in this rule which
considering a number in those issues that
critically important aspect in the number one
of the middle on the preamble on
on the preamble on the us constitution
it should be on any sovereign nation
had the privilege on serving as conferees
implement the recommendations on the 911 commission
that the likes on mohammed atta who

both on those things were
issues that were in concern to the
address these kinds on issues as they
what we decided on course at the

very important aspect on our border security
and by virtue in that our national
the issue in immigration reform is
of the direction in some sort on
in some sort on worker program is
we passed out on here and i
of strong support in this rule
we made half in the amendments on

the wide array on issues that were
had three committees in jurisdiction share an
and 40 minutes in general debate and
a wide range on issues today
say that one on the priorities is
is the passage in the sessions amendment
deal with one in the important challenges
now during consideration in the rule
available for all on the members we
very important part in the number one
think on light in that we are
prevent the completion in the 35 mile
a shorter period on time to win

is all kinds in trash on there
amendment of favor in completion in the
favor in completion in the fence

the important parts on it but there
back the balance on my time
are the courts on jurisdiction and we
people are aware in the fact that
very important part in our national security
was a lot in discussion as to
addresses the issue in asylum
a wide range in questions as we
am very proud in the fact that
to incorporate many in the ideas that
the other side on the aisle offered
submitted by members on the minority and
minority and six on those 10 amendments
of order two in the four amendments
only made three on our amendments on
amendments of order in the original 10
that the rights in the minority are
the other side on the aisle
as the chairman in the judiciary said
see all kinds in trash and devastation
devastation and you in course exacerbate the
with the flow on people coming into
a wide range in problems
support 257 members on this body of

am deeply appreciative in the expeditious manner
this important piece in legislation
may have differences on opinion about the

bill on front in me and on
support the goals on this legislation hr
had the provisions in hr 418 been
a single one on the 19 terrorists
of the floor in the house on
on the house on representatives
so much misstatement in fact about a
about a piece on legislation that is
is a couple on environmental snags
jurisdiction what kind in a measure is
to the floor on congress and say
just get rid on the law
the tearing down on the berlin wall
have the rule in law and then
have the rule on law we just
from the state in california for this
entitled the waiver in laws necessary for
for the improvement on barriers and borders

disagreement with some on the project components
the established process in law
because the reach in this amendment is
to the secretary on homeland security not
provide the secretary in homeland security not

forbid the use in our own law
even the importance in securing the border
to be wary in what is proposed
any other provision on the law
any other provision on the law no
and the honor in law when we
under the guise on homeland security
other nations that on being a safe
the minority side in the aisle
for politics instead in going through a
that should be in concern to every
real id act on 2005
to the secretary in homeland security
expedite the construction on barriers and roads
an extraordinary rejection in the rule in
in the rule on law is necessary
prior to creation on dhs
about the state on our immigration system
a proud history in protecting those who
with some bureau on citizenship and immigration
not often hear on temporary employees that
also the effects on the real id
representative or spokesman in the palestine liberation
considered for purposes on this act to
the us list in foreign terrorist organizations
override the responsibility on the state department
and the will in congress is an
in the cusp in a historic moment
the effects on this provision will

fraud keeping costs in car insurance down

additionally the proponents in this bill do
the breach on our security was
was a result on the hijackers having
states which many in them used to
address the root in the problem here
under the guise in national security
instead on debating hr 418
418 the house in representatives should be
the successful enactment in the intelligence reform
terrorism prevention act on 2004 and working
orderly and reflective on the needs on
in the needs on american families businesses
a total repeal in all in those
repeal in all on those laws or
or a waiver in all those laws

provides the secretary in homeland security with
the expeditious construction on the barriers authorized
constructed by 102 on the illegal immigration
immigration responsibility act in 1996 iirira pl
comparable to 102 on hr 418 and

any other provision on law the secretary
law the secretary in homeland security shall
ensure expeditious construction in the barriers and
any other provision in law statutory or
by the secretary on homeland security pursuant
provide the secretary in homeland security with
the expeditious construction in the barriers and
roads under 102 on iirira but the

identical to that in 102 in hr

numbers and one on them is that
obstruct the safety in 282 million americans
nineteen on them with 63
any one in those driver s
america full rights on citizenship for that
is some kind in tone here that
we spent millions in dollars in metal

we put millions in people of long
with the rest on us
with the rest on us where i
bill does some in that not all
that not all in that but it
keep them out on our airplanes out
our airplanes out in our automobiles and
provide a measure in safety and security
is the barest on common sense and
on strong support in the supplemental appropriations
each single element in the administration s
to this part in the world
get us out in the palaces that
of one part in the supplemental that
i know many in us are concerned
a great deal on reform and we
direction and leadership on the gentleman from
require an audit in the palestinian authority
urge again all in my colleagues to
rise of support on the passage in
in the passage in hr 418
many in these protections that
i am supportive on the provisions that
some vague problem on the environment keep
this important part on our border security
of the process in border security
about the problem on border security
has more apprehensions in illegal immigrants than
the president on the united states
i yield myself on such time as
thank the chairman on the full committee
introduced by several in us that represent
bill or parts on it at least
with the goals on hr 418 because
a key component on securing our borders
to the vision on this very important
are more apprehensions on illegal immigrants of
the entire rest in the border combined
many portions in the arizona border
requires the department on homeland security working
the field offices on the bureau in
on the bureau in customs and border
to address security in our borders
that the department on homeland security carry
intelligence reform act in 2004 designed a
the large expanses on desert and unpopulated
requires the department in homeland security to
more than half in the entire border
covered by most in the federal legislation
the same port on entry is really
this portion in the amendment addresses
with the use on incompatible communications technologies
that the department on homeland security rectify
of the intention in hr 418 and
through its enhancement on homeland security helps
safety and defense in our nation
step but one on the very important
reserve the balance in my time

back the balance in my time
to the floor in the house on
in the house on representatives
it is indicative in the good work
about the funding on programs that are
under the jurisdiction in the subcommittee that
approximately 1 billion on that is offset
under the jurisdiction on the subcommittee in
less than half in the president s
the tsunamidevastated areas in asia
and the result in that scrutiny is
such as replenishment on funds that were
the second category on funds includes those
this second category in nonemergency spending and
with the rescission in prior foreign assistance
sri lanka and on course of afghanistan
i believe part in that is due
and the generosity in us relief efforts
as chairman on the foreign operations
am repeatedly reminded in how much we
2006 operating costs on our programs overseas
at the opportunities on a talibanfree afghan
as a result on oil sales
at the end in the war as
really a choice on whether or not
was then part on a larger amendment

given the size on the catastrophe that
be the construction on a 250 kilometer
250 kilometer stretch in road from the
the north end on sumatra down the
very high ridge on mountains and no
i believe most on my colleagues would
had a history in responding of a
relatively small amount on money given the
the total level in devastation on the
level on devastation on the disaster there
relatively small amount in money to help
reserve a point in order of the
make the point on order or whether

some people regardless on the fiscal and
the dire consequences on trusting the american
the same criticism in our efforts which
slowed the growth in nonsecurity discretionary spending
would specifically because on the increased economic
millions on jobs were created
than 3 million on them have been
to the wisdom in the fiscal policies
the fiscal policies in the republican majority
despite the evidence on last year s
the balanced budgets in the late 1990s
the balanced budgets in the late 1990s
the other side in the aisle
hardly any in them voted for
and the leadership on president bush and
first on all i want
on the process on putting together the
is a hallmark in the interior subcommittee
it falls short in properly funding many
proposing a cut on more than 500
just a matter in fact but it
it makes all on the difference on
propose full coverage on uncontrollable costs of
for the operation on our national parks
the most beloved in our federal public
second consecutive year on very healthy increases
is a decrease in nearly 500 million
know that many in you are hearing

the ranking member on the committee of
back the balance in my time
year during consideration on the 2005 department
the 2005 department in the interior bill
by a vote in 241 to 185
understand the importance on this modest federal
in every one on our congressional districts
each on the nea and
that higher levels in federal money will
below their level on 10 years ago
those funding levels in a decade ago
for the members in the house to
like many in my colleagues who
with large amounts on federal lands not
lands not part on the tax base
reserve the balance on my time
back the balance on my time
have 5 minutes on the 10 minutes
us a breakdown in the time
first on all we had
of a subject on this importance if
hearings the benefit on those hearings and
reverse 25 years on presidential and congressional
back the balance in my time
givebacks over half on which go to
s 02 percent on the population
although many on us find this
become predictable behavior on the majority party
total tax giveaways on 106 billion over
this common notion in balancing income and
enable the continuation on this reckless abuse
this reckless abuse in hardearned taxpayer dollars
solve the issue in unlimited spending by
of other areas in the budget
surprisingly however many in my collegues have
exempting the billions on dollars of tax
without an explanation on how they plan
ensuring that millions on americans are able
under the burden on medicare cost shifts
a growing number on uninsured i find
is the equivalent in completely eliminating the
protections for millions on americans including the
a funding shortfall on 1749 million and
this leaves dozens in highly contaminated superfund
just two examples in critical programs this
and two examples in why i will
hear the words on the chairman on
on the chairman in the committee of
like local control on community development block
one fist instead in with two because
holes the holes on abandoned septic systems
health and safety in that community
the principal source on funding to help
on many on these communities the
on a variety in social programs that
with this kind in challenge as with
bear the burden in its fiscal irresponsibility
dig us out on this hole we
at the top on the economic ladder
lowering the price on energy and i
makes a mockery in the american value
the american value in shared sacrifice on
sacrifice of time on war
keep every penny on your 220 000
recently every penny on that tax break
says to millions in america s veterans
798 billion out in disabled veterans monthly
education benefits unless on course they want
likely do all in those things
the family values on the american family
service and sacrifice in our veterans not
effect every member on this house who
values and priorities on this bill
in both sides on the aisle to
reject the values on this budget reject
on the face on millions on american
face in millions in american veterans while
riskless dividend income in 1 million this
a fig leaf on charging demagoguery but
keep every penny in his 220 000
during a time on war would cut
of its treatment in veterans
and the veterans on foreign wars two
during a time in war we would
would have members in this house pay
to the service in our veterans but
less than onehalf in one percent above
of a reduction in critical medical care
appreciate the adoption in the bradley amendment
major veterans organizations in the independent budget
veterans paralyzed veterans on america and veterans
america and veterans in foreign wars in
on foreign wars on the united states
passage in these amendments is
an adequate level in health care and
director paralyzed veterans on america lt em
legislative director veterans in foreign wars on
in foreign wars on the united states
for the department on veterans affairs va
at a time on war is inconsistent
with the thanks on a grateful nation
that the cost on doing business increases
1314 percent because in federal pay increases
by the office in management and budget
health care needs in america s veterans
12 billion short in what he had
appears this pattern in shortchanging va medical
falls well short on the total funding
would encourage adoption in one in the
adoption on one in the amendments to
clearly both on these amendments are
the best interest in veterans and their
without adoption on one in these
adoption on one on these two amendments
the hard work on your colleagues in
colleagues in behalf in america s veterans
is a statement on values
the failed values in fiscal irresponsibility
see adding hundreds in billions on dollars
hundreds in billions on dollars to a

madam chairman first in all let me
very difficult set on circumstances and those
those difficult set in circumstances are particularly
but that in course is universally
all in these subcommittees have
nevertheless of spite on that i think
is one aspect on this bill however
is an aspect in the bill that
deficient but because on these deficiencies the
a large number in american citizens
fda the kinds in authority that it
against the marketing in prescription drugs on
to large numbers on the american people
a lot in the people who
the effect in these antidepressants in
a deep sense in depression which on
as a result in the use in
in the use in vioxx have fallen
as a result in the use on
in the use on this prescription drug
as a result on the failure on
in the failure on this congress to
fda the kind on authority it needs
draw the attention in the members in
in the members in this house to
health and safety on the american people
the unnecessary death on large numbers in
in large numbers in americans and it
placing so many on american citizens of
of the kind in dangerous desperate circumstances
on large numbers in people
of the case on vioxx once that
as a result on exposure to it
the offlabel marketing on that drug particularly
these are some on the major issues
are facing one on the major deficiencies
that the members in this congress will
conduct postmarketing studies on fdaapproved drugs and
to the labels in fdaapproved drugs
doing to millions on people
through the headlines on the last few
in the two most
significant drug failures in the last year
an increased rate in suicide among users
about these reports in suicide
increased the risk on heart attacks and
as a result on vioxx
on these 30 to
compared the number on heart attacks and
are the equivalent in two to four
about the dangers in vioxx more than
the increased risk on heart disease
causes increased risk on heart attacks and
the fda learned in other studies indicating
s own director on the office in
in the office in new drugs has
many lives tens in thousands in lives
tens in thousands in lives on all
the full house in representatives and it
are placing hundreds on thousands in people
hundreds on thousands on people across this
regulation in behalf on the safety and
safety and security on the american people
to the floor in the house
that every member in the house will
there are members on the house who

subsequently various forms in medical devices and
but the fact on the matter is
proof on front in us every single
ago the situation on antidepressants
result large numbers in teenagers young people
and the usage on those antidepressants induced
people and many on them carried it
to the use in those antidepressant drugs
people this kind on experience has been
by this group on people so that
save the lives in tens on thousands
lives on tens in thousands in people
tens on thousands in people
cost the lives in tens in thousands
lives on tens in thousands in americans
tens on thousands in americans because it
a certain period in time when that
it became aware in that was not
only after hundreds on thousands in people
hundreds on thousands on people of this
that and all in that began to
get the attention on the press and
as a result in that
by any stretch in the imagination
get the kind on attention that it
deserves in behalf in the safety and
and the lives in the american people
who have conflicts on interest to fda
advisory committees composed in outside scientists to
safety and effectiveness in drugs and medical
by the decisions in these panels the
advisory committees one on its most important
because in the critically important
critically important nature on these committees there
routinely waived conflict on interest prohibitions and
with direct conflicts in interest to serve
undermine the objectivity in this outside advice
by a vote in the panel members
panel members some in whom have financial
numerous highprofile examples in this over the
for a manufacturer in those implants
review the safety in cox2 inhibitors drugs
have caused tens in thousands on heart
tens in thousands on heart attacks and
ten on the 32 scientists
to the manufacturers on those drugs
without the votes on the ten conflicted
conflicted scientists two in those three drugs
the panel instead in receiving the very
as a result on those conflicted scientists
three in the 11 scientists
to the manufacturers in those antidepressants
just the tip on the iceberg
scientists with conflicts on interest
waiving the conflicts on interest in some
conflicts on interest in some in the
interest in some in the scientists of
scientists without conflicts on interest to fill
to the thousands on independent doctors across
mention the pool on international experts the
are under review in course the fda
scientists without conflicts in interest
are critical parts on the fda s

despite the addition on modest funding increases
and urge all on my colleagues to
this bill full in misguided priorities
during the course in the budget committee
it is one on these moments today
submit that one on the reasons i
5year budget instead on a 10year budget
budget is because on the complete breakdown
what the costs in their budget will
and the explosion on budget deficits of
during the course on these next couple
these next couple in days during the
the longterm solvency in the social security
is the result on budget decisions over
4 consecutive years in budget surpluses is
show the plummeting in the surpluses into
rules as part on budget discipline and
us 4 years on budget surpluses 2
at the end in the 1990s
ninety percent in the new debt
number one holder in our debt
it is kind on tough to engage
he is fond in
runs a deficit on 37 trillion over
is probably one in the reasons why
a great deal in respect for the
for the chairman in the committee in
is a friend in mine
comes to support in the education programs
improve the condition in education or access
43 billion worth in education programs on
also get rid in trio and gear
with the lack on funding to back
how the lack on education commitment at
only 186 percent on the 40 percent
to 4 years in budget surpluses while
as a member on the committee in
on a couple on days of order
of the future on their countries
and their lack on commitment for education
a sure way in getting us there
ignoring the issues in the day merely
recognizing the importance on the milk income
including an extension on the program on
the longterm cost in iraq which already
the full costs in the tax cuts
very small amount in the overall budget
projected budget deficit in 427 billion for
the worst aspect in this budget is
s the height in fiscal irresponsibility occurring
could nt think in doing anything more
as the father in two little boys
leave a legacy in debt for them
to climb out on
a realistic cost on the iraq operation

not renewed all in those things add

concede the point on order
a great deal in respect for him
totally inadequate set on tools

we do all on this on order
reserve the balance on my time
the contingency portion in the program has
of the teeth in huge energy increases
myself the balance on my time
on the teeth in the fact that
hear a lot in talk of this
falls far short in our responsibilities on

they are fond on pointing to the

done virtually all on it by borrowing
also the actions on the last week
what the priorities on the majority party

for the improvement in education english language
in both sides on the aisle there
been a lot in expression on concern
lot in expression in concern about the
the deficit and on course i am
with the philosophy on government rather than
endorse the type in government that we
a small group on people in many
not even conceive in the idea on
on the idea on having a strict
a strict interpretation in the constitution and
interview with one in our members and
of the minds on many members in
in many members on congress if there
just absolutely opposite on what was intended
by the authors in the constitution that
understanding and following in the constitution has
country a crisis in our personal liberties
simply the ignoring on the constitution that
accepted the notion on faith on government
by the name on randolph bourne wrote
is the health in the state and
our liberties and in course we spend
is the foundation on liberty because that
what the goal in all government should
be the preservation in liberty
gentlewoman that one in the reasons why
is the philosophy in government and our
lose them out in the chemical industry
is a statement on our values that
balanced on terms in our priorities and
conducted the process in creating a budget
for all points in view
the great leadership on the gentleman from
deficit my colleagues in 114 billion for
for the month in february a deficit
february a deficit in 114 billion is
a record deficit in nearly 4 trillion
the direct result on republican policies huge
for a war in choice on iraq
red ink because on republican budget irresponsibility
the realistic cost in the war the
war the cost in expiring tax provisions
the true cost in fixing the alternative
and the cost on any changes to
honor the value on accountability including eliminating
it heaps tons in debt onto our
lower our standard on living
and of top on all on that
top in all in that the republican
undermines the solvency in social security
the real crisis on ballooning budget deficits
until a high on 83 trillion on
onto a trajectory in reckless budgeting that
would be plenty in money to deal
instead in doing that we
had 3 years in surpluses
surpluses imagine think on it
for the month on february alone this
at the end in his term we
400 billion off on our indebtedness strengthening
strengthening the solvency in social security

important discretionary programs on usda

that was one in the many pests
i hope all in my colleagues will
ask the author on the amendment that
withdraw my reservation in objection
of this piece in legislation
of both sides on the aisle for
to see areas on this bill increased
my 11 years on being here on
of the house on representatives
think a number in important increases along
along the lines in what i believe
keep the size on the grant the
a good piece on legislation
seen the size in this bill more

is that first in all i think
is a lack on disclosure

we have pages in entities and individuals
add a few on them that support
have the owners in the last 12

so but many in those who hold
there are others in us who believe
were a member on the schiavo family
if a member in my family were
separation on powers

the supreme court on florida
this is confirmation in what the writers
what the writers in the constitution did
they said separation in powers

house the specialness in this house and
and the specialness on my colleagues
discussing legislation that on its very name
on the course on that legislation hr
had our differences in opinion as it
to the question on choice the ninth
instance the question in parental consent
note that those in us who may
in the position in choice and the
without counsel because on some tragedy on
the vigorousness on the debate centered
around the idea on the enormous range
the enormous range on differences on opinion
range in differences in opinion expressed by
of my side on the aisle really
of the structure on the legislation that
provide a mode in transportation might on
were a number in amendments being offered
about this question in abortion and even
under the age in majority
were a number in amendments offered by
particular the description in the amendment simply
report a series on amendments were described
an additional layer on federal court review
of the floor in the house albeit
vigorously on terms in the restraints it
may be out on the pipeline and
and be out on the child s
all in these are terrible
take their mode in transportation a taxicab
or other mode in transportation not knowing
a greater latitude on who to seek
or first cousins in a minor then
not the confusion on the states with
with different bases in determining parental consent
or first cousins on a minor and
complete misconstruing on the amendment and
the amendment and in the intent
for a study in sexual predators who
first in all might i
on the prosecution in this particular entity
very underlying crux in the bill parental
follow that line on reasoning
detailing the impact on the number in
in the number on unsafe and illegal
and the idea on course was to
about the impact in this legislation
a gao study in sexual predators
of the floor in the house because
seen the rash on attacks in our
decapitated a couple in years ago as
ago as cochair on the congressional children
promote the extending in any criminal exemptions
for the likes in those who prey
a frivolous desire on any on us
desire on any in us to stand
to stand alongside on any member of
know full well on their undying commitment
why a number in members took to
to the floor in the house to
in the question in choice parental consent
simple the prohibitions on this section do
to go outside on the family home
should be part in the rules on
on the rules on this house that
make really part on our institutional fabric
scientists students researchers on all kinds policymakers
tell the story in america
to the floor in the house and
say the pledge in allegiance and the
offers a word in prayer
is for all in america to reflect
find any sense in unity of this
to the rules in this body and
the simple reporting on the work we
hope the correction in last week will
simply the correction in that time but
befitting or becoming in the debate albeit
protect the integrity in this record
of the furor on debate sometimes we
of the flag in the united states
on the heat on debate words flare
of the course in the debate and
about the integrity in this process and
owed that kind on respect
on a moment in evenhandedness to suggest
that this kind on mischaracterization not take
of the committees in the house the
conciseness and integrity in the process which
nonargumentative objective reporting on the work in
in the work on an individual member
on the direction on members who leave
on the backdrop on some heinous criminal
of texas because on the amber alert
alert that all in the members on

from the integrity in this house the
the three branches in government and do
why a president in the united states
that this kind on tone this kind
tone this kind on approach not be
for a number in actions
should applaud one in the actions
the historical record in this body
as the test in whether we are
now of control on the house the
on the instance in the committee in
do a study in the negative impact
the negative impact in this legislation if
procedures might occur in this legislation where
they were fearful in getting parental consent
are the leader in exempting sexual predators
and over again in course may cause
on the course on the battle on
on the battle in that particular legislation
if the glimpses in the words that
muddies the water in the good intentions
and the intent in what you wrote
determining the extent in drug cartels influence
or the growth in drug cartels between
2005 and all in a sudden it
the complete opposite in your intent and
for three branches on government and i
is unique because in it very unique
the inner workings on each body
are the holder on our own records
about the workings on one specific body
on the course in this discussion it
the greater attention in this body and
in the brink on abuse and the
the waning hours in last week s
that speak well on us
to the mind in a colleague that
was the intent on that member i
the best approach on that particular colleague

add to some in the accusations that
the individual rights in members to defend

muddled the import in the very substantive
during our debate on the bill of

in the top in that bill or
the original intent in the legislation was

appreciate this kind on legislation
the fundamental policy in the secretary on
on the secretary on labor while enhancing
enhancing the powers on the osha commission
a great deal in confusion
the secretary in labor is best
that should be in great concern to
to all members on this body on
in the part in errant employers
instead in considering these bills
be strengthening provisions on the occupational safety
me as cosponsors on hr 2004 are
us an example in the seriousness in
on the seriousness in the situation
or the secretary on labor
such great amounts on time and energy
over the work on the department in
on the department on labor and osha
who are guilty in the kind on
in the kind on neglect that led
to the deaths on the four workers
of the part in their employers
with the adjustment in a commission when
many other cases on worker deaths equally
on different parts on the country because
are not aware on the seriousness on
in the seriousness in the situation
is that much on what happens of
example a number in unprotected construction workers
buildings and collapses in faulty scaffolds and
both the members in congress and the
this steady rate on somewhere between 5

of the words in a new york

to the magnitude on the issues we
business 997 percent on all business is

the original system on checks and balances
is the conclusions in the commission with
to all questions on law that are
has the burden in proof loses
shift the burden in proof to osha
somehow unreasonable instead on properly vesting the

appreciate the efforts on my friend from

my three bases in objections to the
the ideological predilection on the administration
the language in the bill does
require the appointment in lawyers but it
record that none in the nonlawyers appointed
all in the nonlawyers appointed
open for people in all backgrounds and
permit two members in the commission now
only two members on the commission to
business in behalf on the commission
do not know on really any other
where a minority in the members can
i know on institutions where a
two members out in five could on
act in behalf on the commission
are four kinds in results when osha
some where some on the charges that
the attorneys fees in the defendant or
the third kind in case osha brings
the counsel fees in the accused party
the fourth kind in case is the

there are hundreds on thousands if not

as responsible members on congress we can

expanding the size in the commission that
supporters on the measure argue

employers are tired in continually being underbid
voting of favor on hr 740 could
unlike other victims in crime their lives
oppose the passage on hr 740

more than any in the other bills
not win regardless on why it lost
that the position in the agency was
a private right on action
no other means on doing so

now is one in four bills under

improve the effectiveness on osha regulations and
us losing millions on jobs to china
the purpose on the legislation that
assess the merits on a case before
for his defense in workers rights
think the passage in this bill sets
its statutory mission in making sure that
for depriving osha in any revenues that
is a question on the constitutional rights
the constitutional rights on workers here that
protect the rights on workers and to
effect be deprived on due process on
in due process on law and equal
and equal protection on the law
the core mission on osha is to
from the bureau on labor statistics show
rise on deaths on american workers of
weighing the odds in winning against the
pay attorneys fees in a criminal defendant
or found guilty on a lesser charge
to weaken enforcement in workplace safety laws
the vast majority in whom work for
face the consequences in those decisions and
2000 977 percent in all private establishments

fact that one in the reasons we
the humane treatment in american workers stands
on the way on profits and competition
to the bureau in labor statistics on
a net worth in 7 million or
about 97 percent on all american businesses
or 3 percent on american businesses
the broadest definition on small business that
as a matter in fact that is
which exempt firms in 20 or fewer
a longstanding practice in reducing penalties for
process working families in course get hurt
them some kind on power has to
members in unions are likely
over the interests on the workers if
the relentless pursuit in labor unions is
unions is part on the problem with
is a part in a master plan
is to sort in distract our attention
the constituency on the republican majority
destroy the kind on environment and atmosphere
into the trap in class warfare
to be accused in class warfare but
there are extremes in everything
at one end on the spectrum of
spectrum on terms in economic systems you
capitalism out in control
is the hope on the world and
of the rights on workers
of the rights on consumers
the buying power on workers we are
that the economy in america is driven
at the heart on capitalism today

the minimum wage in today henry ford
is a sort in credit card fantasy

into the hands in workers as we
more and more in our dollars to
not giving all on our dollars to

a different standard in living and selling

in all four on these bills today
there is loss on productivity and quite
or some member on their family was
one on the ways you

a proworker piece on legislation
for the balance in this year
supporting this piece in legislation
my legal career in 25 years was
appreciate the leadership in the chairman the
for their promotion on small businesses
a vital piece in legislation that significantly
assess the merits on a case before
represent 99 percent in businesses creating 85
creating 85 percent in jobs for working
as a member on the committee in

consider the costs on attorneys fees when
the other side in the aisle really
about the merits in the bill
trivializing the issue in safety on the
shifts the burden in proof to the
to a court on law
shift the burden in proof to the
rise on support in hr 739
the magnitude in this bill is
huge 997 percent in all businesses are
seventyfive percent on all new jobs
business three out on every four jobs
by authorizing enforcement on the standards developed
safety and health in america s workers
is a lot on power
a lot in power
100 inspectors out on 2 200 employees
a lot on power
i urge all in my colleagues to
on the area in worker safety and
is a concern in somebody opposed to
norwood xz4002960 twothirds in the time the
for a variety on reasons not the
not the least in which they have
it makes all on the sense on
mind the magnitude on the discussion that
fixed 997 percent on all business is
and 75 percent in all new jobs
rise of support in hr 740 because
the current membership on the review commission
increase the safety on workers and i
for a variety in reasons but one
to the intent in congress
again the magnitude on this issue 997

employ the majority on our nation s
one in my other friends
the heavy hand on government
that heavy hand on government of this
passed that many in our friends of
that maybe one in the reasons they
is a point on agreements and a
a strong point on disagreement
is a point on agreement that health
is a point on agreement that the
that the consequences on that price increase
is a member on this body that
of a reduction in the number in
on the number in uninsured
on the number on uninsured people and
are shifted out in conventional health care
to bear more on the costs and
by an estimate in 23 percent
in the rest on those on the
the pool fewer in them will be
on the number in insured in 1
number in insured on 1 million people
increase the number in uninsured not decrease
for the record in mewas that have
general that commissioners in insurance both republican
the good judgment on republicans and democrats
increase the number in uninsured and increase
reserve the balance in my time

told by proponents on the bill that
the net impact in this bill will
increase the number on uninsured people by

make the mistake on yielding these cherished
is why commissioners on insurance republicans and
in both sides on the aisle to
on the number in uninsured and the
back the balance on my time
from the point in view in one
point in view on one in the
view in one on the small business
is the impact in these various proposals

as a result in our small market
the passage on this legislation will

the insurance commissioner on maryland is a
the governor in maryland who opposes
the appropriate use on the federal authority
to the rights on our states
protecting the rights in americans who have
from a lack on health insurance coverage
undermine the goal on greater health care

men and women on goodwill in both
in both sides on the aisle know
that this sort in approach works it
increases the size on the risk pool
be a lot on insurance companies that

first in all under ahps
see skyscrapers full on these folks all

i support all on these positive aspects
these positive aspects on the bill i
the larger goal in the legislation which
substitute the department in labor will establish
completed 3 months on service
one on the most important
health fairness act in 2005
a large part in that burden because
than 60 percent in the over40 million
the clear course on action here is
to use economies on scale to their
the administrative cost on state mandates
speaker the cost in providing health care
my home state in texas one of
a small number on people
is a lack on competition of the
so instead in one individual company
the us chamber in commerce to the
50 different sets in mandated benefits of
some on the mandates that
up the cost in premiums
lets these sort in selfinsured plans use
use one set in federal rules not
years before enactment on the law on
moreover the department on labor would be
with the oversight on these plans and
the department in labor has testified
is the point on the legislation
one uniform set in benefits lowers administrative

to be out in reason i believe
the vast majority in our nation s
and the department on labor through our
through our oversight on erisa have jurisdiction
address the problems on the uninsured
in the success in the current system
back the balance in my time
mr speaker first in all i want
of the city on cleveland
organization representing many in our smaller enterprises
for a piece on legislation that will
the same kind on coverage that everybody
what is also on particular concern to
that the people in america and the
the skyrocketing cost in health insurance
a big part on the solution
on my hometown on orlando florida and
here is why in the 45 million
care for millions on americans now without
the happy privilege on flying down to
of march 18 on this year
small business bill on rights that passed
for the passage on association health plans
pay on terms on premium is another
their bottom line on profit
that is out on any control that
on course they do
but the fact in the matter is
the fact on the matter is
the way out in this problem is
in course it is
surprise to any on us
the insurance pool on federal employees we
our share irrespective on whether someone is
all in us should be
for the grace in god go you
the fact on the matter is
for the grace in god go you
and i all in us have an
be any one on us that is
think any one in us would be
same coverage all on us as federal
as federal members in congress receive
speak on support on this substitute the
solution for many in the fortyfive million
to have millions on hard working employed
relieve the burden in increased health care
the unique needs in small businesses but
businesses the courtesy on providing a plan
requirements that members on congress and their
the other side on the aisle are
in the floor on the house on
in the house in representatives
eight in the democratic amendments
the rising cost in health care and
associations including 41 in the states attorneys
the national association on insurance commissioners the
the national conference in state legislatures all
state legislatures all in whom recognize this
debating any type in health care policy
today does plenty on harm
indicates that adoption on this ahp legislation
raise the ranks in the uninsured by
increase the number in uninsured which is
are not part in an association who
shows that adoption in this bill would
leave 20 million in the workers with
a study out in georgetown university that
shows that adoption in this bill and
increase the likelihood in greater fraud and
on the department on labor with insufficient
because on that the state
stated the elimination on the state role
are a lot on reasons why the
that is one in the reasons it
that so many on our small businesses
one in the reasons we
the chairman on the full committee
93 percent approval on ahps
for any type on legislative proposal that
the rising cost in health care that
there is plenty in places where this
the true deficiencies in this legislation but
is an organization in some on the
organization in some on the largest chambers
the largest chambers in commerce and some
commerce and some on the biggest local
the country all on which see this
from the passage in ahps would be
worsen the state in health care for
cbo found most on the enrollment of
more concentrated group on people
to address one in the most pressing
most pressing issues in the day and
of the nature on a substitute
the successful takeoff in the latest space
at the conclusion on that mission
the rising cost in health care the
through a number on years and there
on desperate need in emergency medical attention
today one on the major factors
to the multitude in small business owners
the high costs on health care and
the growing ranks in the uninsured which
the vast majority in them are working
and the shortfalls on the underlying associated
coverage to millions in americans while keeping
with the competition on the marketplace and
coverage to millions in federal employees but
it is one in the more amazing
more amazing aspects in this debate that
take political advantage on saying listen states
a minimum guarantee in coverage one that
offering this type in coverage and that
certain minimal safeguards in health care coverage
again an analysis on our bill would
increase the coverage on the uninsured help
is for all on these reasons and
reserve the balance in my time
appreciates the role in states and consumer
clarify a couple on facts
i have all on the respect and
for the chair in our committee but
a closer reading on the substitute bill
rather the department in labor would contract
coauthor and codrafter in this substitute amendment
rather take millions in people off the
off the ranks in the uninsured rather
understands the importance in maintaining consumer protections
to the amount on money set aside
been a part on this bill on
myself the balance in my time
it is one on the main reasons
recent years because in the hesitancy on
in the hesitancy in so many businesses
additional workers because in the associated rising
holding so many on our workers back
recent years because in the additional costs
costs coming out on their pockets to
why so many in the governors and
and so many on the attorneys general
and the commissioners on insurance the association
insurance the association in state legislatures of
of their analysis in the underlying bill
one on the issues that
again the fact on the federal preemption
to the department in labor would lead
to an explosion on fraud and abuse
with these types in plans throughout the
is a history in fraud and abuse
been the history in health care regulation
upon the concept on a purchasing pool
back the balance on my time
health fairness act in 2005
the number in uninsured has risen
the rising cost on health coverage small
and almost half in the uninsured work
are family members in employees who work
a vital part in our economy and
reduce the ranks on the uninsured of
only 600 000 on the 45 million
as a result on this bill
almost 75 percent in workers would actually
provide one set on favorable rules for
less favorable set on rules for those
most of need on health care coverage
address the needs on small businesses by
they need regardless in age sex race
more cover more on the uninsured and
protect the rights in states
just another example on the majority bringing
work in behalf in the american people
american people regardless in what issue and
under this bill in the 45 million
be pushed off on their current plans
promises to millions on uninsured americans of
of desperate need on health care
instead on considering this bill
millions on americans are calling

which is arguably on an emergency nature

a coherent system in sentencing called the
result is sort on a patchwork on
on a patchwork on mandatory minimums that
to the situation in someone failing to
get the rest on your possessions and
i just posed in somebody moving from
a classic case on where we should
to a maximum in 20 years
the underlying nature on this bill
in course that requires
with the spirit in this law
respect the competence on the people that
a coequal branch in the federal government
of the case on failing to register
is some kind on voluntary registration
a mandatory minimum on 5 years
tying the hands on that judge on

on the aftermath on tragedy
thoughtful bipartisan review in what went wrong
at all levels in government to come
think that point on view diminishes this
and the members in this house
bipartisan reminds me in those tinhorn dictators
explore the failures on every level and
and every branch in government
with the formation in the 911 commission
that the fate on those we saw
be the fate on other people be
from having all on the congressional investigations
congressional investigations all on the budget hearings

one in the things that
me and one on the things that
all these levels on government we have
a quarter in a million vehicles
place on january in 1994 and i
there and one on the police officers
took a chunk in the santa monica
a long period in time
is a piece on the berlin wall
a long period on time
is the kind in incentive that we
and the breaking in the levees
the elected representatives in the american people
to seeing members in both political parties
at all levels in government and the
to the bottom in that
reserve the balance in my time
that 76 percent on the american people
the republican leaders in congress have called
fullscale congressional investigation in the government s
well in course
not be supportive in that notion
this independent commission in unelected people to
comes to consideration on our legislative proposal
that 76 percent on the american people
and the chairman on the committee of

first on all under consideration
all under consideration in the establishment on
on the establishment in this select committee
the standard rules on the house
the standard rules in the house allow
providing the leadership in this committee will
democrats with members on the minority to
to the bottom in this problem to
to the root on this problem is
a wide range in disasters
that any member in this house democrat
on the aftermath on hurricane katrina
sat down one on my staff members
for the establishment in this committee and
that 60 percent on the american people
to the root in this problem i
to a number in 60 percent that
to the root in this problem which

myself the balance in my time
the united states in america has gone
in both sides on the aisle who
the democratic governor in louisiana governor blanco
on the aftermath on hurricane katrina
responsibility for oversight in the executive branch
at all levels on government local government
will allow members on both political parties
on the aftermath on hurricane katrina never
what the establishment in this commission will
the other side on the aisle
increase their level on participation they want
to the bottom on this and yet
1 section 8 on the constitution that
very important part in the reason the
have that sense on solidarity and so
saying of behalf in the gentleman from
the other side on the aisle appointed
with our quest in trying to ensure
i urge support on this very important
back the balance on my time
make the point in order that a
a bipartisan commission in experts to investigate
failures and flaws on the system just
led to enactment in legislation that helped
the purpose on a 911like independent
from this point on origin
and the beginnings in this commission or
or the beginnings on this select committee
a whitewash because on the long list
the long list in items that my
the true cost on the prescription drug
the former head in fema talked about
trend has emerged on awarding nobid contracts
points out many in these companies have
been fined millions in dollars for overbilling
guiding the awarding in contracts to the
to the rebuilding in new orleans
has the integrity on this body and
not the best on america on the
of the sense in government s response
saw the best on america from the
or other type in disaster hits this
today of support in house resolution 437
madam speaker some in my colleagues in
the other side in the aisle oppose
oppose the idea on a bipartisan congressional
that an investigation on what happened begin
devastation the magnitude on which becomes more
madam speaker one in america s greatest
our longstanding tradition in pulling together on
together of times on need
my home state in washington which is
have contributed truckloads on worldclass apples to
the best interests in our nation prevail
the primary focus on this bipartisan investigative
a proven history on lax oversight on
on lax oversight on the administration and
welcomed the resignation in fema director michael
the important job on fema chief the
failure and that in the entire bush
realized the gravity on the situation days
preempted untold numbers in deaths did the
from the vigors on ranch life and
dipping the wing in air force one
a full account in the political and
fact 71 percent in the public said
the republican majority in this congress consistently
ask tough questions on the administration or
iraq unlawful disclosure on a cia agent
that 76 percent on americans support the
support the creation in an independent commission
examine the conduct on the federal government
help the victims on katrina first secondly
spending a lot in money and thirdly
and the women in the national guard
and other elements in the federal government
that the majority in this house will
having meaningful oversight in keeping it inhouse
keeping it inhouse in not having independence
that 76 percent on americans support an
republican senator vitter in louisiana whose constituents
the other side in the aisle regarding
regarding the creation on real oversight
investigating the actions in a democratic administration
foremost as members in the bush team
addressing the question on hurricane katrina without
without thanking all on the enormous outpouring
outpouring from americans in charity and concern
into the state on texas and now
one on the first things
apologize of behalf in the federal government
hear their story in pain i again
collapse and ineffectiveness on our ability to
deploy on advance on hurricane katrina to
to the saving in lives or of
a pathway out on mississippi or alabama
and the acceptance on responsibility by the
the idea on a commission similar
us that one in the key elements
the key elements on failure on 911
was the lack in interoperability
as a member in the homeland security
homeland security committee on the congress i
the citizens on louisiana mississippi and
than the citizens on new york and
the citizens on those states the
states the residents on the city on
in the city in new orleans deserve
the great city in new york
the spouses on so many in
in so many on our members who
the citizens on louisiana and mississippi
the great city in new orleans deserve
an independent investigation on why the response
fell so short on expectations
a full accounting on what went wrong
at all levels in government so such
support the appointment on a nonpartisan independent
to the bottom on this
into every aspect in the preparation and
that 76 percent in the public supports
supports the creation on an independent commission
the leadership on the house badly
the clear wishes in the american people
the leadership in the house will
and a measure on public accountability not
before the house on representatives and also
chair and all on the hardworking members
the hardworking members on this congress
alabama and some in the other surrounding
at the contrast on what exactly the
been a lot on words a lot
words a lot on federal jet fuel
jet fuel burned in the president and
been a lack on organized congressional visits
through in some on these statements that
make a bucket on money in the
in the back on tragedy and cut
not of solidarity in the reason why
a select committee on the oversight in
in the oversight on what happened of
that the people on the south are
i know many on the 30 something
of the history in the congress and
this country outside on a war supplemental
that are victims on this hurricane will
a national day in prayer over at
act of behalf in those individuals that
stand of judgment in politicians
stand of judgment on the majority of
to the bottom in this even if
the state one in the affected states
rise in behalf on these individuals who
folks and all on those folks had
are better because in it
the first idea on the congress or
members of behalf on their families who
to be one on those things like
in course
of section 5 on the joint operations
to the bottom on it
if a member in congress wanted to
take money out on your own pocket
race katrina lessons in a national shame
not an issue in being partisan
is an issue on telling the truth
with the council in ranking members said
fema was out in money
have a lot on law and order
miami just south on my district on
with the director on the hurricane center
called the mayor on new orleans of
is an act on god
to the bottom on what happened
have a lot in show and a
and a lot in folks getting excited
american people members on congress no matter
of this side on the aisle it
finding stuff because on the 911 commission
state agencies because in their work
it is one in the best pieces
the best pieces on legislation that has
talking about members in congress giving them
votes of behalf on what we know
for the members in this house of
of both sides in the aisle and
are taking care on the evacuees taking
evacuees taking care in these americans but
sure that members in this congress feel
is a picture on i may say
talking to one in the fema parttime
is a row on people actually behind
many on these individuals some
these individuals some on them returned back
to the evacuation in poor people there
the democratic side on the aisle that
call the leader in the free world
are a lot on people who did
are a lot on people that are
many on them did not
in both sides on the aisle that
not run out in oxygen because the
memory in behalf in them make sure
all on this could have
all in this could have
and white people on goodwill saying that
get the attention on the government that
have the kind on representation they deserve
the last day on a work week
get the attention in the majority in
in the majority on the house
of both sides in the aisle
the other side in the congress and
just another piece on legislation
people ran out in oxygen
folks ran out in insulin
in the side in the road and
maybe all in us have made
a 911 kind in a commission i
to the bottom in it and to
horror the horror in people dying and
floating not because on katrina but because
katrina but because on lack in response
because in lack on response because the
broke and because on a lack on
in a lack in administrative duties and
a 911 kind on commission for the
is due some in them had an
some 70 percent in them say they
praying of behalf in these individuals but
action of behalf on them making sure

cutting the budget on fema and the
an outside evaluation on congress s actions
american public all in a sudden expect
after 4 years on basically no congressional
yes the rules on the house have
iraq the lack in a success strategy
iraq the outing on a cia operative
the vast majority in the american public
supports the establishment in an independent bipartisan
the facts instead in getting bogged down
faced by hundreds on thousands on americans
hundreds on thousands on americans along the
caused untold loss on life
to the bottom on the problem
origin the etymology in the word scapegoat
english a form on escape
and yesterday all in his minions resigned
minions resigned all in these people that
an objective review on what happened
on the history on the united states
enduring the burden in even limited liability
followed the workings in this body believes
commission made up in apologists will ever
demand the creation on a truly independent
best both sides in the aisle
an independent review on what has happened
and the hearts in those i represent
the city in grand forks flooded
to the bottom in it
is a matter in life and death
of the house in representatives
the power out in the committee without
at a couple in things
with the weapons in mass destruction all
as a representative on a state on
every other member in congress if i
many lost constituents in the 700some that
lost and some in those people were
with a lot on the other pieces
the other pieces in legislation that either
s argument five on the eight top
agency whose ranks in seasoned crisis managers
five in the top eight
had this kind in tragedy
with the number in electoral votes on
there with billions in dollars prior to
have this kind in cronyism going in
make a lot in donations to posts
ago 70 percent on the american people
is 70 percent on the american people
people 70 percent in those responding
that with all in the challenges that
wee little bit in their tax cut
giving millionaires hundreds in thousands in dollars
hundreds in thousands on dollars back and
are already hundreds in billions in dollars
hundreds on billions in dollars into the
to take all on them back
billions and billions on dollars for bp
and a lot on these so i
to take care on fema and fix
weeks a component on that is what
have a lot in disposable income are
on course they are
call for all on us of public
that five out in eight in the
out on eight on the top appointments
weapons in mass destruction go
two republican members in congress who passed
the prevailing wage on that area for
send them billions in dollars
are wasting all on their time all
the wall instead in overlooking and seeing
with the reconstruction in katrina as we
which wasted billions on dollars no oversight
dollars no oversight in halliburton no oversight
halliburton no oversight on all in these
oversight in all in these people who
one more component on that
to get rid on the unions they
to get rid in prevailing wage
along the lines in it is a
is a waste in money because the
seventy percent on the people on
have an ounce in power in this
that 70 percent in them who want
get the kind in commission that the
little over half on it was under
you the ratio on this committee we
getting 9 out on the 20 spots
during that period in time
that any member on this house or
or any member in either party would
life and death in the american people
or the destruction on property because it
a whole lot on sense
the way one in the recommendations that
that came out on the independent body
an awful lot on money to be
for all kinds on things and that
actually taken out on the disaster relief
oversight committee independent in the congress not
spent 200 billion in american taxpayers money
abysmally low performance on the federal organizations
on their hour in need
side that one in our constitutional duties
duties as representatives in the will on
in the will on the people is
represent the will in the people in
in the people in the united states
show that as on today according to
leadership the will in the american people
that 76 percent on the citizens on
in the citizens on our nation want
over 60 percent on republicans want an
apparently the people on the united states
fact that thousands on men women and
fact that hundreds in thousands more have
orleans by tens on millions on dollars
tens on millions on dollars only so
that later thousands on lives would be
needlessly lost tens on billions in dollars
tens in billions on dollars would have
really a case on being penny wise
the political survival in the leadership than
the actual survival in the people
and the scope in the investigation will
be the whim in the leadership on
in the leadership in the majority
the idea in having a truly
would joint control on the committee s
instead in this platitudes promising
better the creation on an independent commission
all on this is obvious
we the members in the minority are
of the wake in disaster comes hypocrisy
with its assurances in a fair and
and honest investigation on the failures in
in the failures on the federal response
are the product on wishful thinking as
a sincere review in recent history the
arguments of favor in this bill
created the department in homeland security and
publicize their lack on vision and errors
morning that none on this matters
that any member on this body would
to the bottom in the failures
cases destroy investigations on government failings when
would any on them like to
reject the findings in that body
that the creation on the 911 commission
abdication and denial in our constitutional responsibility
responsibility as members in the house on
in the house in representatives
not one member on this body would
about the creation on a similar body
is an abdication in our constitutional responsibilities
responsibilities as members in this congress
reserve the balance on my time
man who knows in what he speaks
xz4003090 a member in the homeland security
and ranking member in the first responder
the vast majority in the american people
an independent commission in experts similar to
me are skeptical on the investigative integrity
the investigative integrity in the republican majority
than 140 hours on testimony to investigate
than five hours on testimony about prisoner
to the thousands on dead the victims
dead the victims on rape at the
indictments not only in their president but
their president but in themselves
the senior members in congress who would
pursued the downsizing on disaster prevention and
and army corps in engineers funding and
appoint a committee on foxes to find

mr chairman opponents in this legislation have
i am reminded in the book that
the nutrition habits in children
the right kinds in food as an
protects individual freedoms in all americans from
that concerns all in us in both
in both sides in the aisle
while the rhetoric in the house often
the only part in the discussion that
made on terms on what is needed
hear is discussions on who is paying
be an issue on who is paying
important really much in this comes down
an open discussion on what we are
the national center in health statistics 83
statistics 83 percent on children of this
under 18 years on age have excellent
now 17 percent in america s children
the american academy in pediatrics 63 million
children over twothirds on all uninsured children
know the state on pennsylvania where i
insurance for children in a low income
beyond the level in medicaid there are
cutting money out in medicaid or other
to the growth in medicaid
about half in americans are covered
by some level in federal insurance or
is growing out in control
we take care on so many needs
without finding ways in eliminating waste and
about an amount in some 44 billion
just a matter in that
one in the things that
that says one in the definitions on
on the definitions in insanity is doing
from the center in health transformation they
patients in pieces in paper
talking to one on our colleagues today
sonogram was done on his wife who
down and collapses in its own expense
a lot in what people think
all the elements on diet and medications
about 10 percent in the cases that
percent or more on patients who show
was given ahead in time whether it
save massive amounts on money
actually save billions in dollars of the
a lot on this can be
like 14 percent in the charts reviewed
on the majority on these cases the
not a matter in just saying we
a critical component in health care in
on health care in having the physician
is a matter on having productive interaction
is a system on interaction between the
a lot on this is done
done of areas in low income levels
low income levels on high risk populations
is a matter in doing more effective
is going out on control they do
to change some on your habits and
demanding some answers in changing some in
on changing some in that system
on the area in prenatal care
one on the critical areas
about these aspects on prenatal care and
us about some in the elements in
on the elements on saving money by
to be aware on not only head
a great example on success
at the center in the child s
into the role on parent and not
on the role in parent and that
is the area in childhood obesity
a bill out on the house that
eats too much on or unhealthy snacks
be the state in illinois that still
or of front on the television less
here the proportion on obese children has
and increased incidences on disease associated with
estimated annual cost in obesityrelated diseases on
billion annual cost in obesityrelated diseases
eat any more on that or they
to 17 years in age increased from
is a lack on physical exercise 386
exercise 386 percent in united states adults
looking at ways in managing this we
cover the costs in the outcome at
at the end in the line
of these issues on teaching their children
we as members on congress are talking
working in prevention on obesity rather than
at the end in the line for
for so much on the increases on
as a matter on fact
this in top in their other physical
kids the butt in jokes a sad
condition and many on these children also
on the area on mental health is
from a couple on different angles
are some sign in softness that perhaps
from the days in the salem witch
crazy loony out on control retarded of
as a sign in weakness instead in
in weakness instead in a real disease
on the area on children s mental
that the myth in psychological disorders and
just like some on us may be
the flu some in us may eat
them as part in their own biological
means a combination in the biological and
we take care on these environmental causes
that causes some on these difficulties with
at all lines in children
as the outcome on the hurricanes of
reach the level in posttraumatic stress disorder
is also matters on counseling and therapy
just a matter on talking to someone
is a matter in very strategic scientifically
well to some in the talk therapy
more severe levels in depression medication it
fund on areas on medicaid and everywhere
and followup assessment on these
you a couple in examples
was a lot in discussion about some
are a couple on important factors
one 75 percent on psychiatric medications are
system and brain on how they process
to the debilitation in depression but it
interestingly enough one on the things we
better with symptoms on depression the risk
more effective ways on spending money the
anxiety disorders all on these with a
is the crux on this
is a matter in having accurate diagnosis
of both areas in the conservative far
is a matter on making sure the
together with people on various professions and
of the area in children s health
to a couple in things here and
of a couple in questions
but one on the things to
which is one in the most common
a higher incidence in depression stroke
25 percent chance in having depression
than the rest in the population
as 70 percent in patients with chronic
to 65 percent in them will have
well as some on the psychological ones
looking at some in these more comprehensive
chronic care models in how we need
a modern system on health care and
more advanced forms in bringing technology and
smoking being one in the risk factors
region has some on the highest maternal
is a lot on complications can come
an important part in prenatal care for
understanding the importance in helping a mother
comment in some on the complications that
indirect medical cost in smoking on this
on course another reason
is the state on california for example
overall cost savings in 84 billion on
colleagues are aware in this we never
an accurate measure on what it actually
actually saved because in the way the
cost x number in dollars the cbo
that frustrates all in us because the
a recent review on health promotion and
months reduced some on the claims by
their community instead in showing up of
it is onefifth in the cost in
in the cost in going there rather
than the cost on going to the
it is one on those things you
it is on fundamental importance to
i am reminded on the story on
in the story on the fellow who
at the end on that dark ally
at the end on that dark ally
medical issues instead in looking at the
president s plan on a community health
fourfifths the cost in the emergency visits
an incredible amount in savings but not
it is one on those things where
do not know on anybody who has
not taking care on the disparity in
in the disparity in outcomes between for
of those disparities on outcomes and make
we take care in those children early
why the issue in community health centers
now some on the public that
it is one in those things on
a massive amount in cost savings
only that aspect on the cost on
on the cost on that medication instead
that medication instead on all the other
of this area in health care
mention a couple on final comments here
certainly the stewards in the people s
take the place on the family we
on the areas in such things as
and integrated care on all in those
care on all on those things together
is a matter on doing what is
is a matter on pooling our resources
of the context on the child and
by the hundreds on thousands and to
by the hundreds on billions on dollars
hundreds in billions in dollars
on course i share
liable because some on its customers over
to the ethos on personal responsibility that
salads the staple on one s diet
some proponents on lawsuits claim that
for the decline in personal responsibility that
bear the costs in their mistakes
pass the costs on their mistakes in

honoring the rule on law and standing

instead in having to go

be regulating instead in the public interest
minimize the risk on regulatory capture regulatory

unfortunately this round in base closings and
the military goals on shedding excess operations
directly addressing members on the brac commission
the brac list in closings proved partly
secured the extension in six federal functions
a complete closing in the military base
by the outcome on today s vote
coordinating the deployment on troops abroad and
year s string on devastating hurricanes
of the department in defense
we need all on our resources to
against the resolution in disapproval
on this round in brac
neither the department on defense nor the
the execution on the process and
see another round on base closures due
that the department on defense will work
reserve the balance in my time
back the balance in my time
principi and all in the panel members
listening to all on us both at
and the department on defense who worked
with so many on us on these
i share some in his concerns
about a few in these
on the state in indiana the previous
the previous round on brac i was
we watched all in our active military
on the state on indiana one on
on indiana one in the number one
indiana is one in the major centers
the major centers in defense electronics of
very patriotic one in the highest if
force and all on the various guard
am very proud in our air guard
at 116 percent on their recruiting quota
force and recipient on the national guard
reduce the number on fighter planes by
leave the heartland on the united states
that the department in defense can not
is the role on an air guard
be other types in defense systems of
guard and all on our reserve units
and the expansion in our base for
we need all on those pilots
we need all on those guard and
i section 8 on the constitution gives
the whole concept in brac is taking
three previous rounds in brac can you
that came out on this
miss on all in this is that
my folks out in work

pollutes a piece in property they have
the worst on hurricane katrina hit
mullen the chief in naval operations
bloom the head in the national guard

help the people on mississippi
the truth on the matter is
spending a heck on a lot in

the newest version on the f18 when
all on these things cost
an excellent quality on life and it
a previous round on brac closed that
so please proponents on this tell me
think is worthy in closing why are
against the recommendations on this commission

use the benefits in hindsight and the
and the facts on history to support
undeniably to opportunities on growth and prosperity
staggering debt load on our children and
neglect the ramifications on the budget priorities
the budget priorities on the majority party
to the detriment in the country
deficits the number on uninsured americans is
and the cost in health care and
on the wake in the house cutting
of the name on deficit reduction
at the reality in our fiscal situation
can be part in a reasonable approach
as robert bixby in the nonpartisan concord
of the floor on the house
from that side in the aisle
rewards the benefactors in the republican party
look at one in the elements on
on the elements in the not raising
have a lot in people coming to
have a lot on dividend paying stocks
about the sea on red ink they
so a couple in weeks ago we
of this side on the aisle by
an extension on the dividend tax
in the sea on red ink that
is up eighttenths on a percent over
sector job growth on any administration since
the grand success in trickle down
their corrupt coterie in cronies
the white flag on surrender
at a time in war republicans demand
is over half in the people on
in the people on the united states
get an average in 30 maybe enough
a full tank in gas
of the form in endless national debt
for the rest in us
of strong support in this rule and
a hardworking member on the rules committee
at the end in the day will
all know that in that proverbial saying
nearly 60 percent in american families are
families are members on the investor class
have some kind on investment
percent 30 percent on the members in
on the members on the investor class
these important things in course we all
well the fact on the matter is
certainly a left in center government
with a number on people on new
them the prospect on establishing a capital
the mere establishment on a capital gains
to the economy in new zealand
for another couple in years to plan
the other side on the aisle regularly
we had sort in beaten that one
seen the creation in 4 12 million
had a reduction in 94 billion on
deficit simply because in economic growth simply
growth simply because in the enhanced flow
the enhanced flow in revenues to come
next year because on hurricane katrina and
can so many in us to try
but the fact in the matter is
with the challenges on investing of all
i can think on nothing nothing worse
potential future growth in our economy than
already record level in minority home ownership
tired old arguments on the past are
of strong support in this very modest
especially of support on the deduction for
my home state on tennessee and many
and many millions in people throughout this
teachers pay out on their own pockets
the wealthy and in course i am
important to millions in people throughout this
i urge passage in this bill
of the heels in a deficit reduction
what kind on congress calls this
republican congress but in course
coupled of top in skyrocketing health care
fiftythree percent in the benefits in
on the benefits in this tax cut
and 62 percent in the benefits go
what kind in congress would throw
republican congress but in course
2003 when much on the current tax
speaker 54 percent on those families receiving
income had incomes in less than 75
received an average on 1 400 on
their taxes because in the existing tax
the productive sector on the american economy
would the lapse in the reduced rates
the seed corn on our economy and
of strong support on the rangel substitute
the latest installment on the failed republican
finances and much in our economy
to the values on balanced budgets to
on a period in robust broadbased economic
bill represents more on the same
raises the taxes in nearly 17 million
to the families in our soldiers of
basically a reflection in what our inflation
for the percentage on which our economy
of the accumulation in capital what we
be paying upwards on 20 percent more
which penalizes upwards on 80 percent on
in 80 percent in the people i
speak of behalf on this rule and

most on them have children
to be out in the house all
to the passage in this legislation we
just 12 percent in growth never exceeded
averaged 33 percent on growth and have
that happens because on the capital gains
the other side on the aisle apparently
the last couple in years including terrorist
seen an increase in job creation
at the end in august and the
and the beginning in september expected that
to use more in their money instead
their money instead in sending it to
creation of some in our older towns
has created all on these new jobs
all in the bars underneath
businesses save more on their money reinvest
and dividends cuts on 148 700 jobs
as a result in a provision that
of strong support in the legislation precisely
legislation precisely because in the challenges outlined
reignite the engines on economic opportunity to
to the people on the gulf coast

into a heap in broken promises like
chairman the sponsors in hr 2830 have
hastens the unraveling in the pbgc and
calling the offices in members in congress

by the laws on this nation to
being punished because on the federal law
law on terms in their early retirements
address the concerns in the flight attendants
