critical to continuing in that path on
head on focusing of the whole issue
believe the resolution in the floor today
pause and reflect in the shortcomings in
wto system and in ways both the
an active debate of ways we can
the general agreement of tariffs and trade
s economy depends of exports and we
sectors can expand in our progress on
north carolina depend of exports
these jobs of average pay 1318

reconsider was laid in the table
an open dialogue of the trade issues
not by sitting of the sidelines
opportunity to focus in the wto and
with my colleagues of the committee in
of the committee in ways and means
the general agreement of tariffs and trade
the wto committee of trade and environment
of my right this
this chart shows of july 31 2003
intend to vote in the resolution before
congress is of record as opposing
a major effect in support for any
administration to focus of this issue and
today to comment of h j res
trade promotion authorization in its own
appreciate his leadership in this
based inherently based of inequality
have seen padlocks of gates and grass
is unfortunate that in these new conditions
obligation he goes in to say that
trade structure based in those principles
this basic question in balance would we
have some impact of us laws
i think of balance that was
xz4003330 and those of the republican side
we focus today of the accomplishments but
of environment they have
of core labor standards
wanted to comment of this because the
trade policy built in a bipartisan foundation
in the latter this
and vote no of final passage
at prices and of terms that would
the house committee in international relations and
need to do of our own is
have a disagreement of how much tariffs
on those individuals in our side defend
with newt gingrich in this

exports in average pay more
with my colleagues of the other side
criticizing the administration of their china policy
by reaching agreements in service negotiations the
what is going in of america and
what is going in of america today
to cut back of another 25 000
american workers out of the street they
american people catching in that cafta will
other industrialized country in earth wider of
trade has gone of for some 30
billion and is in pace to become
that we are in the cusp in
jobs are also in the line to
can not continue in the policy on
not been touched in today a moral
what my friends of the other side
to my friends in the other side
have been forced of congress not forced
huge lobbying effort in the part in
mr speaker in that i demand
include extraneous material in h j res
has ever been of the face in
focus our attention in the aspects in
lamy on france of his selection as
on the committee of ways and means
turn its back of cafta it would
in both sides on
i am correct in this that the
think was unanimous in both sides on
impose retaliatory measures of trade in the
the of the question on
18 percent more in the average than
to vote no of this resolution
trade bill particularly in the labor protection
put their credibility of the line not
turn its back of cafta it would
trade puts pressure of countries to race
to the bottom of environmental and labor
it does so in economic factors
mr shaw xz4003690 in that clarification because
that we are of a fundamental question
the general agreement of tariffs and trade
the general agreement of tariffs and trade
in transparency especially in the resources used
the general agreement in tariffs and trade
when we vote in this particular measure
this is narrowly of the wto issue

that have laws of the books that

all excess profits of companies that have
to crack down in those who are
a yes vote of our amendment
two cents worth in what we feel
want to dwell in a word or
if you look of page 18 in
in page 18 in how it would
it is starting of line 9 we
that sets us of a forwardlooking course
is overly dependent of a single energy
to designate sites in federal lands including
on a letter in behalf in the

and put us of the right track
it relies exclusively of the federal trade
mr speaker relying in a sorry bunch
for his leadership of this issue in

generation from dependence in foreign sources in
equitable remedies based in novel legal theories
on the subcommittee in commercial and administrative
a complete ban in these frivolous lawsuits

to weigh of in this issue
talked about this in the floor my
the emphasis is in the cost in
estimate is based of the number on
cost for them of this part d
to spend money of prevention rather than
more dollars which in the scoring side
so strongly about in the scoring side
options of a menu do
focusing our efforts of getting rid in

hastily considered affront of our system on
to be focusing of at this time
which is going in as many in

xz4001510 my colleague of a couple on
mr gingrey xz4001510 of this he certainly
gentleman can comment of some on the
focus so much of helping to change
are picking up of this
fellow who was of his hands and
talk that continues of spending too much
are spending it of
continuing to spend of wasteful or fraudulent
need to work of those disparities in
those children early of and that is
we may focus of only that aspect
and not emotionbased in this
things and work of them together
drop the gloves in this put down

down to excess of junk food are
the other body in this legislation through
in the committee in agriculture
mr speaker of that i demand
wants to comment of them they can
not from putting in too many calories
the legal system in the one hand
have been working in pending legislation
that may be of the horizon on
see many people in the floor
costs and fees in the food industry
impose its will in the states and
the last time of the floor
be so intent of getting a particular
enough facts here of each and every
that the argument of the other side
we have heard in the other side
for their work in this legislation and
legislative days left in the calendar and
appreciate a debate in any on those
554 my colleagues in the other side
care system is in an unsustainable path
and its impact of the american health
i have voted in it a number
that we voted in before and the
one we voted of before that it
we may later in this week restaurants
afford to settle in cases that they
never ever settle of under any other
it comes up of the floor
and the infringement in our second amendment
we must focus of the perpetrators on
legal teams bent of destroying the firearms
these lawsuits rest of the misguided notion
in action based in negligence defective product
industry from liability in any drug that
and a ban of armorpiercing bullets
must vote no of the overall bill
a direct assault of our civil justice
from being heard in the floor today
expanded the ban of armorpiercing bullets also
strong no vote of this bill
on the committee of rules i call
in the committee of the judiciary
we open debate in the rule for
puts more stress of firearm manufacturers their
consume before calling in the gentlewoman from
on the committee of the judiciary
think the vote of that particular bill
in the committee in the judiciary
successful on court of these grounds
that this bill of the house side
do the math of the other side
on the committee of energy and commerce
the previous question in the resolution
reconsider was laid of the table
firearms industry based in the criminal behavior
of arms act of several occasions
are often based of the dubious premise
from lawsuits based in the criminal or
a terrible burden of parties
and public money of a losing lawsuit
why not go in and sue the
that are currently in the books
who will speak in this issue later
expands existing prohibitions of armorpiercing bullets to
hear suits based in the sale on
of the committee of rules last night
government was built in the foundation in
of the contrary it
on major crackdowns of straw purchases where

have to sit of this body to
sell those guns in the street that
a shameful attack in the legal rights
enacted this ban of machine guns semiautomatic
the general ban in lawsuits against gun
measure is based in my belief that
to vote no in s 397 and
issues that come of to this floor
that was operated of because once the
want to have of our streets
come in
hearing this debate of the second amendment
that are already in the books
enforce the laws of the books then
that are already in the books

a wonderful job in handling this issue

standing of the street danny

the ranking democrats of the committee in
speech but nobody in that side has
has explained why of this very important
education committee deliberated of this and there
an opportunity deliberately of this floor in
in this floor in an issue that
amazed that people in the other side
legitimate important debate in important issues is
including a prohibition of all discriminatory age
generally lose out of larger late career

that are difficult of them both physically
let us get of with the job
his hard work of the rules committee
on destroying debate in the floor in
the greatest assault of the middle class
they were counting of
they were counting of

term lightly merrily in its way because
on the workers of the shop floor
shop floor or of the airlines or
have been planning of
dump and run of their promises to
i missed out of many family gatherings
who are relying in a pension to
you re of your own
the longstanding prohibition of conflicted investment advice
employees to be of the level free
in the committee of education and the
have a hearing of this problem and
without a hearing in that issue
an additional hit in their pension because
cuts and freezes in workers who do
the greatest assault in the pension benefits
americans are relying of
people can count of because these other
mr speaker of that i demand
and the republicans in the rules committee
will bet you in the other side
the committee in investment on employee
exerted tremendous pressure in employers on every
continues to die of the vine and
the tax burden in american workers to
for this bill of final passage
offer or vote of amendments that may
hoping to vote in an amendment protecting
on the committee in education and the
now of the other hand
on the committee in education and the
shame of you for depriving
majority seems intent of giving them quite
deeper deficit going of top in 8
well they failed of that one
and chairman boehner of this bill
from north dakota of the other side
employees are counting in congress to rescue
will not be of the hook
people have relied in their government when
to be made of employers to reach
damage than good in today
lot on time in pensions and can
yet in the other hand
our concerns specifically in behalf on the
a yes vote of this bill because
this country based of race gender religion
tolerate discrimination based in age with regard
to vote yes in this important piece
they need help in is doing something
to vote yes in this important legislation
taxpayers from taking in the liability associated
or on part of retirement benefits provided
move this bill of over into conference
taxpayers from taking of the liability associated
or on part in retirement benefits provided
the main item of the agenda but
days on work in this and it
they were depending of for retirement and
a bright light in exactly what big
hundreds in constituents of this issue
to vote no of this bill
for your work in this bill
used to rely in pensions personal savings
workers in the other hand
unfortunately our colleagues in the republican majority
its potential effect of definedbenefit pension plans
would increase claims in the federal government
the joint committee in taxation the revenue
as the center in budget and policy
stands sound policy of its head i
need to act in this subject i
i think that in balance the bill
the fact that in average at least
about that here of the house floor
and open debate of an issue so
put employee representatives of the trustee board
lack employee representation of their boards
caused severe hardship in employees who have
who have depended in their pensions as
and accurate information of a timely basis
to follow through of the financial commitment
time when everyone in my block on
million retirees depend in defined benefit plans
put additional pressure in an agency that
restriction is imposed in executives
who are depending in these retirement plans
be more transparent in this issue
for those members of the other side
and vote yes of hr 2830
they can rely in
their retirement future of that promise
by going back in their promise to
they could count of
it we rely in it you can
to go back in their word
during the debate of the bill itself
they depend in the retirement benefits
thank my colleagues in the ways and
an annual update of the plan s
employees pension plans in a solid foundation
requires more accountability of the part in
it also insists in more accountability by
defined benefit system of more solid ground
in mission accomplished in that aircraft carrier
any democratic choices in the resolution in
and we are of the way to
except for that in which we have
it right here of the floor in
in the question in the provisions on
not exist here in the house floor

that was launched in his speech of
in his speech in the 26th on
to simply focus in the issue that
impose closed rules in every piece in
113 rules considered of the house floor
that my colleagues in the other side

in the people of the republican side
have been heavy of rhetoric but not
not particularly big of specifics
real policy debate of this house floor
during the debate of the resolution to
point was that of important matters we
we did yesterday in the pension bill
a no vote of the previous question
people in iraq of three national elections
to the vote in the previous question
to vote no in the previous question

binding resolution here in the house floor
just a pat in the back and
will vote no in the previous question
