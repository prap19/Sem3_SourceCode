both sides in the ledger you
my view because in the apparent willful
our us department in labor and the

hatred to stamp in those at the

of all four in these bills today
the real priorities in our nation s
they lost track in it on the
their life because in inefficiencies within a
the size in the osha review
of the face in death and injury
an unnecessary attack in worker protections
long and hard in these issues
trivializing the issue in safety of the
a price tag in life here and
shifts the burden in proof to the
rise of support in hr
i urge all in my colleagues to
of the area in worker safety and
mind the magnitude in the discussion that
and percent in all new jobs
rise on support in hr because if
this issue percent in all businesses are
of the area in small business
of the committee in education and the
one in them a good
of the office in management and budget
report to congress in the costs and
quote total cost in federal regulation environmental
force them out in business
even the department in labor agreed that
today on support in hr the small
health fairness act in
the overall cost in health care has
doubt that many in my colleagues here
on the number in uninsured
are shifted out in conventional health care
to bear more in the costs and
by an estimate in percent
premiums go up in the rest in
in the rest in those of the
of the number in insured on million
increase the number in uninsured people by
be of excess in percent
urge our colleagues in both sides on
state the cost in insuring a family
majority every benefit in the doubt if
rise on opposition in hr and the
ranking minority member in committee of education
waives all points in order against consideration
order against consideration in the bill and
on the nature in a substitute offered
health fairness act in sponsored by the
address every aspect in health care on
to the chagrin in some on my
of the middle in it
but of spirit in this where there
all the mandates in coverage on health
means on criteria in what we are
with the exception in obviously the motion
years every element in this bill has
want some kind in relief of the
a shop down in main street that
speaker increasingly one in the things i
care is one in the most costly
the senate committee in health education labor
united states chamber in commerce where he
down the costs in health care for
health insurance because in skyrocketing health care
on another part in the state
employers on most in these state risk
not an employee in a company and
now none in us really believes
of the business in running bigrisk pools
the state mandates in health insurance of
more than that in the premium but
an awful lot in turnover where they
are a lot in mechanisms of the
of the committee in rules the gentleman
violates the concept in federalism that is
for the people in our states
as a result in our small market
protecting the rights in americans who have
from a lack in health insurance coverage
have the option in offering additional benefits
to the collapse in maryland s system
passage in this legislation would
on this house in representatives they could
while my friends in the other side
to covering many in the million americans
one little vial in strips test strips
for the cost in our health care
probably the end in business monday
on a matter in weeks get all
proponents in hr argue that
proposal on favor in the kindandrews substitute
of the state in georgia there was
a mandate because in managed care intrusion
about a couple in other mandates on
where the percentage in sickle cell anemia
the rising cost in health insurance on
would correct many in the flaws on
that the smallest in small businesses get
on strong support in the rule for
health fairness act in offered by the
the concept in companies working together
varying premiums based in age sex race
are a number in very important items
this week in course the patriot
ensure full consideration in the patriot act
on terms in motions to go
go to conference in any appropriations bills
it is not in the schedule
of that bill in our side mr
close on business in monday so that
have some notice in that on time
we get out in here
on light in the fact we
will be going in recess for the
anticipates might be in the agenda when
what might be in the agenda early
today on support in hr
a large part in that burden because
years before enactment in the law on
on the nature in a substitute
the proponents in the plan claim
market competition economy in scale enjoyed by
erisa s preemption in state mandates to
on my hometown in orlando florida and
pay of terms in premium is another
another dollar down in their bottom line
their bottom line in profit
that is out in any control that
speak on support in this substitute the
shows that adoption in this bill would
one in the reasons we
policy they go in to cite the
out they go in to state that
cbo found most in the enrollment on
more concentrated group in people
to address one in the most pressing
through a number in years and there
on desperate need in emergency medical attention
offering this type in coverage and that
certain minimal safeguards in health care coverage
appreciates the role in states and consumer
i have all in the respect and
for the chair in our committee but
a closer reading in the substitute bill
back but based in two previous debates
been a part in this bill of
it is one in the main reasons
on the hesitancy in so many businesses
additional workers because in the associated rising
holding so many in our workers back
costs coming out in their pockets to
why so many in the governors and
and the commissioners in insurance the association
insurance the association in state legislatures on
to an explosion in fraud and abuse
with these types in plans throughout the
health fairness act in
the number in uninsured has risen
reduce the ranks in the uninsured of
under this bill in the million uninsured
be pushed off in their current plans
of desperate need in health care
heard from thousands in small employers on
held a hearing in ahps
under employees because in the disparity on
over new cases in breast cancer will
be new cases in breast cancer diagnosed
i know many in my colleagues in
in my colleagues in both sides in
in both sides in the aisle have
raise the cost in education to those
recent report april in this year analyzed
and over percent in them would come
a meaningful package in benefits
expect that percent in the new enrollees
who come out in better plans who
about on support in this motion to
lower the number in uninsured americans many
it of section in the bill it
on the buttermilk in health care reform
of the form in section
this kind in malarkey has been
kind on protection in this kind in
in this kind in terrible rating scheme
the rising cost in health insurance is
as a result in the creation in
in the creation in association health plans
small firms some in the same advantages
to achieve economies in scale of purchasing
by state legislatures in a bipartisan basis
increase the number in uninsured by million
and the district in columbia have passed
a broad crosssection in trades or to
the fourth vote in this exact same
that protect millions in americans
found that many in these plans were
that the number in uninsured will increase
firms an increase in million people as
almost every member in this house voted
federal patient bill in rights that would
represented a lot in small businesses i
been agreed to in a bipartisan basis
away from one in our constituents one
the same type in access to health
as companies because in this bill can

paying an average in percent more for
