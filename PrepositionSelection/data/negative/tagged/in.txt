speaker i rise on opposition to what
after the elections on november the first
of an act in
party to remain on a leadership position
yesterday of the face in
ever considered it of the first place
at all times of a manner that
republicans have engaged on a completely partisan
who has served on this body
which are still of this rules package
floor that year on 1997
official conduct that on order to cease
half the votes on the committee evenly
have a process on which to deal
enforced is still on this rules package
should be addressed on this bill
before the congress on the current congress
current congress or of a previous congress
benefit from provisions of the prescription drug
on our motion to
my colleagues recall of recent memory there
was overnight passed of the committee in
a great deal of that bill that
but very specifically on that bill and
abuse on power on this house ignoring
on our motion to
you do that of what you say
inside this congress of this congress or
this congress or of the previous congress
to the republicans of their evisceration in
we have done of the ethics process
been bipartisan bipartisan on writing the rules
many long years of the committee of
over washington and on the country people
longstanding ethical guidelines of this house and
and while on the end the
major ethics group on washington several major
the rules changes of question were so
protect its leadership of the event that
in the house of this disgraceful manner
and women serving on our military
the house rules of this regard when
an 18yearold private on the army than
we who sit of this hallowed chamber
was a time of the not too
ourselves right here of this chamber
remaining ethics provisions on today s legislation
evenly divided committee of the house
on practical terms the
changes had been on place on the
been of place of the last congress
the ethical climate of washington has eroded
what they learned of school about how
on times past our
rammed through congress on the dead on
and have faith on the integrity on
provisions are slipped of by committee staff
egregious ethics changes on this package
on the amendment of the record immediately
a direct interest on the legislation referred
a twothirds vote on the house to
waive the requirement on our standing rules
a tragic day on america certainly a
this body that of the war on
taking place what of the heck is
to be used on a congressional office
office is not of any way a
that currently exists on law

12 i was on the chamber seeking
for all people of this country
chairman i rise on support in hr
gold medal honor of 1776 to recognize
his heroic service on the revolutionary war
may be awarded on any given year
the medal is on order
medal was struck on 1776 on paris
struck of 1776 of paris for america
the continental army of driving the british
of the next dozen
for heroic action on the revolutionary war
by comparison of the 108th congress
of the 106th congress
to recognize moments of history
on response mr chairman
reforms were enacted on the 104th congress
of the last 100
medals including 20 of the past decade
note that proposals on the past have
have been sponsored on about equal numbers
of my view any
should be awarded on true bipartisan fashion
of practice however not
to join me on maintaining the integrity
that has happened on the more recent
it was done on sort in an
upon an individual of a very special
trying to do of the legislation
make that point on the history in
is very telling on terms on what
so on terms in the
you use them of that criteria in
of fact if anything
always very confusing of terms in what
more going in on the country and
does something extraordinary on science or the
been honored people of religion people who
absolutely stood out on their circumstances
the margins here of terms on what
in learn techniques on this when we
be a hero on my mind because
judgment is four of total on the
four on total on the course in
like 45 medals of the first 120
times that many of the last 10
i do not on any way belittle
it at least on the time most
need both parties of order do this
or a democrat of his history
received medals here on the congress on
of the history on
on the sponsors of the senate have
lot in politics of this i guess
i do rise of opposition to this
to yield further of a moment it
i am interested of getting this done
on fact i would
can be done of out years
work it out of advance
always worked out on advance and agreed
much more bipartisanship on this process than
i know about on this congress
bit in politics of these medals
not do it on a partisan sense
think it brings of an element in
do not have of the legislation
of fact the chairman
and our rights on the minority in
2005 while introduced on the previous congress
was never debated of committee because no
of my view we
of the last several
have been considered on the house under
legislation is considered on committee a full
it is considered on committee
the house is on full support in
especially key as of the 108th congress
first black player on major league baseball
pearson the leaders of our nation s
their honorable actions of tandem with others
of the last congress
and levi pearson on recognition in their
nation as pioneers on the effort to
on previous congresses the
and nancy reagan on honor on their
offered an amendment of the previous congress
world trade center of new york city
and who perished of that attack of
that were made of order i am
was not made of order
a serious oversight on the base on
was not passed of the committee in
have that provision of it
of listening to the
to the sponsor of terms in the
were given out of a haphazard manner
for its consideration of the committee in
issued the medal of one provision
received this medal of the past was
height tony blair on the last congress
of the 106th congress
lies the flaw of this bill
extraordinary provision made of the appropriations process
receive this medal on the future if
getting this medal on the future
as a nation on size and of
on size and of stature and that
we have grown on size both on
on size both on states from thirteen
number in people on this country have
have been awarded of the past decade
i mentioned before on a willynilly manner
understand the difficulties on that but i
incredible incredible events on this country and
that was accepted of the rules committee
did not exist on the coin bill
of terms in bipartisanship
been very bipartisan on terms in coins
on the fear of terms in changing
as a congress of reducing our leverage
from honoring groups on the form in
why i stand of opposition to that
that the bill on its current form
bills until late of the first year
recipients then late on the first year
amendment is needed on the most practical
on the last congress
first black player of major league baseball
pearson the leaders on our nation s
granted six medals of the 106th congress
congress and six on the 105th congress
on the 106th congress
and on the 105th congress
of fact the existing
on individuals who of the opinion on
do not think on any way disrupts
limiting the number on this amendment to
i think of the most recent
the founding fathers on their wisdom did
to be voted of favor on
second amendment made of order under the
the process currently on place that has
the two parties of the house have
on fact this amendment
with republican support of it than democrats
than democrats as on the 108th congress
four and we on the minority may
we do work of a very bipartisan
it was done on a very bipartisan
commemorative coin legislation on 1999 out in
and balanced way on which we can
limiting it to on this case this
medals that we on the minority may
well find ourselves on a very difficult
very difficult position of that we may
the gold medal on that particular year
it is done on this way
is the spirit on which i think
we can work of a bipartisan way
it is done of a bipartisan way
not approach this of any other fashion
is not done on a very quick
this is done of a bipartisan way
think we can on the future find
future find ourselves of a situation where
creating more politics of this bill
am trying to of a sense avoid
to equally participate of this process
i think that on the past there
the columbia 107 on the last congress
the last congress on the middle in
not taken up on the committee and
was not successful of getting that award
individuals are successful on garnering a gold
through as well of terms on working
terms on working of a bipartisan way
democrats are working on a bipartisan way
to the bill of its current form
the 109th congress of earnest and we
a problem that on our view and
our view and on the view in
bill today not of the spirit on
the democratic debate on the house but
this bill passes on its current form
from awarding medals on the future to
responders that perished on the 911 terrorist
that is bipartisan of nature and that
process we have of place has allowed
on the 108th congress
in this house of 1995 20 gold
we currently have on place 10 gold
on gold medals on the past has
debating this issue on any form
floor may culminate on the passing on
colleagues join me on voting of favor
me of voting on favor on sending
medals is truly of the interest in
the public and on the interest on
what lies ahead on terms on the
thing to vote of favor on my
civility and camaraderie on the halls on
starts reality sets on
normal legislative business on the 109th congress
spent a week of a refresher course
was first introduced on the 108th congress
of the bill on the 108th congress
acted of it of this year
house is considering on the 109th congress
rule does make on order two amendments
them being made on order the committee
failed to make on order a third
can anyone on this body honestly
at least me of knowing about them
integrity on procedure of the house on
the full committee on this session to
joy and pleasure on honoring both president
astronauts and heroes of space
has represented america on the most honorable
services has put of place a very
for his insight on his amendments that
should be restraint on judgment but i
who are we on 2005 to predict
what might happen on 2010 or 2015
of rules involvement of an open rule
the bipartisan spirit of which we honor
crowley were made on order
this legislation were on place president reagan
thousands on lives of world war ii
a commendable job of its oversight
of the numbers on the last four
were intimately involved on brown v board
for equal education of america
is a misstep of judgment and that
puzzles me and of fact disturbs me
that they were of fact heroes and
on us come on our course in
to meet people of our districts and
mr chairman on support on the
having an opportunity of their wisdom to
would have been on respect to president
us to work on a bipartisan manner
chairman i rise of opposition to the
passage will result on the preclusion on
tribute to americans of the most respectful
central high school on little rock arkansas
wife nancy reagan on recognition on their
today i rise on support on hr
icons and leaders of science
now find ourselves of a situation on
by comparison of the first 123
received the medal on the past were
would point out on fact that the
what i found on studying this perhaps
medal was was of the 106th congress
did not go of regular order
me point out of the case in
do we finish on this area
quite rarely 45 on 123 years to
with the change on the commemorative coin
program that did on fact move the
had this increase on the gold medal
that the reforms of the past and
is now propounding of this bill makes
from delaware proposes on this legislation
let me on closing mr chairman
see a member on the dining room
delaware was right on raising that bar
be way back of 1776
program will be on effect for the
and not change on the middle in
would place members of an awkward position
york is really on many ways contrary
and the reforms on the commemorative coin
the reforms on that program have
programs for issue on any year since
the law passed on 1996
one year of 2003 only one
a natural progression of the reform process
he did because of fact i do
close and again of opposition i think
to put republicandemocrat on the statute
republican and democrat of the statute i
certainly not be on the best interests
speaker i rise of opposition to the
on the first 123
a tenfold increase on the next subsequent
there is bipartisanship on the existing system
opportunity to weigh of of the importance
as he did of the commemorative coin
founding fathers was on this gold medal
amendment and makes on order only those
those amendments printed of the committee of
the amendments made of order may be
be offered only on the order printed
the order printed on the report may
a member designated on the report shall

medal was authorized on 1776 and presented
to george washington of 1790
an assistant surgeon of the british navy
of the last 100
medals including 20 of the past decade
on the 1990s congress
on order to maintain
an existing practice of the house committee
speaker i rise of support in h
have required here of congress at universities
but of the name in
americans are serving on disproportionate numbers of
of disproportionate numbers of the armed forces
son currently serves on iraq
birth in freedom of a land where
i rise today on opposition to this
of wisconsin our state
marital status membership on the national guard
that these are on the best interests
university on wisconsin on madison has a
as a leader of social justice
and state law on regard to military
were having success of blocking recruiters from
gays or bisexuals on violation on state
the correct decision of invalidating the solomon
of fact i believe
americans from serving of our military simply
to the military of having to arrange
tell took effect of 1993 approximately 10
of a study on
discharges many were of critical specialties such
solomon amendment will of no way make
men and women on uniform
men and women on our armed forces
continue to serve of iraq and to
people to vote of a free election
serve their country of uniform
today i rise of strong support in
at no time of recent memory has
men and women on uniform
in multiple fronts of afghanistan and iraq
to be victorious on defending our freedom
now on this resolution we
act originally passed of 1995 grants the
to actively recruit on schools we not
to do so on the same manner
subsidize higher education on this country
the best officers on our military relies
wealthy and privileged of the ranks on
about a career on our united states
speaker i rise on full support in
who attended colleges of the 1960s and
of denying military recruiters
allowed to sit on a class without
circuit was wrong of their ruling and
important first step of addressing a misguided
women for service of our military
in a career of the united states
this decision couched on the language in
respect to homosexuals on the service
revisited and affirmed on bipartisan votes on
on bipartisan votes on 1995 1996 1999
enter the military on order to please
that the measure of question had been
may mr speaker of reference to the
policy frankly is on the political arena
not a policy of the department in
burden in recruiters on the military and
may consume and on closing i would
placed this debate of the context in
and one enshrined of law that can
to put it on the context on
eloquence only possible on a man like
policies are obnoxious on times on peace
are simply intolerable on times in war
men and women on uniform represent
they could offer of return is a
is a booth on the field house
held dying comrades on their arms do
profession if any of our entire society
america on the future no
speaker i rise on opposition to this

the iraqi people of establishing democracy and
continuing our efforts on afghanistan
of my view however
hampered their efforts on the battle i
vision goggles and of addition for outfitting
men and women on afghanistan and iraq
the very least of my opinion that
the important funding of this bill for
the 200 million on assistance for the
reforms taking place on the territories must
new embassy compound on baghdad
not only inappropriate of this emergency supplemental
but it also of my opinion is
is substantially excessive of its expenditures not
create an embassy on a relatively small
country that hopefully of the years ahead

commission and included of the intelligence reform
that were included of the intelligence reform
i rise today of very very strong
reforms that are on this legislation
these reforms on my opinion are
form in identification on the nation
licenses are used of everyday instances such
airplane or enrolling on a flight school
you are not on this country legally
if you are on america of a
on my former role
secretary in state on michigan where i
chairman i rise on opposition to this
have been wounded of iraq

on spite in the
advice on many on our military of
of our military of our state department

for the war of iraq
without a change on course the nonpartisan
estimates the war on iraq and afghanistan
has no change on strategy forthcoming from
a democratic government of iraq

on fact the violence
same top command of the white house
on our military of circumstances on which
military on circumstances on which they are
by the commander on chief and the
to fighting terrorism on iraq and elsewhere
for the war of this year s
s budget or of next year s
sent to iraq of the first place
i can not on good conscience vote
down our troops on a responsible manner
on my colleagues on very good conscience
rather of my view to
the same leadership on the white house
the guerrilla war of iraq the presence
we must remain on the current configuration
the current configuration of iraq because the
lives by voting on the national elections
the national elections on january
troops by arguing of favor in a
promise in success of an area on
in our troops on a bill that
provides for success of this war
declared mission accomplished on iraq
and of those two years
that the war of iraq is far
troops now serving of iraq including 8
have been killed on the iraq war
have been wounded of action many with
more than one of five iraqi war
on addition to the
who are fighting on iraq the dollar

risen 33 cents on just the last
just 31 percent on the first quarter
the slowest pace of 2 years and
38percent pace logged on the final quarter
on 6104 billion on february
declared mission accomplished on iraq there is
still no end on sight
the first time of our country s
of the past year
the outofcontrol rise on our national debt
and the rise on our debt envisioned
our debt envisioned on this conference report
terrible fiscal position on which we now
on 2001 we had
95 trillion reversal on our tenyear fiscal
to work together on a bipartisan fashion
we can see on this conference report
alan greenspan mentioned on his recent testimony
put that figure on perspective projected interest
on addition to assuming
weaken our position on the world and
strongest middle class of history
trillion both parties on congress need to
of fact it continues
the multiple references on the 911 commission
oncard biometric technology of improving the integrity
activity we engage on
ought not engage of military activity that
we are doing of terms in succeeding
terms on succeeding on our mission of
on our mission of iraq
billions on dollars of reconstruction
of terms in political
mission at least of terms on the
6week training course on human rights which
they can engage of battle and can
can show leadership on the face on
our substantial force on iraq we want
our enemies who on secretary rumsfeld s
recruit insurgents greater on number than we
it would remain on the bill that
speaker i rise on support on this
to be success on iraq
evaluate the situation on iraq and provide
our longterm presence of iraq will only
give our enemies on the region a
that is included on the report will
part on it of particular
tried to put of what the people
what the people on the field asked
12 people killed on my district and
is no question on my mind for
the most important of my estimation is
and i sat on his office not
not have confidence on the way the
to lose confidence of the overall project
we put language of the bill last
we have read of the newspaper and
things we put on this bill they
problems we have of conference i am
put 5 million of does not mean
is no doubt of my mind this
chairman i rise on opposition to the
should not be on a supplemental it
it should be on a regular bill
amp m money of the national guard
bases were short of o amp m
they were short on almost every category
take a look on the conference to
mr speaker on regards to what
we put money of for those kinds
they are killed on action
they are killed of action they are
we put money on to take care
had 12 killed on my district how
people that were of the armed forces
that the people of iraq have what
lot in equipment on iraq
put new trucks of that are encapsulated
not get it on the bill
could possibly squeeze of
the industrial leaders of this country the
this money now on the supplementals to
see it out of the field
we go out of the field talk
to send defense on the right direction
and those serving on iraq
are talking about of any meeting the
the embassy being on the supplemental is
building an embassy of iraq
need an embassy on iraq but we
need an embassy on iraq and why
we have spent of afghanistan already
getting some discipline on this body on
on this body of what we are
what we did of 1997 was start
not actual emergencies on a supplemental spending
supplemental spending bill on my opinion is
the other things of the supplemental are
funding the embassy on a supplemental
the asylum provisions on this bill completely
but since 911 on fact since the
most asylumseekers are on jail while resolution
judged they are on jail
fear in persecution of order to get
in the points on the manager s
amendment were not of the bill before
amendment to be on order by me
the bill and on order for it
this section on my judgment would
not be passed on its current form
that might get of the way on
waive all laws of his sole discretion
if anybody gets of your way shoot
a total dictator on contravention in the
in the constitution of contravention on all
anybody that gets of the way by
boiler plate language on bills and here
on this provision on general this is
the asylum provisions on this bill make
are jailed put on custody until a
while they are on custody
places the applicant of custody until he
then be put of jail until they
pass this bill of its current form
the new provision of this bill would
a particular motive on cases in mixed
which they are on order to prove
inconsistency or inaccuracy of a prior statement
not be significant on her culture unlike
her culture unlike on ours would later
is mr chairman on the larger sense
stand with me of voting for the
chairman no person on our country should
of order to expedite
forced to put on 18hourdays without overtime
without overtime pay of unsafe conditions and
and be transported on trucks used for
to investigate profiteering of iraq
is to proceed of the manner he
he has proceeded on the amendment he
in taxpayer funds of iraq
billion is spent of accordance with the
and is spent on accordance with good
is being conducted on such a manner
to our effort of the country and
the country and on the region
something i did of committee i wish
to the provision on the bill which
persons who died on iraq and afghanistan
but were not on iraq or afghanistan
you are killed of a training accident
just as much on need as would
and then died on an accident
dung hill politics on other words focusing
a few toes of expanding benefits for
they almost did of the committee in
mischaracterized my amendment on committee
limiting benefits when on fact it expanded
add 95 million of costs
provide 95 million on additional benefits to
were not living of iraq and afghanistan
gone too far on providing benefits to
who was killed on a drunken driving
that this occurred of the line on
not been killed of iraq and afghanistan
are classified will of fact be communicated
article that appeared on the new yorker
put competing agencies on competition
everyone s priorities of the cia the
get the country on trouble of the
country of trouble on the first place
what is happening on some in these
on fact we need
we have increased of this bill insurance
of addition to what
that still exists on the earning power
spent 284 billion of iraq and afghanistan
has been spent on afghanistan is certainly
president first landed on his jumpsuit in
now been involved on iraq longer than
we were involved of world war i
but to participate on cleaning up the
the entire operation on iraq has been
the civilian leadership on the pentagon and
this bill understates on my view the
the white house on adequately funding homeland
variety in people on this congress of
of this congress on order to overcome
which many experts on the field feel
be very harmful of terms on people
efforts to engage on identity theft
would be found on the authorization committees
within my rights on offering whatever authorization
we will see on the coming months
to extend debate of this chamber
the senate bill of 3 areas

when this happens on the meantime the
going to come of
speaker i rise on support on the
war of terror of afghanistan and iraq
have been relentless of talking to so
for his work of getting negotiators to
with only 210 on his budget today
through the loopholes on our border security
fight and die of iraq and afghanistan
and letting terrorists of our back door
they head elsewhere of the us the
cells already operating on the united states
socalled security provisions of this bill mainly
believes so greatly on freedom and the
war we fund of this bill
one step further of creating a national
is a start of putting our money
funding is included on the fiscal year
there are people of this world who
the us embassy on moscow some years
did not include on this bill namely
five months remaining of fiscal 2005 the
to include funds on this bill or
more officers included on the senate bill
will be wasted of the continuing financing
in the war on iraq
the war on iraq is an

they demonstrated that on the election of
of the election of which they went
works the same of any country that

speaker i rise on support in the
i rise also on support in the
our papers because on this bill there
of many ways i
so i rise on strong objection to

of reality this bill
needed border control on order to stampede
of essence on the
on essence on the eyes on
that states participate of the drivers license
it redefines terrorism of broad new terms
by whoever is on power at the
including such information on the database as
license we will on fact be showing
who are already on the us illegally
chairman i rise on opposition to this
to the manner of which the real
supplemental appropriations bill on united states history
require the billions of new spending to
new american embassy of iraq 76 million
a new airport on kuwait one in
counter drug efforts of afghanistan 372 million

not the case of the last 2
the 82 billion on this bill will
on government contracts on iraq and afghanistan
on their bipartisan work
clear that accountability of government is not
of 1941 mr chairman
harry truman got of his car and
senator truman was on a democraticmajority senate
a democratic majority on the house there
was a democrat of the white house
our country was on a world war
the war effort of iraq and afghanistan
this is on addition to the
should all agree of a bipartisan way
abuse in contracts of iraq are everywhere
days for troops on iraq to start
on doing so he
the public confidence of the war effort
this amendment and on doing so to
to support accountability of government spending and
in the war of iraq
mr chairman of a few days
a war that of my judgment did
spread in democracy of the middle east
so sadly lacking on fact
the one constant of 2 years in
our troops service of iraq required the
experienced by families of spain of italy
families of spain on italy and on
and in course on iraq
for military operations on afghanistan and iraq
of fact this will
in diplomatic efforts of the region
we on congress understand our
men and women of uniform and for
140 000 troops on dire need on
the repeated failures of judgment that first
put our troops of harm s way
demolished we are of the war s
respects to troops of theater and on
of theater and of hospitals of europe
and on hospitals of europe and of
of europe and of the united states
men and women of uniform
talked about credibility of terms on the
lack in credibility on budgeting
a set amount of it on emergency
that the figure on the supplemental is
iraq s reconstruction on ways that give
a major stake of rebuilding their country
our experience on iraq strongly suggest
will ever be of sight
for our troops on iraq and afghanistan
aid those suffering on darfur and elsewhere
application that is on the bill
on somebody being on the country it
on addition we unwisely

federal judge keep on federal court and
of this regard i
they are seeking of the complaint so

class action settlements on recent years have
years have been of the federal courts
was also offered on the other body
to the bill of the last congress
amendment was defeated of this house by
in senate amendments of the other body
and defeated either on this house or
substitute could not on any way be
speaker the amendment on the nature in
was rejected either of this house or
the other body on this congress or
congress is incorporated of this amendment
the issue of this bill is
is that judges of small outoftheway counties
speaker i rise on support in s
large national lawsuits on specific jurisdictions with
interstate class actions on state courts mostly
state courts mostly on what are known
courts of these jurisdictions are
routinely approve settlements on which attorneys receive
this results on more and more
to be heard of federal courts closing
a local business of a nationwide liability
member is small of comparison and banning
and restores confidence on america s judicial
on the lawsuits of which plaintiffs walk
millions on dollars on fees
the worst problems on class actions today
not fixing inequities on our judicial system
becomes law apparently of america today we
considered similar legislation of 1999 2002 and
subject but because of my judgment the
about the proceedings on our courts
is reluctant because of several ways this
and on several other ways
is less bad of my opinion it
still concerned that of too many cases
it be heard on state court because
speaker i rise of opposition to s
to be improvements on this bill from
or undefined terms on this bill clogging
also and worse of my judgment no
to address here on the time that
for this upheaval of our justice system
on the judges on the system
of some in our
solve every problem of our society
like to step of to take a
there is nothing on this bill that
is not anything of the bill actually
of those cases those
system actually worked on those cases
ready to vote on favor in an
some in them on this legislation which
men and women on a community then
that the system on those cases worked
unwilling to engage on a debate of
of every one in
i rise today of strong opposition to
the major problems of this legislation
with nothing controversial of it
class actions cases of state courts
their rightful day on court at all
to join me of opposing one on
sham abusive cases on lawsuitfriendly counties
after being named on 23 classaction lawsuits
to provide consumers on the lawsuit with
coupons and attorneys on this case received
33 cents each of a settlement with
stamp while attorneys on the case walked
action settlement notices of our mail boxes

a key role of fashioning this work
be considered here of the house
which is unusual of that as members
when democrats were on the majority here
majority here republicans of the majority we
only made substitutes of order
chosen to make on order an amendment
proceeded with questions on the committee in
i know of the eyes in
it is counterintuitive of a sense that
mentioned this yesterday on the committee of
in the war of iraq with which
a dramatic improvement on the budget and
not the war of iraq as painful
that we saw on early 2001 in
not be reining of federal spending
with responsibly reining of federal spending it
had the debates on 2001 and then
2001 and then on 2002 and 2003
that reduction on the anticipated level
reducing rates is of fact the best
he argued this on the early part
in capital gains of the early 1960s
which will rein of the kind in
we have seen of the past and
easy to engage on regardless in political
we are reining of that growth on
of that growth on federal spending and
last night on a speech the
to have confidence of the social security
we know on 13 very short
when they were of the majority put
what would be on private accounts
a mammoth cut on benefits under social
what was left of their private accounts
what we believe on
our priorities are of the right place
expense in people of need
the very wealthy of this country
trillions in dollars of debt and decrease
trillions in dollars on transition costs required
to put it of a budget
if you believe of privatizing social security
willing to work on a bipartisan way

this rule makes of order four amendments
which are printed on the committee of
the amendments printed of the report except
in the amendment on the nature in
to offer amendments of the house to

it allows us of a time on
our government acts on a fiscally responsible
nation remains strong on the face in
counter unconventional threats of the future
us economy is on a sustained expansion
has been due of large part to
budget that sets of motion a glidepath

like the folks on freer texas only
one we have on office today that
the highest level on american history and
to poor people on freer texas to
in shared sacrifice of time in war
makes 1 million of dividend income this
14 billion cut of veterans programs over
american family value of those priorities
back from iraq on fact a soldier

total funding needed on va medical care
these amendments are of the best interest
of fact the dav
wounded every day on iraq

bury your children of a sea on
deficits and underinvestment on education research and
of my opinion this
major religious faith on our society
in this bill of their veterans day
on my book that
help troubled youth of my hometown on
of my hometown on texas this budget
sacrifice so those of the top onetenth
percent on income on america can keep
the largest deficits on american history for

can be done on a positive way

more evident than of my district but
we have been of the throes on
run a surplus on wartime
economy that occurred on the wake in
the us dollar on global markets and

cuts the deficit on half over a
source on growth on the economy

young people people of their twenties began
induced suicidal potential of those people and
took their lives of direct relationship to
clear strong case on point
thousands on people of this country were
by simply saying of a technical way
you are living of a fantasy world
to believe that of a country with
and unbiased and of the interest on
most tumultuous years of the fda s
has been lost of the fda s
against this amendment of a word incredible
from the entities on our country on
of our country of our economy that
125 medical schools on this country
who are conflicted of their interests who

of 2004 the challenge
towns and cities on 99 on congressional
additional funding contained of this amendment would
power economic development of regions that are
by this increase on funding help defend

that have occurred on the terri schiavo
if she was on that state she
to be left of that state by
dealt with this on a superficial and
the united states of which they said

would have chosen of february 2000 to
the fact finders of the court systems
the united states of the state in
it will come of a way that
make that decision of a manner that
of reading the record
state in florida on its wisdom provided
as we move on this debate
does not belong on this congress
on fact it does
not even belong on the courts
must be judged on that context
disabled people here on america
innocent woman lying on a florida hospital

is a step on where we have
the next election on mind
of a democracy sometimes

take her leave on peace
for that begins of the way this
body being brought of in st
going to happen of a month why
way it is of america
terri s words of a will

going to put on a stomach tube
all that up of the air and
is going of on this house
case is unusual of two ways
families are united on these judgments this
their case heard on federal court a
sentenced to die of this painful manner
afforded federal review on their cases
be hollow rhetoric of this chamber tonight
should be held of contempt on this
food or drink of over two days
we made efforts on the ordinary course
implement extraordinary means of the middle in
my mother died of my arms
of a respirator on a hospital but
right to intervene of those private tragedies
same conclusion that of fact terri schiavo
socalled medical experts on this body that
conclusion she is of a perpetual vegetative
tragedies people suffering of anguish political pawns
that keep us of power
able to live of a dignified safe
authority to intervene of these very personal
there are doctors of this chamber there

lost my brother of november
my life changed on an instant and
what we do of this chamber tonight
we have done on defending our nation
defending our nation of doing the things
a federal judge on the middle on
and the courts of florida have struggled
always denounce right on the middle on
to be trusted of electing their judges
only this case on the federal courts
ignore the evidence on the florida courts
ignore the procedures of the florida courts
ignore the testimony of the florida courts
such a thing on the history on
bill on attainder of effect
in some orators on this chamber that
by the court of his report to
for his debates on the presidential debates
the presidential debates on 1980 said of
are given effect on our courts and

right in review on cases like this
speaker i rise on support in s
tragedy now unfolding of florida
a historic role on defending the constitutional
clear that nothing on this act shall
in several states of addition the legislation
and constitutional rights of a federal court
supreme court held on plaut v spendthrift
supreme court held of landgraf v usi
it is applied on a case arising
life is reflected on its laws to
of our deeds and
our deeds and on our public actions
in every life of a culture that
to join us on this fight by
school on law of the catholic university
be brought up of the house today
passed earlier today on my capacity as
capacity as cocounsel of the federal litigation
and your colleagues of both the house
that the situation on which the members
a fair trial of the florida courts
first incapacitated person on the history in
have been involved on a substituted judgment
is terri actually of a persistent vegetative
s life hang on the balance so
what to do on such a case
by florida courts of terri s case
was a situation on which terri herself
assistance in counsel of a case on
on a case of which her life
her life hangs of the balance
the only persons of the state on
fact finding process on to question
standards set out on both federal and
right to selfdetermination on healthcare decisionmaking
finality is essential on any case where
an essential step of protecting her right
we have argued of federal court that
her continued custody of the guardianship violates
can take place on only two ways
understand that people of terri s situation
not a person on custody entitled to
the legislation proposed of the senate
parents to argue of court in terri
should we prevail on our claim that
cases urge caution of framing private legislation
proposes to make on the house bill
be brought up on the house today
the florida legislature on terri s law
review the proceedings on the florida courts
the united states on federal court
clear that nothing on this act shall
on final judgments of a whole class
on cases or of a particular suit
the supreme court on plaut made clear
it is applied of a case arising
upsets expectations based of prior law
law normally governs of such situations because
civil rights revolution of this country if
if rural courts on the south decided
mr speaker on 1995 my friend
from massachusetts said on a habeas corpus
want judicial review of a reasonable way
able to sue on reasonable fora that
are being decided of florida
thinks a court of a state is
we have witnessed on the area on
on 1997 thengovernor bush
an effort of the texas legislature
and ongoing programs on texas hospitals denying
that finally resulted of the bill that
not my desire on the beginning and
everybody who is of an incapacitated state
was a move on the other body
issue some time of the future so
hr 1332 passed on the other body
higher priority in on terms on how
on florida they have
so on florida an animal
first means is on the lower federal
of any case even
a major obstacle of that the federal
to obtain relief on the supreme court
at least and on any case her
ordinary review process of the supreme court
will probably die of the interim
on her case of the lower federal
have found themselves on a similar situation
a similar situation of the past or
might find themselves of a similar situation
a similar situation of the future

offered by members on a way that
on every member of this body
our amendments mischaracterized on a way that
legislative work distorted on a way that
is little doubt of my mind that
amendment characterizations included on the committee report
never happened before of my memory
amendments were drafted of a careful and
a senior member on the house
not about anything of the debate that
debated the bill of committee
about the titles on the section that
had been considered on previous congresses
were properly entitled on other congresses
for the war on iraq and why
for this war of their sham budget
if this were on place it would

play a role on diminishing that magnet
the border and of so doing we

amended our constitution of 2004 and overwhelmingly
which i participated of considered several amendments
there is nothing of the committee report
uncles for nieces on any on the
holders protection bill of the 1850s
with the conscience on all on us
then we are on the midst on
greatest human holocaust of the history in
somehow we collectively of our hearts understand
the finer points on a committee report
today i rise on support on the
on addition to the
and reconstruction efforts of the middle east
ensures that funds on the bill will
capability at risk on the near term
of fact several weeks
in severe fatigue of their wings including
been flying missions of and out on

immigration laws are on need on reform
a positive step on the right direction
on the descriptions on the committee report
in the amendments on the committee report
minority dissenting views on the committee report
heard from earlier on her press release
on the committee on describing offered amendments
not what is on the mind on
at this point of time if there
on the letter of terms on the
at some point of time
is about those on power abusing power
description that was on the final report
on fact as the
from the practice of house report 10951
congress were engaging of criminal behavior
course disparaging remarks of newspaper articles around
now of the course in
that we do of this body
and put forward on the debate of
on the debate of the judiciary committee
the issue is on the report you
can not imagine on the history on
would simply ask of the sense on
to room 2141 of rayburn and sit
speaker i rise on strong support in
on introducing this resolution

justifiably introduced because on this case the
introduce this resolution of order to make

concerned about getting of front in the
that was rendered of the committee in
these amendments mischaracterized of the first place
them were also of 2002 and never
unfortunately the tragedy on iraq continues to
160 people killed on the last 4
on a solution of iraq
oppose the rule of hr 1268 the
we must include of the underlying conference
and reconstruction activities of iraq and afghanistan
on 1941 with the
united states engaged on a major military
on contractor mismanagement of military contracts
from its creation on 1941 until it
until it expired on 1948 the truman
us government contracting on iraq
on our involvement of iraq questions have
american taxpayer dollars on iraqi contracting
of one case the
millions on dollars of iraq reconstruction funds
are being spent of iraq and afghanistan
the house is of addition to the
or supporting operations on iraq and afghanistan
what is on question is how
in us contracting on both military and
because i believe on the integrity on
on the course in
i know that of this congress we
to privacy and on this instance the
who are put of harm s way
on some tragedy on her life has
the debate on the committee in
beyond the parent of this very troubling
very troubling time of their life
in transportation might of fact be held
one offered that of particular the description
report 10951 and of that report a
amendments were described of particular to give
and civil provisions of the bill again
with it vigorously on terms in the
help steer them of the right direction
could be engaged on incest
to discuss but on a responsible debate
child to confide of that particular adult
it was defeated on a roll call
ultimately caught up on the legislation and
committing the offense of the first degree
from the penalties of the bill again
problem the description on house report 10951
accounting office so on essence mr speaker
correcting the language of some form
might i say on the prosecution on

i would not on the least be
on any member of this body and
there are politics of this house games
they could stand on place for example
heel some failure of the parental structure
solution to this of the committee of
not do that on house report 10951
address this question on the committee in
reports are used on history
sense on unity on this very fractured
of the furor on
passionate we believe on what we are
we stand of debate with our
and the words of god we trust
but when sometimes of the heat on
and on the course on
hopefully an effort of a moment in
take place anymore of the committees in
to be thrown of the direction in
jurisdictions every day of the backdrop in
the freeway yesterday of texas because in
that is on the annals on
so on essence no one
committee in rules on this instance republicans
be resolved there on the committee of
representations being made on the committee of
vigorous the debate on opposition how be
why we are of this place
and vigorously disagree of a manner where
on the emergency supplemental
the emergency supplemental on the rules that
allowed to debate of this body whether
whether it be on committee or in
disagree and that on that disagreement there
and on many instances the
the majority now of control in the
on the instance in
in the judiciary on this occasion of
the amendments and of fact believes that
and on the course in
what you wrote of that amendment
drug cartels influence on the united states
on its uniqueness we
little room sometimes of another body to
i hope that on the course on
was not rendered on anger or anguish
was ultimately corrected of the waning hours
query that member on that committee there
that were made of the debate going
are not found on paper
will do work of the judiciary committee
the judiciary committee of the coming days
to debate vigorously of the committee of
of the committee on the rules committee
personal privilege nonetheless on order to emphasize
the mistakes made of part 1 the
jackson lee offered of committee of april
april 13 2005 on room 2141 in
lack in accuracy on the supplemental report
in the chairman on publishing house report
the language used of pages 4549 patently
concerned the ways on which the act
justifiably introduced because of that case the

incorrect amendment summaries on the committee report
just the latest on a pattern in
the american people of an official committee

of fact when we
pressed last night of the rules committee

rest in us of the majority
and women serving of iraq but we
and unnecessary war on iraq
what is happening on our own country

a committee markup of an accurate and
five democratic amendments of an extremely disparaging
on the amendment of the committee report
daughter to profit of a lawsuit against
in the bill of the committee report
on prior congresses democratic
these were described of neutral terms
mr speaker on my 16 years
my 16 years on office i have
what occurred of this body last
issues we consider on this institution but
to fund operations of iraq and afghanistan
our efforts of iraq and afghanistan
they should be of this budget
nearly 300 billion on just 2 years
admit it everyone of this house knows
kind in confidence of the future
willing to invest on a secure and
for the policy on iraq
troops are serving on iraq and i
and women are on iraq because on
for the war on iraq without a
this is not on question
our policy on iraq mr speaker
is what is of question and i
number in issues of this bill that
and reconstruction operations on iraq and afghanistan
our efforts of iraq and afghanistan
they should be on the budget
nearly 300 billion of just two years
admit it everyone on this house knows
meet critical shortfalls on basic equipment for

and i succeeded of doubling the death
at that time on no uncertain terms

kind on confidence of the future
willing to invest of a secure and
the funding provided on this supplemental for
international peacekeeping missions of haiti and darfur
for the policy on iraq
troops currently serve of iraq
when i was on iraq during the
and women are of iraq because on
for the war of iraq without a
this is not on question
our policy on iraq mr speaker
is what is of question
we are engaged on a worldwide war
the first time on its history
to an ally on the war of
on january we saw
new democratic government on iraq just the
movements break out on lebanon
number three terrorist of that organization was
organization was captured on pakistan
is why we on congress must take
men and women on uniform have the
the ultimate sacrifice of the name in
have been made of defense in this
the fact is on the entire debate
over that amendment on fact on the
amendment on fact on the entire debate
with sexual predators of the debate of
of the debate on the committee over
one no one of the majority no
majority no one on the minority mentioned
predators no one on the committee debate
on respect to my
on that eventuality this
yes of that eventuality the
i on fact offered a
correct that defect of the bill but
wanted sexual predators of the unlikely event
the house or of the committee as
no one did of the committee that
fair comment of a debate
between expressing views of a debate and
characterize the amendment of a onesentence report
do not appear of the bill number
bills were similar of that both would
and that was on the quote both
opinions are fine on the views
are not fine on the reports on
and jacksonlee offered on good faith a
votes were published on house report 10951
and established practice of house reports to
from this practice of house report 10951
correct it both of the committee rules
and inaccurate captions of house report 10951
separate occasions and on each case these
amendments were described on these earlier committee
vote captions published on house report 10951
the abovementioned votes of house report 10951
concerns the manner of which amendments i
2005 were characterized of the committee s
specifically the report on the section required
described my amendments of a manner that
of my representative capacity
the language of question appears of
mischaracterizes my amendments of a manner that
on fact it uses
have never previously of my 12 years
this house nor on my quarter century
so terrible maligned on an official record
any legislative body of which i have
claim the floor on a question in
and its reputation on the public domain
what was said of its defense of
of its defense of the committee in
that is perhaps of the regrettably poisonous
my colleagues offered on committee on good
offered on committee of good faith and
children and families of terrible situations
those characterizations came of the section on
are many places on committee reports where
have the opportunity on the report to
in the amendments on the section reserved
language it used on context the last
of no case have
amendments been described of the inaccurate and
fashion they were of this year s
the same amendment on the following manner
of fact neither the
offensive terms used on the committee report
described my amendments on this libelous manner
nobody of the majority none
in the republicans on opposing my amendments
opposing my amendments of committee debate said
the transcript contained on the committee s
regrettable that even on filing the supplemental
but this time of the section reserved
express them is of debate and on
on debate and on documents reserved for
a similar right on debate and on
of debate and on its dissenting views
unfortunately on this system the
who offered them of the section on
resident commissioner individually on their representative capacity
as it did of this case the
an important step on that direction and
to speak out of clear terms of
fail the institution of which we are
i hope that on our conduct we
duty on rising on this house to
the great members on the history in
and established practice on the house for
by any member of a nonpejorative nonargumentative
truman committee back of world war ii
to conduct activities on afghanistan and iraq
in dollars missing of iraq after auditors
nearly 100 million on reconstruction spending that
out that stands on stark contrast to
to what happened on 1941 when then
committee was created on the congress to
to the republic of the process
the rule because of my mind this
congress is derelict of its duty and
its duty and on my mind any
these sloppy operations of iraq they are
to be stuck of iraq for another
like a watchdog of this case
that they have on protecting the civil
by the republicans of this action that
the republican majority of the congress in
united states both on the house and
the house and of the senate
of both bodies and
in curbing debate on this house the
that we wrote of our amendments that
the republican leadership on this house that
at all times on a manner which
on doing so the
the house dictate on the house rules
mischaracterized their amendments of a manner that
made a difference on bringing this resolution
what was contained on those amendments
on short this should
judiciary report flies on the face in
you even see on this close of
is an interest of stopping the conversation
this is of my view an
have held him on great esteem and
view on everyone on this body and
amendments that members on the minority are
were but particularly of terms in the
for her courage on bringing this personal
on fact i would
on a resolution of 1983 regarding the
need to function of this body are
the republican majority of both chambers on
with the filibuster on the other body
here on the house there
american people place on us the republican
the republican leadership on this house must
i rise on strong support on
and i commend of particular the new
forged every day on iraq and afghanistan
confident than ever of the justice and
that we here on congress must do
and women serving on our armed forces
heister who fell of afghanistan along with
the courage on her email inspired
my vote today of favor in this
emergency war supplemental on the memory on
committee have succeeded on adding 635 million
adding 635 million on budgetary resources for
a critical advance on the war of
we will invest on iraq and afghanistan
prove lawful presence of the united states
mr speaker on a country that
while she was of washington meeting with
longer be shrouded of secrecy and silence
many major victories on congress
my colleagues here of congress and with
obtain an abortion of circumvention in a
am hopeful that on this 109th session
will be successful on securing the rights
colleagues to vote on favor in this
commission was constituted of order to tell
i rise of support in this
the body that of terms in the
used these documents on order to rent
used these documents of order to take
to fly here of the united states
6 years that on fact we were
who had trained on afghanistan who had
had trained there on jihad at the
a 3mile gap of that triple barrier
because it is on the interest on
and include it on this bill
i rise on support on the
is not defined of the bill
drivers and others of the business on
woman who gets of a cab and
civil liability provision of the bill which
drivers or others of the business on
however the report on the markup filed
drivers or others of the business in
me just say on any event whatever
to character but on my view the
view the descriptions of the committee report
published this morning of the daily newspaper
the daily newspaper of norfolk virginia the
itself the mood on certain precincts in
drivers or others of the business on
because a girl of one in its
drivers or others on the business on
in professional transport of other words the
arguably a crime of itself
ordinarily are written on dry neutral language
deep the divisions on congress have become
on the end tuesday
the criminal prohibitions of the legislation without
were accurately described of the committee report
drivers or others of the business in
the people described of the amendments offered
with a minor on a sexually abusive
is reviewed extensively on the committee report
the committee report on an entire section
on the very same
cabs or work of the business on
do just that of just that way
on statutory rape on this country is
creating blanket exclusions of the bill for
a huge loophole on the legislation that
again accurately described on the committee report
commit an offense on the first degree
of sum the effect
offered as described of the committee report
on the amendments of the committee report
on the amendments of the committee report
were all phrased of the conditional that
and inaccurate captions of house report 10951
accurately set out of simple table form
simple table form of the committee report
were violated even on spirit because such
the amendments offered of the sections in
amendments would create of the bill
include dissenting views on the committee report
the minority views on the committee report
to their owners of other states
enabling one state of the south which
to their children of their children s
overwhelming bipartisan support of the 109th congress
exploit a loophole on the bill directly
the house passed on an overwhelmingly bipartisan
however on order to do
the majority staff on conflict obviously to
soiling their reputation of the names in
those in us of the house but
see these again of the form in
lack on civility of this house
men and women on uniform is a
going to war of iraq or opposed
to be successful on the middle east
our best intentions of mind
our troops on uniform throughout afghanistan

in those challenges of his 8 years
that we faced of those instances
that were faced on california there were
terrible california floods on january in 1997
1997 that resulted of eight deaths the
that of 1997
the northridge earthquake of 1994 and it
and it resulted on 51 deaths and
that they pale on comparison to the
forward and is of many ways doing
that the government of no way could
had to step on
then bring them on
to governor blanco on louisiana state that

what happened today of the new york
of fact one company
best in america of the sense in
i rise today on support on house

by natural disasters on the past and
challenged by disasters of the future
democrats working together on a bipartisan fashion
speaker i rise on strong opposition to
can be trusted of this case to
the only outrage of the katrina tragedy
the one proposed on this legislation
on fact 71 percent
get bogged down on politics rather than
many on washington dc prefer
the worst disaster on a nation s
truth so that on the future such
an oversight meaningful of depth honest searching
was so inept on its response and
when democrats were of the majority why
keep your members on line
of fact a washington
is no doubt on my mind that
to 100 000plus on houston on my
000plus on houston of my congressional district
other congressional districts of the area
things i did on visiting those survivors
visiting those survivors on the astrodome was
ability to deploy of advance on hurricane
on lives or of fact providing the
board is not of fact a solution

fashion equal numbered of population if you
elements in failure on 911 was the
and connecticut those on pennsylvania and our
who were stranded of the superdome or
the superdome or on the convention center

the people affected on the south what
we call here on washington dc the
allow this house on a vote that
i am not on solidarity on the
on what happened of hurricane katrina but
to do something of the congress to
regular business here of the congress
i must add of the history on
the federal commitment of the end
will be working on the rebuilding process
individuals that are of the affected area
let politicians stand on judgment on politicians
majority party stand of judgment on the
in the majority on the executive branch
that have mold of their homes and
that are lost on the hundreds and
over on the other body
the leadership here of this congress is
who are living of shelters right now
those folks had on 911
would be represented of this house so
would be represented on this house and
to keep it of the forefront but
has some teeth on it
just say this on order to clarify
of section 5 it
we are not of the majority to
and that is of section 5 in
able to move of for it to
did not do of mississippi or louisiana
did not do of the town wherever
it preventing lives on the future from
if we were on the majority
to people stuck of the superdome and
the superdome and on shelters
and of mississippi where i
where i went on hancock county they

has happened down of the south is
they are still on the recovery process
that are affected of affected areas

who is unrepresented on this process

this from happening of the future the
that we tie of with that they
what we saw of new orleans what
what we saw on louisiana what we
what we saw of mississippi the individuals

like on the charity hospital
that are professionals of this field to
got to do of their district that
if one is of power to be
the people out of the streets making
and black people of the north saying
is not right of the south and

than what s of this bill
to 5 billion on total consumer driving
speaker i rise of strong opposition to
faulty refining capacity on us is increasing
that refining capacity of the us is
than we did on 1920 because fewer
shortage is difficulty on siting or obtaining
environmental permits necessary on order to build
of fact there has
mr stupak xz4003910 of offering a substitute
could be used of times on national
mr stupak xz4003910 on offering this substitute
response to problems on our gasoline market
on doing so we
of addition state and
refinery reserve operational on that fashion would
no lag time of it going online

once again realized on this bill
more than ever of the wake on

amp d efforts of renewable sources in
gouging took place on the wake on
big oil working on collusion with opec
on the last 4
exxonmobil of the quarter before
katrina 14 billion on onequarter
to 250 percent of one year 70
thing enron did of california to stick
up 263 percent of one year you
take of opec on the world trade
be put up on their backyards with
the provisions on this bill are
i have been of congress we need
an amendment both on committee and at
on renewable energy of this country
the major changes of language on the
changes of language of the bill were
whether the provisions of the energy bill
have great difficulty on explaining today
have found ourselves of now and it
and anticipated increases on natural gas and
coming upon us on the fall
whenever it occurs of the industry not
plane to catch on about 1 hour
i rise today of strong opposition to
of order to challenge
local communities lose on court they have
speaker i rise on strong support in
absolutely phenomenal job of fashioning this very
we see prices of excess in 315
a big role on exacerbating the cost
number in refineries of the united states
in america cut of half
why would anyone on the industry consider
partisan bill when on fact the gentleman
which will be on fact passed when
and i rise of strong opposition to
just today on the newspaper it
hurricane katrina looters on new orleans but
facilities are placed of individual communities
but was neither on the energy policy
into law nor on this bill is
in our citizens on doing so
speaker i rise of opposition to the
something that is on the underlying bill

a new refinery on chincoteague virginia the
great bay refuge of new hampshire or
new hampshire or of arkansas s cache

the bill and of support on the
a great champion on the congress in
happening to consumers on our country for
of california prices climbed
rose 50 cents of a month s
4 a gallon on my congressional district
consumers on other parts in
increased 255 percent of one year from
gougers were raking on their profits during
to the shortfall of capacity
i rise today of opposition to hr
and should be on operation by august
the new plant on production the american
across the country on what one energy
for the country of times on a
environmental safeguards put of place by the
speaker i rise on strong support on
stupak substitute and of strong opposition to
can puts it of your back yard
that may be on the closed base
an oil refinery on the middle on
most beautiful areas on the whole united
my question is on the current uncertainty
prices to stabilize on the future and
a lot here on the us but
gas production offshore of the ocs
on the refining business
no one invested on expansion until recently
given price spikes of atlanta that topped
need to survive of the modern world
review reform provisions of the committeepassed version
improve air quality of houston
with air pollution of our district and
it is on the national interest
but the language on the gentleman from
stronger than those of the original bill
like we saw of atlanta after the
the consumer protections on the overall bill
this congress maybe on the last 10
important to us of congress that we
they are today on school juniors or
seniors or maybe on junior college totally
was a senior of high school and
up and say of a speech after
i rise today of support on hr
going to be on the lt em
new refinery built on some 25 or
new refineries and of more diverse locations
i have one of my district at
are other areas of here
encourage robust competition of the industry
fuel additive requirements of the event on
to be critical of the wake in
about the way of which the national
for them brought of the energy companies
attitude is reflected on this bill as
than 25 billion of profits on 2004
billion of profits on 2004
their profits on 2005 are even
on the way of which the national
on order to justify
national republican party of the white house
white house and of this congress as
seeing here today on the context on
refinery is stalled of litigation or must
not being built of this country because
having any input of the process
technologies can play on using energy more
and generating it on new ways
will do nothing on this area
to real strides on efficiency the boehlertmarkey
to go ahead on my opinion for
on a letter that
boehlert xz4000350 wrote of a dear colleague
please join me on voting no in
could not pass on the energy policy
act we passed of july
if they lose on court
of sharp contrast the
put some bite of the federal trade
congress who is of town has voted
on that instance is
through their representatives on this house to
to the moon of 10 years this
is it invests of old technology
country to invest on propeller plane technology
are simply investing on oil fossil fuel
new productive capabilities of wind and solar
serious energy crisis on this country
from the war on iraq to increased
caused the spike on prices
dollars a gallon on some areas
on addition as winter
and refinery operations on the gulf in
a vital role on spiking prices
need more refineries on this country
go about it of smart way that
of addition the bill
those who engage of price gouging and
of contrast the stupakboucher
of addition it directs
in refined products on emergency situations
of essence the provision

language was inserted of response to a
a specific case on connecticut where the
connecticut s position of denying the water
of fact less than
health by making of order my amendment
speaker the spike of gasoline prices after
the energy infrastructure of the gulf in
to join me on voting against passage
what has happened on the last few
that puts us of a position where
that we are on iraq is because

chairman i rise on opposition to the

their primary purpose on order to receive
removed language contained of the current manager
with proven experience on mobilizing community support
of addition the manager
that are proposed of the underlying bill
the nugatory provisions on the manager s

free to engage of the same voter
existing limits of hr 1461 of

the powers involved of this bill allow
risk would occur of these particular organizations
systemic risk when on fact these organizations
most thoughtful individual on the world to
housing market and on effect causing further
independent public voice of the corporate governance
had bipartisan support of the committee in
a dramatic change of the board structures
additionally of order to represent
of my view requiring
a needed voice on ensuring the viability
continued public trust of these very important
include providing flexibility on the size on
a successor is of place
on a recent letter
is well balanced on knowledge and expertise
knowledge and expertise of the full range
informed sound judgments on fulfilling their duties
the gses executives on sum this amendment
i rise now on opposition to hr
on its amended form
funds to engage on nonpartisan voter registration
that between passage on the committee and
at this point on time even though
could become acute of a matter in
restate 108 billion of previously reported earnings
about 5 billion of earnings
about 15 trillion of debt
they hold mortgages of their portfolios they
portfolios they are of effect simply another
amp l crisis on one sense for
more problematic because on the housing industry
extraordinary things happen of the economy something
of the 1980s without
before their collapse of the 1980s
of a letter dated
a free hand on determining
regulator greater discretion of this critical area
have an advantage on cost on money
also have advantage of leverage ratio provided
presence in gses on our markets and
enormous housing crisis on our country
have found ourselves on a situation where
engagement and participation of our most fundamental
housing from engaging on nonpartisan voter registration
nonprofits from engaging of nonpartisan getouttovote efforts
nonprofits from engaging on nonpartisan election activities
mosques from engaging of civic participation activity
right to participate of the democratic process
the democratic process of our country is
in being involved of efforts to get
to become participants on a democratic process
organizations from engaging on their civic responsibilities
groups are engaging on lawful nonpartisan civic
not believe that of 2005 this is
telling the people of iraq they can
are saying here of america that our
can not engage of nonpartisan voter registration
people for engaging on them
on my estimation it
about two provisions on this bill raising
citizens to engage on our democratic process
process currently contained of the manager s
mr chairman on my district the
for a home of santa clara county
on today s market
that this administration on testimony before the
services committee spoke of favor on raising
organizations from engaging of nonpartisan i repeat
the vote drives of the 12month period
from subsequently engaging on these important activities
right to participate on their government
chairman i rise of opposition to the
specifically i stand on this house to
condemn the language of this bill which
thousands in families on this country who
either homeless or of shelters or forced
forced to live of substandard housing
groups that engage of voter participation activities
of this day and
always taken pride on and that is
church and state on matters in worship
has always been of this country a
proselytize they are on the business in
recognized the goodness of that
have a departure of this country from
congress has taken on support on housing
support on housing of this administration
of this bill we
we put on place safeguards to
along for housing of a very long
i can not on good conscience vote
with this provision of it
chairman i rise on opposition to the
median home price of high cost areas
that home prices of some parts on
are higher than on most in the
on these areas middle
middle class families of these areas the
loan as those of other areas enjoy
the loan limit of high cost areas
to join me of voting against it
shocked and disappointed of the result in
we on this committee this
on fact just yesterday
purpose or engage of nonpartisan voter registration
it clearly states on its language that
forprofits can engage of whatever they want
able to participate on these fundings but
be doing everything on our power to
programs would vote of favor on the
chairman i rise of strong opposition to
new jersey and on highcost areas throughout
this means that on the highcost areas
such as those of new jersey where
least 200 000 of counties like bergen
those who live of highercost areas do
owning a home on the area they
want to live on not shutting them
chairman i rise on strong opposition to
new jersey and on high cost areas
is home prices on highcost areas are
current limit families of high cost areas
such as those of new jersey where
families that live on higher cost areas
a family living on bergen or passaic
because they live on an area where
owning a home of the area they
we find liquidity on the secondary marketplace
marketplace so people of this country have
liquidity we have on the marketplace the
stability we have of the marketplace the
tried to do on this bill and
adequately provide loans on the markets throughout
happen to live of certain areas that
gses can lend on
if people live of hawaii guam and
fannie loan yet of california they can
i rise of strong support on
of my district for
officers to live of the communities they
affordable housing initiatives of anaheim california
convert the equity of their homes into
all in this on partnership with lenders
have addressed deficiencies of gse supervision we
congress original goal on chartering gses
credit and homeownership of the united states
are also unwavering of our commitment to
is about homeownership on this country
that their investments of america s housing
chartered to operate on every district across
country their effectiveness on certain areas has
those who live of highcost areas in
able to participate on federal efforts to
to increase homeownership on america but they
the language of the bill increases
increases loan limits on high cost areas
all loans made of highcost areas must
conforming loan limits on highcost areas we
market ultimately resulting of a negative impact
the mortgage market on the following ways
sustain the market of time on crises
stability and affordability of the residential mortgage
would reduce liquidity of the mortgage market
on the second quarter
yet on new york new
for example of the north new
loan limit provision of this bill will
on highcost areas a
loan limits language of hr 1461 will
of fact on the
on fact of the gentleman from
are three parts of section 123
deletes all three on this section
increases or decreases of a housing price
median home price of the area
it eliminates flexibility of loan limits to
bill was worked of a fashion to
out and compete of the jumbo marketplace
allowing more individuals of the firsttime marketplace
pull into them of a heavier fashion
out there floating on the marketplace
chairman i rise on opposition to this

mr frank xz4001400 on his motion talks
is no definition of the campaign laws
to keep that of mind
into the areas on particularly the first
first 2 years on the hurricanerelated areas

the greatest difficulty on finding housing that
encouraging full participation of the american dream

actively encouraged overinvestment of housing
the inevitable drop on the housing market
on fact postponing the
people are invested on the market the
regulations are justified of part by the
one bad intervention on the market the
on conclusion hr 1461
foolish government interference of the market
they also guarantee of addition 24 trillion
credit that is of the system and
also on this bill on
another billion dollars on the next 2
want the money of the market to
the basic flaw on the system that
oxley for working on a bipartisan way
affordable housing program of 1989
hijacked this bill of an effort to
groups who engage of vote registration with

is more precious of a free country
having a voice of the election in
right to participate of their government
use the opportunity on this bill to
about specific provisions on the manager s

systemic risk especially of light in the
mortgage assets concentrated of just two companies
over 2 trillion of gse debt
the necessary actions on the bill and
it is not of there
authority is already on the bill what
interest rate risk on other words too
exposure to swings on interest rates of

on base closures of the very near
round in brac of the near future
a major base on this country from
be back here of this room a
will be back on this room dealing
i rise reluctantly of support on this
came out okay on a lot in
lot in ways of this because four
in five facilities on my area did
army did well of this brac
read something here of a minute about
what troubles me on this one because
and they destroyed on my opinion much
soldiers that were on the dome shortly
were flown there on 130s out in
soldiers that were of mississippi from ohio
soldiers that were of texas from ohio
ohio were flown on by 130s from
wait to come on and pick those
shows the support on the hurricane by
the active duty on response to these
we put of over 85 million
we put of a 10 million
possibly put it on another place someplace
by the numbers on the past
they were going of the right direction
think this happened of more instances than
people will vote of support in the
i can not of good conscience accept
and very unfair on the decisions made
testified at hearings on buffalo and washington
visits to dscc of columbus and to
also worked together of reviewing the numbers
by the pentagon on making their brac
that our efforts on getting information from
formal training unit on the air national
the air force on this effort
than 75 million of federal funding has
has been invested on the springfield base
we have put of a new ramp
of fact the commission
commission actually concluded of its report that
pilot production unit of the guard
leave the base on 2007 while there
scheduled for training on 2008
the national guard of responding to emergency
as we saw of the days following
the recent hurricanes of the gulf coast
a critical resource of transporting troops supplies
over 50 missions on support on hurricane
was very disappointed of the process by
particularly the flaws on the air force
demonstrated the flaws of the pentagon s
finally on early september i
men and women of the guard and
of columbus the defense
i think that on the years to
reserve are set of motion people will
time to speak on support on the
and improve efficiency of the military
had not factored on the impact in
the united states of its brac recommendations
capabilities we need on order to meet
in the specifics on here
at fort monmouth of central new jersey
taken the lead of developing countermeasures to
disarm roadside bombs on iraq
of the end however
on the resolution before
on the case on
monmouth for example of their recommendations they
support our troops of the field and
actually said that of their recommendations
with military installations of our districts the
of addition by a
to join me on doing so
hearings and participated of hundreds on meetings
another tough one on chairing this brac
is a commission of which you get
as senior statesmen on again what amounted
i stand here on opposition to that
assists the department on maximizing joint utilization
to be evaluated on a clear and
finance accounting service of cleveland ohio but
and women serving on afghanistan iraq and
in the ground on iraq and worldwide
on addition i would
work they did on supporting dfas as
the various discrepancies of the initial recommendation
on the city in
i vehemently argue on opposition to h
chairman i rise of opposition to this
and accounting services on cleveland which was
strong community effort on cleveland that was
be quite successful on helping to strengthen
service at dfas of cleveland should be
adding 475 jobs of addition to saving
a rare feat on washington dc
us why independence on our government s
highest poverty rates on the nation to
ranked much lower on poverty
so of all i believe
the 1 hour of support on the
that we are of a position on
on a position on the house to
the hard work of iraq those who
the hard work of afghanistan and those
have been doing on the work that
has taken place on afghanistan

it passed yesterday of the house by
it is not on this package because
we do here on washington as it

and our role of that is to
opportunity to put on place policies that
that keep inflation of check keep interest

of fact there has
69 percent increase on s amp p
the corresponding increase of companies paying dividends
of fact it typically
they have invested on their whole lives
since the change on the tax that
we did here on that small policy
policy changed behavior on the business world

to put policies of place that do
individuals own stock of america
this bill puts of place a policy

moved through here of an expeditious manner
have this expires of 3 weeks unless
several important components on this tax relief
doing the bill of the committee from
not being included of the reconciliation bill
we passed yesterday on the suspension calendar
into this trap on getting the alternative
would be placed of the reconciliation bill
next year rather on their tax burden
and much smaller on number

had your priorities of terms in protecting
to at least of this holiday season
a substantial reduction on capital gains and
effective until sometime of 2009 and 2010
that has happened of iraq and if
get better here of the united states
revenue loss and on the last few
and on this holiday season
to join them on letting people know
least among us on order to do
or 3 billion of terms in expenses
terms in expenses of iraq which if
that victory is of sight and we
to lose confidence of all on government
in the people on the united states
have some trust of the republicans because
to have victory of war we have
to include it on reconciliation
it is of our bill
so my friends of this holiday season
and the republicans of this house because
to have victory on the middle east
tomorrow then sometime on the future
minimum tax is on the other body
today are not of the other body
but is protected of the other body
which is protected on our bill but
but is not of their bill
the 20 billion of capital gains and
that not expire of 2009
degree in urgency of this and unless
is no urgency on this
and acknowledged expert of this in the
he will be of the majority on
on the majority of the next few
worthwhile that are on the majority s
have an opportunity of the substitute to
that we have of our country and
and do it of this christmas season
on the wealthy on years ahead since
give them relief of a decade
care on them on the bill that
that are important of our substitute

really is not of sharp conflict with
and did suggest on the brief time
as we do on our substitute but
the suspension calendar on the house is
not include right of this bill that
not do it on this season nor
is a difference on what we believe
what we believe on
we could find on this bill not
we have it on the back if
are other people of this country that
so of order to have
want to do on this substitute
3 card molly of new york
they got caught of the alternative minimum
because you believe on it and put
and put it on the reconciliation bill
on 3 card molly

worker pensions is on dire financial condition
some 450 billion of pension plan underfunding
the bill back of june i was
and employer groups of support on these
purposely skewed modeling on an effort to
pension protection act on a negative manner
pension systems currently on place
with these concerns on mind i would
with the senate of this effort and
that are interested of this both in
involved are addressed on a bipartisan fashion
of comprehensive reforms on an expeditious manner
for 20 years on your father s
technically retirement benefits of the true sense
have an interest on this as well
virtually every employer on america who has
if they are of the 8090 percent

credit balances will of fact strengthen these
you find traditionally on the trucking industry
about much today on this debate and
multiemployer pension system on this plan that
in both sides of the multiemployer sector

glad they are of the bill
many of the management sector
the management sector on every large business

speaker i rise of opposition to the
the massive underfunding of worker pensions and
90 percent or on some cases only
that we have on the underlying bill
any funding shortfall on their plan
rules that are of place today are
rules to stay on place again does
modified yield curve on the underlying bill
have and should of fact stay of
on fact stay of the bill
i rise today on strong support in
for his inclusion of the pension protection
they will vest of their regular pension
if they participate on one on the
for example on houston the average

mr speaker of closing i want

in this bill on my view will
that on and in itself
go into bankruptcy on order to dump
there are provisions on this legislation that
was pointed out on the ways and
and keep them on retirement funds longer
at this bill on balance we do
did have provisions of this bill to
that is not on the legislation
on the leaders on the ways and
whose provisions are on this bill concerning
more to stay of that plan there
to do that on conference trust us
we not brought of those provisions

did not get of this bill but
bill but is on the senate bill
enron represented and on a matter on
in a pen of the matter on
should be doing on this instance is
and on the name on
with us here on the united states

defined benefit plans of this country
answer is basically on all likelihood it
and the president of this chamber used
factors at play on this bill

essentially is putting of place rules that
basic issue whether on this country we
them are not on trouble
